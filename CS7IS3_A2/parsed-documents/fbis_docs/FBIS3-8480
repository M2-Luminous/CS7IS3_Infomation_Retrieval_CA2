Its load mainly of flour was for the 350,000 people of Sarajevo still besieged by Bosnian Serb forces, although a ceasefire has been in force for the past month. General Andre Soubirou, commander of the French contingent of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in Sarajevo, said the airlift had enabled every Sarajevan to receive 500 grams (nearly one pound) of food per day. At present 5,000 tons of food are being brought in every day, 80 percent of it by air on British, Canadian, French and U.S. transports flying from Split and Zagreb in Croatia, or from Frankfurt in Germany. At the same time, 500 badly-wounded victims of Serb mortar, shell or sniper fire have been evacuated for treatment abroad since the air lift officially began on July 3, 1992. The airport straddles the front lines of the conflict, with each end of the runway in the hands of the mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army and the sides controlled by the Serbs. In the middle are the UNPROFOR troops, presently numbering 1,300 mainly French soldiers. More than 100 UN soldiers have been wounded while guarding the airport, which until the ceasefire was regularly closed because of shelling or because aircraft were hit by small-arms fire. Hundreds of people, both civilians and troops of the warring sides, have also tried to cross the opposing lines by way of the airport. UNPROFOR has orders to send them back each time they are caught, in line with an agreement declaring the facility neutral.
