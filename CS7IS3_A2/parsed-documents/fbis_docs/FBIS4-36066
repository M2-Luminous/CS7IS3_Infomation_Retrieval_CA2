In press statements made here today, he said the lack of progress in the peace process is being blamed on Israel, which does not want to withdraw from the Arab territories it occupied in 1967. He said that the Arab parties are committed to the peace process and the UN Security Council resolutions. Answering a question on the effect of the Israeli stance on achieving progress on the Syrian track, he said that although Israel does not want peace, the United States will not abandon the peace process. He said the Lebanese have the right to defend themselves against the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon to implement international legitimacy and Security Council resolutions. On the Syrian presence in Lebanon, he said this presence is aimed at helping the Lebanese people in reconstruction efforts. Commenting on the situation in Yemen, the Syrian foreign minister said his country is currently holding intense contacts to stop the ongoing fighting in Yemen and preserve Yemen's unity.
