They said that the shells were fired from a position opposite the palace somewhere in the Abu-Nuwwas Street, which runs parallel to the Tigris in the eastern Karradah quarter on the al-Rasafah side. Three shells fell on the palace and the fourth fell in the river. Unified Iraqi National Congress [UINC] sources have told AL-HAYAH that "some members of the Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) and some Army officers have taken refuge in Irbil," which is under Kurdistan Front control. A statement issued by the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI] said that "the special security organ in Baghdad arrested Staff Major General 'Abd-al-Malik al-Juburi on a charge of covering up embezzlement at the al-Radwaniyah military industries plant." SAIRI sources said that al-Juburi, who was commander of the 10th Armored Division during the war with Iran, "was recently released after being sentenced to seven years in prison on suspicion of complicity in the coup attempt plotted by a number of officers from the al-Jubur tribe after the Gulf war." Meanwhile Kurdish administration sources have told AL-HAYAH that Iran has amassed large forces from the 5th and 11th Corps of the Revolutionary Guard supported by tanks and artillery on the borders with Iraq, in the area opposite Banjwin to the east of al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate. They added that the Iraqi Kurdish villages of Nukan, Tuqla, Kurah Shir, and Bidlan [last four names as transliterated] were shelled again. Most inhabitants of these villages have had to leave before as a result of previous Iranian aggression. On 24 April an Iranian force entered the village of Kani Khan in the Banjwin area after shelling it. The same sources described the situation on the Iraqi-Iranian border as tense.
