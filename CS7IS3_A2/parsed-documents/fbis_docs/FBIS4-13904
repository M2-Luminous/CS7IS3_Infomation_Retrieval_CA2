He added that agreement would depend on whether the Israeli side intends to finalize the remaining issues this week. Speaking to reporters today before the start of the Palestinian-Israeli round of talks, Sha'th noted that a date for signing the documents on implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement cannot be set before we find out what the Israeli delegation is bringing with it and whether or not it is really ready to finalize the outstanding issues. Sha'th pointed out that among the issues still under discussion by the Palestinian and Israeli sides are security-related issues such as the legal jurisdiction over Gaza and Jericho, and he noted that the two sides had previously reached a verbal agreement on this matter. He added: We are waiting to see the draft the Israeli delegation is bringing regarding this issue. Sha'th pointed out that there are some paragraphs in the "general agreement" that need to be revised, and the same applies to the question of the release of the Palestinian detainees from Israeli prisons. Sha'th noted that should the Palestinian and Israeli sides reach an agreement during this week's talks, the date for signing the agreement on implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement will be announced next week. He stressed that all this is contingent on the intentions of the Israeli side. He referred in this regard to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's remarks in which he said that the agreement would be signed on 15 May. Sha'th added that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Cairo at the end of this week. He noted that 'Arafat's meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is not confirmed. Sha'th stressed that no one can pressure the Palestinian side into giving up its rights, even if this means another year of negotiations. He added: If the Israeli side is ready to sign an agreement next week, the Palestinians are ready too. He added: The Israelis must not believe that we are prepared to abandon our rights to meet a specific deadline. On the recent agreement between Fatah and Hamas, Sha'th said it will open the door for national unity so that a Palestinian national authority can be established on Palestinian territory and an inter-Palestinian peace can be achieved. Concerning the number of Palestinian detainees to be released by Israel, Sha'th said that this will be discussed with the Israeli delegation in today's meetings.
