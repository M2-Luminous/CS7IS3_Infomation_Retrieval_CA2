The talks were chaired by Russian President's special envoy on the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, Vladimir Kazimirov. Deputy Chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group, Mathias Mosberg, and the leaders of the CSCE monitoring mission, General Burg and Berkman also participated at the meeting. The expert of Azeri delegation, Tofik Zulfugarov, told TURAN that the mediator presented its draft of the agreement to both parties. The draft stipulates for cease-fire and liberation of territories occupied by Armenia. "It was difficult to find agreements with Armenia since it does not wish to liberate Kelbadzharskiy and Lachinskiy regions of Azerbaijan. The experts discussed the draft of the agreement proposed by Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The draft must be reviewed by the mediator taking into account several amendments and then will be presented to Azerbaijan's and Armenia's top powers as well as to the leaders of Azerbaijan's and Armenia's communities of Karabakh", said Zulfugarov. Armenian experts insisted on liberation of a part of Azerbaijan's occupied territories with exception of Lachinskiy and Kelbadzharskiy regions. Those two regions will be liberated if Nagorno-Karabakh exists as a sovereign republic. Azeri party offered the opposite, that is liberation of all territories occupied by Armenian troops and then Azerbaijan's and Armenia's communities will decide the matter concerning the status of Nagorno-Karabakh themselves. However, territorial integrity of Azerbaijan must be maintained. Last week [as received] Kazimirov's and Mosberg's missions will arrive in Azerbaijan, reports Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
