Attending the meeting were some 100 people from religious departments in provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and responsible comrades from relevant CPC Central Committee and state organs. State Councillor Ismail Amat spoke at the meeting. He said: Correct handling of religious affairs and doing a good job are an important part of building the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which has an important significance in maintaining social stability; enhancing national unity; and promoting reform and opening up. Reform and opening up bring great changes to society and to the people's spiritual outlook, and provide a favorable social environment for doing a good job in religious affairs. At present, religious affairs work faces many new situations and problems. To do a good job under the new situation, it is necessary to seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to resolutely implement guidelines set forth at the 14th CPC National Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to incorporate the party's basic line into the real practice of religious affairs work; and to handle various day-to-day religious affairs work in strict accordance with the state's relevant laws, regulations, and policies. At the same time, it is necessary to attach great importance to unity in religious affairs work. We must forge unity between the masses of believers and nonbelievers, between the masses of different religions, and among those who believe in the same religion; we must be united, be of one heart and one mind, strive for common progress, and for building a modern socialist state. Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of the United Front Work Department under the CPC Central Committee, and deputy secretary general of the State Council Xi Dehua attended today's plenary session. Zhang Shengzuo, director of the State Council's Bureau of Religious Affairs, delivered a work report; deputy director Chi Nai presided over the meeting.
