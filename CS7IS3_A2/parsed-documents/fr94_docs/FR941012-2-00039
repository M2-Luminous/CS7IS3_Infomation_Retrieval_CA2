FR941012-2-00039 FR941012-2-00024 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;80&hyph;006] National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation; Tariff Filing October 5, 1994. Take notice that on September 30, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, Third Revised Sheet Nos. 2, 3, 205, 236 and 237; First Revised Fourth Revised Sheet No. 6; and Second Revised Sheet No. 205A. National states that these tariff sheets are submitted to (1) update the table of contents in National's tariff to reflect the addition of the P&hyph;2 and IR&hyph;2 Rate Schedules, (2) revise Sheet No. 6 to remove a reference to the GSS Rate Schedule which was terminated in the merger of National and Penn-York Energy Corporation, and (3) to include the necessary references to the IR&hyph;2 and P&hyph;2 Rate Schedules on Sheet Nos. 205, 205A, 236, and 237, which were inadvertently overlooked in National's July 25, 1994 compliance filing in this proceeding. National states that a copy of this filing was posted pursuant to ยง154.16 of the Commission's Regulations. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before October 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
