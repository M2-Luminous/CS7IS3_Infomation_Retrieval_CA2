FBIS4-29374 "dreas117_a_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-117 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan `Sources': Sanctions Unlikely To Affect Japan `Sources': Sanctions Unlikely To Affect Japan OW1606122094 Tokyo KYODO in English 1215 GMT 16 Jun 94 OW1606122094 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The first phase of sanctions proposed by the United States against North Korea over its nuclear recalcitrance is unlikely to have much effect on Japan, well-placed sources predicted Thursday [16 June]. Japan has indicated that it supports in principle Washington's draft resolution to be submitted to the UN Security Council in response to North Korea's refusal to permit inspections of its nuclear facilities. The sources pointed out, however, that the first phase of sanctions, including bans on arms trade and development assistance, would have only a minimal effect on Japan. The first phase of proposed sanctions, still subject to change, includes a ban on nonpassenger flights into North Korea, an embargo on technical and scientific cooperation, and participation in sports events, cultural, scientific, educational and diplomatic exchanges. Local governments bordering on the Sea of Japan which currently have exchanges with North Korea may be asked to exercise restraint in their relations if sanctions are adopted, the sources said. With the absence of diplomatic relations between Tokyo and Pyongyang, bilateral cultural exchanges have been limited to 100 or so North Koreans coming to Japan annually. A Justice Ministry survey reveals that some 16,000 North Koreans entered Japan in 1992, but 90 percent of these North Korean nationals were residents of Japan returning from a trip overseas. Only 756 of the North Koreans coming to Japan entered the country as business-related people or tourists with 51 entering the country on cultural or sports exchanges. The second phase of sanctions would more closely affect Japan since it would be asked to close down the flow of billions of yen in hard currency in support that Korean residents of Japan send to their relatives in North Korea. North Korea has warned that any sanctions imposed by the United Nations would be considered a declaration of war and has said Japan would not be able to evade its "deserved punishment."
