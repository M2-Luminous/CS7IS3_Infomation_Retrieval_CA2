[Begin recording] [Correspondent] Mr Prime Minister, which issues did you discuss today? [Silajdzic] We discussed political issues, electricity and gas supplies and prisoner exchanges. [Correspondent] What did you agree to? [Silajdzic] Let us begin with easier issues. Concerning electricity supply, we agreed to repair the power line between Sarajevo and Buca Potok. Repair teams have tried to go out to do the repairs four times, but the Serb side did not allow them to do anything. However, it was said this time that they would allow it. We will see. It is important for both sides to respect their mutual interests [words indistinct]. Concerning the exchange of prisoners, the big problem is that we are not sure that the number of prisoners registered by the Red Cross is correct. We think that there are prisoners [words indistinct] Therefore, I think that a partial exchange of prisoners is possible, which means that we will exchange as many prisoners as possible, but that an exchange according to the all-for-all principle -- according to Red Cross lists -- is not possible for the time being because we think that this would not be an all-for-all exchange. We believe that the Red Cross has not registered all prisoners. The gas supplies were interrupted yesterday. I hope that we solved that problem too, and that this will not happen in the future. Concerning political issues, I must say that we met after a long time, but there are no results, no changes. Our positions have remained unchanged. We will meet in Geneva soon. I cannot say whether any progress will be made there. Both sides want peace, at least judging by statements. However, we do not want the peace which is being offered to us, which is unacceptable. I do not know whether any progress in that respect will be made. I also must say that our side stressed the problem of bombing the city [Sarajevo], and the actions taken despite promises that they would not be taken in other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, I must say that the other side voiced the same complaints concerning the territories under occupation. [passage indistinct] [end recording]
