This was a result of joint strenuous work of experts for a year because border issues demanded urgent settlement. The adoption of a such a document for the first time is an evidence of strengthening of mutual respect, sovereignty of each of the member states and the development of friendly relations between them, as well as the positive changes in international relations as a whole. The conclusion of this agreement means for us that Mongolia has reached a full agreement on state border issues and thus laid the foundation of its stability, Zhalbuugiin Choinkhor, Mongolian minister of foreign relations, told ITAR-TASS. Russia and China with respect to Mongolia demonstrated respect for such important international principles as inviolability of its state borders, its independence and territorial integrity. The historical importance of the present agreement lies just in all this, the Mongolian minister of foreign relations stressed.
