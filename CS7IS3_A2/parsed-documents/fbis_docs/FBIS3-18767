However, the Twelve are not considering a resort to a new trade tool of their own for now. In addition, the Twelve still openly disagree on the message they should tell the world on the occasion of the new world trade organization's inauguration. In a common statement, the Twelve's foreign affairs ministers express their concern about the implementation of U.S. trade law Super 301. The EU Council condemns the use of such unilateral actions in international trade conflicts. The Twelve ask that all trade partners act according to the agreements reached within the framework of the multilateral GATT negotiations. The European Commission must thoroughly investigate whether the U.S. trade sanctions, which are directed against Japan, are a violation of the GATT agreeements. However, the Twelve are not sharpening their knives right away. So far, the possible creation of a new European trade tool intended to protect the EU against unfair trade practices has been ruled out altogether. The Twelve agreed on this last December, when they ratified the GATT agreement. On behalf of the Twelve, EU Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan outlined the provisional state of affairs regarding the commitments for market access. The latter revealed that the EU would scale down its original offer regarding trucks and nonferrous metals. The EU Commission is negotiating with the United States for an improved and more equitable offer. [passage omitted]
