Nevertheless, it is in trouble. [Czerwinski] Let us begin by considering that, in the 1980's, the concept "arms industry" extended to some 90 manufacturing plants, both final producers and supplier plants. These plants were geared to serving our military and the armies of the Warsaw Pact, and, in addition, we exported part of the output outside the Warsaw Pact. The changes in our region, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, and the abandonment of the policy of confrontation and of materiel stockpiling led to a situation in which such a considerable potential of the arms industry has turned out to be unnecessary. Most of its manufacturing plants had to retool to other production. At present, our arms industry consists of 31 plants, chiefly final producers. It is a modern industry, and its products do not deviate from international standards; its output can supply about 70 percent of weaponry and equipment for the military. [Kozakiewicz] What kinds of weaponry can it manufacture? [Czerwinski] To put it differently, except for medium- and long-range antiaircraft missiles, supersonic aircraft, and large deep-sea vessels displacing more than 2,000 tons, we can make the entire weaponry and equipment needed by the military. [Kozakiewicz] That is an impressive capability, but what is the industry's financial situation? [Czerwinski] Its basic problems are its huge debt and the absence of alternative civilian production. In peacetime, arms plants cannot--because it is unnecessary--exploit their entire arms-manufacturing capacity, even if they are able to export part of their output. Thus, in order to keep operating, they have to make goods for the civilian market. Well, civilian production is not the problem; the real problem is its expansion to an extent sufficient to offset the deficit due to the mothballing or only partial utilization of defense production lines--hence the need to restructure the plants. Our experience, as well as the experience of other countries, indicates that, if output for the military is not more than 30 percent of capacity, a plant can still perform in the black if the remaining 70 percent is sold. I mentioned the arms industry's debt; last year it amounted to 16 trillion zlotys [Z]. At present, this burden is much lighter. Debt-reduction agreements account for about Z7.7 trillion and other forms of debt conversion for Z3 billion. The remaining obligations were rescheduled and will be repaid partially in cash and partially in the form of shares in civilian production. Government loan guarantees--I emphasize, loan guarantees and not subsidies--have been provided, totaling Z25 trillion for industry as a whole. The arms industry and its particular plant can, if they have tangible prospects, count on loans totaling Z1 trillion and perhaps even more. About Z1 trillion has been allocated for funding inactive production capacities. Altogether, this is, relatively speaking, a substantial amount. Arms plants have caught their breath and can exploit new opportunities. [Kozakiewicz] You mean opportunities for developing products attractive to the civilian market? [Czerwinski] Not only that. Our analyses demonstrate that the Polish arms industry can meet the needs of the military 70 percent. The world is not standing still; hence, we too must think in long-range terms, about new types of weaponry and equipment, the modernization of current equipment, and the utilization of electronics and other achievements of science and technology. The Ministry of National Defense and our industry are doing a great deal of work on the modernization of weaponry. We have also established interesting contacts with foreign companies--Swedish, French, American ones. Joint undertakings are being planned. An example of a modern Polish project may be the Grom missile. An example--of course, not the only one--of extremely promising cooperation with foreign companies may be the joint project of the Gdansk Unimor and the Swedish Ericsson for developing tactical communications based on digital processing and the encodement of information. [Kozakiewicz] Some foreign newspapers have been advising us to introduce a far-reaching conversion of our arms industry. It may be that the motive is to get rid of competition, is not that so? [Czerwinski] It is hardly conceivable for a country of Poland's size to have no arms industry of its own. I believe that this idea is not even worth considering. Our arms industry remains in our Polish hands, and we shall continue to improve our technologies, but we shall also be wide open to foreign cooperation. The arms market is uncertain, but, perhaps, owing to such cooperation, broader export opportunities will be afforded. At any rate, I do not believe our exports are to diminish. [Kozakiewicz] What other factors will influence the process of reforming the arms industry and adapting it to the market economy? [Czerwinski] This process still continues and, for the enterprises to perform truly efficiently, it must continue further. The next step will be to commercialize the plants by transforming them into Treasury companies; this precisely means the adaptation of enterprises to the requirements of the market economy and adherence to the commercial laws and cost-effective accounting on the microscale. Arms enterprises will not be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Ownership Transformations because their sale, partially or in their entirety, is not envisaged. But this does not preclude structural and ownership transformations in those enterprises that produce for the civilian market. We shall support the concept of employee stock ownership, and this should favorably affect the ties between the work forces and the enterprises. Groups of companies will be organized under the arms enterprises, with the object of spurring their civilian production. The debt of these enterprises could be converted to shares in their civilian departments. All of these changes are intended not only to spur economic revival but also to counteract unemployment, which has strongly affected arms enterprises. At the same time, I wish to emphasize that these changes will not extend to the enterprise departments geared to defense production. For the arms industry, privatization is not a means in itself but a means of promoting and accelerating economic growth. This policy on privatization will continue to be pursued. At the same time, considering the special nature of the arms industry, we shall also guide ourselves by the principle that the State Treasury is to own at least 51 percent of stock--that is, a majority share--in every arms enterprise, and the stock will be the registered rather than the bearer kind. Given adherence to this principle, practically all forms of structural-ownership transformations can still be applied. [Kozakiewicz] The arms industry at one time found itself in an extremely difficult situation that was traumatic to its work force. What has changed in that respect? [Czerwinski] We should bear in mind that at those 90 plants that worked for the arms industry in the 1980's, the share of civilian production was small, so that when the demand for military production slumped, it entailed collapse, mass layoffs, unemployment. That is why we attach such great importance to restructuring these plants, to converting to civilian production. Here I wish to emphasize the great role of the Committee for Scientific Research, whose projects are making it possible to surmount the related difficulties. The arms plants had tried to save themselves by exporting to the East. This caused them to contract considerable debts owing to the difficult situation of their Eastern partners. By now, the plants have regained one-half of the value of those exports, while the other half does not appear to be irretrievably lost. I have already mentioned negotiations intended to reduce our multitrillion debt. Definite symptoms of a stabilization of the job market are arising. Such plants as the Rzeszow WSK [Transportation Equipment Plant] and Wroclaw Hydral, which slashed their employment in the years 1991-92, are now increasing it; the employees laid off in those years are returning to their work stations. For next year, we envisage no employee discharges other than those owing to old-age retirement. The establishment of civilian companies under the arms plants will also favorably affect the job market and reduce unemployment. All of this warrants speaking of a gradual improvement, of bettering the situation at arms-industry plants. As time goes on, this will be more tangible to employees than it is at present. I would like to emphasize one other thing: There has been a marked improvement in the political climate, which favors the arms industry and the development of production for domestic consumption and exports. Our undertakings are commensurate. On the basis of what was done last year, we are organizing in Kielce an educational and promotional exhibition. We expect that, like other measures, it will foster the development of cooperation with domestic and foreign companies, the expansion of exports, and the strengthening of our potential.
