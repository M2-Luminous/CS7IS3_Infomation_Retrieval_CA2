Shanghai Offers Large Projects To Attract Transnational Corporations"] [Text] Attracting internationally renowned transnational corporations for completely systematic cooperation with various industries has become a main goal this year in Shanghai's use of foreign capital. Persons concerned have disclosed that Shanghai will offer about 100 major industrial projects this year to attract more than $10 million in foreign capital. These offers are in the petrochemical, metallurgy, complete electric power plant equipment, telecommunications electronics, motor vehicle tires, computer, and ball bearing industries. These projects will be joint ventures or cooperative ventures with major advanced world business concerns and transnational corporations. They will include joint ventures that cut across industry lines, and complete industry joint ventures. They will also break new ground in the use of technology exchange markets, in investment scale, in investment methods, and in conditions for setting up holding companies. The goal is for one-third of the world's top major corporations to have an investment project in Shanghai within one year. People in the economic sector note that the purpose of Shanghai's active efforts to cooperate with transnational corporations is formation of a high and new technology industrial group of substantial size so as to be able to begin from a high starting point in the development of its own products. This will enable a "new generation" of Shanghai goods in entirely new garb to take part in international economic competition. Reportedly, Shanghai has some new areas, new approaches, and new methods for using foreign capital this year. Ten major projects make up Shanghai's second round of infrastructure building. They include a power generation project, the Number 2 subway line, the Pudong international airfield, the circumferential highway around the city, and refuse treatment. In the attraction of foreign traders, in addition to the use of Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperation, BOT and other means of using foreign capital are beginning to be used. Commercial wholesaling and retailing enterprises will set up joint ventures and cooperation with foreign chain stores, and will trial operate Sino-foreign joint venture or sole proprietorship foreign trade companies. They will trial operate Sino-foreign joint venture commercial wholesale enterprises, and means of production retail enterprises. They will, on a trial basis, operate and develop investment institutions such as various kinds of funds, investment trusts, and holding companies. They plan to draw up attractive preferential methods and concessionary policies to attract foreign finance and banking institutions, transnational corporations, and noted blocks to move their headquarters or regional headquarters to Shanghai. They plan to decontrol, on a limited basis, the renminbi business of foreign financial institutions. Under prevailing conditions, foreign financial companies will first be allowed issue loans to and collect deposits from foreign invested enterprises and those state enterprises which receive supplementary renminbi loans along with foreign loans. Statistics show that so far Shanghai has attracted more than $13 billion in foreign capital, and has authorized more than 6000 foreign investment projects. One hundred twenty-six world renowned transnational corporations have invested in Shanghai enterprises. One-third of the world's 100 largest transnational industrial corporations have set up shop in Shanghai.
