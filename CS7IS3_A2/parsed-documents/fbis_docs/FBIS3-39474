Our soldiers are certainly not backing out but, on behalf of all of them, Admiral Angelo Mariani, chief of general staff, said: "All we want is for the Navy to be given the means to fulfill its task properly. We are concerned -- but, frankly, we are more than just concerned -- that our men's commitment and professionalism will not be enough if in the meantime the right choices are not made in terms of investment and equipment." According to a report on the state of the Army, in 1993 the defense budget amounted to 25.56 trillion lire [L]. The Navy absorbed L3.458 trillion, which represents 19 percent of overall expenditure. Forecasts for 1994 confirm the budget is shrinking. The assumed availability of L26.167 trillion for defense means a 2.4 percent increase in monetary terms, but this amounts to a reduction in real terms. Allocations for the Navy should be in the region of L3.513 trillion, representing an increase of 1.6 percent in monetary terms, which is not even enough to offset predicted inflation levels. Operations in the Adriatic Sea in connection with war in the former Yugoslavia have represented the most important commitment in strategic, political, and organizational terms. The Navy took part in these missions right from the start, committing ships and aircraft, and two of its admirals were in command of the two allied naval task forces that were initially deployed. Effective control of the makeup and destination of cargo ships began in November 1992, following the UN decision to strengthen the measures aimed at enforcing the embargo. The Navy was involved in the "Sharp Guard" operation, for which it continuously provided three to four naval units and two to three aircraft for patroling purposes. As far as Albania is concerned, in 1993 the Navy was engaged in continuous control operations to prevent any illegal mass migration into Italy. Furthermore, in 1993 another 180 minor missions were carried out, amounting to as many days out at sea.
