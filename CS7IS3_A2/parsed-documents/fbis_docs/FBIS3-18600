Then a decision is to be made whether or not the development of the new VLCT plane (Very Large Commercial Transport) will be continued together. This was decided by the European Airbus companies Aerospatiale (France), British Aerospace (Great Britain), Casa (Spain), and Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa/Germany) as well as the U.S. Boeing corporation (Seattle) at a meeting in London on Thursday [3 March], Dasa announced. At the meeting, it was agreed that, in the future, the umbrella organization of the Airbus partners, Airbus Industrie (Toulouse), will itself be involved in the studies. In the studies for a plane that is larger than the Jumbo Jet currently produced by Boeing, which were initiated in 1993, only the Airbus shareholders have talked to each other so far, since Airbus Industrie and Boeing are direct competitors. Speculations about the departure of Aerospatiale from the project were denied by a Dasa spokesman. According to the agreement, it is also to be examined whether other companies, for instance from Japan or Russia, may be included in the project.
