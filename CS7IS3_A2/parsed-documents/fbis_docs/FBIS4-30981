Why do you think that this saying is so popular with us Romanians? [Nastase] One could speculate at length on the meaning of this saying. I believe that we have not yet managed to develop a sentiment of solidarity around certain common interests. Maybe these common interests are not all that clear to us, or were not properly explained to us. They do not provide enough motivation for the public at large, the journalists, and the political forces. Therefore, all we are doing is resort to petty moves, the end result of which is zilch, meaning that they lead nowhere. It is a pity, since we are thus making no headway whatsoever. We should aim at pointing out the essential and remove, as much as possible, the ballast of our resentments and learn to appreciate true value and merit. The thing about dragging the neighbor down the drain along with you does not apply anywhere else in the world. There are political debates and contrary opinions in all countries, but things are much too personal in our country. In Romania, the parties are personalized and they mainly appear before the public through their leaders, not their structures. Because of this personalization, the overall political life is too personalized, as well. Only to the extent that the parties become more solid will they be able to function better as organized entities and will we manage to put an end to this individualistic dimension and extreme personalization of Romanian political life. [Lucaciu] Is it worth getting involved in politics, so that one may be judged severely by the public at large at some point for all that one has done? [Nastase] Anyone entering the political life is actually entering a stage, whereby all your details can assume greater proportions due to the assorted stage-lighting. Some of the people backstage can throw a certain light upon you in order to emphasize a given detail. All this is inevitable. [Lucaciu] So, whoever enters the political battle must assume the risks of the trade. [Nastase] I would not say that it is not natural to attack political figures. However, I believe that a balance should be struck between one's political activities and one's private life when passing judgment on a politician. The politicians also have parents, families, and children. Flinging mud at people is unacceptable in the private sphere. Therefore, many politicians have begun to withdraw from politics and enter the business world, where they can make more money. I believe that a certain degree of understanding should be reached and certain practical limits be agreed upon as far as politician hunting can go. Even hunting animals has its own rules. For instance, you may not shoot at a pheasant on the ground or at a rabbit that is standing still. You may not fire more than two shots. These are a few rules that are supposed to give the adversary a chance. For instance, if a newspaper with a certain circulation aims at starting a hunt for politicians, it can cause such an upset that it might affect the entire political life. [Lucaciu] Does that mean that you favor a press law? [Nastase] No, because I do not believe that a law can solve this problem. I believe in correlating one's rights with one's responsibilities. I do not know how one can achieve this practically. Many countries practice a kind of self-censorship. I do not think that this is possible in our country. However, it is obvious that journalists should display a certain degree of responsibility. The Wall of the Electoral Result [Lucaciu] Let us not forget that the press -- the same as the economy and even politics -- is going through a tumultuous period of transition. Do you believe that, in this period of transition, Romania is experiencing a political crisis? [Nastase] There are several aspects to this question. First of all, we must clarify the meaning of crisis. Does it mean an extreme institutional malfunction? Does it mean a breaking point that requires other solutions than the usual ones? Paradoxically, the functioning of Romanian society and its stability have not experienced dramatic upheavals as of September 1991. No dramatic elements have appeared at the domestic level since. Therefore, the political life in our country has proceeded without major malfunctions for the past three years. I am not sure that we are in a situation of crisis. We are in a state of constant searches, political struggles, and attempts to find better or worse answers to the current problems. We are trying to adjust the current aspirations to the electoral results of 1992. As a matter of fact, we are faced in parliament with the electoral choice of 1992. This is rightfully called "the revolt of the facts against the law." A certain codification of the electoral options took place in 1992, after which all kinds of political developments occurred, all of which bumped into this wall of the electoral result. This wall, created in 1992, can resist until 1996, when the next elections are scheduled, or it can disintegrate under the pressure of the accumulation of facts, expectations, and aspirations. [Lucaciu] Dismantling this wall before 1966 would imply early elections. Do you believe in the possibility of holding early elections? [Nastase] I do not believe in it. However, I can tell you that, theoretically speaking, if the 1992 situation can no longer contend with the current political reality at all, then early elections might take place. We have not reached this point yet and the major political parties in Romania are not interested in early elections. The stability we have had since 1991 has been achieved on the basis of a delicate balancing act that has required extraordinary efforts. [Lucaciu] The latest public opinion polls show that the same electorate from 1992 no longer trusts the people it has elected. In my opinion, the credibility of the parliament and government has decreased to an alarming level. Does that not mean that we are in a time of political crisis? [Nastase] Public opinion polls in most countries show a lack of trust in the respective parliaments and governments. Therefore, I would not take these results in our country as unequivocal. What is more, no matter what parliament or government functioned in Romania at this time, the discontent would still be present. You should also note the level of trust in the political parties represented in parliament. One cannot make a direct correlation between the lack of trust in parliament and the lack of trust in the political parties. In the last instance, we are faced here with a state of expectancy. The parliament -- not as a political institution, but as a legislative institution -- is called upon to do more. [Lucaciu] Before last summer's National Conference of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], you issued an open letter through which you managed to trigger off an epistolary dialogue, out of the desire to clarify the doctrine situation of the party. In my opinion, things have not yet been clarified -- proof of which is the denigration campaign against you, a campaign that you yourself have said may not be alien to the doings of some of your party colleagues. Why did this situation arise? [Nastase] Compared to the situation last summer, when it was not very clear how the party members were contemplating their ideology and action strategy, the situation has changed. The National Conference has helped quite a lot to emphasize a theoretical development and modern tackling of the social-democratic doctrine, which increasingly more party members have adhered to in recent months. I believe that, right now, the great majority of the party members are following this line and are making efforts to build a modern center-left party that is European in its approach to problems and national in its approach to interests and values. Of course, there are also some people who are probably afraid of changes. I do not know whether personal interests are necessarily at stake there. However, they might be afraid of the unknown... [Lucaciu] Looking at the rather diverse attitudes of some PDSR parliamentarians at times, one may note that they are much closer, from a doctrine viewpoint, to the PDSR's satellite parties -- the Greater Romania Party [PRM], the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM], and the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR] -- than to social democracy. [Nastase] The answer is yes and no. Maybe this aspect was more obvious at the beginning. However, with the passage of time, we explained to everybody that we must clearly delimit ourselves from the other parties and I believe that this was pretty well understood. The problem is more of a practical nature. The voters can only give their vote to a single party, which can be the PDSR, the PRM, or another one. There can be no amorphous structure. There might be some common interests and strategies. But in the last instance, we must clearly know what the boundaries of our party are. Regarding the labelling the people as categorically belonging to a certain sphere or not, I believe that things have changed a lot since last year. It is necessary to make a much more careful analysis of the party structures, including at the regional level. In my opinion, many people have moved toward a position of expecting and desiring the modernization of this party. [Lucaciu] I am looking now at a note published in CURIERUL NATIONAL daily, which prints excerpts from an interview granted by PDSR Spokesman Dumitru Paslaru to the BBC. I am going to read a sentence from it, which I would like to comment on: "We are dealing here with an attack against a political leader who has managed to make a name for himself and to elevate the party and make it stronger than it should have been." What might be the meaning of "stronger than it should have been"? [Nastase] I think Mr. Paslaru placed the emphasis on the wrong word. He wanted to say "stronger than others would have liked it to be." Since I know him well, I am convinced that this is what he wanted his comment to be. But then, it is pretty hard for anyone to comment on everything that has happened of late. He wanted to express his support, but he also lacked enough information, hence he found it hard to give an explanation. The most shocking thing about these attacks against me is that they did not take place in 1990, 1991, or 1992, but now. Why did they come when I was away on a visit to Germany? First, I was accused of having four houses, then of having only one house, then no house at all, since I had given it away as a present. These things are pretty strange and the question is: Why did it all happen at this time? [Lucaciu] Nevertheless, what explanation do you have for the fact that this concentric fire is aimed only at you? [Nastase] For the time being, I have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The skeptical philosophers of antiquity used to say that when you have no answer to a question, the best solution is to suspend judgment on the question for a while. This is exactly what I am doing now. What is more, my position is very clear and, in the coming days, I will submit all relevant acts on the issue of the houses to the relevant parliamentary commission -- since it takes some time to collect all documents -- and then I will continue with my other, more important, activities. This week, we will resume our visits to the provinces. I no longer intend to continue my game with the daily ADEVARUL [which has published allegations about Nastase illicitly acquiring several houses in Bucharest]. I consider it beneath my dignity. [Lucaciu] [PUNR President] Funar's party is one of the PDSR's allies. Do you believe that the PUNR is involved in the Caritas [Cluj-based money-multiplying Ponzi-scheme] affair? [Nastase] I do not intend to investigate this matter, since I do not have the necessary details. I did not see the file. From the very beginning, I considered the Caritas game as a damaging phenomenon for Romanian society. I made this statement some time ago, when I first visited Cluj. At the same time, I pointed out why I and the party I represent cannot agree with Caritas and with its way of making money. [Lucaciu] Why did you not start a legislative initiative at the time to curb Caritas and other such allegedly "mutual assistance" games? [Nastase] The word was out at the time -- and maybe there was some justification to it -- that Caritas was just waiting for an excuse not to have to pay out the money it promised and to also have somebody else to blame for it. A legislative initiative at that time would have encouraged the Caritas people to claim that the initiative had destroyed the people's trust in the scheme, therefore the PDSR or the government should pay the people whose turn it was to receive money. My statements -- at least in the Caritas case -- were unequivocal. I said that the people should be warned about the risks of playing the Caritas game. Regarding the PUNR position vis- a-vis Caritas, I believe that they should clarify this matter themselves. When we held our talks with the PUNR, one of the first explanations we demanded from them was whether they are involved in the Caritas scheme or not. Their official answer was a categorical "no." [Lucaciu] What do you have to say about Mr. Gheorghe Funar's participation alongside [Caritas director] Ioan Stoica in a television program? [Nastase] I did not see that broadcast, but many references were made to it. We were told that the program was shot in different studios... I do not remember their explanations very well. However, the PUNR's position was that they are not involved in the Caritas scheme. If there are documents that prove their involvement, it is obvious that the matter should be discussed by us, by taking the proof into account. Good PDSR and Bad PDSR [Lucaciu] The PDSR has negotiated not only with the PUNR, but also with the opposition. What conclusion did you reach at the end of these negotiations? [Nastase] The discussions were halted for the duration of the budget discussion in parliament, without an "armistice" or an "end to hostilities" being declared. The budget itself represented a political struggle, and each side gathered its big guns to make their point. No serious talks can be held at such a time, and consequently the negotiations will be resumed after the budget is finalized. The conclusion of the talks is that each political force in the country needs to mature itself from a political viewpoint. This dialogue should become a means of communication even in delicate situations. Otherwise, blockages may emerge, with irreparable results through their recurrent effects. We have achieved a very important thing, namely a personal dialogue, which is more than we had in 1991 and 1992. We have gained a lot from that. It is the difference between "means" and "results." Of course, no major or spectacular result was obtained. Some people thought that another governmental team and a new parliamentary majority would be put together after two rounds of negotiations. Certain political parties expected such a thing. But the discussions revealed that changing the parliamentary majority is no easy thing to do. One cannot ignore the fact that we are working in 1994 with a parliament elected in 1992. These results cannot be changed easily. [Lucaciu] Let us call things by their name. The opposition is demanding that the PDSR should distance itself from the PSM, the PRM, the PUNR, and the Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania [PDAR], with which you make up the current coalition. [Nastase] I do not deny that the opposition is demanding this. They consider this aspect to be very important. However, there is a matter of a nuance here. We are asked not to distance ourselves, but to politically separate ourselves from them. We are also the recipients of other advice as well, namely that the good part of the PDSR should join the opposition and the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] to make up the difference from 47 percent to 51 percent. However, let me assure you that we are not interested in having our party toe somebody else's line. Of course, from the opposition's viewpoint this would be a most useful and appealing formula. If they can get the 51 percent, they would have no further problems. They would like to take 4 or 5 percent from the "good" PDSR, to add to their percentage. We do not want to turn ourselves into an insignificant minority part of another governmental formula or parliamentary majority formula. Until now, the opposition has failed to convince us that what it is suggesting is also to our benefit. To put it bluntly, the offer is interesting for the opposition, but I do not see how it can be interesting for us, too. [Lucaciu] You are talking about good and bad parts of the party. If the PDSR ceases to be a ruling party, meaning that it is no longer in power, will it not go the way of the former National Salvation Front [FSN] and split? [Nastase] I do not think so. Maybe a couple of people will leave, but their place will be taken by others. There will always be an ebb-and-flow movement in the party, as is the case with others parties, too. The PDSR has already acquired its own physiognomy and can overcome even an internal crisis. Some people rely too much on what you just said, and they are very wrong. I only believe in the need to bring about a change within the party, minute by minute and day by day. This is what is actually happening, but it is not all that visible. I have noted this change in the territory. There are valuable people who want to join the party. The PDSR is like a snowman, which we are building and which is turning from a hastily put together dwarf into a big snowman. [Lucaciu] May I remind you that snowmen eventually melt? [Nastase] The observation is very correct. I should better say "like a man made of clay or precious metals." The Restoration in Attitudes [Lucaciu] The fact that the PDSR tried to impose its people at all administration levels and in the executive, like the Romanian Communist Party [PCR] did in its time, has led to the conclusion that a restoration is taking place in Romania. [Nastase] I do not know, it seems that many ministries have always functioned with their own apparatus. Whether they functioned well or not, well, this is debatable. These people, which form a separate structure, have functioned under the Petre Roman, Theodor Stolojan, and Nicolae Vacaroiu governments. There is a good and bad aspect to this situation. The teams will change with the passage of time. The great majority of these clerks were not hired now; most of them have worked in these ministries since 1989. I repeat, I do not know whether this is good or bad. Where the basic apparatus of an institution was destroyed, an implosion usually occurred. An example of this is Bulgaria, where the foreign minister sacked half of the employees -- if not more of them -- with the end result being that the respective ministry practically collapsed. Such things happened in our country, too. I do not know what you mean by restoration. If you mean that we must not agree that those people who held positions at a certain hierarchical level on the country's technical and political scale before 1989 should hold even higher governmental positions now, well, this is certainly something worth discussing. [Lucaciu] What is your opinion about the fact that a high clerk in the Ministry of Culture, the poet Ion Gheorghe, can claim that "the moment of 22 December 1989 is a crime against the Romanian people?" His presence in the ministry is proof of the phenomenon of restoration. [Nastase] I agree that we can talk about a restoration in attitudes, but not about somebody's appointment to a given post. I agree with your assessment of the poet Ion Gheorghe's comments. Such a statement is inadmissible! [Lucaciu] Such statements, as well as those made by other people still longing for the Ceausescu [Nicolae Ceausescu, former communist ruler] era, are pretty worrisome. [Nastase] That is why we must continue to pay great attention to the manifestation of such attitudes and ensure that our society is perceived by everyone as a society that is worth living in. [Lucaciu] But you see, there are such nostalgia-stricken people even within the PDSR. [Nastase] I do not know who you are referring to. [Lucaciu] I am referring to the articles signed by Messrs. Vacaru [PDSR vice president Vasile Vacaru] and Dumitrascu [Gheorghe Dumitrascu, PDSR senator for Constanta] in Adrian Paunescu's [PSM vice president] daily VREMEA on 26 January, Ceausescu's birthday anniversary. [Nastase] I do not know whether all these articles should be taken literally... [Lucaciu] In one of [Supreme Court Judge] Antonie Iorgovan's letters, which fueled the polemical dialogue in the press, he maintains that the country's president should not belong to any political party and should be independent... [Nastase] This is a formula that I do not understand very well. In his opinion, a country's president should be someone held in a kind of test tube, so as not to be contaminated by political ideas. If that is the case, then we may one day have to bring somebody from abroad who has had no contact whatsoever with Romanian political life and is completely neutral. If we bring him from the East, it is bad, and if we bring him from the West, it is also bad. Maybe we should bring him from another planet. In my opinion, Iorgovan's proposal is naive. Nowhere is the president accepted and voted for by the entire electorate. Some presidents are elected by 51 percent of the votes, others by 55 percent. Look at the Americans or the French! After the elections, they become the presidents of all the voters! Everything depends on the ability of the politicians to realize their duties at a given time, otherwise they will eventually be held accountable for their failure. If a president takes someone's side too much, he will be punished for it. He or the party he represents will surely be punished at the following elections. We must realize that the current institutional construction in Romania becomes validated with the passage of time. Both the parliamentarians and their parties will be voted for at the next elections to the extent that they have performed adequately. [Lucaciu] This is also the PDSR's case. Mr. President Ion Iliescu has started on his road with your party. Therefore, you will jointly reap the fruit of your achievements and failures, proceeding from the assumption that you will also jointly contest the next elections. The law on everything being sanctioned by the passage of time will also apply to the PDSR-Mr. Ion Iliescu tandem. [Nastase] Formally, if the president wants, he will be endorsed by the PDSR. He can also run as an independent, but I believe that he will accept to be supported by us and probably by other parties, too. Everybody knows that he was the first president of this party, which proposed him for the position of the country's president. Therefore, it only seems natural to me that, six years from now, when he is no longer the country's president, he should return to the PDSR. This happens in all countries in the world. This president-party relationship is not something abnormal. [Lucaciu] In his capacity as the country's president, Mr. Ion Iliescu should be neutral from a political viewpoint, as the Constitution stipulates. However, due to his sentimental nature, he does not forget you and often holds consultations with the PDSR. [Nastase] At the party level, Mr.Ion Iliescu holds consultations with us, to the extent that he has consultations with other parties, too. Occasionally, we also want to meet with him and he kindly accepts it. However, please note that Mr. Ion Iliescu meets with politicians from all parties. His agenda is proof of the fact that he often has such meetings. [Lucaciu] A recent PDSR-Mr. Ion Iliescu meeting took place at Cotroceni, with the "Nastase case" on the agenda. [Nastase] Four subjects were discussed at that meeting. The press campaign against me was not a distinct subject of discussion. Of course, this element was brought up at a certain point. However, the matters of interest for our Central Executive Bureau meeting were those linked to the basic problems of our political life. [Lucaciu] Still, what did Mr. Ion Iliescu have to say about this campaign against you? [Nastase] My opinion is that some people thought that my relationship with the president is too good and it should be destroyed, so as to hurt me and, I think, also him. Of course, much speculation can be made in this respect. As far as I am concerned, I looked back in time and could find no moment of tension between President Iliescu and myself. On the contrary, we have always understood each other very well. I have always told him what I thought, and I believe that this helped him to take certain decisions. I consider Mr. Ion Iliescu to be a political figure who has made a great impact on our political life in the past five years and who will continue to play an important role. [Lucaciu] Have you ever thought of running for the position of Romania's president? [Nastase] To be honest, I have never thought of this, for quite a few reasons. First, I do no think of a problem when it does not arise. Right now, we have a president, new elections are going to be held two years from now, and I think that President Ion Iliescu should consider running again for a new mandate. I am 44 years old and I do not think that a country's president should be that young. I do not know whether I would be ready for such a position. I lack the necessary experience, since I have only been politically active for the past five years, which is far too little. As a matter of fact, the issue of the presidency is slightly exaggerated in our country, since we attach too much importance to the position of president. Of course, this comes from our past and from the idea that we need a fatherly figure. If you read the constitutional stipulations about the president's prerogatives, you will note that they are rather limited in Romania. They mainly refer to his capacity to influence. Thus, I assure you that the life of a foreign minister can be far more interesting than the life of a country's president, which should not be envied. Therefore, I have not bothered to think of the problem raised by your question. Some People Were Scared by the Public Opinion Polls [Lucaciu] I asked you that question because a recent pubic opinion poll showed you to be the most popular political figure. [Nastase] The polls change from one week to another, if they are correct at all. Personally, I do not pay too much attention to these polls, but others seems to have attached great importance to them, got scared for reasons I fail to comprehend, and then leaked all kinds of messages and interpretations, some of which found their way to a certain newspaper [ADEVARUL]... [Lucaciu] You stand for change and modernization in politics. What about the family life? How do you see the husband-wife relationship in your rather large family? Are you still subscribing to the old principle that the wife should stay at home, care for the children, and wait for the husband with the meals ready? [Nastase] My wife is a very practical and dynamic woman. I humbly admit that I would have liked my wife to stay at home. On the other hand, I cannot ignore the fact that, if I were to stick to such an old mentality, I would practically risk destroying my family. I cannot ask my wife to wait for me at home with a hot meal from early in the morning until 11-12 at night, when I come home after work. I admit that I would like that, but I am rational enough to realize that if she did not have something to do and all she had to do was read the papers that attack me, then she would begin to suffer from anxiety. That is why I encouraged her to find a job for herself. She is working on a project now. Maybe she will publish it, I do not know... The truth is that, these days, a woman can no longer stay at home as in the past. We, men, should also change our mentality. I am making efforts to change my attitude, but I admit it is pretty hard. [Lucaciu] I hope you will not be angry with me if I ask you where the nickname "Sweetie" comes from? I heard it from some of your PDSR colleagues. [Nastase] This nickname does not even bother me. I believe I was given this nickname because I am slower by nature, softer in the way I express myself, pretty easy-going, and with round, less sharp features. Maybe this is the source of it all. It is only natural that I should also have a nickname, since almost every politician has one. I find it hard to judge whether this nickname suits me or not. After you also wrote a lot about my nickname, people said that I am authoritarian, tough, and inflexible. I do not know how these statements tally with the nickname of "Sweetie." Maybe those who claimed all those things did it too hastily. [Lucaciu] At the beginning of your parliamentary mandate, I believe that the nickname suited you, since you were chairing the sessions far too delicately. Then, when you were faced with the hardships of tumultuous parliamentary life, you let go of the little bell and started making use of the alarm gong and so forth. [Nastase] I believe that we cannot make any headway in our parliament without a little firmness in chairing a session. The deputies have also begun to accept that the session chairman should play a more dynamic role. At times, someone is needed to break the deadlock, by putting together certain ideas in order to reach a compromise. Otherwise, hours on end would be wasted, without any results being achieved. [Lucaciu] Is compromise a specific method in politics? [Nastase] Compromise is absolutely necessary, it is the essential way in which many political problems can be solved. Compromise is the key answer to any political dispute. Of course, basic principles of values must not be affected, but a balance of interests should always be achieved. [Lucaciu] What disturbs you most at this time? [Nastase] The fact that I am in politics and that I must keep on going. What I have just said -- that sometimes I feel like retiring from politics -- is something that preoccupies many politicians. I -- as well as my wife and parents -- am also asking myself, quiet often, whether it is worth it to stay on in politics or devote myself more to my family. Those close to me suffer along with me for the attacks in various articles, and I know how ill- meaning they are. But then, I must probably have a sentiment of duty... I do not know whether this is good or bad... I inherited this attitude from my father, namely that I should not desert something when the going gets tough... Nevertheless, the question remains whether it is worthwhile staying in politics or not?! Many people are asking themselves this question today...
