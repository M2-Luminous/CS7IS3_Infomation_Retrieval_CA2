Do you think these remarks are fair? [Ymeri] Unfortunately, the activities of RTSh [Albanian Radio-Television] deserve most of the remarks, not only those of the press, but also those of our political and cultural personalities and of international bodies or their representatives. [Keko] How would you, briefly, summarize some of RTSh's shortcomings? [Ymeri] A shortage and distortion of information, the barring of alternative opinions, and an open political stance. [Keko] Let us take the issue of information.... [Ymeri] It is very difficult, if not impossible, to learn from radio and television information programs what is going on in Albania. In these programs you can find virtually all the meetings of our president, our prime minister, and other ministers; you can learn that a minor thief or ordinary murderer has been caught, you hear every single declaration of the Democratic Party [PD] and its offshoots, you can follow rosy reports on Albanian existence, but serious events of our political, economic, and social life are either passed over in silence or viewed according to the official version. I do not know a single case of our television having taken the lead with its own information or any example of professionalism having prompted a RTSh journalist to refute official communiques with actual facts. [Keko] Do you think it is a matter of a lack of professionalism? [Ymeri] No. I think that in spite of the massive purges that have occurred among the RTSh journalists, there are still many capable journalists left who like their profession and know it well. The same thing can be said about the newcomers. You can of course come across incompetent journalists, uncultured ones, some of whom are running important departments. But it is not here that the root of the evil lies. In the final analysis, one can blurt out the truth. The principal reason for this situation is that RTSh's activities are subject to strict political censorship. [Keko] You spoke about RTSh's political stance and the exclusion of alternative opinions.... [Ymeri] ...which are not only an infringement of the law, but also a violation of the basics of a democratic state. It is a known fact that RTSh's microphones and cameras are closed to any kind of criticism of the state or to any alternative way of thinking about politics, economy, and international relations. They are closed to the opposition and forbidden for prominent figures of our culture, even to august and respected international bodies, if they give vent to "heretical" opinions. The RTSh has, on the one hand, undertaken, in an illegitimate way, to "denounce" all the activities of the opposition forces, but on the other hand, it never acknowledges their legitimate right to express their own opinions. The European Parliament endorsed a special resolution on Albania underscoring the violation of basic human rights and the freedom of the press, but the RTSh kept silent for a time, pronouncing itself only after governmental bodies reacted by putting together their response to the resolution in a remarkably primitive style. Let us compare this fact with the ridiculous hullabaloo that we heard about a survey carried out by Euro-Barometer. Here is another example: Let us remember Professor Rexhep Qosja's criticism of the policy of our government and president. The RTSh did not publicize a single article by R. Qosja, whereas it was quick to broadcast, with gleeful alacrity, our president's reaction to his criticism. We can therefore safely affirm that our "national" RTSh has declared a total embargo on Professor Rexhep Qosja ever since. Still another example: Several months ago, the doors of the RTSh were open to Mr. Kalakula, who was one of the PD's top leaders. Nobody even ventured to censure his fascist-type declaration made in parliament. However, these ever-growing contradictions with the PD sufficed to make him a target of smear statements and accusations, broadcast by the RTSh. Personally speaking, I do not feel the least sympathy for Kalakula's political viewpoints. Nevertheless I cannot help admitting that he should have been given the right to respond to those attacks. [Keko] What then should be, according to you, the RTSH's role in Albanian political life? [Ymeri] As an impartial institution, the RTSH cannot remain outside politics, neither can we ask for such a thing. The RTSH must, however, be an objective mirror of our political life, reflecting the stands of different political forces, both for and against the government, without ever undertaking to play the role of a referee in the competition among political parties. In reality, however, just the opposite is happening, a typical example being the way how they went about the "Nano affair." It remains a fact that the RTSH went out of its way to keep Nano's trial hush-hush, and those who were looking forward to following this event with interest were disillusioned. If "smothering" Fatos Nano's declaration was, technically speaking, an easy thing to do, the pains taken to back up the indictment and the judicial bench were really heroic. I can imagine the fatigue of editing, making "cuts" and "patchwork" phrases in order to concoct a chronicle that was the fruit of betraying one's profession, civil honor, and dignity. It seems to me, however, that we are asking too much from such department heads and journalists, who never dared to rise up and voice their support for their colleagues sacked by the RTSh, for their fellow-professionals who were put in prison. Besides, they did not utter a word in support of one of their colleagues who was beaten up by the bodyguards of some government dignitary. It, therefore, comes as no surprise that one of the these maltreated journalists puts together servile commentaries on Fatos Nano's trial. Under such circumstances, there is simply no room to speak of human dignity, let alone professionalism! [Keko] Who is running the RTSH, according to your opinion: the president, the government, the PD, or someone else? [Ymeri] I do not see any essential difference within this trio. Their policy is the same, their goals also. It is natural to think that the branch that has got most weight in his trio is the one that decides. One thing is clear; when you see the RTSh's teams running after the PD leaders escorted by a suite of ministers, and following their every step, when you see press conferences and reports on visits concocted on no criteria whatsoever, it becomes evident that the RTSh has been relegated to the position of a private taxi: Aside from the fact that, in this particular case, it is the state that pays for the petrol. [Keko] What would you say about the Management Council's role? [Ymeri] The Management Council has almost been converted into a formal rubber stamp. Its rare meetings are postponed indefinitely, especially in moments of political "crises." All important issues are resolved outside this council and more often than not its members are confronted with a fait accompli. The same thing happened with the dismissal of the RTSh's employees. Naturally, we, I and other of my colleagues, voiced our concern and objections at our council's meetings, but the result was such as you can see for yourself today. [Keko] Do you think the RTSh is heading for a new cycle of single-party propaganda? [Ymeri] A tendency toward control, circumscription, and censorship is becoming more and more evident. We can compare the present with the past, but not the monist [single-party rule] period. In this respect, the fact should be mentioned that, as far as economy is concerned, the state compares the present situation with that of 1992, whereas when it comes to democratic freedom and rights it makes comparisons with 1989. Let us now compare the RTSh of 1991 with today's RTSh. There is no doubt that, even though we were just coming out of a period of single-party rule, the degree of freedom of speech and information we enjoyed at that time was higher than today. Thus, ever since, we have been heading for restrictions on the freedom of information and the expression of opinions. The RTSh is on the verge of being converted into an entirely party and government instrument. I believe and hope however that this will not happen. I am even certain that the RTSh will soon take the place it deserves in our country's political life and national culture. [Keko] Do you base your belief on the prospect of a forthcoming political change? [Ymeri] Not only on this. It is everybody's feeling that the number of those who have remained disillusioned by the new situation, who are tired of trials and discrimination, of demagogy, and unprincipled political life, is growing rapidly. This will, of course, lead to political changes, which will create a new climate in the state-owned RTSh's activities. I entertain this belief, relying also on a number, by no means small, of journalists of this institution, who, regardless of their convictions, have their own viewpoints, which differ a lot from those of the RTSh's present leaders and controllers. I hope that the changes in the RTSh's activities will precede the political change you were speaking about. Professional journalists always have a lucid and incisive intuition, enabling them to properly distinguish the requirements of the time. [Keko] Now a question about the RTSh's satellite program: Word reaches us that this programme is threatened with closure and that the RTSh has run up a debt of $600,000 because of satellite transmissions. Is it so, or what is the truth? [Ymeri] As far as I know, the problem is not so dramatic. At least at the Management Council's meeting, where this problem was discussed, it was not treated in such tones. It is true that there are financial difficulties. Here I want to explain that, according to the contract concluded between the RTSh and the Radio-Television of Kosova, the transmission expenses would be borne by the latter and not by the RTSh. As our Kosovar colleagues explain, these financial difficulties have emerged as a result of the fact that the bank accounts in the countries where the Kosovar emigrants are living have been delayed. It has been impossible therefore to collect their financial contributions to the desired degree. There is no doubt that the closure of this program would be regretful, and I hope this handicap will be overcome. I would like however to add in this respect that improvements in the RTSh's programs will certainly boost the interest of the Albanians living outside our state borders. Here I have in mind what I already mentioned above: If there is discontent about the RTSh in Albania, it cannot happen otherwise in the diaspora or elsewhere.
