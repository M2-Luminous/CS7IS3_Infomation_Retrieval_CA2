UN patrols due to start as early as Saturday will be accompanied by unarmed Croats and Moslems, said Major Rob Annink, a spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Starting Saturday talks will also be held on opening up six routes to cross the frontlines. The report comes a day after Bosnian army General Muslimovic and his counterpart, General Vrbanac of the Bosnian Croat HVO [Croatian Defense Council] force, agreed on the terms of the patrols. UN peacekeepers will be deployed immediately at the Croat-Moslem hotspots of Mostar, Vitez, Gorni Vakuf, Prozor, Konjic, and Jablanica where ceasefire violations have been rampant, said UNPROFOR spokesman Major Guy Vinet. Under the Moslem-Croat agreement all checkpoints manned by HVO and Bosnian army troops will come under UN control, Vinet added.

Bosnian Justice Minister Kasem Trnka will head the government delegation while the Croat delegation will be headed by Deputy Croatian Foreign Minister Sanader Ivo. U.S. special envoy on ex-Yugoslavia Charles Redman will also attend. A high-level transitional committee has been charged with drafting a constitution for the Croat-Moslem federation as well as the outlines of a confederal arrangement linking the proposed alliance with the Republic of Croatia. The committee in addition will try to forge a military accord between Bosnian Moslems and Croats and an agreement on the shape of governmental structures in the proposed federation. The talks here are expected to last around 10 days. [passage omitted]
