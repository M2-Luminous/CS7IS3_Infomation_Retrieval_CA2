He said that Thailand has made progress and enjoyed a 30 percent increase in its trade surplus. Speaking about the trend of expanded foreign investment into the Indochinese market, Suphachai said this is a mechanism of competition in trade, but the Thai market is still attractive to investors. Moreover, the deputy minister notes that Thailand still needs to improve its trade and investment system in order to be able to compete with other rivals in the future. [Begin Suphachai recording] In my opinion, among the ASEAN countries last year, Thailand had a trade surplus with ASEAN countries for the first time. It had never happened before. You cannot say we suffer disadvantages with others in ASEAN. It is impossible. Our export of goods to ASEAN countries increased by 30 percent last year. That was the first such time in history, and we also enjoyed a trade surplus. It is not the other way round, I believe. We asked a number of companies why they transferred their investment into Indochina or China. Is it because our country is not attractive or because of the appearance of new markets? Most of them said it is because they have to compete with other companies in the Chinese market, not because our market is not competitive enough. They still continue to invest in our country. Because other companies have shifted their competition to China or Indochina, they therefore have to follow suit. We have to consider these points carefully. Our expansion of exports is second to none. [end recording]
