It makes one wonder what drove the two climbers, Shim'on Peres and Yasir 'Arafat, to exchange peaceful Norwegian country houses for the media spectacle at the World Economic Forum in Davos. If the "miracle of Washington" -- the Rabin-'Arafat handshake of 13 September -- has taught us anything, it is the obligation to be discreet. Major conflicts, such as the Arab-Israeli one, are not solved at CNN speed -- and especially not in a forum that invites participants to pose for the media rather than engage in hard work to increase mutual confidence. Thus, Peres and 'Arafat could meet the world press hand in hand, but they could not present an agreement on enforcing the autonomy accord to the world policy groupies. They only got "very close." Foreign Minister Peres, a poet manque, cannot have read his "Magic Mountain" properly, which he quotes as a symbol for rising and overcoming problems. Thomas Mann's novel was inspired by his wife's stay at a Davos sanatorium. He describes the "Magic Mountain" as a mystical, dreamy world -- the absolute opposite of the "flat country," where, just as in real politics, sobriety and reality prevail. The two ideological opponents, Naphta and Settembrini, "are both great wafflers," whose fierce debates turn into "major irritability." Finally they fight a duel: One fires a shot in the air, the other -- Naphta -- shoots himself. The more modest mountains of Norway would have provided a happier metaphor. But this is not the right time for literary excursions. Although the appearance in the snow failed, the model worked out in the Norwegian solitude last year continues to be the right one. What is more, the hand-in-hand appearance in Davos once again showed dramatically how strong the impulse for peace is. There is no doubt that Peres and 'Arafat want reconciliation. The only question is whether they are able to achieve peace in their negotiations. The "big success" achieved in Washington avoided the crucial question "Who will get what, when, and where?" And this is bothering the negotiators now -- not because the devil is in the nuts and bolts, but because the principle is in the nuts and bolts. For the Israelis, the first principle is security, and the second -- although not forever -- avoiding an "independent Palestinian state" (Rabin). For the Palestinians, however, the foremost principal is a "state" -- as much of it and as quickly as possible. The security of Israel and the settlers hardly bothers them. What is worse, since 13 September the number of terrorist attacks has soared, and escalation remains a latent option to make the Israelis withdraw from Jericho and Gaza more quickly. After all, 'Arafat has not yet brought himself to condemn the attacks clearly. This is why Peres and 'Arafat have to fight the agonizing expectations hand in hand. The Israelis expect the journey to peace not to be paid for with less security -- and this is the reason for the seemingly endless disputes about who controls the borders of the autonomous regions: The Jordan -- which is only a few meters wide anyway -- must not become a channel for weapons. Also, they are not convinced that hand-holding 'Arafat has his own clients in hand. The Palestinians who want to wrest more democracy from him are mostly those who accuse 'Arafat of "selling out to the Zionist enemy." They want the state here and now, forgetting that such a state cannot be created in Oslo or Davos, but only in the blood- soaked strip of land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River. There, in their day-to-day lives, Israelis and Palestinians will have to realize that the other does not want to overpower them. This conflict cannot be solved by a stroke of the pen, but only by a daily demonstration of "live and let live." The appearance of the Davos duo has created misleading confidence in this respect: Neither Rabin-Peres, nor 'Arafat can rely on their followers at the moment. If elections were held in Israel today, Rabin would be very likely to lose. Whether the one-man-regime 'Arafat would pass such a test is an open question. This is why the adversaries could not keep up the momentum of Washington, why symbols are no longer enough, and why each detail is being bargained over. But this may be the very reason why the descent from the "Magic Mountain" should not be sneezed at. Israel and the PLO have to get back to the "flat country," which has virtually to be surveyed with a tape measure: Who gets which road, which allotment? What are the conditions for extending the autonomy area, both geographically and politically? The more precise the rules, the fewer the reasons for dispute. And the fewer the spectators, the greater the chances for a peace that nobody could even have dreamed of a year ago.
