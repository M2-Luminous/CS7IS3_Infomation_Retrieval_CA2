Today, our words are dedicated to several sectors of the national life, whose commemorations we have observed. First, I do not want to forget that today, 6 June, is the 33d anniversary of the creation of the Interior Ministry [Minint], one of the most active fronts at this current juncture of the fatherland, the most active sector against crime and those who wish to threaten national security. I extend my respect and admiration to these honorable men and women. Comrades, our people are perfectly aware of the conscientiousness and morality with which you conduct your work in the midst of enemy lies and the barrage of hostile propaganda. Our people are aware of how treacherous is the lie abroad that distorts the impeccable attitude of even the last man of the Minint in the midst of very difficult conditions and against totally amoral people. We constantly witness the committed endeavors of the Minint workers to confront crime, which has strategically sided with the enemy. Yet, this is to no avail with those people who take women and children as hostages in their petty personal desires to emigrate. Leaving Cuba does not condemn them; what does is that they do not hesitate to use violence, trickery, theft, lies, and unlawfulness to do so. Our people clearly understand this struggle and this is why they admire and support you because the people recognize your bravery and the need to maintain order and confront those who attempt to make chaos and crime the rule. Other sectors are also observing important dates. The day after tomorrow is Legal Workers's Day -- lawyers and judges, clerks and prosecutors, registry workers, notaries, and lawyers' office workers. To them, we also extend our respect and hopes of seeing their efficiency increase in the fight against crime and illegality. There are other important dates. There is also the Library or Librarians' Day; friends who are many times not recognized given the urgency of the other problems we face. We find libraries and librarians at every level of our school system, and in the cities, with their supply of information and culture ready for our work or leisure -- a book, magazine, pamphlet, map, data, math tables, a name, a dictionary, the title of a book, or a foreign tale, anything. A thousand things that we need to know and for which we have to consult libraries and librarians. We know that nowadays these institutions face many difficulties, given the shortage of resources, and perhaps some might have closed their doors. These are transitory problems, however. Libraries continue to survive despite it all, and their wealth of knowledge is at our disposal. There is nothing more fair or well deserved than extending to them our respectful salute.
