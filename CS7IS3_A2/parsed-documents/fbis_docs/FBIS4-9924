FBIS4-9924 "drlat065_n_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-065 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 Chile RN To Propose Anti-Corruption Bill RN To Propose Anti-Corruption Bill PY0404173594 Santiago Radio Cooperativa Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 4 Apr 94 PY0404173594 Santiago Radio Cooperativa Network Spanish BFN [Report by Claudio Pereda Madrid] [Text] The National Renewal [RN] party will be submitting to the Chamber of Deputies a draft bill that strives to avoid corruption at the civil servant level. This draft bill includes legal measures not in current Chilean law, such as influence peddling. The draft bill, which will be submitted in the next few days, also adds regulations to the law on bribery, expands measures regarding conflicts of interest, and adds measures on illegal exactions. The measures proposed by RN, which were disclosed by RN President Andres Allamand during a news conference, intend to punish officials or civil servants who seek to obtain profit for themselves or third parties through the illegal use of secrets or privileged information through influence peddling. According to Andres Allamand, influence peddling is the most common form of corruption at the civil servant level but it goes unpunished in Chilean law: [Begin Allamand recording] It must be noted that in the last 20 to 25 years, the majority of countries have held in-depth discussions to penalize influence peddling, which, I repeat, is not punished in Chile. [end recording] The draft bill also intends to punish bribery, not only when the action takes place, but also when it is offered. The law currently establishes that bribery is a crime only when the illegal payment is made. The draft bill also expands the list of people with whom government workers cannot negotiate, among whom are their business partners and direct relatives, such as spouses and direct ancestors or descendants. It also punishes public officials who are entitled to make any payments and who request a sum higher than what is established. The law currently punishes those who demand an additional payment but not when it is requested. [Begin Allamand recording] Consequently, we are building [words indistinct] introducing in Chile the legal measure of influence peddling, which currently is not included in Chilean law. We are perfecting the law on bribery by establishing the punishment I mentioned before: when the public official either requests it or it is offered. We also are expanding conflicts of interest and, last, we are perfecting the measures regarding illegal exactions. [end recording] Finally, Andres Allamand explained that the draft bill is completed by measures expediting the defense of public officials unjustly charged with the crimes included in the draft bill.
