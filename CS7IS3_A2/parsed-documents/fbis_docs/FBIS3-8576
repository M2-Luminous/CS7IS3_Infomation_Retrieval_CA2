"Accepting unanimously, that the Catholic Social Thought is an ideological foundation of further works, the group will seek to formulate theses and a political, social and economic programme for all who adhere to Christian, democratic ideals and the concept of social solidarity," the Programme Centre declaration reads. The new movement will not seek to become a party, and was born "out of concern resulting from the fact that elements of social justice are put to the back burner despite a government's shift to the left," Stelmachowski claimed. He argued that the ruling coalition has failed to present a concrete socio-political programme that would contain a clear vision for the future. The centre intends to cooperate with the Solidarity clubs and other socio-political groupings in formulating its programme. Representatives of the "Solidarity" Union Mazowsze Chapter, the New Polish Right (NPP), the Party of Polish Democracy (SDP), the Christian Democratic Centre (CCD), the Movement for the Republic of Poland (RDR) and former activists of the Centre Alliance (PC) have responded to Stelmachowski's invitation to join the centre.
