Therefore, the People's Army is firmly defending socialism of our own style at the most acute confrontation place of the revolution and antirevolution, and socialism and imperialism, and is vigorously advancing for the ultimate completion of the fatherland's reunification and the chuche revolutionary cause. Even amid the vortex of a complicated and severe situation as today, socialism of our own style is firmly standing deep in the core of the earth, and our party and the people are constructing socialism and communism with confidence. This is because they highly upheld the dear comrade leader, who strengthened and developed the People's Army into a one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary force, as the great commander at the helm. More than anything else, the dear comrade leader provided a programmatic guideline which must be firmly adhered to and advanced to strengthen and develop the People's Army into an ever-victorious and invincible revolutionary force. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il wholly elucidated the revolutionary essence, basic demand, and method of realizing the slogan of one-a-match-for-100 which was presented by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. Thus, he clearly clarified the road to strengthening the People's Army into a one-a-match-for-100. The dear comrade leader regulated that the basis in strengthening the People's Army into a one-a-match-for-100 is to prepare the soldiers well, and he also regulated that preparing the soldiers is in essence a political, ideological, military, technical, and physical preparation. A soldier is the most important element of military strength, and a decisive element of the armed struggle. Weapons are important in a war but the master using it are through and through the soldiers. The might of an army and victory or failure in a war are decided upon not by weapons but by men. When all soldiers are firmly prepared politically, ideologically, militarily, technically, and physically, can the army come to the fore as a group of fighters who move swiftly and as an ever-victorious and invincible revolutionary force that has an invincible commander who can cope with one-a- match-for-100. The dear comrade leader also modernized the armed equipment of the People's Army, and elucidated that making the military camp into an impregnable fortress is a fundamental demand in implementing the slogan of one-a-match-for-100. The armed equipment must through and through be developed in a chuche-oriented way in conformity with the situation of their country, must be highly modernized, and the military camp must be maintained into an impregnable fortress. As such, the dear comrade leader profoundly elucidated the revolutionary essence, basic demand, and method of realizing the militant slogan of one-a-match-for-100. Thus, a programmatic guideline which must be adhered to permanently was provided in strengthening the militant strength of the People's Army. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il also strengthened and developed the People's Army into an invincible party's army that is possessed with an absolutely perfect trait of an army of the leader, army of the party, and army of the people. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: Amid the arduous trials of the revolution, our People's Army was trained into an iron-willed rank which is firmly possessed with the party's unitary ideology system. Our party's greatest honor and pride is having the People's Army that resolutely advocates and defends the party and the leader and that implements to the end the party's order and instructions even through fire and water. In accordance with the new high demand of the development of our revolution and army construction, the dear comrade leader presented the program of modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea and intensified the work of establishing the party's unitary ideology system in the People's Army. With the presentation of the program of modeling the whole Army after the chuche idea and by thoroughly implementing it, our revolutionary force created by the great leader has been strengthened and developed into an army of the leader forever, and it has been possible for the People's Army to fulfill its lofty mission of firmly advocating and defending through arms the ultimate victory of the chuche cause under the leadership of the dear comrade leader. Today, a chuche-oriented leadership system in which the whole Army is moving as one person under the party's unitary leadership firmly stands within the People's Army, all the soldiers regard the slogan, "What the party decides, we will do," as their faith, they are willing to sacrifice their youth and lives if it is for the party and the leader, and they are living and struggling with the soldier spirit of jumping into water and fire if it is an order made by the party. Thus, the party and the Army are linked as one today and the People's Army has been strengthened and developed into the ever-victorious invincible army of the party which shares destiny with the party forever on the single road of revolution. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il also strengthened the military might of the People's Army in every way and thus fostered our revolutionary armed forces into a unrivaled strong army. The dear comrade leader, regarding intensification of combat training as a basic key to preparing the People's Army to be an one-match-for-a-100 army, energetically led so that soldiers are firmly prepared militarily, technically and physically through such training. The dear comrade leader put forward the five-point training policies and training principles, as well as basic demands and tasks that should be resolved in training, so that combat training is intensified. He saw to it that all soldiers thoroughly implement the party's training policy with chuche-oriented outlook on training and establish the trait of anti-Japanese guerrilla-style training and that a revolutionary turn is registered in combat training. By directing keen attention to the work pertaining to organization of training, the dear comrade leader had a thorough comprehension of the real condition in organization of training within the People's Army and a deep understanding of defects revealed from this condition. By establishing revolutionary measures, he saw to it that combat training is conducted in accordance with characteristics of each military branch and service and with the degree of soldiers' preparedness. Thus, he made combat training a course for soldiers to have practical knowledge useful for actual combat. With a view to enhancing the qualitative standard of combat training, the dear comrade leader saw to it that various mass movements, including the movement to win the red banner of three revolutions, are carried out in close combination with combat training. In particular, he led soldiers so that they can better make military and technical preparations, as well as physical preparation. Combat training has been vigorously carried out within the People's Army under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader. As the result, all soldiers came to have smart and sagacious tactics, master marksmanship and iron-clad physical strength. Thus, they became reliably prepared as one-a-match-for-100 fighters capable of smashing any strong enemy at a stroke. In addition to preparing soldiers to be one-a-match-for-100 fighters, the dear comrade leader wisely led the work of constantly modernizing arms and equipment and of fortifying the military encampment. The dear comrade leader put forward a wise policy for modernizing arms and equipment with our own strength and according to our practical situation, and energetically led so that the work is thoroughly implemented. The dear comrade leader saw to it that the might of arms and equipment of the People's Army is increased many more times by modernizing them with our own strength and in our own style, and in accordance with practical situation in our country. He put forward a profound plan to simultaneously upgrade onto a modern standard arms and equipment of not only one specific branch and service but also of all branches and services including the army, air force, navy, artillery, tanks corps, and communications branch. Thus, he carried out a bold operation that cannot be found in any history of the building of the military in the world nations. Under such a wise leadership by the dear comrade leader, our People's Army has been strengthened and developed into a powerful army equipped with modern arms and equipment. Military delegations from foreign countries, who attended the military parade held to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the KPA, were struck with admiration for the fact that the People's Army is equipped with ultramodern weapons and all arms and equipment were domestic products. Head of a foreign military delegation said with admiration that even with armed forces mobilized in the military parade, one can carry out a large-scale war and win victory. The dear comrade leader also wisely led the work of fortification of military encampment. The dear comrade leader saw to it that the work of fortification of military encampment is carried out not only as the work of the People's Army but also as that of entire party, the whole nation and all the people. Besides, he saw to it that the whole nation is firmly fortified so that manpower and firing positions not only in frontline area but also every place throughout the country can be reliably protected from any modern firing means and that any enemy who may sneak in with superior forces be smashed in all places in a one-a-match-for-100 manner. As the result of this, all soldiers of the People's Army have been firmly prepared militarily, technically and physically; arms and equipment have been modernized at a high level, and military encampment has been fortified. Thus, the People's Army has been fostered to be an unrivaled indomitable army. All this is attributable to the fact that the People's Army is upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at its van as the great sagacious commander. Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader, our People's Army has been strengthened and developed into one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary army with traits as the army of the leader, of the party and of the people both in name and reality and with indomitable military power. As the result, a reliable guarantee is provided for firmly defending our-style socialism and for expediting the historic cause of national reunification. Indeed, by upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as supreme commander of the KPA and as chairman of the nation's Defense Commission, our People's Army today has been strengthened and developed into invincible ever-victorious revolutionary armed forces.
