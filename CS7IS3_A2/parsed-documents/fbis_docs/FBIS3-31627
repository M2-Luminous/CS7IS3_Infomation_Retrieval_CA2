[Martic] I would say that a great political wisdom was shown here, particularly by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and certainly by Dr. Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic. In a very positive way, NATO forces found themselves in a situation in which the unpopular idea of bombing was simply avoided. I also have to say that all of us here were somewhat positively surprised by Russia's diplomacy, but when one observes the entire picture, we must say that this was the last bandwagon Russia jumped on; it came to grips with other diplomatic circles in the world.
