Simko entered politics as a member of the KDH, which now again becomes a government party, and which he co-founded in early 1990. His post-November political activity was preceded by numerous activities under the communist regime (toppled in November 1989). During his studies in Bratislava, Simko, along with local Catholic circles, helped establish Christian-oriented communities of young people. Ivan Simko, doctor of law, was born on January 1, 1955 in Bratislava. In the late 1970s he graduated from Bratislava's School of Economics. He was shortly employed in economic research, later worked in the Department of Bratislava's Chief Architect. In the mid-1980s he studied, without leaving his job, at the Law School of Bratislava Comenius University, from which he graduated in 1987. In January 1990, he was invited by Jan Carnogursky, then deputy prime minister of the new Czechoslovak Government, to work in his secretariat, where he stayed until the first free elections in June 1990. He was elected a deputy to the House of the People of the then Federal Assembly. He headed the Parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, and was a member of the Assembly's Presidium. He held the deputy's post until the next elections in June 1992. In 1991 he was elected as Czechoslovakia's representative to the European Parliament. A few months before the June 1992 elections, the KDH proposed Simko to the vacant post of Slovak justice minister. Between March and July 1993, he was deputy chairman of the Legislative Council of the Slovak parliament. Since late 1992, when the Federal Assembly terminated its operation (in connection with the split of Czechoslovakia into two independent republics), Simko, a member of the KDH leadership, has been working for the KDH. At the 5th KDH congress in September 1992, he was elected a party's deputy chairman.
