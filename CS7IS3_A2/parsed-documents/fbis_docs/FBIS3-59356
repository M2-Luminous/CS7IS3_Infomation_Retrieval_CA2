Too high inflation has a destructive impact on the normal growth of a national economy. While the formative mechanisms in China's inflation of recent years are complex, an analysis of their mutual impact constitutes the basic analytical framework for and policy thinking on inflation. Since the beginning of 1993, sustained strong demand has pulled and supported hyper economic expansion, gradually becoming a key factor in the new round of runaway inflation. This should arouse our full attention. I. The Basic Current State of Market Prices: Moderate Inflation Since the beginning of 1993, as our national economy has continued to grow at a high rate, while our pace of conversion of price formation mechanisms has accelerated, potential inflationary pressures have been released faster, with market prices showing a strong upward momemtum. Having topped 10 percent for the first half, our inflation rate for 1993 will undoubtedly reach double digits at that rate, with it already being a foregone conclusion that it will exceed the planned controlled-price index of 6 percent, to make 1993 our inflation peak since 1988. Our key current inflation features are: 1. Inflationary energies are being released faster, with all categories of prices on a clear upward trend. Under the dual impact of price-reform policy results and rapid growth in public demand, our market prices in 1993 are in a state of all-out rapid increase, with particularly sharp rises in the prices of capital goods and labor. For the first five months, purchase prices were up 31 percent from the same period in 1992 for energy and raw materials, 11.2 percent for agricultural capital goods, 27.2 percent for service projects, and sharply also for capital and foreign exchange. From an urban and rural perspective, while urban prices sustained high increases, rural prices were also in a clearly rising state. For the first five months, our national cost-of-living price was up 12 percent from the same period in 1992, including rises of 12.8 percent for cities and towns (16.7 percent for the 35 large- and medium-sized cities), 11.3 percent for rural areas (with rural wholesale and cost-of-living prices both higher that those for cities in May), and 10.2 percent for national retail prices. 2. Retail prices, on the heels of their higher base for the fourth quarter of 1992, have shown a monthly upward momentum. In comparison to the same months in 1992, they were up 8.4 percent for January, 8.7 percent for February, 10.2 percent for March, 10.9 percent for April, and 12.5 percent for May, with retail price rises averaging 10.2 percent for the first five months, and estimated to have risen 10.5 percent for the first half, for an increase close to or exceeding that for the first half of 1988, showing the beginnings of a new price-rise peak period. In 1993 in particular, cost-of-living prices in our 35 large- and medium-sized cities have grown monthly in comparison to the same months in 1992, being up 14.7 percent for January, 15.3 percent for February, 17 percent for both March and April, 19.5 percent for May, and 21.6 percent for June, for an average of 17.4 percent for the first half (including 14.7 percent for consumer goods and 38.9 percent for service projects), with the first-half rise being higher than the 14.5 percent for the same period in 1988, to make 1993 our highest price-rise peak since 1990. 3. As to our price-change structure, the lagging impact of 1992 price rises made up about one-third. In 1992, the state and localities speeded up their pace of reform, raising grain buying and selling prices, adjusting prices of capital goods, such as railway freight, coal, and natural gas, and devolving pricing jurisdiction or deregulating prices on a large scale, which further expanded the market price-regulation percentage. It is estimated that 3.3 points of the market retail price rise for the first five months of 1993 were due to the lagging impact of 1992 prices, which impact was nearly one-third, while new price-rise factors in 1993 (including spontaneous rises and structural adjustments) made up the other two-thirds. As to our price-change regional structure, rural retail price rises were close to those for cities and towns, with particularly high price increases in our 35 large- and medium-sized cities. Comparing the first five months of 1993 to the same period in 1992, rural retail prices were up 9.9 percent, only 0.6 points lower than the urban retail price rise (10.5 percent), including April and May when retail prices rose even more in the rural areas than in the cities. This was due mainly to the lagging impact of the successive upward adjustments in recent years by the state of energy, fuel, and oils and foodstuffs prices showing up gradually on rural markets. It is predicted that for 1993, retail price rises may be higher in the rural areas than in cities and towns. 4. As to the commodities driving price change, price changes were larger mainly for ones, such as grain, building materials, fuels, agricultural capital goods, and service projects. A) The deregulation of grain prices, pushing up food prices, has also become a key factor in the high retail-price rises. Comparing the first five months of 1993 to the same period in 1992, retail food prices were up 10.4 percent, including a retail price rise of 27.9 percent for grain, which one item alone caused 1.9 points of the retail price rise, meaning that about 20 percent of the impact came from the grain price-rise factor, and a retail price rise of 8.7 percent for nonstaple foods (including 1.6 percent for fresh vegetables, 10 percent for meat, poultry, and eggs, and 13 percent for aquatic products). As to manufactured consumer goods, a comparison of the first five months of 1993 to the same period in 1992 shows retail prices up 39.7 percent for fuels and 25.9 percent for construction and decoration materials, with these two items having a joint impact on retail price rises of 2.9 points, or as much as one-fourth. Various other commodity retail prices were respectively up 4.3 percent for clothing, 3.7 percent for everyday commodities, 5.4 percent for books, newspapers, and magazines, and 9.7 percent for drugs and medical articles, but down 1.1 percent for cultural and recreational articles. B) Agricultural capital goods prices are up sharply. Comparing the first five months of 1993 to the same period in 1992, agricultural capital goods retail prices were up 11.2 percent, causing 1.3 points of the retail price rise. This includes prices up from the same period in 1992 by 8.8 percent for chemical fertilizer, 46.7 percent for farm-machinery gasoline, and 2.6 percent for agricultural plastic film, but down 2.3 percent for pesticides. This was due mainly to the greater impact of new price-rise factors in 1993. The monthly comparative indexes for the first five months were respectively 102.5, 103.3, 104.3, 102.5, and 101.6. An analysis of the year's trends shows agricultural capital goods prices were impacted by higher costs and expenses in the production and marketing links, with the rises likely to grow still further. C) Service price rises are growing steadily. Service price rises have been in double digits ever since August 1992, with a comparison of the first five months of 1993 to the same period in 1992 showing service prices up 27.2 percent (for January through May respectively 22.9 percent, 25.9 percent, 28 percent, 29.3 percent, and 29.9 percent), exceeding 1988's 16.2 percent and 1989's 23.9 percent, and causing 3.1 points of the cost-of-living price rise. This was due mainly to all areas generally raising train and long-distance-bus ticket prices, as well as deregulating or adjusting prices for items, such as telegrams, tuition and miscellaneous expenses, child-care charges, bathhouse, rest home, and park admission tickets, and movie tickets. II. The Immediate Impact of Inflationary Pressures on the Economy: A Further Analysis and Forecast While China's economy has maintained a high growth rate since the beginning of the 1980s, with our GDP growing at an average rate of 8.9 percent a year, including a high of 11.5 percent from 1984 to 1988, our rapid economic growth has been accompanied by progressive price rises, with the high inflation accompanying the rapid economic growth in 1988 in particular being a direct factor that forced the improvement and rectification campaign. As higher economic growth rates usually are accompanied by higher inflation, with the two showing a feature of changing in the same direction, which has been proved in both domestic and overseas economic practice, the period of high growth that our economy entered in 1992 due to rapid investment growth has steadily raised the attention of those in all walks of life toward the inflation problem, with some in both theoretical circles and actual working departments continuously calling for vigilance against an inflationary rebound, and anti-inflation also remaining a key item in macroeconomic monitoring and government macroeconomic regulation and control. We hold that there now exist both factors that are sharpening inflationary pressures, as well as ones that are curbing and easing inflation. At present, the latter factors are weakening in impact, while the former ones are growing. In light of the market price-rise features and factors manifested in the first half, which are similar to those in 1988, we predict that it will be hard to curb the price rise momentum in the second half, for which our key grounds are: 1. Increasing public demand will strengthen the [upward] pull on market prices. As demand-driven inflation has a lag period, such inflation shows up first in higher capital goods prices. As to our current capital goods price changes, the upward momentum still shows no clear signs of containment. This means that for enterprises with currently weak consumption capability, higher basic product prices will eventually result in retail market prices rising correspondingly. And investment, after a certain lag period, will generally be 40-percent converted to consumption funds. While such conversion is certainly not evident in today's market, it will be reflected somewhat on markets as time passes. Then it will spur consumer demand to faster growth, increasing market demand pressure, to turn the upward pull on market prices from a possibility into a reality. On the other hand, our money supply is now obviously growing faster than our economy. Due to the changes in our overall assets-liability items in particular, there is still great pressure to put money into circulation. While our GDP grew 13.9 percent in the last half, our current M<inf> 0</inf> is growing at a high rate of more than 50 percent, with our M<inf> 0</inf> demand elasticity nearing 4 (and our M<inf> 1</inf> and M<inf> 2</inf> demand elasticity coefficients also similar), much higher than the normal value of 1.5-2, and higher even than 1992's 3. 2. The gradual conversion to market-oriented price-formation mechanisms will further strengthen spontaneous price-rise factors. China is now in a stage of conversion to markets, requiring rationalization of longstanding too- low basic product prices, which is inevitably accompanied by a high price-rise period. In particular, as tertiary industries further expand, the trend of higher labor prices will grow more evident. And in the current state of our still imperfect market system and relatively weak price-control oversight, spontaneous commodity price rises will be unavoidable. The last few months of market price changes show that spontaneous price-rise factors are growing steadily. On the other hand, cost-driven pressures are continuing to grow. As intermediate investment product demand is up, in addition to the larger change in capital goods prices, prices are clearly rising. In the first quarter, our national manufactured goods factory-price index rose about 18 percent, while the comparable product costs of budgeted state-owned industrial enterprises rose 11.1 percent. Based on monitoring by our commodity sector, our key commodity market prices are now all in a general upswing, with some commodity prices rising sharply, to exceed international market prices. In the first quarter of 1993, our commodity system's capital goods prices, on the heels of 1992's higher price base, continued to rise 38.2 percent. Meanwhile, the price rises are still continuing to grow in scope, with the larger increases being mainly for items, such as rolled steel, lumber, cement, machinery and electronic products, and motor vehicles, which merits attention. 3. The follow-up impact of higher business taxes will gradually show up. In May, the state raised the commodity retail business-tax rate from 3 percent to 5 percent. The projection is that if the retail sector (business) incorporates all of the higher business tax into sale commodity prices, this will push 1993's retail commodity prices up about 1.3 points. All areas report that the increase in the business tax has pushed market prices up 3-5 percent, or more than the business-tax increase itself. In addition, some regions have delayed putting the new business tax into effect, which will be bound to increase the retail market price rise for the last half. 4. GATT membership will impact China's market prices. Once we rejoin the GATT, China's prices will get on track with those on international markets, which will inevitably tend to raise our price levels. On the other hand, along with foreign-exchange system-reform, the force of lower exchange rates to encourage exports and curb imports will strengthen, with higher purchase prices for export commodities pulling up similar domestic commodity prices to a certain extent. In particular, since the last half of 1992, our market foreign-exchange conversion price has seen a sharp increase. Our foreign-exchange quota conversion price per U.S. dollar was 0.45 yuan at the beginning of 1992, up to 1.74 yuan by the end of 1992, over the 2-yuan mark for the first quarter of 1993, up to 5 yuan by the second quarter, and above 10 yuan by the end of June, even higher than 11 yuan on some black markets. While the effects of our macroeconomic regulation and control policy have brought certain new changes since July, there is still quite a large gap between this [market]-conversion price and our official exchange rate. An analysis of the historical data and China's current sustainability in all areas shows that in China, price rises constitute low inflation at 4-8 percent, moderate inflation at 9-14 percent, severe inflation at 15-18 percent, and runaway inflation when over 18 percent, meaning that 1993 will be a year of moderate inflation. But as our current material base and public psychological and economic sustainability are much stronger than in 1988, short of an abrupt change, we will not see the sharp panic-buying and social unrest of 1988, for which our grounds are: 1. From the perspective of the economic growth in all countries throughout the world, price rises due to inadequate infrastructures and raw material shortages are a normal market-economy phenomenon, as well as the price that China must pay for reform and getting onto track with international prices. China's current order of too low basic product prices with higher manufactured goods prices has not yet been basically reversed. As we make the conversion from a planned to a market economy, the products formerly regulated and controlled by the state will enter markets, bringing quite glaring conflicts between supply and demand. When our old administrative regulation and control means have lost effectiveness, while the new market restraint forces have not yet been genuinely established, the market-driven operations will inevitably touch off price rises. On the other hand, China's GATT membership will also require us to speed up our pace of price-mechanism conversion, spurring China's pricing system to shift to an international orientation. This will require us to sharply raise our basic product prices to keep them from flowing on a large scale to overseas markets, which would exacerbate our supply shortage of domestic market-resource products. 2. From the angle of China's economic-system reform experience, during periods of high economic growth, price structural adjustment is bound to cause price rises. In China's current economic system, high economic growth relies mainly on the drive of high investment and industrial production growth. Generally speaking, a high-growth economy cannot be founded on the basis of price stability, but rather needs prices to be adjusted and stimulated through constant change. Or it could be said that a certain amount of inflation is a hard-to-avoid price for economic growth. 3. As to overall supply and demand balance, our supply and demand differential for the first half of 1993 was only 6.1 percent, lower than the normal level of 10 percent. But this demand exceeding supply was seen mainly in staple capital goods, while the opposite order of supply exceeding demand on consumer goods markets had not yet changed. As to the supply and demand order of over 700 staple manufactured consumer goods for the first half of 1993, commodities for which supply exceeded demand or where supply and demand were in balance made up 90 percent. In addition, our improved agricultural situation in 1993 gives our market a solid foundation. But in 1988, supply and demand were severely out of balance, with demand 7.7 percent higher than supply, far exceeding the normal 5 percent, and the gap of demand exceeding supply being larger mainly for consumer goods. 4. As individual income is growing more than prices are rising, economic sustainability is up. Comparing the first half of 1993 to the same period in 1992, urban residents' monthly income for living costs was estimated to be 186 yuan, up 27.9 percent from the same period in 1992 and, corrected for inflation, up a real 13.8 percent (which figure was up only 2 percent for the first half of 1988, and down 3 percent for the first half of 1989). 5. Political and social stability are maturing the consumer mindset. As consumer demand is now diversified, with no new consumer fever yet formed, and consumer mindset matured, unchecked competitive consumption out of line with incomes is now extremely rare. Urban and rural savings deposits, under sharp attack by a great wave of all types of bonds, stocks, and public fundraising, still showed a balance of 1.2789 trillion yuan by the end of June, up 124.3 billion yuan from the beginning of the year. While panic buying was experienced by some some areas in 1993, it was focused mainly on items, such as gold jewelry, foreign currencies, and imported and domestic brand-name household electronics and expensive wool textiles, lasting for a shorter time. But the panic buying in 1988 was on a large national scale, involving commodities all the way from refrigerators and color TVs to needles and thread, as well as lasting considerably longer. In addition, through 14 years of market-oriented reform, China's economic climate and growth mechanisms have undergone great changes, so that our inflation-formation mechanisms and manifestations are correspondingly somewhat different than in the past, which point also needs attention when we analyze current price conditions and future trends. We hold that there now exist both factors that would set off inflation, such as rapid economic growth, sharply higher fixed assets investment, new loans and currency put into circulation far exceeding our economic growth rate, and rising product costs, as well as ones that would curb too fast price rises. So our real price changes are the result of the contest between these two factors, with the ones that would touch off rapid price rises now temporarily having the upper hand. So as to our current price rises, we should neither be panic-stricken or lower our guard, but rather should tighten our macroeconomic regulation and control, by taking the right steps to keep price rises from exceeding the warning line. As to our economic operating trends for the last half, the choice of regulation and control targets gives us two possibilities: 1) We could take forceful regulation and control steps for an overall retrenchment, to provide an overlapping of policy effects and economic cyclical impact, which might quickly bring our economy from the "red-light zone" into a sharp decline, for a great fluctuation; 2) or we could apply moderate fine-tuning to sharply strengthen our structural adjustment, in which case our economy might make a soft landing from the "red-light zone" onto a basically normal operating field (the "yellow-light zone"). Our analytical projection is based on the second possibility. As to the various factors impacting our second-half economic growth, the favorable aspects are: 1) the second-half is driven by a high-speed economic growth momentum; 2) the market-regulation impact is stronger; 3) comsumer goods market sources are abundant, with supply greater than demand as before, and public purchasing mindset basically stable; 4) incomes are growing more than prices are rising, bringing somewhat greater reform sustainability; 5) while our economic operations are subject to many problems meriting attention, they are generally still within the limits of possible macroeconomic regulation and control, with previous adjustment experience and lessons that can be drawn on. The unfavorable aspects are mainly that our current management system has too many links to be efficient, and that all macroeconomic fine-tuning steps are subject to too long of a time-lag, which might further exacerbate the various currently existing conflicts and problems. In addition, our regional and industrial growth is uneven, with all interested parties not having a consistent understanding of conditions, adding to macroeconomic regulation and control difficulties. Based on an overall analysis of the abovementioned conditions, premised on taking fine-tuning steps, and short of the unexpected, our key 1993 economic growth indexes will end up in the following manner: -- Our economy will maintain its high growth. Our 1993 GDP is predicted to reach about 3 trillion yuan, up around 12 percent from 1992. -- Our industrial growth priorities will be heavy, coastal, and nonstate industries. Affected by "bottleneck" restraints and 1992's large bases, our second-half industrial production rate will recede somewhat. Our 1993 GVIO is predicted to top 4 trillion yuan, up about 22 percent, including heavy industry up approximately 23 percent, and light industry up around 21 percent. -- Our agriculture will expand steadily. While our 1993 GVAO is predicted to grow about 4 percent, our grain, cotton, oilseed, and sugar output will be down to varying degrees, with our livestock and aquatic breeding industries continuing to maintain their growth momentum. -- Our investment will grow rapidly. Fund shortages in the last half may make the growth decline. Our 1993 overall fixed assets investment is predicted to reach nearly 1 trillion yuan, up about 40 percent from 1992 and, corrected for inflation, for real working growth of around 20 percent. -- Our domestic market sales order will be rapid growth of investment products and acclerated growth of consumer goods. Our 1993 retail commodity sales turnover is predicted to reach about 1.35 trillion yuan, up around 21 percent, with our capital goods sales turnover growing more than 40 percent. -- It will remain hard to change our foreign trade order of high import growth and low export growth. Our 1993 exports are predicted to amount to $92 billion, up about 8 percent, while our imports will top $100 billion, for growth of approximately 25 percent. Our national cash reserves will be below the $20 billion mark. -- While our national credit scope is expected to be basically controlled, a lot of currency will be put into circulation. It is predicted that while our 1993 new bank loans will amount to approximately 410 billion yuan, our currency issue is likely to reach nearly 165 billion yuan. -- Our urban and rural individual income growth will be in a state of "one fast, one slow." It is predicted that our 1993 urban resident cost-of-living income will average 2,300 yuan, for real growth of about 11 percent corrected for inflation, while our rural individual net income will average around 870 yuan, for growth of approximately 3 percent corrected for inflation.
