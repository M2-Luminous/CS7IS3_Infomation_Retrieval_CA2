This is the view shared by chief representatives of Beijing offices of nearly 20 foreign companies and heads of Sino-foreign joint ventures. They said in a recent interview with XINHUA reporters that China's legislation in the economic sector had been much improved. Statistics show that the Seventh National People's Congress [NPC] and its Standing Committee had passed 87 laws during its five-year term from 1989 to 1993, one fourth of which were on foreign investment in China, and last year, 15 of the 20 laws adopted by the Eighth NPC Standing Committee concerned the economy. They also said that China attached great importance to protecting interests of foreign companies with laws and regulations. Among the adopted laws, the Law of Sino-Foreign Cooperative Enterprises and Maritime Law of the People's Republic of China (PRC) are concerned with foreign companies' businesses in China, and a chapter of the corporate law was made specifically for foreign companies. Besides, Law on the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, Income Tax Law for Enterprises With Foreign Investments and Foreign Enterprises also defined rights and obligations of foreign companies in China, which are welcomed by foreign entrepreneurs and bankers. Chun Song-chin, chief representative of the Beijing office of the Lucky-Goldstar International Corporation from the Republic of Korea, said that although China's legislative system needs to be further improved, the adoption of so many laws in such a short time is indeed an "amazing progress." According to him, China has approved over 70,000 foreign-funded companies last year, which account for half of the number China has approved in the last 15 years. Many trans-national groups have come to China in recent years, he said, adding that foreigners have begun pursuing long-term development in China, rather than seeking short-term benefit as most of them did before. Chun attributed this not only to the social stability, and the more open market, but also the improving legislation which makes foreigners feel safer in investing here. Dick Liu, president of the Du Pont China Company, said that it is obvious that Chinese laws can protect foreign companies in China. The patent law China passed in 1984 did not protect the patent of chemical products, he said. However, the new patent law put into operation in 1993 has included the protection of chemical products and agricultural chemicals. Thus the interests of foreign chemical enterprises like Du Pont will be further protected, he said. Takeshi Kagami, the chief representative of the Beijing office of the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, expressed his hope that the Law on Commercial Banks, Law on the Central Bank, insurance law and the law of bills which are being prepared will be passed at an early date. He said that he was confident that these coming laws will define clearly business spheres and status of foreign banks in China, and create better financial conditions for the development of foreign enterprises. Klaus Kaltenthaler, chief Beijing representative of Germany's BASF Chemical Corporation, pointed out that as an international corporation with branches all over the world, one of his company's rules is to abide by laws of countries where its branches are located. "So we are eager to know every law China has just passed," he said. "We hope that China could publish the English version of the laws as early as possible." H. T. Kun, director of the public relations department of the AT&T China Company, said that his company had established a special department to study the Chinese laws, and many other overseas business offices also do so.
