The presidents of Kajima Corp., Taisei Corp. and Shimizu Corp. gave the pledge to the ministry by the end of January, the sources said. The three leading contractors have also started personnel changes as part of their efforts to prove their commitment to the pledge, the sources said. A series of recent bribery scandals involving the nation's construction industry has led to the arrest of a number of senior executives of building firms, including former Kajima Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama. Kiyoyama, who was indicted on charges of giving a 20 million yen bribe to former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi, was reportedly at the center of collusive bidding involving major contractors. On January 25, Taisei decided at a meeting of its executive board to transfer Kanji Hayama from the post of sales manager to a position in charge of technology. The sources said Taisei's sales manager was previously often involved in dealing with other companies about price-fixing arrangements. Shimizu, meanwhile, decided on January 28 on large-scale personnel changes and organizational reform for strengthening its inspection system, while Kajima is expected to decide personnel changes by the middle of this month, the sources said. The moves come as the Construction Ministry plans to introduce a new open bidding system for public works projects in April.
