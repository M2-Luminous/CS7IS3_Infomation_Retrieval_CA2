The character of the speeches is not in doubt: The former vice president has launched an energetic campaign to win votes in the future presidential election. He is doing so, moreover, in the provinces, which to a large extent will determine the outcome. The former vice president now states in plain terms only one or, to be more precise, two interrelated goals: Repealing the current Constitution and holding an early election. He has said not a single word about any intention on his part to run when the time comes, but that does not, of course, mean that there is no such intention. That intention is clear in every word uttered by the garrulous orator, who adroitly brought the audience at the Khimvolokno joint-stock company's culture complex around to the idea that no better "savior of Russia" than he is to be found. And he did so by the method of negation, so to speak. It was a rare politician who did not get a mention in his impassioned monologue, and it turns out that there is indeed no one worthier than Aleksandr Vladimir in Russia. Scathing, off-the-cuff descriptions were dished out right and left. There was no need to say anything even about our currently thriving president or the "Yeltsin gang" -- for them there is only "one route, the route to the cells." Viktor Chernomyrdin, the "presidential appointee," repeats over and over his favorite saying "let's work, let's work," but does nothing. The former vice president's vocabulary has become substantially richer of late as regards the democratic reformers. Many newer descriptions have appeared to supplement widely known ones such as the "kids in pink pants". For example, the minister for nationalities questions is suspect because he "only learned to blow his nose five years ago." And how, the orator asked, "was it possible to entrust the economy to someone who has never held anything except a spoon, a fountain-pen, and perhaps one other thing in his hands?!" Guess who? Roughly the same was said of representatives of the various shades of opposition. The name "Travkin-Murkin" (my apologies, I merely quote -- V.Ch.) is reinforced by the image of a weathercock. Ivan Rybkin "has trimmed to fit the mold." While Gennadiy Zyuganov is blameworthy because Rutskoy saw him on TV on 2 October last urging the population to refrain from demonstrations or other dangerous acts. And so it went on. I apologize to all the people mentioned here for citing these coarse insults. I do so only because readers and voters should know what language our head of state will be using with Russia and the rest of the world if Rutskoy fills that role. And the fear does exist, after all, that he could. At any rate, it should not be discounted. The "democratic" language of the barrack room, spiced with populist views on politics and the economy, falls on fertile soil and does go down well, you know. At the Khimvolokno joint-stock company's culture complex, the hall, designed to hold 700 people, accommodated at least twice that number, and thousands were left outside to listen through loudspeakers. It would be bad enough if they had simply listened and formed critical judgments, but they excitedly applauded passages in Rutskoy's speech.... Clearly, aware himself of a certain similarity, Aleksandr Vladimirovich deemed it necessary to stress his difference from Zhirinovskiy, and he did this, of course, in his own inimitable way: "You mustn't bamboozle people as Vladimir Volfovich does; I have told him repeatedly: Cool it, man, cool it!" Of course, Rutskoy acts much more subtly and adroitly than Zhirinovskiy. On the whole his speech produced a perfectly seemly impression. Everything looks as if it is dictated by great concern for the country's future and for the people and is emotional only for that reason. And even the coarse language that spilled off Aleksandr Vladimirovich's lips caused a hum of approval: Everyone understood that he spoke from the heart -- the disgraceful things going on around us are more than a person can endure! Moreover, it turns out that this person is simple and down to earth. Great doubt arises, however, as to whether there is a fundamental difference between the "concepts" of Rutskoy and those of Zhirinovskiy. True, Aleksandr Vladimirovich did repeatedly stress that order in the country must be introduced by "economic methods." But here he recalled with manifest pleasure a little scene espied in Singapore: Right in front of him policemen were using bamboo sticks to administer a lesson to an offender who had discarded a cigarette stub or spat in the street.... But all this finds a broad and very vigorous response in conditions where local authorities demonstrate a staggering lack of will in pursuing reforms; where representatives of the authorities actually steal everything that is not nailed down by the state and create nothing at all for the common good; and where in the last oblast Duma elections the heads of administration roughly elbowed aside all candidates capable of bringing into local lawmaking the interests of other social groups and strata, have since impoverished local lawmaking to the maximum extent, and now hold sessions without even letting representatives of the press in. These are the conditions in which leaders like Rutskoy are snatching success. It is certainly time for politicians -- major and minor -- to open their eyes and realize that it will not be only the capital voting in the forthcoming presidential election. If things do not change very quickly in the provinces, then (God forbid!) the prophecy of a great cataclysm in Russia will come to pass. And that cataclysm will come not from the East but from places like Kursk or Voronezh. At any rate, that is the way it looks today to your observer from the provinces.
