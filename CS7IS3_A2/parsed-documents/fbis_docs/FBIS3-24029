Disheveled, with its pockets turned inside out. This time the economy was speaking through the voice of Valentin Kolomiyev, acting chairman of the Ukrgaz Production Association. Consider for example the following: Last year the production association purchased gas in Russia valued at 2 trillion Russian rubles, but it paid for 466 billion, including 166 billion on Russian technical credit. In the meantime every kopeck of the R1.2 billion obtained for transit handling of gas across Ukrainian territory was used to reduce the price of natural gas in the domestic market. Up until May inclusively, as an example, Ukrgaz purchased a thousand cubic meters at a cost of 15,600 in the karbovanets equivalent, while selling it to consumers at 6,810 karbovantsy. It was in this way that the debt was multiplied and the prices of products of chemical, metallurgical and other sectors of the national economy, which are already becoming noncompetitive in the foreign market, were regulated. First one prime minister and then another told us that there was nothing to fear; still, the socioeconomic situation is being monitored, though industry is not striking. It became clear as early as at the beginning of this year that a strike is not necessary for a work stoppage to occur. Price inflation has become the cause of financial paralysis. But we are reassured once again: There is nothing to fear, such a financial crisis can be seen in other states of the former Union as well. You're trying to pull the wool over our eyes, folks, because there's nothing in common between these two cases. It was revealed at this same meeting of the board of the State Committee for Oil and Gas that an ultimatum was in fact sent to acting Prime Minister Ye. Zvyagilskiy in a telegram from Turkmenistan. It threatened cessation of natural gas deliveries to Ukraine as of 21 February if it continues to evade payment of its debts for last year and this year. Last year's debt is not less than $500 million U.S., while this year's debt consists of penalties for late payments, as per the signed contract. In the words of V. Kolomiyev, in January his department should have paid $284 million for gas. But where was he to get the money? The $18.4 million obtained through the stock exchange and tender committee were only enough to pay the penalties for 1 month. In other words Ukraine is reaping its harvest from the fields of currency regulation: What you sow is what you reap. And the wretchedness of the currency harvest, which is something we need for foreign economic activity, distinguishes our financial crisis from the others. A hastily created government commission took on the task of leading the industry out of its crisis of payments, while Yefim Leonidovich Zvyagilskiy was tasked to settle things with Turkmenistan. This by the way will not have any effect on the cost of gas this year. If it does grow more expensive, it will do so only insignificantly. And the Ukrgaz Production Association probably shouldn't count on the enterprises immediately fulfilling government decree No 23 on settling natural gas accounts in hard currency and Russian rubles. It seems as if the Ministry of the Economy feels that cheap gas means an inexpensive life, but it has no idea of what a cheap policy can bring. By the way, Turkmenistan's ultimatum carried the threat that a contract with Ukraine for 28 billion cubic meters would be broken. Ukraine naturally isn't pleased. And as it became known, it sat down at the negotiating table with Turkmenistan, offering to pay its debt off with wheat. But it is now understood even by people who aren't economists that there will never be enough wheat to pay off the debts. What we need to do is improve the system of currency regulation, and the loan and financial policy. It appears that the National Bank, which offered to employ market distribution of credit resources and hard currency this week, was the first to realize this. And it promised creditors a new weapon with which to fight debtors--the promissory note.
