Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), told a news conference it is not easy to carry out corporate reorganization without reducing jobs in view of the serious business environment caused by the strong yen. He said employers have so far done their best to prevent an increase of unemployment. The strong yen has caused a serious impact on corporate performance, particularly in the raw materials industry, he said. Nagano expressed hope that the dollar will rise to around 105 yen.
