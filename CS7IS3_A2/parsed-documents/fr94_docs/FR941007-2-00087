FR941007-2-00087 FR941007-2-00053 [CA&hyph;940&hyph;1430&hyph;01; CACA&hyph;24047] Proposed Extension of Withdrawal; Opportunity for Public Meeting; California AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Land Management proposes to extend Public Land Order No. 6763, which withdrew public lands and public minerals for protection of Sea Site I, a highly classified, sensitive, electronic warfare installation at the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake, pending the processing of an Engle Act withdrawal application. The land has been and will remain open to mineral leasing. DATES: Comments and requests for a public meeting must be received by January 5, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments and requests for a public meeting should be sent to the California State Director, Bureau of Land Management (CA&hyph;943.1), Room E&hyph;2845, 2800 Cottage Way, Sacramento, California 95825&hyph;1889. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Duane Marti, BLM California State Office (CA&hyph;943.1), Room E&hyph;2845, 2800 Cottage Way, Sacramento, California 95825&hyph;1889; 916&hyph;978&hyph;4820. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 12, 1990, Public Land Order No. 6763 withdrew public lands and public minerals from operation of the public land laws, including the mining laws, for five years to protect Sea Site I, a highly classified, sensitive, electronic warfare installation at the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake, California, pending the processing of an Engle Act withdrawal application. The land has been and will remain open to mineral leasing. This withdrawal exceeds the 5,000 acre limitation and requires legislation under the Engle Act. This legislation has not yet been approved and the segregation provided by the five year withdrawal will terminate on January 11, 1995. It is proposed that Public Land Order No. 6763 be extended for five years to continue the segregation provided by this withdrawal. The following described public lands were withdrawn by Public Land Order No. 6763 to protect Sea Site I: Mount Diablo Meridian T. 27 S., R. 43 E., Secs. 31 to 34, inclusive. T. 28 S., R. 43 E., Secs. 4 to 9, inclusive; Secs. 17 and 18; Sec. 19, N1/2N1/2N1/2. The area described contains 7,760 acres in San Bernardino County. The purpose of this proposed extension is to continue the protection of Sea Site I until Congress makes a final determination on legislation under the Engle Act. Until January 5, 1995, all persons who wish to submit comments, suggestions, or objections in connection with the proposed extension may present their views in writing to the California State Director of the Bureau of Land Management. Notice is hereby given that an opportunity for a public meeting is accorded in connection with the proposed extension. Public meetings were held in Ridgecrest, California on February 6 and 16, 1984, and in Lancaster, California on November 15 and 16, 1984 concerning the Navy's application to withdraw Sea Site I. There have been no substantive changes in either the proposed use of the withdrawn area or the issues involved since these meetings were held. Any parties who feel that a public meeting would provide important information and should be held, must submit their request and reasons therefore to the California State Director by January 5, 1995. If the authorized officer determines that a public meeting will be held, a notice of the time and place will be published in the Federal Register at least 30 days prior to the scheduled date of the meeting. This proposed extension will be processed in accordance with the regulations set forth in 43 CFR part 2310. The proposed extension of this withdrawal will not authorize any military use of the lands by the Department of the Navy until legislation under the Engle Act is enacted by Congress. Dated: September 30, 1994. Nancy J. Alex, Chief, Lands Section. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24850 Filed 10&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;40&hyph;P
