While the meeting of the two foreign ministers focused mainly on the nuclear question on the Korean peninsula, Japan also condemned the underground nuclear test carried out by China last Friday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. "It is extremely regrettable that the People's Republic of China conducted another nuclear test. Japan has always regarded the nuclear test ban as one of the highest priorities in the field of disarmament and it strongly urges China not to repeat nuclear testing in the future," Kakizawa was quoted as saying. On the North Korean nuclear issue, Qian said China "will participate positively in the discussions within the framework of the United Nations and is ready to play its own positive role," the spokesman said. The Chinese foreign minister said applying sanctions to North Korea would be ineffective, judging from the fact that it has already been isolated and has little economic contact with the rest of the world, he said. The spokesman refused to speculate on whether China would be willing to go along with U.N. Security Council sanctions under discussion, or whether it would veto such sanctions. "We explained to our counterpart our view that the situation demands that the international community as a whole, through the United Nations Security Council, consider an appropriate response, including sanctions," he said. "Our purpose is not to bring about punitive measures. Rather, our objective is that North Korea dispel the doubts of the international community over its nuclear development and it come back to the dialogue table," he said. Kakizawa said Japan values highly the work China has already done on the issue and stressed the importance of China playing a "positive role within the framework of the U.N.," the spokesman said. The two foreign ministers also discussed other issues of bilateral concern, including growing and increasingly "interdependent" economic and trade ties and China's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), he said. Kakizawa's one-day visit follows his talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff, held Saturday in Seoul on the recent developments of the North Korean nuclear issue
