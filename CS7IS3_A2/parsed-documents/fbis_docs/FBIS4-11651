Furthermore, on behalf of my people and the government, I would like to thank very sincerely for the cordial welcome, the affection, the kindness that has been shown to us in these few hours of our presence in this beautiful country and congratulate you for the organization of this meeting. We are convinced of the importance of the cooperation among our countries as a fundamental instrument in our struggle for development and welfare of our people. Success that we noted in the processes of reform in the past years in many countries that form part of this forum shows clearly which benefits countries can expect that are ready to undergo processes of liberalization and the economic opening. I believe that the traumatic experiences shared by the countries present here are some of the most valuable ones offered by the contemporary world. Sharing this experience among us will help us to face future challenges and strengthen the achievements already attained. In this respect, I would like to express my great personal satisfaction over the results obtained in many of the cooperation projects the group has already implemented. In particular, I would like to underline the success of the meeting on exchange of information on national economic policies, which focus on the issue of privatization. It is an example of the activities aimed at strengthening and consolidating the work and functioning of this group. At the same time, it is a clear example of the constructive form of a high-technical component in which the South-South cooperation can be made increasingly effective. I am convinced that the strengthening of our group through a program of technical cooperation cleared of ideological contents, which are survivors from, or vestiges from, passages already overcome, and a solid scientific support constitute the best possible way to sensitize the most developed countries regarding the needs of a free international trade. The different sectors of our countries, without prejudice, will help us to create a favorable international environment, in which the benefit of free trade will be distributed in a just manner among all of the nations of the world. Luckily, the days are already gone by when the probable, alleged culprits of all our problems were sought in the developed world. Today, we know that the main responsibility of our countries is to achieve the necessary structural transformation to maintain the course of full economic and social development. The genuine economic development, stemming from this process of sincerity, will constitute the best basis for the universal consolidation of fully democratic regime founded on the sovereignty of the people whose authorities act in strict conformity with the laws sanctioned by the representatives of the people without discriminations and with full respect for the human rights. In other times, these subjects were considered to be the exclusive domain of each state outside of the interference of other members of international community. Today, we know to which extent it is in the interest of everyone that democracy be effectively adopted by all nations. Recent history and also the events we have to face everyday in the different regions of this world show us that as long as this does not occur, a Damoclean sword will continue to hang over world peace and over the material, moral progress of our people, as well as the effective sharing of the benefit of civilization by all human beings. Argentina has systematically sustained the need to realize a role of international organizations of all kinds as a dominant force and a useful instrument in trying to achieve international peace. In this framework, an active commitment to the values of democracy, pluralism, rule of law, and the protection of human rights, is the best contribution we can make in order to promote all the other objectives of the Group of 15. I would like to repeat my thanks, very warm gratitude, at the fact that we have been allowed to be in the last moments of the meeting of the Group of 15 and to be able to repeat the offer of Argentina that in 1995 we will be able to meet again in our country in order to continue our deliberations there. One of the most fundamental topics Argentina is going to propose, and that has already been dealt with in the framework of the United Nations, is the creation of an organization termed White Helmets in order to make sure and support the struggle against poverty on our earth. I think we cannot be talking of justice and peace as long as there are poor people on this globe. I think we have reached an unavoidable and inescapable commitment of all countries, especially those that have greater possibilities, to be involved not only on the diplomatic level in a preventive way but fundamentally in the diplomacy of cooperation, solidarity. The White Helmets that the Republic of Argentina proposes do not mean to try and achieve only food and similar help for our brothers on this earth that need it, but to achieve a way of teaching man to work, teaching man to make use of the resources available on the earth to make sure that on the basis of his own efforts, he may have a more dignified life. We will continue to insist on this issue and we will make sure that in 1995, the White Helmets will be present in those countries and those places where marginal poverty is specially hard until we may in this way bring warmth and affection to those people who really need to be alleviated of the sacrifice they are subjected to. Thank you very much and we see you soon. [applause]
