"Violent demonstrations, especially against policemen who are guarding the nation, democracy, and law and order, are unacceptable," the president said on receiving a new year's policy report from Seoul City Mayor Kim Won-chong. The home affairs minister and the national police administrator must tackle violent demonstrations with firm determination, Kim said, adding that he will ask them to take responsibility if they fail to do so. The president's comment on demonstrations came a few days after thousands of farmers and student sympathizers staged a violent protest in the heart of Seoul against the opening of the domestic rice market to imports under the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. Kim said his administration, elected by a majority of the people through democratic means, is different from the authoritarian governments of the past. Violent anti-government demonstrations, therefore, cannot be justified under any circumstances, he said. Now is the time for the country to establish a "demonstration culture," or a correct and democratic way of advancing different opinions.
