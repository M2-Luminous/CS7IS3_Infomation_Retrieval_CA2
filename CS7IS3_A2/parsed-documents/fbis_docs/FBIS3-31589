They have also asked the general prosecutor to investigate the legality of these proceedings. Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar said at a news conference at 1130 [1030 GMT] today that the draft of the resolution had been brought to him by Ivan Gasparovic, parliamentary speaker, this morning. Vladimir Meciar went on to say: [Begin recording] [Meciar] I would like to point out the following: The draft of the resolution of the Slovak parliament (?although it is not signed by anyone) is a result of talks between the SDL and the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. It says in Point 1: It abolishes, according to Paragraph 87, Section 3 of Law No. 44 of 1989 first the Decree of the Government of the Slovak Republic No. 273 of 1991 on the excemptions from Paragraph 45 of Law No. 92 of 1991 on the conditions of the transfer of state property to other persons; the Decree of the Slovak Government No. 40 of 1992; the Decree of the Slovak Goverment No. 144 of 1993; and the decree of the Slovak Government No. 151 of 1993. Second, the Decree of the Government of the Slovak Republic of 15 February 1994, which authorizes Julius Toth, deputy prime minister and minister of finance, to endorse the excemptions from Paragraph 45, Section 1 of Law No. 92 of 1991. Third, the Resolution of the Government of the Slovak Republic of 15 February 1994, which endorses the transfer of the property of the Novofruct state enterprise in Nove Zamky by direct sale to the company (?CV Slovakia) Ltd Nove Zamky and the (?Maktomat) Ltd Zvolen. In Section 2: According to Paragraph 91 of Law No. 44 of 1989 and Article 4 of Law No. 17 of 1993 it asks the general prosecutor to launch investigations against Vladimir Meciar, Slovak prime minister, who is also in charge of the Ministry for Administration and Privatization of the Slovak Republic, and also against Julius Toth, deputy prime minister and minister of finance of the Slovak Republic, in the matter of the legality of: First, the transfer of the ownership and the property of enterprises carried out according to Paragraph 45, Section 2 of Law No. 92 of 1991 in the version of the decree of the Slovak Government No. 151 of 1993 and according to the resolution of the government of 15 February 1994, which authorizes the deputy prime minister and minister of finance to endorse excemptions according to Paragraph 45, Section 2. Second, decisions of the government on the transfer of the property of the Novofruct Nove Zamky state enterprise by direct sale to the company (?CV Slovakia) Ltd Nove Zamky and (?Matsomat) Ltd Zvolen. Third, the decision of the government on the sale of the shares [words indistinct] by direct sale to the company (?Monis) Ltd in Levice. In Section 3: It calls on Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, who is in charge of the Ministry for Administration and Privatization of National Property, and Julius Toth, deputy prime minister and minister of finance, to resign due to the deliberate violation of the constitutional oath on observing the law in cases of the transfer of state property. Commenting on those facts I would like to say the following: First, the National Council does not have the right to cancel cabinet resolutions. This is why some different bodies are entitled to act if these resolutions contradict the law. Second, I do not have anything against the request addressed to the General Prosecutor's Office to assess whether any action by the cabinet is in accordance with the law. On the contrary, I am in favor of this course of action. In this context I am sending a letter to the prosecutor general to ask him to investigate whether the matter of the October early elections is not linked to an attempt to politically blackmail the prime minister and the chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. Third, this appeal (?anticipates) the result. It was not put together on the basis of any investigation. Nobody studied the evidence and nobody studied the facts of the case. This is an attempt to disgrace some people. I would like to say that this is just putting the finishing touches to the picture of the deep, above all moral, crisis of Slovakia's political life, polititics of the SDL, and others who participate in this. This also indicates the depth of the crisis of political life in which the Slovak Republic has found itself. This also indicates an attempt to solve the problem of elections by disgracing the name of the government coalition representatives even before the elections starts. I have already experienced something similar. It was when I was persecuted for being perceived as the main representative of the future formation of the Slovak state. You have witnessed many events, many scandals involving me--including when I was accused of crimes--and attempts to discredit me. As intelligence documents have gradually emerged from the archives those involved have even attempted suicides. This is the first time this has come from the midst of Slovak political parties, an attempt to discredit another party and its leadership without any evidence and without proper study. I refute such methods. I also reject those who are involved in carrying them out. Last night there were talks between the SDL and the KDH, and talks were being prepared between the HZDS and the SDL. Today at 1500 [1400 GMT] we were to meet each other. I think that given the aforementioned information we do not have anything to discuss. We need an honest partner. The use of blackmail and pressure as the means of talks with HZDS officials is not permissable for anybody under any circumstances. Parliamentary mathematics gives them a majority. They can express a vote of no confidence in the cabinet and the cabinet can resign. This is democratic. I reject their methods and will neither submit to them nor respect them.
