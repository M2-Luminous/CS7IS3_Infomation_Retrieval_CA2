Francisco] [Text] The recently signed banking liberalization law effectively eliminates the nationalization privilege of rural banks as foreign banks are now also allowed to invest in rural banks, savings and loan associations and thrift banks. Senator Raul S. Roco, chairman of the committee on banks, financial institutions and currencies yesterday, told members of the Makati Chamber of Commerce and Industry that the new law liberalizes not only the commercial banking industry but also the rural banking industry which was previously monopolized by Filipinos. One mode of entry for foreign banks under the banking liberalization law is the opening or acquisition of subsidiaries where they can own up to 60 percent voting stock. Mr. Roco said foreign banks can, therefore, acquire rural and thrift banks as subsidiaries. However, Mr. Roco told BUSINESS WORLD he has not heard yet of any foreign bank interested to enter such an investment in small rural and thrift banks. In case foreign banks do invest in rural banks, this would lead to the closure of or mergers among small rural banks which do not have the financial backing of foreign banks. Earlier, Negros Oriental Rep. Margarito Teves told a forum at the Center for Research and Communication the entry of new foreign banks in the country will not affect smaller financial entities like rural banks since foreign banks are more likely to concentrate on wholesale business. Rural banks specialize in the retail business. Mr. Teves also said he expects a linkage between foreign banks and rural banks to be established with the new law since foreign banks need the expertise of rural banks in countryside lending. Some bankers also expect that foreign banks would concentrate on big-ticket transactions, which are the business of large commercial banks. Benjamin Palma Gil, Philippine National Bank (PNB) executive vice president, earlier said the entry of foreign banks may create competition on the level of bigger banks. Community banks will then be left to handle the smaller businesses. Mr. Roco also said the new law also increases the ownership cap of Filipinos in local banks from 30 percent to 40 percent. While foreign banks are allowed to own up to 60 percent of the total voting stock in a domestic bank or subsidiary, Filipino groups who are listed in the stock exchange or are existing for at least 10 years are also accorded the same privilege. The banking liberalization law also provides for new funding sources for educational institutions, hospitals, cooperatives, local government units and low-cost housing. Mr. Roco said foreign banks which would offer financing for these sectors would be given incentives under the law. The law signed by President Ramos last 18 May allows 10 new foreign banks to establish branches in the country within five years. It also permits an unlimited number of entrants to set up subsidiaries or buy into any of the existing 28 local banks. Since the Monetary Board holds the right to decide where the last three of the allowable six branches of foreign banks would be situated, Mr. Roco said the government would still have control over the dispersal of development in the country.
