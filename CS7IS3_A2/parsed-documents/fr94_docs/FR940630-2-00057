FR940630-2-00057 FR940630-2-00041 [Report No. 2020] Petitions for Reconsideration of Actions in Rulemaking Proceedings June 27, 1994. Petitions for reconsideration have been filed in the Commission rulemaking proceedings listed in this Public Notice and published pursuant to 47 CFR 1.429(e). The full texts of these documents are available for viewing and copying in room 239, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC, or may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, ITS, Inc., (202) 857&hyph;3800. We are waiving the requirements of Sections 1.429(f) and (g) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 1.429(f), (g), and instead we are providing expedited filing dates for oppositions and replies, to increase certainty for competitive bidding participants by compiling the record prior to the date of the auctions. Accordingly, opposition to these petitions must be filed July 11, 1994. See Section 1.4(b)(1) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 1.4(b)(1). Replies to an opposition must be filed within 7 days after the time for filing oppositions has expired. We believe that these filing dates will provide a reasonable opportunity for filing and meaningful consideration of the oppositions and replies.
