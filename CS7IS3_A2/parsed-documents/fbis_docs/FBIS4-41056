Before the vote on this issue, Mikhail Zadornov, the chairman of the Duma's Committee for the Budget, Taxation, Banks, and Finances, said that all the amendments that had been made to it during the second reading had been taken into account for the document's third reading. He noted that these amendments related, in particular, to increased spending on defense and fundamental science and also to a 15 percent cut in spending on the structure of state administration. The deputy stressed that the document had undergone a final expert legal and linguistic examination. After this, Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of the lower house of the Federal Assembly, informed deputies that the third reading of this document did not stipulate a debate and he proposed that they vote on it as a whole. However, only 194 deputies voted for the 1994 budget, while a total of 225 votes was needed for a positive outcome. Deputies then left for a break, just prior to the announcement of which Rybkin noted that deputies would resume the debate on the 1994 budget on their return to the hall.
