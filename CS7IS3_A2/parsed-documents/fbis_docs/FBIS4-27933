It is the first official visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet to these states since the collapse of the former Soviet Union. The prime minister is accompanied by Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam; minister of the Government Office; minister of energy; minister of science, technology, and environment; and 31 Vietnamese businessmen. The prime minister's trip will start in Kiev and then Almaty and Moscow. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will be received by presidents of all these states and Vietnam will sign with Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan agreements, treaties, and joint communiques on cooperation. Relations between Vietnam and Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan have been established for a long time. After the collapse of the former Soviet Union, Vietnam and these states try to maintain these relations. Cooperation has continued to develop in the fields of energy and oil and gas. Vietnam also has cooperated with Russia in other areas, such as transportation and agriculture. However, two-way trade turnover between Vietnam and Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan was still at a modest level. The turnover with Russia was $300 million and with Ukraine $330 million. During the trip, further cooperation will be developed in accordance with their potentials. Meanwhile, relations between Vietnam and Germany are developing strongly. The visit to Vietnam by Minister of Cooperation and Development of Germany Carl-Dieter Spranger at the end of May made considerable contribution. The development of relations between the two countries does not reflect Germany's official development aid -- ODA -- to Vietnam, but Germany's efforts are clear in increasing its aid to both north and south Vietnam equally. In 1990, Germany granted aid to Vietnam 12 million Deutche marks, in 1991 the amount of aid from Germany increased to DM27 million, in 1992 it was 49 million, and 1993 63 million. These figures prove that over the past four years relations between the two countries have achieved important steps which were not obvious in previous years. The main reasons are the changing and development in Vietnam itself because of renovation.
