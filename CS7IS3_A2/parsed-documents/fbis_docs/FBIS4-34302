Investigative Police detectives arrested Pablo David Contreras Olivos, aka Jose Luis or Joam, yesterday in the vicinity of the Plaza Italia. Contreras Olivos, who has been identified as the current number two Lautaro Group leader, was in charge of the group's military structure. He was arrested along with Maria Angelica Medina Soto, aka La Cuca. She led the MAPU-Lautaro [United Popular Action Movement, Lautaro Group]. Through these arrests the police were able to establish that Guillermo Ossandon was in Cartagena, where he had been residing for some time. The police arrested Ossandon in a telephone booth in Cartagena. He did not offer any resistance. Along with Ossandon, the police also arrested his companions Sandra del Carmen Ramirez Barahona, and Flor Ines Alcallaga Cepeda. [Begin Investigative Police Public Relations Chief Luis Cariz recording] All the investigations leading to the arrest of these people were conducted on the basis of a decree issued by Judge Dreiser, who has already been duly informed. We also asked Judge Dreiser to authorize an extension of the detention period in Investigative Police barracks for up to 10 days. We are now proceeding to compare the existing evidence with their testimony, so as to establish their involvement in the numerous crimes with which they have been charged. [end recording] The government praised the Investigative Police for their work, and commended the successful investigation that led to breaking up the guerrilla group. [Begin Interior Ministry Under Secretary Belisario Velasco recording] During the operations officials seized the following guns: one pistol, four revolvers, nine sawed-off Tamara shotguns, and two double barrel shotguns. We must also praise the Investigative Police intelligence brigade's professionalism in planning and conducting this operation. We must also praise them for the fact that no one was injured. As is well known, in the last couple of years the police force has been increasingly coordinating its actions to effectively comply with their role as established in the Constitution. [end recording] Guillermo Enrique Ossandon Canas, alias Diego Carvajal, established the Lautaro Youth Movement in 1983. With a dissident MAPU group Ossandon was able to establish an organization that later developed into the Lautaro Rebel and Popular Front [FRPL] Forces. Since then homicides, bomb attacks, bank holdups, and armed propaganda actions increased considerably in Chile. FRPL forces first centered their actions in the southern region of Santiago. Later they expanded their operations to other regions. A few years ago the police arrested some FRPL leaders. On one occasion the police almost arrested Ossandon, but he was able to escape. In view of this the Investigative Police special corps took action only after the entire operation had been secured. They decided nevertheless to delay the operation so as not to allow Ossandon to escape in the dark. The Lautaro Movement leaders were brought in from the coast aboard an airplane. They are currently under arrest at a Santiago Investigative Police barracks. Fearing extremist reprisals, the Investigative Police have reinforced the guards throughout its units. Moreover, personnel from several police precincts will take turns watching the Lautaro Movement leaders. The Interior Ministry will submit an injunction against the five arrested Lautaro Movement members, who have been charged with terrorist actions. In the next few days they will be placed at the disposal of Judge Arnoldo Dreiser, who is in charge of investigating the crimes perpetrated by the Lautaro Group crimes.
