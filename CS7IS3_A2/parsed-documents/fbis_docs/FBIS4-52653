The paper says: First of all, the United States intends to stifle Korean socialism with strength by reinforcing its Armed Forces in South Korea. It is the invariable policy of the U.S. to aggravate military confrontation and tensions on the Korean peninsula, threaten the DPRK with strength and, furthermore, stifle it. The U.S. bellicose elements plan to send military strength 600,000 strong, over 200 combatant ships, more than 1,600 warplanes and other aggression forces which are far greater than those hurled into the Persian Gulf war to the Korean front in 80 days in "case of emergency" on the Korean peninsula. Another purpose of the United States in its arms buildup in and around South Korea is to attain the goal of its Asian-Pacific policy. The keynote of the U.S. Asian-Pacific strategy at present is to curb the expansion of the sphere of influence of the Western countries in this area by relying upon its military predominance and to establish U.S.-orchestrated dominationist order. In this, it attaches importance especially to Northeast Asia and intends to keep powerful frontline combat power in and around South Korea and strengthen its domination and control over the Asia-Pacific region by using it. Another purpose of the U.S. war-thirsty elements in stepping up arms buildup in South Korea is to turn it into its arms market and bring fabulous profits to the U.S. military monopolies. The U.S. ruling circles intend to make South Korea, its colony and military base, open its door wider as an arms market and drive out the puppets as a shock brigade in invading the North. The United States must stop the reckless arms buildup going against the trend of the times toward disarmament and detente.
