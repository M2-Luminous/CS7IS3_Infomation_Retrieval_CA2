In January, 52.6 Million People Were Below the Poverty Line, in February 24.8 Million"] [Text] There is hardly any need to demonstrate that, of all the negative consequences of the reform, the most painful is the truly calamitous situation in which millions of our indigent fellow citizens find themselves. The sentimental pictures which have flashed on our television screens -- charity dinners and charity gifts, clearly pursuing publicity purposes -- have been quite unable to rectify the situation, merely underlining the depth of the people's sorrow. In January, 35.4 percent of the population had an income below the living wage. Let us call things by their proper names: More than one-third of our fellow citizens were doomed to a slow extinction. But then the situation changed materially in February, when 16.7 percent of citizens remained below the poverty line. The little word "only" is clearly inappropriate here. It is equally inappropriate to be moved by the changes that have occurred. Because 24.8 million hapless citizens represent, all the same, a very large number, monstrously large! Therefore the words used to form the headline must be perceived with a certain degree of irony. And yet the cited facts require careful analysis. They attest that Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet has replaced the "declaration of intentions" with practical steps aimed at giving social protection to needy sections of the population. It is very important to investigate the mechanism of such actions. What, then, happened? First, the difference in the wages that were increased as of 1 December last year and as of 1 January this year for working people in the budget-funded sphere and in management organs was paid in February. The payment was increased by the amount of the compensation relating to pensions. Second, the rate of inflation slowed down sharply in February and stood at 9.9 percent. The increase in wages (10 percent) overtook inflation probably for the first time. Third, owing to the low rate of inflation, there was an insignificant change in the actual size of the living wage: 51,360 rubles [R] in January, R56,574 in February. A natural question arises: How stable is the trend which has become apparent? First of all, it should be said that provision has already been made for a number of protective measures in the social sphere. Thus, as of 1 February it is proposed to increase compensation for pensioners from R11,700 to R20,000, and to R29,600 as of 1 May. But this, of course, is not the main point. Everything depends on the limit to which the level of inflation can be kept. This is primarily dependent on the republic budget deficit, which is to be compensated for to a considerable degree by money emission. The government intends to keep the budget deficit within quite a rigid framework -- approximately 9 percent of GDP. This would also ensure a moderate rate of inflation. The final fate of the budget is not yet known, however. At the end of last week Viktor Chernomyrdin signed its draft and sent the document to the president and the State Duma. It can only be hoped that its classes of expenditure will not swell up under pressure from various lobbyist groupings. In any case it is gratifying that the cabinet's social policy has occupied priority positions not in words but in actual fact.
