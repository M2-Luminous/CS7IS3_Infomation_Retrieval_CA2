FBIS4-25635 "drchi113_w_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-113 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong XINHUA's Wang Rudeng Assures Post-1997 Press Freedom XINHUA's Wang Rudeng Assures Post-1997 Press Freedom Urges Press To `Abide' by Law HK1306084194 Hong Kong TA KUNG PAO in Chinese 13 Jun 94 p 12 HK1306084194 Hong Kong TA KUNG PAO Chinese BFN [Report: "Wang Rudeng Says There Still Will Be Press Freedom in Hong Kong After 1997"] [Text] Wang Rudeng, assistant director of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, emphasized yesterday that the Chinese Government would ensure that Hong Kong enjoyed freedom of the press and freedom of speech after 1997. He did not think that Hong Kong's mass media organizations would exercise self-restraint or press censorship for fear of offending the Chinese side, but he reaffirmed that while enjoying press freedom, we should be particular about the objectiveness and truthfulness of the press and speeches, and that journalists should be abide by the law. Wang Rudeng discussed press freedom after attending a ceremony to present prizes at a dragon boat invitation tournament held by the Central and Western District yesterday. He emphasized that in the past, the Chinese Government and the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch have always greatly respected freedom of the press and freedom of speech in Hong Kong. He also believed that after 1997, the Chinese side would try its best to ensure local freedom of the press and of speech. He pointed out, however, that while enjoying freedom of the press, we should be particular about the objectiveness and truthfulness of the press and speeches. He said that while enjoying freedom of the press, we should not distort facts at will and make groundless accusations, nor should we publish biased speeches. He held that journalists should be abide by the law, and that if they violate the law, they should be punished according to the law. When asked about the incident that occurred in the News Department of Asia Television Limited [ATV] not long ago [reference to resignation of several ATV journalists in light of TV station's decision not to air a Spanish TV documentary on Tiananmen -- a decision later rescinded], Wang Rudeng said that it was purely an issue of the ATV administration itself and did not concern freedom of the press. He also said that he did not think the mass media organizations in Hong Kong would exercise self-restraint or censorship for fear of offending the Chinese side because everyone could see the respect of the Chinese Government and the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch for local press freedom. He also emphasized that there would not be any problem for the media to criticize the Chinese side after 1997. On the other hand, Wang Rudeng criticized as groundless and irresponsible Legislative Councillor Emily Lau's accusation at the "City Forum" last month that he had intervened in press freedom. He pointed out that at the City Forum last month, Emily Lau accused him of inviting persons in charge of some mass media organizations to a meeting a few years ago, and of asking them to intervene in the news coverage carried out by their subordinates. In that year, Emily Lau made a telephone call to him to ask about the matter and to make the accusation, but she was not able to provide strong and concrete evidence, such as with whom he met, or when and where, or what issues he discussed that constituted an intervention in press freedom. He held that Emily Lau was irresponsible to have brought up this matter again on a public occasion and to have made a groundless accusation against him.
