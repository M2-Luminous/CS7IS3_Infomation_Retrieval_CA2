Addressing a press conference in Wroclaw on Tuesday, Szmajdzinski warned that the daily costs of maintaining the complex military training, health care, and housing systems represent 75 percent of the total Army budget because these structures are too large for the reduced Polish Army. Szmajdzinski called for respective quick decisions because even a 6-7 percent increase in spending on national defence will not solve the problem. He also appealed for quicker structural changes in the national defence sector and exemption of 5 thousand soldiers from the military service duty.
