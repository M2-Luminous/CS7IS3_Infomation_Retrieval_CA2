He pointed out: Basically, the law shows that the Chinese Communists are still playing the trick of one country, two systems. If they truly want to protect investment from outside, they should sign agreements that meet international requirements. We cannot rashly enter into all-around, in-depth economic contact with the mainland simply because the Chinese Communists passed an incomprehensive, nonspecific law.
