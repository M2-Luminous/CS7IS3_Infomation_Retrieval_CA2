I. Purpose and Substantive Description A. Authority and Background (1) Authority (a) Section 802 of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (42 USC 8011) created a new CHSP. (b) Section 604 and 672 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 amended the CHSP. (c) A final common rule for the CHSP is published elsewhere in today's Federal Register . (2) Background The CHSP was originally authorized and funded as a demonstration program under the Congregate Housing Services Act of 1978 (1978 Act) (42 USC 8001). It provided congregate housing and coordinated supportive services for elderly handicapped or non-elderly handicapped individuals to allow them to maintain their independence and avoid costly and unnecessary institutionalization. Congress appropriated funds for Fiscal Years 1979 through 1982, to remain available until expended. Since then, Congress has provided funds on an annual basis to continue funding grantees that previously received assistance. The demonstration became a permanent program in 1987. Based upon the experience of the grantees funded under the demonstration, Congress created a new CHSP as one of the components of NAHA, which was enacted on November 28, 1990 and amended in 1992. HUD, in coordination with the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) of the Department of Agriculture, administers the CHSP under a Common Rule in accordance with the statute. This Notice announces the availability of both HUD and FmHA funds for the CHSP and invites applications from both HUD and FmHA applicants.
