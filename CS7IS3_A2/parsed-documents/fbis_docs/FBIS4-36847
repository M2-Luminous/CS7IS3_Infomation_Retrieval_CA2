[passage omitted] The first sermon on this Friday, because of the issue of the pilgrimage and the events which took place in Mecca and Medina, is naturally about that subject. I shall talk to you dear ones briefly about it. The first is the issue of that of disavowal. We believe -- and his holiness the imam [Khomeyni], God be satisfied with him, and the esteemed leader [Khamene'i] have also recommended -- that disavowal must be carried out, that the disavowal ritual cannot be cancelled and is a duty, and that efforts should be made for that duty to be performed in the best manner. This year the House of Al Sa'ud treated the honorable Iranian pilgrims and the esteemed leader's mission roughly and harshly. They kept the mission under siege a few days up to 17 May. The siege was ugly. The Saudi forces were in three rows and in emplacements; they had brought military hardware, machine guns, cannons and tanks; riot squads were there with their riot gear and water cannons and such were at hand here and there. It was foreseen from the start that an unpleasant situation was imminent. But we said, perhaps we will be able to carry out our duty. Then, closer to the mission, we got a tighter circle of the besieging troops and stricter traffic restrictions to and from the mission. A sister of one of the faithful who lived in an Arab country and who had come to visit him was stopped on her return and was interrogated for an hour. She was asked: Where were you and what was your business. Her address was obtained. There was such harsh and dreadful behavior. There was a police state and martial law around the mission. Under those circumstances, the question was what to do, since preserving the sanctity and security of the shrine is a must for everyone. That action of the House of Al Sa'ud undermined security. Security means pilgrims to the holy house of God must be safe. Stationing armed troops and creating a police state and an emergency situation would deprive everybody of their security. That means everyone would be in fear, lest they are arrested, beaten or molested. That action was breaking the security of the shrine. But it was clearly foreseen that if we were to hold the ceremony, there would be clashes and the desecration of the shrine would be much greater; moreover, the lives of pilgrims to the holy house of God would be endangered. Under these circumstances it was decided that this year's disavowal of infidels ceremonies should not take place. Our duty was in fact nothing but to obey what we had been ordered. God has ordered that if a pilgrim, who wants to go to Mecca in order to carry out the pilgrimage, finds himself impeded -- that is, he faces a closed route -- even though he has committed himself to the rites by putting on his special hajj attire, he is authorized to perform merely the part to do with slaughtering sheep, and then remove his hajj attire and return home. He is authorized to do the same if, for instance, he becomes ill during the pilgrimage. This is Islam's decree. The same decree obviously applies to other pilgrimage obligations, such as the disavowal of infidels ceremonies. We had no other choice, as we did not seek to have caused the violation of the sanctity of the holy shrine. This was what I had to say about the disavowal of infidels ceremonies. There are, however, numerous issues to do with the pilgrimage and the Al Sa'ud government. In sum, one can say that it has become the Americans' nest of corruption, in that they have brought everything under their control. They have imposed their control over political, economic and religious issues. On the one hand, they became present in a sacred Islamic land. This was unprecedented, as the infidels should not be present in that land. However, the Americans came and found a foothold there. On the other hand, they invariably interfere in different issues. With a single telephone call to Fahd about the purchase of passenger planes, Clinton tells him to buy Boeing; otherwise, relations are going to be affected. Just by this threat, a $6 million aircraft purchase deal is suddenly made. Clinton receives his commission from the companies concerned, while at the same time about 300,000 jobs are created in the American aircraft industry, which is saved from bankruptcy for at least several years. This is all done by one single telephone call. This is what the situation is like. When we say that Muslims should not be abject, this is what we mean. What abjectness can be greater that what I just described? What I said merely concerned intervention in economic issues. We have, moreover, their intervention in large and small issues. I have a guess, which I consider as very close to reality, that in respect of the cancellation of the disavowal of infidels ceremonies, the support and the insistence of the Americans must certainly be taken into account, alongside the fact that the Wahhabi clerics and the Al Sa'ud rulers are not very keen on the staging of such events anyway. Another issue is that a strange situation has been created there, in that a group of Najd clerics, who are in fact the most reactionary clerics Islam has seen, seek to impose their ideas, with the support of the Saudi leaders, on about 1.2 billion Muslims and deprive them of freedom of action. They want everyone to follow what they consider as Islam and refrain from what they term non-Islamic. This does not follow any logic, given what Islam says about the two holy shrines. According to Islam's point of view, these shrines are international Islamic centers. [passage omitted] Instead of belonging to one single group, these shrines belong to all Muslims. If a government rules that land, it should only serve the Muslims. It is not authorized to interfere in the way that the Muslims fulfill their obligations and perform their rituals and worship. That state is there merely to serve Muslims. Despite this Islamic point of view, they prevent Muslims from performing what in their opinion constitutes a diversion, an innovation, and an act of infidelity. This does not only affect the Shiites, as the majority of Muslims believe in the principle of the blessings which are induced by the act of visiting shrines and offering prayers at sacred tombs. They, however, oppose all these. This a tragedy, and something must be done about it. If these clerics had been anything but extremely reactionary and fanatic, then we could have invited them to an Islamic congress to discuss these issues in the presence of all Islamic scholars. However, they are not prepared to say even one word about these issues, as they claim that whatever they say is the absolute truth. [passage omitted] The other issue concerns the Saudi leaders' incompetence in managing the affairs of the holy shrines. One aspect of this concerns safeguarding people's lives. It is not a small matter when a pilgrim, who has travelled thousands of kilometers from Africa or east Asia to have his one chance of a lifetime to go on pilgrimage, is suddenly killed under the crowd stampede. How can one justify that? What I saw with my own two eyes smacked of mismanagement. Imagine the situation where there are about a million people around, half of whom are going towards Jamarat while the other half are returning from the site. The two crowds suddenly collide, while cars and their escorts are also trying to get by. People wonder what they do as they are being pushed around. The volume of the crowd naturally causes people to fall, and once they fall, they cannot get up, until their corpses are evacuated. [passage omitted] What judgment are the people of the world going to pass when they witness all these scenes in a center where Islam and its culture is manifesting itself? This can be called by no other term but mismanagement. Another issue, which is of paramount importance, is the widespread corruption of the Saudi ruling class. The whole world, except the extremely ignorant, knows that they indulge in the most grand debauchery and spend the greatest amount of money to satisfy their carnal desires. The scandals are numerous, but it is not right for me, as the preacher present at Friday prayers sermon premises, to talk about them. I leave these to the press. Perhaps when the flow of their money to the Zionist press stops, these newspapers will then disclose more of these matters. On the basis of these clear issues, one must ask whether these people are suitable for managing the affairs of the two holy shrines. [passage omitted] It is the pious who should manage the holy shrines. Not everyone can take up such a duty. This is the place for the pious, for holy Abraham and for worshipping one single God. [passage omitted] God, then, ordered Abraham to keep the shrines pure and clean. What impurity can be worse than the fact that a number of corrupt and profligate individuals, who have built themselves places for debauchery and vice all over the world, are ruling that sacred land? That is also one such tragedy that we face there. Another issue is that of the minorities in Saudi Arabia who are mainly Shiite. Some have been expelled from Iraq, and the Saudis themselves put them in such a miserable situation. There are also Shiites who live in Sharqiyah, living in very bad conditions indeed. Extraordinary restrictions are imposed on them. They are not allowed to publish or obtain books. Their bookshop has been closed down. What kind of logic is it, that a group of people are not allowed to write religious books and write about their religious duties in order to give them to their children to read?. Which part of the world accepts that? But, if we make a wrong move -- and sometimes even if we do not -- they raise a hue and cry and blow their horns that human rights are being violated here, but that it does not matter if they are violated there -- even when it concern a cultural or religious issue. The minorities cannot establish a seminary; they are not allowed to build a mosque; they are not allowed to have a bookshop. Those are some of the ugly and shameful restrictions imposed on cultural and religious matters. What can be done? Why do they behave so badly towards them? What is the offense of those refugees? Some of those refugees who are seeking asylum are told they should become a Wahhabi first. The first condition is that a person should become a Wahhabi before seeking asylum. Where in the world could you find such words or the imposition of such ideas, such weak-minded ideas? But the world has shut up because Saudi Arabia is where the dollar is and is the center of oil money, and it is giving it away to shut them up. Therefore, to the West, everything Saudi Arabia does conforms to human rights. Another issue, which constitutes my final remarks in this sermon, is the speech of Fahd on 'Id al-'Adha this year. Each year heads of various pilgrimage groups from different countries are invited to go and see Fahd on the occasion of 'Id al-Adha. This was done very simply in previous years and nothing was mentioned. But this year, all of a sudden, his excellency made a long speech, which newspapers also reported, on various issues and services in Medina and Mecca. One part of the speech was about the services and another dealt with political issues in Somalia, Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina and also one part was about Iran. On the issue of Iran, he mentioned the issue of the three islands and said that Iran should observe international agreements and human rights and so on. Very well, our first question is: you have always condemned us and placed a cordon around us saying that political issues should not be raised here during the pilgrimage. What was your speech about then? Was it not a political speech? Why are you raising political issues? [passage omitted] Then on the Iranian affairs, always when those Saudi gentlemen are under pressure, in order to make a payoff to their masters, they immediately raise certain issues headed by the issue of the three islands. They think when they say a few words then all problems are solved. They themselves know that the issue of the islands is nothing that could be solved with a speech or a statement. Basically there is no problem to be solved. They are stirring trouble. They want to blackmail us. They want to blackmail us that if you do not do this or that, then we will raise the issue of the three islands. That is the issue; otherwise, the UAE itself is not so persistent on this and they themselves are perhaps conscious that we are right. But the Saudis are stirring up trouble. They have become the region's agent provocateur now. They bully Yemen, they bully Qatar, they bully the UAE, and they also intend to bully us. In any case, those are some of the issues, and we hope that one day a pious government rules that holy land so that the Muslim people who go to holy Mecca could perform their religious duties as God wishes.
