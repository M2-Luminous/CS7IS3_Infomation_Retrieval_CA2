The meeting, which was held last Saturday in the Gyulistan Palace, was attended by A. Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Azerbaijani Supreme Council. M. Zabelin, an Azerbaijani Supreme Council deputy and the chairman of the Russian community, delivered the introductory address. Having introduced the guests, he described the purpose of their visit--to learn the truth about the sociopolitical situation in the republic so that they could later bring to every Russian the truth about the Karabakh conflict, the everyday life of the Russians living here. The meeting proceeded on a very friendly note. The Russian parliamentarians came to this meeting straight from the reception by the republic's president, G. Aliyev. The prominent theme in the meeting was that the main pain for the Russians in Azerbaijan is the same as for all Azerbaijani people--the six-year-old Armenian aggression and its terrible consequences, as well as one-sided, and often distorted, coverage of it by Russian mass media. We all know what broad activities members of the Russian community (created at the initiative of Azerbaijan-Russia Society) and the Sodruzhestvo Slavic Culture Center have launched outside of the republic for the purpose of breaking through the information blockade and establishing connections with Russia. And this is very understandable: Those for whom Azerbaijan is home, regardless of their ethnic identification, cannot help but be concerned over everything that is happening to their homeland. And do not members of other ethnic groups, first and foremost Russians, fight together with sons of Azerbaijani people for the independence and territorial integrity of their republic? In the Alley of Martyrs, next to National Heroes of Azerbaijan E. Yakhyayev and H. Hasanov, also lie National Heroes of Azerbaijan Yu. Kovalenko (his mother was present at the meeting) and V. Plotnikov. Both Russian parliamentarians and meeting participants said that Armenians actively use Russian arms and mercenaries, and that the fact of aggression has not yet been recognized by any international document because the war is conducted not by regular troops but by gangster formations. L. Morozova, a deputy chairman of Azerbaijan's Russian community, said that as a head of the Azerbaijani delegation she had traveled through all the North Caucasus, meeting with Cossack atamans and heads of oblasts and krays, and through them she learned that Armenians, taking advantage of privatization, buy up real estate literally for peanuts. In addition, she presented a newspaper, which published a report that a deputy minister of the Armenian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] had issued a decree on placing settlers in all these oblasts. In a couple of years, she warned, a new Karabakh may quite easily emerge in the North Caucasus. And for some reason, Armenian genocide toward the Azerbaijani people still has not been recognized. While at the same time life in Shusha is vibrant, tourists are invited to visit, enterprises are being built, and landmarks of cultural history are entered in registers as Armenian. Having angrily denounced Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan and supporting the course taken by the farsighted politician G. Aliyev, the Russians living in Azerbaijan called on their compatriots to support the protest, to take a stand against Armenian occupiers seizing the territory of others, against brutality perpetrated upon the Azerbaijani civilian population. To this Russian parliamentarians said that they will resolutely support the efforts to achieve the quickest possible peace and accord on the soil of Azerbaijan. It was also noted that Azerbaijan is a motherland for all its inhabitants, and regardless of their nationality all its citizens enjoy equal rights. Among other issues brought up in the course of the meeting was education in the Russian language. In particular, it was said that although Russian classes in schools and Russian groups in institutes are now smaller in numbers, none of the Russian schools have been closed to this day. This can happen soon, however, since Russia now sells Russian-language textbooks for hard currency, which we cannot afford. Most questions asked by journalists revolved around bringing Russian forces into Azerbaijan with the status of peacekeeping forces. Naturally, the lack of continuous information is capable of inflaming passions around one or another event. People in the republic have long stopped reading Russian newspapers. And those that occasionally are available for sale do not add much clarity. Plus, opposition press reports sometimes are quite arguable, and quite often are unsubstantiated. Apparently, this has prompted such an interest in the question of bringing in peacekeeping forces, to which the concrete answer was given that Russian troops are not going to be brought here. At the end of the meeting Supreme Council Deputy Chairman A. Dzhalilov congratulated everyone on the occasion of the holiday--Republic Day--and thanked Russian parliamentarians for mutual understanding and the Russians for participation in the meeting, and promised that all the issues raised by them will be resolved at state level.
