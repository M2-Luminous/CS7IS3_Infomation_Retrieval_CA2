FBIS3-12801 "drnes043dd_94015" FBIS-NES-94-043 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Mar 1994 Palestinian Affairs Signatures Collected for Anti-Negotiations Memos JN0303185794 Amman SAWT AL-SHA'B in Arabic 3 Mar 94 pp 24, 21 JN0303185794 Amman SAWT AL-SHA'B Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Report by Riyad Mansur] [Text] The collection of a million Palestinian signatures to a memorandum calling for an end to negotiations with Israel, unless it agrees to end all settlement activities and dismantle all settlements, has started. The signatures of Palestine National Council [PNC] members and national and popular figures to a similar memorandum has also started to be collected. The first memo, called "the National Consensus Document," was prepared by the Habash-led Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and the Hawatimah-led Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] in the occupied Palestinian territories. Its final draft was worked out yesterday after consultations with the two fronts' leaders abroad. It reads as follows: The ugly crime and horrendous massacre against the defenseless sons of our people in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, in collusion with the occupation forces, is clear and unequivocal evidence of the premeditated intentions against the sons of our heroic Palestinian people and are meant to force them to relinquish their legitimate rights. Accordingly, we in the occupied Palestinian territories call for suspending the current negotiations until the following conditions are met: 1. Israel's explicit agreement to halt all settlement activities, expansion, and confiscation of lands. 2. A pledge to dismantle all settlements, considering them illegal according to the international legitimacy resolutions. 3. Rebuilding the negotiations on the basis of the resolutions of international legitimacy on the Palestine question. 4. Providing direct international protection for our people and their holy places, and forcing Israel to respect all international charters and norms, the Fourth Geneva Convention, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The document stressed that withdrawing from the occupied territories, guaranteeing our people's right to self-determination and the establishment of their independent state with Jerusalem as its capital, and implementing the resolutions of international legitimacy are considered a basic condition for the establishment of peace in the region. The two fronts' representatives in the PNC also began to collect the signatures of the PNC members and national and popular figures on a similar memo prepared by Taysir Khalid from the DFLP, 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh from the PFLP, and Sulayman al-Najjab from the Palestinian People's Party. Al-Najjab, however, disclaimed the memo in whose formulation he participated. The representatives of the three organizations drafted this memo after the failure of 120 PNC members in Jordan to agree to a joint stand toward the Hebron massacre. The memo calls for and end to the current overt and covert bilateral talks with the Israeli enemy until the international community, particularly the Security Council, and Israel respond to our just demands which are: 1. Dismantling the settlements and stopping all settlement activities in accordance with the UN resolutions, particularly Security Council Resolution 465 for 1980, which considers these settlements illegal, and evacuating settlers from all the occupied Palestinian territories, including holy Jerusalem. 2. Securing international protection for our Palestinian people under occupation, applying the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 to the occupied territories, and entrusting security in the territories to UN forces for a temporary period of time until the Palestinian people can assume responsibility and national authority.
