Is it a continuation of the previous policy? Contrasting opinions are being voiced on this subject. [Kaczynski] On the whole, it is a continuation of the old policy, with certain compromises made for the sake of particular causes--for example, the interests of the farming community. Of course, attempts to "dilute" the main tenets of the economic program are being made in order to disguise the fact that it is still the old program. [Lukasiak] But the condition of the economy does not seem to be too bad. After all, in the course of one year, we recorded economic growth to the tune of 12 percent. [Kaczynski] Precisely. If production grew by 12 percent during one year, we can assume that, with a real transformation of the state, we could achieve a result many times that. However, if this is to happen, we must cut through a network of ties and connections between a narrow band of people controlling mainly banks and large enterprises. Contrary to the expectations of such prognosticators as, for example, Professor Jadwiga Staniszkis, large capital controlled partly by private owners and partly by the state does not lead to rationalization of the economy. It is in our economic interest to transfer that capital outside and boost consumption. [Lukasiak] If the economic program of the present government is a continuation of the previous government's policy, then why, in your opinion, does the Democratic Union criticize it? [Kaczynski] Because, in the first place, the Democratic Union is in opposition, so it must criticize the government's policy; in the second place, as I said, the program has become diluted; finally, after finding itself in opposition, the Democratic Union seems to be changing its values slightly in relation to those it was promoting before. Let me remind you that that group carried out a policy that was openly oriented toward an eventual handing over of power to communists. All of the tenets of the Democratic Union's policy were erroneous, in both the economic and the political sphere. Now they are trying to move away from their previous line in various aspects. [Lukasiak] How doe you assess the present power configuration? Why are the ruling parties--that is, the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], which, after all, share the same Polish People's Republic [PPR] pedigree--unable to arrive at a joint position in such key questions? [Kaczynski] At present, we have a triangular configuration between the Belweder, the SLD, and the PSL. There is open war going on along two arms of the triangle. Sparks also fly occasionally along the third arm,--hat is, the connection between the Belweder and the PSL--but, on the whole, the two actually engage in far-reaching cooperation. However, the association is a tactical one because I do not believe it is very likely that the farmers will give Walesa much support in the election campaign. Walesa is very unpopular in the rural community. Even the strong PSL apparatus, with its firm foothold in the rural sector, could only lose much and gain nothing if it tried to promote Walesa there. Apart from that, Walesa is an extremely disloyal partner, and the PSL is only too aware of that. [Lukasiak] So what is the nature of the Belweder-PSL alliance? What does it rest on? [Kaczynski] Thanks to the alliance, the weaker coalition partner--that is, the PSL--gains some real strength because of the support it has from the Belweder and is able to break up internally the stronger partner, the SLD. The only question is, why did the SLD decide to enter into such a configuration at all? I was convinced from the start that there was a firm conditional compact concerning the solution of the question of Walesa's presidency through a speedy promulgation of the new Constitution at the beginning of 1994. However, the present developments I have watched seem to be rather naively amusing and lead me to formulate only one conclusion: It was easy to play at politics from behind the backs of the Motorized Reserve of the Citizens' Militia [ZOMO] and the Security Service and, even later, in the hothouse conditions created by the Democratic Union and Walesa, when, on the one hand, as representatives of the left-wing orientation, certain politicians belonged to the lowest paid social group and, on the other, they were able to take the most advantage of the existing economic situation. [Lukasiak] In your opinion, how realistic are the voices, which can be heard from many directions, saying that in May we might have a new government based on the PSL, which will try to lean toward the right? [Kaczynski] This is a logical option if you look at it from Walesa's viewpoint. However, it is only so if you assume that the PSL decides not to nominate its own presidential candidate and agrees to support Walesa. On the other hand, gaining entry into such a government could be a very attractive proposition for many politicians of the right-wing orientation who have lost their chance in their own parties. [Lukasiak] You have already partly answered my next question, but would you still tell us what you believe is the source of the president's strength at the moment? After all, he keeps winning successive battles even though he is under criticism from both the right-wing and left-wing camps. [Kaczynski] Walesa's strength lies in the dreadful opportunism of our political circles. The vast majority of our politicians are not capable of opposing him, either because they are too afraid or because they are hoping for some advantages if they do not stand up to him. Let me remind you that, in our debate on the Small Constitution, I moved in favor of a very precise definition of the president's range of competence, so that we should not have to face the sort of situation we are facing today. At that time, Jerzy Jaskiernia (SLD) battled determinedly in order to force through the solution we have in the Small Constitution now. After all, the PSL and the SLD together could have created the sort of government from which the president would now helplessly "bounce off" like a ball thrown against a solid wall. In 1992, having 43 seats at our disposal after the election, we formed a government in which the Interior Ministry and the National Defense Ministry remained entirely outside the Belweder's sphere of influence. Every time, we have the same situation: Either Walesa is feared too much, or someone needs his support too much. After all, Suchocka was permanently terrified because she suspected that certain people were forever approaching Walesa about the prime minister's post and that Walesa promised that post indiscriminately to various individuals around him. [Lukasiak] How do you assess the president's attempts to influence the formulation of the constitution, such as, for example, the proposal to set up a "people's constitutional initiative"? [Kaczynski] That is a gambit played with an eye on the public and Solidarity, as well as a "wink" directed at the right-wing orientation: You would be well-advised to gather around me, get rid of your leaders because they have failed you, and unite under my protection.... [Lukasiak] But after your defeat in the election you yourself were ready to call a truce in your war with the president, were you not? [Kaczynski] Let me explain the essence of my reaction at the time. It was composed of two parts. First, I was not taking back anything I had said earlier, but I was ready to try to judge the president by his deeds. If I had not said that, there would have been no alliance of the right wing today. Already as a coalition, we issued several statements directed against Walesa. We did not have to wait long for his reaction. A number of cases that had been brought against me and that by then were about to be dropped were suddenly reactivated again. [Lukasiak] You recently said in a court case brought by Wieslaw Chrzanowski against Piotr Wierzbicki, chief editor of GAZETA POLSKA, for publishing his name on the list of so-called confidential agents that, according to your information, Chrzanowski was not a secret agent of the Security Agency [UB].... [Kaczynski] All I said was that there was no evidence that Chrzanowski collaborated with UB, although ,in the majority of cases under investigation, such evidence had come to light. The documents to which I had access contained the information that Chrzanowski was first registered as a collaborator and subsequently struck off the list because there was no evidence of any collaboration on his part. Why was he registered in the first place? I do not know, but it is wrong to claim on the strength of it that he was a confidential agent. However, it still does not mean that Wierzbicki could not have believed so in good faith on the strength of that list because the vast majority of the names of the confident agents' list refer to people who in reality were collaborating with UB. [Lukasiak] Is security vetting possible, or indeed necessary, today? [Kaczynski] There will be no order here without security vetting. Security vetting is essential: I have not the slightest doubt about it. I do, however, have doubts about whether it is possible to call to account the companies set up by the old nomenklatura, which are now going bankrupt on a massive scale. After all, their money was transferred so many times from one place to another without actual infringement of the ownership system. [Lukasiak] You spoke about a number of major frauds and rackets in our banking networks a long time ago. The truth behind your warnings was confirmed by reports from the Supreme Chamber of Control [NIK], but no one took particular note of them at the time. Now the fraud is slowly beginning to be disclosed to the public. Why do you think it has taken so long? [Kaczynski] Those who are now sounding the alarm must admit our diagnosis was correct and that we did predict the outcome. Now our own warnings and advice are being kidnapped from us. I am afraid that it may turn out before very long that the Democratic Union is the mother party of all "decommunizers." Consequently, I am inclined to ask a tongue-in-cheek question of Democratic Union politicians and GAZETA WYBORCZA editors: How do they feel in the role of political "cranks"? [Lukasiak] Thank you for talking to us.
