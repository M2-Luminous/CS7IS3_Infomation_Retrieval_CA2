Three people were seriously injured as a consequence of the aggressor's activity. Today the Ustashas used 120-mm mortars to fiercely pound the demarcation lines and the residential areas in Bilo Polje, while the region of Bijelo was the target of multiple rocket launchers. The district of Blagaj was again exposed to artillery attacks perpetrated by the HVO and Croatian Army troops. By accusing the [Bosnia-Herzegovina] Army of allegedly regrouping forces in the region of Blagaj -- as has been reported by the Croatian media -- the Ustashas are looking for an alibi for the daily shelling of this district and crimes committed against the civilian population, as well as for the attacks that they are obviously preparing to undertake against the free parts of the territory controlled by the 4th Corps forces.
