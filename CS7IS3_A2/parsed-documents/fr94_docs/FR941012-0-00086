FR941012-0-00086 FR941012-0-00011 V. Summary and Explanation of the Final Standard The revision of the pulpwood logging standard was undertaken in response to the concern on the part of OSHA to the number of fatalities and injuries that occur each year in the logging industry. The industry itself admits that logging is a high hazard industry. As discussed above, the injury and fatality incidence rates in the logging industry are among the highest industry incidence rates in the country. The OSHA pulpwood logging standard, 1910.266, addressed only the hazards that exist in the pulpwood logging industry. However, examination of the descriptions of accidents and other information available to the Agency indicates that the same hazards exist for employees performing logging operations regardless of the end use of the harvested trees. Many commenters supported the need for a comprehensive logging standard (Ex. 5&hyph;6, 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;41, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;49, 5&hyph;59, 5&hyph;61, 5&hyph;65, 5&hyph;69; Tr. W1 pg 21, 73, 202). For example, one commenter said that in Maine it has generally been acknowledged that both products (pulpwood logs and logs used for other purposes) come off the same job (Ex. 5&hyph;46). This final rule provides protection for all loggers involved in timber harvesting, including loggers employed as part of a mill operation, regardless of the end use of the forest products (saw logs, veneer bolts, pulpwood, chips, etc.). This standard fills the current gap in coverage by providing a basic level of protection for all loggers. OSHA has changed the title of 1910.266 from ``Pulpwood Logging'' to ``Logging Operations'' in order to reflect the wider coverage of this revised standard. In addition, OSHA has added and/or modified various provisions of the pulpwood logging standard to address more adequately the hazards faced in different aspects of logging operations. OSHA also has updated equipment specification requirements in the revised standard. Throughout the development of the revised standard, the Agency strove to promulgate a final rule that is effective, and that is simple, concise, enforceable, and sustainable. Paragraph (a) Table of Contents OSHA has added a table of contents to aid employers and other persons in using the revised standard. The table of contents identifies the provisions that are included in the final standard and where specific requirements can be found. The table of contents also is included because the final standard represents a significant reorganization of the elements of the pulpwood logging standard. The identification of the major paragraphs will, hopefully, aid persons in reading and understanding the requirements of this final rule. In order to add the table of contents, each of the subsequent paragraphs had to be renumbered. The paragraph references in the following discussion of the individual provisions of the standard are to the paragraphs of the final rule, unless otherwise noted. Paragraph (b) Scope and Application This paragraph defines the scope and application of this standard. The existing standard applied only to pulpwood logging operations. That standard adopted, pursuant to section 6(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the American National Standards Institute, ANSI 03.1&hyph;1971 Safety Standard for Pulpwood Logging (hereafter 1971 ANSI standard) (Ex 2&hyph;13). Included in the 1971 ANSI standard were requirements for important safety practices along with provisions pertaining to personal protective equipment, first aid and stationary and mobile equipment. When ANSI revised the 1971 consensus standard in 1978, they expanded the scope of the standard to include all logging operations. The revised ANSI standard adopted, virtually unchanged, many of the requirements of the 1971 pulpwood logging standard, and applied those provisions to all logging operations throughout the nation. OSHA has taken a similar approach in this rulemaking. In paragraph (b)(1), the Agency has expanded the scope of the pulpwood logging standard, 1910.266, and to cover all logging operations regardless of the end use of the timber products.
