ACTION: Notice of publication. SUMMARY: This notice constitutes the required quarterly publication of an index of the Administrator's decisions and orders in civil penalty cases. The FAA is publishing an index by order number, an index by subject matter, and case digests that contain identifying information about the final decisions and orders issued by the Administrator. Publication of these indexes and digests is intended to increase the public's awareness of the Administrator's decisions and orders and to assist litigants and practitioners in their research and review of decisions and orders that may have precedential value in a particular civil penalty action. Publication of the index by order number, as supplemented by the index by subject matter, ensures that the agency is in compliance with statutory indexing requirements.
