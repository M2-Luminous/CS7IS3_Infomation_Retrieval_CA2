BND director Konrad Porzner told (the Thursday edition of) the HANNOVERSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG that there was no indication that countries seeking to develop nuclear weapons had had any success in recruiting Russian nuclear weapons experts. "Nuclear smuggling from the former Soviet Union is not as widespread as portrayed in the media. As far as we are aware there is on the black market no material available for nuclear weapons construction, either in terms of type or volume," Porzner stressed during the interview. "It can be said with more or less certainty that the atomic arsenal is under the control of the armed forces there. We have no knowledge that the Russian mafia has any influence on nuclear facilities." Nuclear weapons were still sought after by other countries, Porzner said, and cited North Korea by way of example. However, Iran "is clearly striving for nuclear weapons" as well. Iran was already capable of manufacturing chemical weapons, he said. The German Government stopped nuclear cooperation with Iran years ago. According to security service information, there is still a threat to the states from worldwide organized crime. "The threat has been recognized but not banished," said Porzner. The 3,000 or so gangs in the Russian mafia had no access to nuclear material, "but there is no doubt that their influence reaches into administrative structures and authorities." [passage omitted]
