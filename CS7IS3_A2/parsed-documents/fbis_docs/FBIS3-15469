Unlike the Government, Oleg Poptsov Still Holds Television Dear"] [Text] Oleg Poptsov, chairman of the Russian Television Company, told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent yesterday about his vision of the new situation in the electronic media that emerged after the budget financing of television companies was slashed nearly four-fold against the requisite level. Television and radio company chiefs were invited to attend yesterday's government meeting. According to Oleg Poptsov, President Yeltsin dwelled on the electronic media in his address. His statement was in line with the ambiguous stance he expressed in his message to the Federal Assembly on 24 February: The state is no longer able to finance television and radio companies, but it is "important to make sure that Russia's information space is not torn apart and divided in the course of practical steps. A state television and radio channel must be preserved." The financial support the state is able to give the mass media this year, however, will hardly be enough to preserve the "information space." For instance, under a tentative agreement with the Finance Ministry, the "Ostankino" State Television and Radio Company could receive no more than 653 billion rubles [R] for 1994 instead of the R1.2 trillion it had requested. The Russian Television and Radio Company received R471 billion instead of the requested R910 billion. But now the initial two-fold cut has turned out to be four-fold. The Finance Ministry is going to appropriate only R679 billion for the federal companies, including "Ostankino," the Russian Television and Radio Company, and local television and radio companies. In Mr. Poptsov's view, these cuts in government subsidies show that the government's "mechanism of assessing priories is out of balance," and if the authorities do not see the mass media as a priority, "the cabinet must have lost either its hearing or its eyesight. Russia is still governed by the word, which alone can say if there are deeds in Russia or not." Mr. Poptsov said that he did not oppose joint-stock television companies, but he thinks that an across-the-board conversion into joint-stock companies is contra-indicated for Russian television groups. At any rate, in his opinion, the state should not quit the game so obviously. "It is possible," Mr. Poptsov noted, "that a lobby pursuing the interests of commercial businesses is trying to clear the 'television field' for a large-scale penetration. Naturally, the four-fold decrease in financing (and, hence, in air time) will mean that the volume of information on the government will be slashed proportionately: Why should we sacrifice movies or other programs that hold much greater interest for viewers."
