The now-famous extremist, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy took a first step a few days ago. Displaying one of his acolytes dressed in Serbian combat uniform he explained: With this uniform, but with Russian weapons, the Serbs will respond to every aggression.

[end recording] [Jentile] This morning, the Russian government also made its voice heard, questioning NATO's right to decide on air strikes, and appealing to the United Nations. A little later, the Russian Army announced that it was beginning early warning exercises [exercices de mise en alerte] for the headquarters of their strategic nuclear forces. For now, however, there is no question of crossing the boundary between exercises and reality: [Begin recording of Anatoliy Adamishin, deputy Russian foreign minister, in Russian, with superimposed French translation] What could we do if NATO were to carry out such air strikes?
