FR940505-2-00033 FR940505-2-00025 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [FRL&hyph;4881&hyph;7] Technical Review Workshop on the Reference Dose for Aroclor 1016 AGENCY: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of meeting. SUMMARY: This notice announces a workshop sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Assessment Forum to study the sceintific analysis underlying the Reference Dose (RfD) for Aroclor 1016, which appears on EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). EPA will use recommendations developed at this meeting to re-examine the RfD for Aroclor 1016. DATES: The workshop will begin on Tuesday, May 24, 1994, at 8:30 a.m. and end on Wednesday, May 25, 1994, at 12 noon. Members of the public may attend as observers. ADDRESSES: The Meeting will be held at the Barcelo Washington Hotel, 2121 P Street, NW., Washington, DC. Eastern Research Group, Inc., an EPA contractor, is providing logistical support for the workshop. To attend the workshop as an observer, call Deborah Kanter, Eastern Research Group, Inc., 110 Hartwell Avenue, Lexington, Massachusetts, 02173, Tel: 617/674&hyph;7320 by Friday, May 13, 1994. Space is limited. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Clare Stine, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Risk Assessment Forum (8101), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, Tel: (202) 260&hyph;6743. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Aroclor 1016 is a commercial mixture of polychorinated biphenyls devoid of dibenzofurans. In January 1993, based in part on a series of published reports on perinatal and long-term neurobehavioral effects in monkeys, EPA entered an Aroclor 1016 reference dose of 0.007 mg/kg-day into the Integrated Risk Information System. The IRIS entry states that, in general, the RfD is an estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a daily exposure to human populations that is likely to be without appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime. The purpose of the May 24&hyph;25 workshop is for EPA to collect expert opinions and recommendations from a panel of independent scientists regarding Aroclor 1016 data and the related IRIS entry. Although discussion of the RfD for any substance may present generic issues, this technical review meeting is limited to the science-based information and analyses relevant to Aroclor 1016. Larger issues regarding the generic RfD process are being addressed by the Agency as a separate effort (58 FR 11490; February 25, 1993). IRIS is an online database created by the Environmental Protection Agency and mounted on the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET). Registered NLM online services users are able to access IRIS and all other TOXNET system files through the COMPUSERVE, TYMNET, TELENENT, or INFONET telecommunication net works or by direct dial. 4 Dated: April 29, 1994.
