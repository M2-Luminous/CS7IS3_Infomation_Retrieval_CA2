FR940830-1-00013 FR940830-1-00002 The decision of the AA/MSB&COD to approve or decline an application for 8(a) program admission would then be based on whether the application, as clarified by any information submitted in response to a request by SBA, demonstrates that the applicant concern complies with each of SBA's eligibility criteria. While SBA would be able to request and consider additional information in processing an 8(a) application, SBA would not consider information gratuitously submitted by an applicant concern after it submits its application. This clarification is needed to streamline the application process and ensure that SBA meets its statutorily imposed time limitation for processing applications. Section 124.103 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (a) that would require direct ownership of 8(a) applicants or Program Participants by disadvantaged individuals. This statutory requirement is currently set forth in §124.109, but SBA believes that it should be added to this section for clarification purposes. Present §§124.103(a) through (j) would be redesignated to become §§124.103(b) through (k). Sections 124.109(d) and (e) would be similarly amended. Newly redesignated §124.103(i) (old §124.103(h)) would be amended to permit a former Program Participant to have an equity ownership interest of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business. Such a requirement would increase an 8(a) concern's ability to raise capital, while continuing to advance the economic viability of a former Program Participant after its 8(a) program term has expired. Section §124.104(c)(2) would also be amended to permit the principal of a former Program Participant to have an equity ownership interest of up to 20 percent in a current 8(a) concern in the same or similar line of business as the former Program Participant. Newly redesignated §124.103(j) (old §124.103(i)) would be amended to make clear that an 8(a) concern may substitute one disadvantaged individual for another without invoking the termination for convenience/waiver provision of §124.317 of these regulations with respect to any 8(a) contracts that it has been awarded on or after June 1, 1989. Provided program eligibility is maintained and SBA approves a substitution of one disadvantaged individual for another, performance of 8(a) contracts already received could continue without seeking a waiver under §124.317. SBA believes that the statutory termination for convenience/waiver provision did not intend to prohibit the performance of an 8(a) contract by the 8(a) concern that initially received it simply where there has been one or more approved changes of particular individuals upon whom eligibility of the concern was based. This change is necessary to apprise procuring agencies and 8(a) concerns that termination of 8(a) contracts is not required in such instances. Pursuant to proposed §124.103(l), SBA would aggregate the ownership interests of a business concern and its principal(s) in determining whether a non-disadvantaged individual or business concern exceeds the 10 percent equity ownership limitations (or, in the case of a former Program Participant, the 20 percent equity ownership limitations) established by §§124.103 and 124.104. This proposed rule would also add a new §124.103(m), dealing with the applicability of state community property laws on the respective ownership interests in an applicant concern or a Program Participant once admitted to the Program. This revision would not be a change in SBA policy. Section 124.104(a) would be reorganized for greater clarity and easier use. Of particular note, §124.104(a) would be amended to specify that one or more disadvantaged individuals who are determined to manage the applicant or 8(a) concern must be physically located at the offices of the applicant or 8(a) concern be open during the normal 40-hour work week of most business concerns. Thus, this proposed provision would require that the disadvantaged individual(s) be present at the location of the applicant or 8(a) concern during those hours and not, for example, only at night or on the weekends. This rule does not imply that business activities of the applicant or 8(a) concern could not be conducted by such individual(s) outside the offices of the applicant or 8(a) concern, nor does it prohibit a disadvantaged individual from establishing an 8(a) concern at his/her home. It is meant to ensure only that one or more disadvantaged owners devote full-time to the business of the applicant or 8(a) concern. Under this proposed amendment, SBA would not permit an individual to be physically located at a job which is separate and distinct from the applicant or 8(a) concern during normal business hours and claim that he/she is managing the applicant or 8(a) concern from that location. Section 124.104(b) would be amended along the lines set forth above for §§124.101(a), 124,104 and 124.206(a). This amended paragraph would specify that the Board of Directors must actually be controlled by disadvantaged individuals. The power of a disadvantaged individual to control the Board of Directors indirectly through his/her right to vote his/her stock (i.e., the power to remove and replace directors) would not be sufficient to establish control of the Board of Directors if non-disadvantaged individuals on the Board of Directors could control, or assert negative control on, the Board as currently structured at the time of the application for admission to the 8(a) program. This paragraph would also provide that non-voting, advisory or honorary Directors may be appointed so long as they do not possess negative control over the Board. Similarly, a separate board of advisors, particularly in the context of tribally-owned applicants and 8(a) concerns, could be established provided such board of advisors could not actually run the day-to-day operations of or possess negative control over the applicant or 8(a) business concern.
