Present at the meeting were Wu Guanzheng, Shu Shengyou, Huang Zhiquan, Zhou Zhiping, Zhang Yunchuan, Wang Maoheng, and Jiang Zhongping. Members of the provincial government and principal leaders of the relevant government departments also attended the meeting. Governor Wu Guanzheng chaired the meeting, which discussed and revised the government work, and reviewed last year's achievements. The report points out: The past year has been one in which the province maintained speedy national economic growth, in which major progress was made in reform, in which the people's lives continued to improve, and in which new progress was made in building the material and spiritual civilizations. Last year, the province's GNP amounted to 68.6 billion yuan, an increase of 15.8 percent over the previous year. Gross industrial and agricultural output value amounted to 122.1 billion yuan, an increase of 27.5 percent; of this amount, the gross agricultural output value was 38.8 billion yuan, an increase of 5.1 percent. This year is a crucial one for promoting the establishment of the socialist market economy structure, an important year for maintaining a good economic development trend, and a crucial year for accelerating the construction of basic facilities and industries and for promoting Jiangxi's economy to a new level. The provincial government asks the people throughout the province to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, to widen the scope of opening up, to bring about further development, to maintain stability, to move forward boldly with an enterprising spirit, to work hard and in a down-to-earth manner, to base themselves on agriculture, and to devote major efforts to industrial development so as to lay a good foundation for future development. In his speech at the meeting, Wu Guanzheng stressed: In economic work, we must bring economic returns into prominence. People in all trades and undertakings must pay close attention to improving economic returns and must work out detailed measures and objectives. There is a need for county-level economic development; for developing high-yield, high-quality, and highly efficient agriculture; and for accurately selecting projects and improving economic results in the development of town and township enterprises. In the meantime, it is necessary to continue developing the individual and private economic sectors, as well as the foreign-invested economic sectors. In the course of stimulating economic development, we should handle correctly the relationship among reform, development, and stability; accelerate the establishment of the social insurance system; strengthen control over government officials; improve the comprehensive management of social order; increase the masses' sense of safety; and ensure increases in the peasants' per capita net income and increases in revenue.
