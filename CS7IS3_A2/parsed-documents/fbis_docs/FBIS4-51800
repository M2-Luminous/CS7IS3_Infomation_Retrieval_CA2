He said, "Harmony is important not only among the cabinet members. I will see to it that state affairs are managed through our exchange of views with as many personages as possible from Chongwadae [presidential office] staff, outside figures, and those in the journalist circles." He made an extra effort to deny his image as a `conservative' and said, "The proof that any person or a group is alive is that such a person or a group is supported by his or its effort for change and reform," thus introducing himself to be a reasonable realist in pursuit of change and reform. The following is a compilation of the questions and answers in the interview. [Kim Chin-wan] As deputy prime minister of unification, you chaired the Unification and Security Policy Coordinating Committee meeting. Will you be standing aloof from the meeting as prime minister? [Yi Yong-tok] The Unification and Security Policy Coordinating Committee meeting is supposed to be chaired by the deputy prime minister according to the presidential order. I think this is sufficient. I will involve myself in it as prime minister only upon request. [Kim] The former prime minister instructed that the agenda of the Unification and Security Policy Coordinating Committee meeting should be reported to the prime minister. Are you revoking this instruction? [Yi] When I was deputy prime minister, I did not neglect reporting to the prime minister on it even before the instruction was issued. Irrespective of an instruction, reporting to each other and exchanging views with each other for the sake of harmony will help bring forth smooth operation. [Kim] What is your opinion of the worries about the weakening of the prime minister's office? [Yi] I do not think so. I do not know legal affairs much, but the prime minister is supposed to control the cabinet receiving orders from the president. I will see to it that things are pushed forward vigorously, taking care that self-control and creativity are respected. Harmony among the departments is important. [Kim] What will be the nature of the third cabinet? [Yi] It is a cabinet of reform in harmony. [Kim] What is your feeling about the stormy passage through parliamentary ratification? [Yi] It is not appropriate that an official from the government should comment on what happened in the National Assembly. The conflict between groups will last longer than the conflict between individuals. I personally feel that the past one week was a very memorable period of time. [Kim] Do you not have a plan to maintain the present senior officials of the prime minister's office for the sake of harmony? [Yi] (Looking to the senior secretary and the administrative coordinating director of the prime minister's office) What shall we do? I have these two dependable aides. I should continue getting help from these two gentlemen, shouldn't I? (laughter). [Kim] What is your opinion of the ethos of the present government officials? Are they excessively passive? If so, what are the measures to overcome this situation? [Yi] I do not think so. I think the government officials have firm resolve to carry out state affairs, though the degree of the resolve may vary between individuals. However, the reestablishment of official discipline may be necessary. Reestablishing official discipline, we ought to boost their morale at the same time. What is needed here is self-control.
