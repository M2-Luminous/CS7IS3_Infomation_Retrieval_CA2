After the investigations, he urged: We should concentrate energy, strengthen measures, have extremely great determination and daring, solidly and effectively do our work, and achieve the reform work of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. We should quicken the setup of the modern enterprise system and enliven large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. During his investigation and study activities in Jinan city, Jiang Chunyun, respectively, held forums with six enterprises with better economic results and four enterprises with bigger difficulties; and also inspected, on the spot, the Jinan [words indistinct] Corporation, the Jinan No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Mill, and the Jinan Beer Shareholding Group Company. At the [words indistinct] corporation, Jiang Chunyun affirmed the practice of using foreign capital to conduct technological transformation and building it into a new-typed new high-tech enterprise. He said that using foreign capital to conduct technological transformation is a shortcut to quicken enterprises' technological progress. At the Jinan No. 2 printing and dyeing mill that suffers deficits, Jiang Chunyun inspected, on the spot, the Shandong handicraft market which was set up after the mill had readjusted its structures. He praised this mill for transferring two thirds of its staff members and workers to the tertiary industry and also affirmed the second pioneering work done by the mill with 100 years of history. Jiang Chunyun said: Doing the second pioneering work is a revolution of vital importance to all money-losing enterprises. Facing the strained circumstances, we can neither fear difficulties nor adopt a wait-and-see attitude. We should pioneer ways by ourselves and tide over the feeling of fearing difficulties. Instead of waiting for and relying on others' assistance, we should press forward in the face of difficulties and rely on reform to seek existence, make development, and blaze new trails. On 7 February, Jiang Chunyun visited the Jinan beer shareholding group company. After hearing the report on the situation of enterprises in Jinan city and the speeches on enlivening large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises made by the provincial and city departments concerned, Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Enlivening large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises is the key point and the difficult point of reform. Whether or not the large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are full of vitality is a matter relating to the success of reform. Our next-step tasks are to accelerate the setup of the modern enterprise system, to positively explore new ways, to proceed from the reality of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises to solve a series of key fundamental problems, and to make these enterprises be full of vitality. To this end, Jiang Chunyun set forth that first of all, we should achieve the internal reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. Jiang Chunyun said: Reforming the property system is a prerequisite condition for setting up the modern enterprise system as well as the key point to promote the overall enterprise reform. Therefore, to promote the reform of the property system, we should vigorously encourage the implementation of the shareholding system, positively develop limited liability companies, and encourage the development of the state-owned and civilian-run small accounting units. The enterprises that are hopeless to halt deficits can be auctioned off and their ownership can be transferred. Jiang Chunyun stressed: In the course of enlivening large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, the governments at various levels and the mass departments should streamline the administration and delegate power to lower levels, resolutely and thoroughly delegate to lower levels the rights that should be delegated, and actually realize the turn from direct to indirect control. We should carry out policies to help enterprises eliminate the debts payable and to solve the problems that enterprises bear financial burden in supporting social undertakings. It is necessary to provide socialized service; to set up and perfect markets for production factors, intermediate service organizations, and social insurance systems; and to actually create fine external conditions for reforming and developing large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.
