"The President discussed with each leader ways to resume negotiations as quickly as possible," White House communications director Mark Gearan said in a statement. During the talks with Mubarak and Al-Asad by telephone, Clinton described his conversations Wednesday with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Clinton and Rabin Wednesday discussed ways to restart the peace talks and called on Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to resume the negotiations immediately. The Palestinians broke off the peace talks with Israel after the massacre by an Israeli settler of more than 40 Palestinians in Hebron two weeks ago. Gearan characterized Clinton's discussions with Mubarak and Al-Asad as useful.
