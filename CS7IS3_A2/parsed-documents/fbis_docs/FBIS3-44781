Spurred by this rapid growth, hard currency income from these export-oriented firms saw a sharp growth of 60 percent over 1992 totalling about 190 billion yuan ($21.8 billion). According to Qi Jinfa, director of the Bureau of Township Enterprise Management under the Ministry of Agriculture, total output and profits of rural enterprises both grew by at least 40 percent last year. The total output value of rural enterprises last year was expected to hit 2.9 trillion yuan ($333 billion) and total sales volume 2.6 trillion yuan ($298 billion). According to Qi, who was speaking yesterday in Beijing at the ongoing national conference on rural work the scale of township enterprises increased as more and more capital flowed in. It is estimated that at least 400 township firms had output values exceeding 100 million yuan ($11 million) and more than 300 had sales value topping that figure. With the deeper reform, the director pointed out more and more rural firms introduced shareholding or cooperative systems or formed enterprise groups to meet the needs of a more competitive market. About 10 percent of rural enterprises have become shareholding or stockholding cooperative companies while nearly 100 rural industrial groups were established across the country. "Township enterprises have played a significant role in the booming rural economy and in absorbing extra rural labour force," Qi said. China has 900 million rural residents, the most in the world, and more and more farmers have left the farm since the beginning of reform 16 years ago in an attempt to earn more money from nonagricultural jobs. Meanwhile, some 20-odd million rural enterprises are mushrooming in the country's vast rural areas and their output has topped one third of the gross national product (GNP) and more than 60 percent of the total rural production value. Last year, some 112 million former farmers were employed by township enterprises, up 6 million over 1992, according to Qi. And a total of more than 29 billion yuan ($3.33 billion) was injected by rural firms into the construction of infrastructure of various kinds in rural areas, making it a new and important investment channel for agriculture. Qi said at least 60 percent of farmers' increased net income last year came from rural enterprises. But some problems and difficulties still hinder the smooth growth of rural enterprises, Qi pointed out. He cited the shortage of funds as the biggest problem, in addition to the lack of talent, especially in the less-developed central and western regions. And the introduction of a market economy, new systems of taxation and other reform measures have also been a challenge to township enterprises' development, Qi added. The director said great efforts, including financial support, are needed to spur the development of the rural enterprises in the central and western regions.
