IF Note: The IMF says the loan is being delayed because of regional instability and fears that the funds can be used for non-peaceful purposes. The president says Armenia is not a party in the conflict and nor is it recognized as such by the international community. He pledged Yerevan's commitment to establishing peace in the region. Economics Minister Armen Yegiazaryan and Vice Foreign Minister Jirair Liparityan are due to go to Washington for a new round of talks with IMF officials to discuss the aid issue and the situation in Armenia. In the meantime, the local currency, the dram, plummeted by 30 to 40 points in Tuesday's sale. The dollar soared up to 130-140 drams on the black market on Wednesday and 1,000 rubles fetched 70-75 drams. Local experts say the setback follows government non-intervention in currency markets in the first days of the new year, a shrinkage in commodity supply, and the indexing of pay and incomes effective from January 1.
