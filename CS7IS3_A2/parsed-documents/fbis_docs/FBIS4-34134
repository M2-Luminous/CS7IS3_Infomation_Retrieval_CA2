The National Economic Council has decided to cut the national investment budget by $198 million because of the international financial institution's, IFI's, decision to withhold funds from Panama, including a loan from the Japanese Government that is tied to a World Bank loan. The reason for this decision is that Panama has failed to meet certain IFI conditions. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Jun 94) President Guillermo Endara has reported that at a special cabinet meeting on 9 June, it was decided that there will be budget cuts in all ministries totalling $269.6 million. Endara explained that the 1994 budget has been balanced, but that all ministries will face cuts. The ministries that will be most affected are health, housing, public works, education, finance, and agricultural development. The reason for the cuts, Endara explained, is that the IFI's have suspended the disbursement of approximately $270 million because Panama has failed to meet certain requirements, including reducing the state payroll. Most of the cuts will be in the area of investments. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 10 Jun 94 p 1) Planning Minister Delia Cardenas and Health Minister Jose Remon have sent a letter to Lewis T. Preston, president of the International Reconstruction and Development Bank, detailing Panama's lingering poverty problem. The letter states that although the Panamanian economy is making great strides, the gap between the social classes is widening and poverty remains at approximately 44 percent. Cardenas and Remon explain that Panama's economy grew by 9.6 percent in 1991, 8.6 percent in 1992, and approximately 5.9 percent in 1993. In 1992, the country's per capita GDP rose to $2,412 and investments increased 20.4 percent. The letter explains that the government's 1994 investment program earmarks 43 percent of its resources for social projects and that Panama is one of the Latin American governments that spend the most on health. The letter says an effort should be made to reduce poverty to 30 or 35 percent.

Meanwhile, Humbert said: "I believe the new government has shown signs that it will favor a national concerted effort, which is what we all want to make Panama better for more Panamanians."
