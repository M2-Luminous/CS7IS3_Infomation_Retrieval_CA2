The shares in the East Slovakia Foundries (VSZ), with a face value of 1.5 billion Slovak korunas ($45 million), were sold for 300 million korunas ($9 million), of which 15 percent was in hard currency. "Everything testifies to the fact that Vladimir Meciar's government continued right up to the end with its stunt-man style of privatization, creating the right conditions for (his) HZDS and for the return its people to the government, or rather to power in Slovakia," the daily writes. This privatization project was carried out "behind the veil" of the new VSZ leadership and "its grey eminence," ex-Finance Minister Julius Toth, who came to the ministry directly from VSZ, where he was an independent specialist, the daily writes, pointing to Meciar's statement on Monday that Toth was the only HZDS founder who had been silenced. "Today we can only guess how many millions for Vladimir Meciar's election campaign in 1992 came from the revenues of VSZ, when Julius Toth was `finance minister'," the daily writes. According to the daily SME, this is the reason for the sudden calling of a VSZ general meeting for Thursday, March 17, to discuss the privatization project and the "establishment" of Toth at the head of the foundries' supervisory council. A written statement from the VSZ management said only that the meeting was called at the request of the National Property Fund, which, as holder of more than 10 percent of the company's shares, has the right to call for a general meeting. "The purpose of the shareholders' meeting will be to change the status of the joint stock company and to change the membership of its supervisory council," the statement says.
