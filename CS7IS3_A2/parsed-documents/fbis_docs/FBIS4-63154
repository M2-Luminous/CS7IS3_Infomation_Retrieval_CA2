The appeal reads that "a six-year-old war of Armenia against Azeri nation worsened socio-economic and military-political situation and presently it also threatens to the state system." "We have to seek for peaceful ways to put an end to this devastating war." The deputies stood against "a wide campaign several political parties and media waged today." "We condemn the activities of those parties, which are aimed against the achievement of national unity and civil consent and which are not in the interests of Azerbaijan." The deputies consider Bishkek Protocol as a move aimed at end of the war and the achievement of peace in Azerbaijan. The document mentions that the signing of Bishkek Protocol does not mean that the UNO [United Nations Organization] and the CSCE will not take part in the peacemaking mission in the region since Russia cannot take part in the process of peace restoration alone. The deputies hope that "the Azeri Government will protect normal mediatorial efforts further more." The members of the Milli Mejlis accused the opposition of using Bishkek Protocol for political purposes, that is to cause instability in the republic and come to power. The appeal was when 17 members of the Milli Mejlis left the Parliament building in token protest of the intention of the authorities to accept the Russian settlement plan. The deputies consider that this plan infringe on Azerbaijan's interests and they will fight against its putting into execution.
