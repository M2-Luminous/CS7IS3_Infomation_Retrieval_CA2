How do you assess the safety standards of Temelin? [Blix] You would have to discuss this in detail with our safety experts. All that I can say is that the Temelin reactor is not a Chernobyl type. It is a heavy-water reactor whose construction and design resembles a Western one. Less sophisticated electronics were normally used for it. As is known, however, the Czechs entrusted Westinghouse with the development of additional control systems. I am sure that Prague's objective is to have a safety standard like in the West. [Bitzan] Do you think that Vienna's attitude, that is, massive influence on the nuclear policy of a neighboring state, is right? [Blix] I do not want to get involved in a bilateral Austrian-Czech conflict. Basically, every country is free to have the nuclear policy that it wants. If Austria -- in addition to Ireland, Luxembourg, and Denmark -- wants to be nuclear-free, this is its business. However, I am personally of the opinion that nuclear power will be indispensable in the future. Look at the Czech Republic. They know that their only alternative is more coal power plants. The Greens will tell you that the future power demand can be met by savings, wind power, and biomass. However, even such organizations as the World Energy Conference say that such views of the Greens are naive. [Bitzan] In your opinion, why does nuclear energy involve less danger than conventional energy? [Blix] In the long run, we only have the nuclear option. It was resolved in Rio to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions to the level of 1990 by 2005. But the reality is different. If the world fears the greenhouse effect, only nuclear power can be the answer. In addition, safety is today far greater than in 1986, for example, when Chernobyl happened. As far as nuclear waste is concerned, its volume is so small that it can be completely isolated and returned to the soil. This is in contrast to the enormous amounts of fossil residues that remain on the surface of the Earth and are forever toxic. They do not even have a half-life period.
