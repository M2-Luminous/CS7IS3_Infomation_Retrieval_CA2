From the roundtable discussion held at the Union of Writers of Russia on the topic of "Current and Future Position of Russia in the Context of the Current and Future World Situation."] [Text] [Begin boxed material] "The Current and Future Position of Russia in the Context of the Current and Future World Situation." That is how Aleksandr Prokhanov defined the topic of the roundtable discussion. The discussion was held at the Union of Writers of Russia with the participation of the newspapers ZAVTRA and SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA. The following writers, poets and politicians shared their thoughts: Aleksandr Zinovyev, Vladimir Maksimov, Valentin Rasputin, Petr Rozhanov, Eduard Limonov, Sazhi Umalatova, Viktor Anpilov, Mikhail Astafyev, Ilya Konstantinov, Valeriy Ganichev, Sergey Vikulov, Gennadiy Gusev, Viktor Smirnov, lawyer Mikhail Kuznetsov and a guest from Yugoslavia, Mother Angelina. The newspaper ZAVTRA will publish the materials of the roundtable in one of its next issues. We are selecting only two presentations, which define the essence and character of the discussion--those of the widely known philosopher and Russian writer abroad Aleksandr Zinovyev, and the remarkable current prose-writer, the firm patriot Valentin Rasputin. [End boxed material] [Zinovyev's speech] ...I am only an observer, but sometimes it is useful for someone looking from the outside to express his thoughts. From the inside, one cannot always see all that is going on. How do I evaluate the present-day condition of Russia?! I evaluate it--and I say this with pain in my soul, for me this is perhaps the most terrible tragedy of my life--I believe that the country has been murdered. Simply murdered. I categorically protest against the evaluation of this situation as being some natural process. Generally, that is what they say in Western propaganda: The system has exhausted itself, and so on and so forth... Nothing of the sort! There has been a murder, planned immediately after the end of World War II. It was carried out in a planned and systematic manner, pedantically. A strategy for the murder was developed, and worked out down to the most minute details. This was a murder from outside, but the murderers found fellow conspirators inside the country, and these murderers became the highest leaders of the country, the well-defined strata of the intellectual elite and the upper strata of Soviet society. They simply betrayed the interests of the entire people, the interests of our country. I use the word "betrayal" not in some moral sense, but as a precise scientific term. An unprecedented phenomenon in the history of mankind has occurred. There has never been anything like it. Just imagine that two armies have faced off against each other, and the commanders of these armies, the entire general staff, have all run over to the enemy camp and begun teaching the enemy how to defeat their own army. This is what has happened with our country. When I was writing the second part of the book, "The Crisis of Communism," which has now been published, I formulated this definition in my consciousness. Yet, although I understood this in my mind, in my feelings I nevertheless could not grasp the impending misfortune. I spoke of the crisis, but already then I should have spoken of catastrophe, of the most terrible catastrophe in the history of mankind. Sometimes it seems to me that I am living in some terrible nightmare. What situation has the murdered, plundered, raped, spat upon and insulted Russia found itself in relation to the rest of mankind? I always warn that I am not a politician, not a composer of plans for the future. I am merely a researcher, and nothing more. This is where my task end. I have always been guided in my research by a simple, banal principle: The truth at any price, whatever this may cost me. I can make a mistake. I can be accused of not knowing something, of not studying some question. Yet to ascribe certain intentions to me--that is dishonest. I have only one intention: In this sea of lies in which mankind is now entangled, ideological lies, to seek out by any means even a grain of truth. You must understand, this is unusually hard to do. In practice, the world does not want to know the truth about Russia and does everything possible to silence this truth. And if it does not succeed in silencing it, then it tries at least to localize it. And if it cannot localize it, then it tries to falsify it. I know of no other period in history when there was such a physiological hatred toward the truth, and not toward truth in general, but toward a fully definite property--the truth about the position and fate of Russia. It is as if everyone has conspired against it. Just imagine, somewhere in Australia they murdered a German tourist. The entire world is abuzz: Month after month, the TV and the press carry on about it for half a year... In Russia they murdered people before the very eyes of all mankind in the so-called White House--and that is alright! And if they do speak of it, it is with justification: This, they say, was necessary for the sake of democracy... I do not understand such hypocrisy. This is something which has no equal... I believe that the struggle for the truth here is task number one. To make known the truth about events in Russia, beginning with the first day, when the murder began, and up to the last. I believe that the events of 3-4 October 1993 were the final stab of the knife to the heart of Russia. Now an evaluation of the objective position of the country. I read an endless number of publications on this topic. All manner of plans are proposed, and their characteristic trait consists of the fact that Russia is viewed in isolation. They take it and look to see: What is possible, what will happen? When I express my thoughts, they say to me: "Oh, enough of this. Don't fall into such pessimism. There was, after all, the Tatar-Mongol yoke, but we survived nevertheless. There was the discord at the beginning of the 17th Century--but we withstood it. How difficult it was during the time of the Great Patriotic War, but we were victorious after all!" To this I answer: "It was a different enemy, and those were different times!" We do not have time to wait! The world has become such that to ignore Russia, to view it as something autonomous--means to evade the main question. The fact is that a global society has already begun to be formulated, or has already been formulated. The global world exists not as a series of autonomous regions, but as a unified society. Unified--not necessarily harmonious. In a family there are fights and quarrels. Sometimes they fight more than with the neighbors, but this is a unified society. Hundreds of thousands of international organizations permeate the planet in the most varied directions. There are world economic empires, which have extended their feelers into all corners of the planet. There is an ideological network which penetrates into the soul of each individual person, an informational one, etc. This global society exists, but it is not a brotherhood of equal partners, as the Western ideology and propaganda is trying to represent it. There is no such brotherhood! This global society already has a clear-cut hierarchical structure, a reticular structure. It is a very complex system which encompasses all of mankind. The West is the world hegemonic power. It is integrated, but already forms a single whole. But the West, once again, is not a brotherhood of equal peoples. It has its structure: The USA is the leader, a rank lower is the European Community, in which Germany has already ascended to the role of hegemonic power. On the next lower level are the dependant countries, say, of Eastern Europe. Or, say, France, Italy and England are one thing, and Spain and Portugal are another. They are also unequal partners, and below them come the dependant countries, and they also are dependant to varying degrees... After that come the semi-colonial countries, and then the colonial. And so, where is the planned place of our Russia in this global society? And where are they shoving us and have already shoved us quite successfully? Let our leaders beat their chests: "A great power, a great power." Yet all the while they are crawling on their knees. No! We are no longer a great power! We have been trampled and ground into the dirt, at the very lowest level of this world global society. This was planned from the very beginning. This was done consistently from one decade to the next. And, frankly speaking, I do not see how this violence can be opposed. Do not think that it is easy for me to pronounce these words. I am recounting the actual state of affairs, and then the question arises: What are Russia's possibilities for getting out of this situation? In my opinion, these possibilities are negligible, if indeed they exist at all. The state system has been destroyed. That which is being created is a mongrelized system of a colonial regime. The ideology has been destroyed. The moral and ideological state of the population have been destroyed. The culture has been destroyed. The youth has been demoralized, the next generation is being corrupted... We have never yet known such a total disintegration of a country, even when we devastated Germany during the Great Patriotic War. There has never been anything like this. From that war we emerged morally strengthened. And now? Is there a Russian army? In one of my interviews with PRAVDA on the eve of the shooting at the "White House," I said that it would shoot at its own. I have expressed my highly pessimistic view of the problem posed at the beginning of the discussion. Perhaps I am overstating things a bit. Sometimes this is useful--to focus attention on the gravity of the situation, so as not to deceive the people with optimistic promises. I believe that today it is more important to speak with the Russian people in just this way. I personally hold the following position: We are doomed, and therefore I as a Russian will fight to the end. Even if I am left one against six billion.
