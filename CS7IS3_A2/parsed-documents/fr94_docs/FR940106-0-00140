FR940106-0-00140 FR940106-0-00022 To give full effect to the 1988 Amendments, moreover, the EB work test must apply even after the TRA claimant has satisfied the requirement of Section 231(a)(5) by completing a training program approved under amended §617.22(a), (see Section C. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90). Having completed such training, the individual should be job ready, and should be actively seeking work so as to return to employment as soon as possible. It is particularly appropriate in these circumstances, therefore, that the EB work test of section 231(a)(4) should apply in regard to any further claims for basic TRA. It would not accord with these purposes to permit the claimant to avoid the EB work test by engaging in any other training that is not approved under amended §617.22(a). The Department has concluded, and the final regulations provide, therefore, that the EB work test must be met by every claimant for basic TRA, unless the claimant actually is enrolled in or participating in TAA approved training as specified in the Trade Act and in these final regulations. This requirement applies as well to claimants who have completed TAA approved training, with respect to any claim for basic TRA for any week beginning after completing the training program. For the foregoing reasons, no change is made in the final regulations. ( Note: section 202(b) of the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992 added paragraph (7) to section 202(a) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, which suspends the eligibility and requalification requirements of paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 202(a) for the weeks beginning after March 6, 1993, until January 1, 1995. GAL No. 7&hyph;93, 58 F.R. 21477, makes this change applicable to the TAA Program and should be used for guidance with respect to this issue. This change is not incorporated into the final regulations because it is a temporary suspension.) 32. Justifiable cause. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), commented on §617.18(b)(2)(i), regarding an individual who ``*␣*␣* fails to make satisfactory progress in training,'' and on §617.18(b)(2)(ii)(C), Justifiable cause, including reasons related to the individual's capability to participate in or complete approved training. The AFL-CIO recommends that, since educational limitations are a common reason for failure to profit from job training, such individuals should be promptly evaluated as to the need for remedial education, as authorized under the 1988 Amendments. Department's response. The Department agrees that training must be suitable for the worker. The fifth criterion in section 236(a)(1) requires a supported determination that a worker is qualified to undertake and complete the training being approved. See section G.1. of Attachment A to GAL 15&hyph;90 and section 4.G.1. of GAL 7&hyph;88, and §617.22(a)(5). This provision emphasizes the worker's personal qualifications; that is, that the worker's own physical and mental capabilities and background and experience are appropriate to the training. It states further that the worker must be evaluated before approving training as being qualified to undertake the specific training program being considered and to complete that training program successfully. If the worker needs remedial education, this should be identified and included as a part of the approved training program. If, during the training program, the need for remedial education becomes apparent, appropriate arrangements should be made to accommodate those needs as part of the same training program. Therefore, while the Department agrees with the comment, no change is needed in the regulations to accomplish this intent. However, the worker's personal qualifications in §617.22(a)(5) are amended by adding financial resources to the existing qualifications to undertake and complete the training being approved. Item J., above, explains the change and the Department's reasons for the change. 33. Satisfactory progress in training. The PDLI commented that several paragraphs in the proposed rule refer to ``making satisfactory progress'' in training. This language was amended in section 233(a) of the Trade Act effec- tive on November 21, 1988, to ``participating'' in training, and section 236(c) was repealed. The PDLI recommends that unless these sections refer to the law prior to November 21, 1988, this language only serves to confuse and should be revised or deleted. The UCSP and UAW made similar comments on the requirement in the proposed rule that the worker must have ``successfully'' completed an approved training program to meet the training completion requirement of amended Section 231(a)(5).
