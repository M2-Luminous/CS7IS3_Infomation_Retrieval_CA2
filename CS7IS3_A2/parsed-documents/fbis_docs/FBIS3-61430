N. Bulavenko; UDC 681.3.06] [Abstract] State-of-the-art in the development of computer systems with massively-parallel architecture is reviewed. Computers with a SIMD (single-instruction, multiple-data) and MIMD (multiple-instruction, multiple-data) architecture are briefly discussed. This category of architecture is subdivided in a large number of sub-groups including: systolic massive architecture, linear massive architecture, a matrix forming processor massive, etc. The particular features of some representative architectures and structures of high level parallel processing with simple and complex processor elements are examined. Along with various foreign made computers of average capacity with complex processor elements, functioning of the ``Intelligent Computer 1'' (IK-1) is described. This is a parallel multiprocessor system, for general application, developed in the Ukrainian AS Cybernetic Institute. Bit- sequential processing and role of Hypercube, Theta-Network, and Universal Readjustable type communication networks are also discussed. Figures 3, references 50: 3 Russian, 47 Western
