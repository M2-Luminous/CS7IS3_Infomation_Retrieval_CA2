"Ukraine's citizens want answers: Where are they going to store highly radioactive wastes adding up to 30-40 kilograms per tonne of spent fuel? Will they be safe during transport? Have the scientific problems of storing the wastes in Ukraine been worked out?" Ways to safeguard the wastes are the subject of our correspondent's interview with Dmytro Pavlovych Khrushchov, head of the Lithology Department, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Institute of Geological Sciences. [Correspondent] Dmytro Pavlovych, how urgent is the problem of storing radioactive wastes in Ukraine? [Khrushchov] The basic source of such wastes here is the operation of AESes [nuclear power plants], also the fallout from the Chernobyl AES disaster. According to experts of DKBYaE [State Committee on the Use of Nuclear Energy], the amount of radioactive wastes subject to burial in deep geologic formations by the year 2010 will be about 60,000 cubic meters. Plans used to call for sending the wastes to Russia for processing, but now Russia has a law banning the burial of wastes from other countries, so now we even have to take back the wastes we sent there earlier. There's really only one way to solve the problem: bury the hazardous material in our territory in suitable geologic formations capable of keeping it safely isolated from the biosphere. [Correspondent] How are other countries handling the problem? [Khrushchov] Many countries have been researching and experimenting with the problem for 20 to 30 years; the work is laborious and takes considerable capital investment. Active work is going on in France, England, and Spain, and Canada and Belgium have underground laboratories. Meanwhile, the practice is to place the wastes in special mine shafts for long-term storage. Germany has an experimental program of burying medium-radioactive wastes in salt strata. Other countries are looking into similar possibilities available to them: the Finns are studying granite strata in the Baltic Shield, the Dutch are looking into salt. The U.S. has excellent prospects in that regard in Nevada's Yucca Mountains, where the rocks and climate are right (very dry) and there are no local population problems, as they were moved out long ago because of nuclear weapons testing. [Correspondent] What are Ukraine's prospects? [Khrushchov] Ukraine has several options. A large part of its territory is on the Ukrainian Crystal Shield, and the Dnieper-Donets Depression has clay strata and salt. But it's hard to make the final choice. Problems of isolating and burying radioactive wastes in Ukraine's geologic formations have been discussed many times in recent years at inter-departmental meetings of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, the State Committee on Geology, the Education Ministry, and also specialists from the DKVYaE, the Nuclear Energy Inspectorate, and the Enerhoproekt [Energy Planning and Designing] Institute. In March 1993 the problem was discussed at a conference of the Ukraine Supreme Council Commissionon on Higher Education and Science, which confirmed the need for integrated research and the formulation of an appropriate state program. Now that program has been formulated, and these are its stages: I (1993-1995). Formulation of the conceptual principles and allocation of promising areas for reconnaisance work and selection of test sites. II (1996-2004). Study of regional, zonal, and local conditions; forecasting of the consequences of the construction and operation of underground radioactive waste isolation facilities. III (2005-2010). Preparation of the construction and experimental operation of facilities. [Correspondent] What do you think of the possibility of using nuclear blasts to make such storage places? [Khrushchov] At first I was tempted to try it. It would be so convenient--bang, and there's your facility. After detailed study, however, we decided the explosions would cause fissures, so we had to look for other ways. And we found them. [Correspondent] We've been talking about AES wastes. How about other kinds, for example military wastes? [Khrushchov] I don't actually know how things stand. I do know about the burial of military wastes in salt mines in the U.S., but I haven't had contacts with our own military. [Correspondent] Can the same methods be used in burying toxic wastes? [Khrushchov] The situation is more complex. Radioactive wastes do eventually cease being radioactive, but toxic wastes never do. I'm worried by the way some nonprofessionals try to solve these problems at one stroke. We need to make a sound choice between two approaches--processing and storage. Recently I was visited by colleagues from Russia who are developing a variant of toxic waste burial in the potassium mines of the Pre-Urals. Their concept is not bad, but I did criticize some approaches. [Correspondent] A final question. What do you think of the idea of burial sites where the area is already contaminated--the 30-kilometer zone? [Khrushchov] No way! It's foolhardy. Ideas like that stem from ignorance of geological conditions. We can only talk of burying low- and medium-radioactive wastes. We need to consult with scientists in order to avoid mistakes!
