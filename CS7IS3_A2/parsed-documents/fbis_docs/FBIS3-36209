The occasion was the arrival of deputy Gennadiy Burbulis to attend an academic symposium on regional security matters. He was admitted to a reception at the premier's residence and to the office of the head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The former Russian state secretary's visit to Japan last September left behind the best possible memories in Tokyo, based primarily on what Japan saw as Burbulis' constructive approach to the territorial problem. For this trip the pragmatic hosts did strip Gennadiy Eduardovich of the title of Yeltsin's closest adviser, together with the description "influential," but they were well-disposed toward the visitor nonetheless. Judging by available information, the meeting with the cabinet head lasted half an hour and was unremarkable. The visitor, placing special emphasis on the Russian president's efforts, set out to persuade the Japanese premier that the course of Russian reforms is continuing and is not going to change and that the new Russian Constitution that has been adopted lays the foundation for Russian political stability and creates an opportunity for the solution of a variety of problems, including bilateral Russian-Japanese ones. The host was rather more laconic and, having paid tribute to Yeltsin's visit to Japan last year, expressed the cautious hope that the reforms in Russia would actually develop and would not go off the road. Burbulis conveyed greetings to the Japanese foreign minister from Kozyrev, who expressed a wish for regular meetings with the head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry for their mutual benefit. Inspired by the greetings, Minister Hata responded by saying that he is prepared to go to Russia and is even planning such a trip, although he strongly linked the fate of the visit and its date to the results of the upcoming Russian-Japanese consultations at the end of February. If the results of these talks are satisfactory from Japan's viewpoint, Hata will definitely go to Moscow. What will happen if that is not the case the minister did not say, although it is easy to guess. Hata's linking the Russian visit to the outcome of the routine round of bilateral consultations with no earth-shattering tasks on their agenda is something new in the context of bilateral relations. It appears that the Japanese are tired of Russian vagueness and, fearful of Moscow's unpredictability, want to clarify matters, first by confirming the vitality and validity of all the accords that were reached during Yeltsin's visit to Japan last year. As far as one can tell, the Japanese scenario for the upcoming consultations is based on a kind of brief questionnaire demanding clear, unequivocal answers and opening with the number one question: Does Moscow acknowledge the existence of the territorial problem and is it prepared to continue the substantive dialogue on this problem? In view of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's well-known stance on this question, which is at odds with the president's, it is understandable that the Japanese should want things defined. In this respect, the terms set out by the Japanese foreign minister look perfectly logical -- you have to know who your are dealing with: the Moscow that went to Tokyo with Yeltsin, or some other Moscow, one that has altered since the parliamentary elections and the establishment of a government of red directors.
