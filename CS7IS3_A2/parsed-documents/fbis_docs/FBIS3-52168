[Peres] Good morning. [Gay] Is Israel really sick and tired of 'Arafat's antics? Has he really put us back to square one? [Peres] We are not sick and tired of anything. We offered the Palestinians a proposal which they accepted. Now they do not want to implement it, so let them wait. [Gay] What transpired between Cairo and Tunis? [Peres] In my opinion nothing transpired. The two delegations worked out a document of understanding which was publicized when Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] and I made a joint television statement. Now the PLO leadership must decide whether they accept it or reject it. If they decide to reject it so be it. [Gay] Is there a communication breakdown between 'Arafat and Abu-Mazin? [Peres] I do not want to deal with their own internal problems. The Palestinian delegation to Cairo was sent on behalf of the PLO, not Israel. I do not understand Yasir 'Arafat's claims. First, he demands that Israel fulfill everything it has promised. I want him to cite even one example of an issue which we have not fulfilled to the letter. Two, I do not understand the example he makes of the term Bantustan, because here everything remains open and within a short period we will have to discuss the future of the autonomy. I also explained to the Palestinians that they are not arguing over territory, but rather over time. 'Arafat is comparing the [Jericho] enclave to an Indian enclave. This is nonsense, because here everybody will be free to travel. They will also be given a police force which they have never had; they are also being given a Palestinian track inside the Israeli border terminal. I do not understand what he is talking about. We have seen several times in history, however, that the Palestinians have rejected opportunities. I hope they will not repeat the same mistake. [Raz] Mr. Peres, do you think the Taba talks should be resumed despite the fairly bleak description of the situation with the PLO which you just offered? [Peres] I did not paint a bleak picture. I think the current debate is within the PLO itself rather than with us. The debate with us has ended. [Raz] Do you think it is advisable to resume the Taba talks already this week? [Peres] We are not playing the offended party. The talks can resume this week or next week on the basis of the understandings reached. It is impossible to resume the talks based on that which runs contrary to the understandings. [Gay] You are saying that everything is now an internal PLO problem. Yo'el Singer, one of the Oslo agreement formulators, said that time is acting against all parties, because a delay could endanger the agreement and bring about the dissolution of the PLO. We will then find ourselves confronting dozens of small organizations unable to communicate with us. [Peres] I, indeed, believe the delay is a negative and unwarranted thing, but we are not responsible for it and we should not be held accountable for it. I want to state unequivocally that all the commitments we have undertaken -- to our Knesset as well -- we will fulfill to the letter. Regarding the Jericho enclave, for example, the Palestinians wanted access to the Dead Sea and to the Jordan River. We explained to them that we told the Knesset there will not be even one Jewish settlement in the Jericho enclave. Those who want access to the Dead Sea actually want to have Jewish settlements in the Jericho enclave. We told them that at the present stage of the negotiations we will not accept this. We also told them that Israel's defense line goes all the way to 'Ayn Fashkhah. It cannot be broken and we have no intentions of breaking it. We were consequently surprised by seeing this issue raised again. If 'Arafat compares the Jericho enclave to an Indian enclave, then Israel is certainly unwilling to turn the crossing terminal into an entrance to the Wild West. You must remember that all those crossing the border are not only entering the autonomy, but Israel as well. Once inside they can travel anywhere they want to. Our positions, therefore, are not capricious or arbitrary, but are rather to the point. This is also why the Palestinians accepted them. [Raz] Mr. Peres, are you not concerned by this pattern, wherein we reach some agreement and then return to square one because 'Arafat does not approve it. We saw Abu-Mazin stand by your side and nod his head in agreement when you spoke about the Cairo understandings. [Peres] Yes, this is why I said it is 'Arafat's problem, not ours. 'Arafat is entitled to reject it if he believes it does not serve the Palestinians' interests. Yet he must also question what his alternatives are. [Gay] He is nevertheless our partner. [Peres] Yes, he is our partner. If we cannot understand what drives 'Arafat, he at least must understand what guides us. We are guided by total commitment to every word we spoke and to Israel's security needs. [Raz] How can you be sure that after an agreement will be concluded and finalized they will not backtrack again? [Peres] The Palestinians should answer this question, not us. Israel is not divesting itself of anything. If there is no agreement we will keep everything we currently possess. [Gay] Are we participating in an oriental bazaar here? [Peres] I do not want to use any descriptions which deviate from the negotiations. I am conducting negotiations and I want to preserve the honor of the other party. Your description, however, is not far from the truth. We all find it painful to sit down, negotiate, agree, and then to have to say that no agreement has been reached. This is the strangest thing I have seen. Nabil Sha'th has sent us a draft with some stylistic amendments to the agreement. Now does this indicate that an agreement has been attained, or not? [Gay] Does this point to what we can expect in future? We might sign an agreement and then after we withdraw from the enclave they will retract and we will find ourselves in square one. [Peres] It takes two sides to reach an agreement, whereas nonagreement is an option of any of the two sides. If they do not adhere to the agreement there will be no agreement. The agreement exists as long as the two sides honor it. If one side tries to violate it there will be no agreement. This reciprocity must be preserved all along the way. [Gay] Thank you very much, Foreign Minister Peres.
