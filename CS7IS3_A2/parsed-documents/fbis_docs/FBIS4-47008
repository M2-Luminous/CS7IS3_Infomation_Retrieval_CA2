Therefore, let us, please, start with this: Does today's FCS have the resources for a serious--and most importantly, effective--fight against economic crime and corruption? One gets the impression that state security cadres are crushed or demoralized. Many can be bribed because life is hard and bribes are generous. Is there a program to combat economic crime--for example, one that would allow the netting of a whole mafiosi clan, freezing its bank accounts, arresting the leaders, neutralizing the musclemen, etc., in one day? [Stepashin] This year an economic counterintelligence directorate and corresponding local units have been set up within the FCS; their tasks include, among other things, the problems you mentioned. The system of economic counterintelligence was not created from scratch--it was build on the basis of BKK (suppression of contraband and corruption) units in the former Ministry of Security [MB], which had accumulated considerable experience in this work. Operational units recently were staffed by young operatives--FCS Academy graduates. People are in the mood for work. Of course, we lost a number of highly skilled specialists. Some went to work for commercial structures (our professionals are highly sought everywhere and offered salaries that sometimes are tens of times higher than what they were paid in the government service); some went to the tax police, where salaries also are one and a half to two times as high. And some simply got tired of endless reorganizations and uncertainty. I want to mention, by the way, that unfortunately our society has not yet realized that a poor--and hence weak--special service in the final count costs the state dearly. For instance, they calculate how much it costs to maintain us (which, by the way, is considerably less than in developed countries) and complain that this burden has to be carried by the taxpayer. A special service that functions normally, however, not only pays for itself but also saves the state enormous money. It is just that the results are not always on the surface for everyone to see. But such is the specificity of our work. For instance, you can calculate in rubles the gain from counterintelligence preventing a deal worth billions that is known to be disadvantageous for the state, or illegal exports of oil from Russia by train load. But how do you put a price on closing off a channel through which commercial information leaks to foreign competitors, halting the activities of a bureaucrat who takes large bribes, liquidating an international narcotics ring, keeping foreign crooks from participating in the privatization of a domestic plant, or keeping the authorities informed of concrete threats of a strategic nature in the economic sphere? A considerable part of our operational information along the line of suppression of economic crime and corruption is put to use through investigative units of other law enforcement organs (the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD], Procuracy, tax police, and customs). This fact is frequently overlooked. In unmasking dangerous manifestations of economic crime we also actively work together with internal affairs organs and the Procuracy. As to "netting" an entire mafiosi clan, technically this is not a problem for us. The tricky part is the law, which still does not define what constitutes organized crime and a criminal organization. As they say, you cannot nail down something that does not exist--so if there is no clan, there are no leaders and no bank accounts. What does exist are individuals committing (or even not committing) concrete crimes covered by the Criminal Code. To strong-arm groups we can apply Criminal Code Article 77 (gangsterism), but it covers "armed gangs intent on attacking state or public enterprises or individuals." As you can see, those who "quietly and peacefully" pocket illegal billions cannot be charged under this article. [Tretyakov] Few people in society doubt that corruption has reached the very top. But the FCS is not the former KGB; there are already special services of higher rank--for example, the presidential. Can the FCS effectively fight corruption in the top echelons of power under these circumstances? [Stepashin] Current legislation places corruption suppression in the top echelons within FCS competence, and the fact that there exist other special services does not keep us from carrying out our tasks. I will note in passing that I do not believe that there are special services of "higher" or "lower" rank. Although if you mean financial maintenance, then some Russian special services are indeed "above" the FCS. But we get "consolation" from the better skills and higher professionalism of our staff. This is what keeps us going. Speaking, however, of law enforcement organs whose interests may cross, our opinion is unequivocal: Monopolism in the sphere of combating corruption and dangerous types of economic crime is absolutely impermissible. Not only is there enough work for everyone--there will still be some left. Also, do not forget that corruption has penetrated law enforcement organs as well. [Tretyakov] Do you have a feeling that important information quite often is leaked from your agency and other agencies, and also that propaganda campaigns are launched that play into the hands of corrupt structures? [Stepashin] Our society has become more open today. Sometimes more than necessary. Nowadays some staff members of our agency quite often (perhaps too often) give interviews to the mass media. We have not had leaks of important information, though. In the country as a whole, however, such a trend regretfully does exist. What can one do... society becomes commercialized; information has become a commodity, too, and some bureaucrats are not above selling it. As to propaganda campaigns, we feel it very clearly these days. Criminal structures have enormous money, and propaganda also is an investment, and potentially very profitable. They gain a lot, for instance, from discrediting law enforcement organs and special services. They understand very well that the attitude towards counterintelligence on the part of not only the society but also of the president is formed to a large extent under the influence of the mass media. Discreditation is conducted both in general and on specific cases. In the course of investigation and trial in the case of an attempt to illegally export from Russia a large consignment of diesel fuel, there were frank attempts to discredit FCS investigators and operatives. Materials organized in the newspapers KOMMERSANT, SVOBODNAYA ZONA, and 24 portrayed special services as structures standing in the way of economic transformations, organizing persecution of "private" entrepreneurs. Along the same lines, through connections of the accused, a television report was organized. After the allegations had been checked authoritatively, the rulings on all complaints were in favor of the investigation, while the Baltiyskiy Rayon court in Kaliningrad indicted a group of persons on the charges of smuggling. There are quite a few such facts. There have been numerous actions of this kind in connection with the investigation of criminal abuse of an official position by the former head of administration of Penza Oblast--when his unlawful activities were made public some mass media presented it as an attempt to "discredit a democratic official." You probably noticed at the time the tidal wave of materials promulgating the theme that shadow capital will give a positive impulse to the national economy. As we can see now, there is no--and had not been any--impulse, while enormous unlawfully obtained capital had been successfully "laundered" and now every day we see on television the commercials of some companies, whose prosperity was built on an extremely questionable foundation. Here is an example of profitable propaganda. Alas, some newspapers, radio stations, and television companies actually turned into frankly commercial enterprises. I would like to use this opportunity to address the mass media: Do not be so omnivorous. Find in yourself the strength to refuse a good profit if the information offered to you leaves a bad aftertaste or comes from questionable individuals. [Tretyakov] Much is being said about economic crime and corruption, but I cannot recall any major or at least sensational disclosure, let alone a trial. What can the FCS show in this respect? [Stepashin] I do not agree with you. There have been and are disclosures. And will be. Examples? Here are some of the latest that I can now talk about. In November 1993, on the basis of materials of the former MB's Yaroslavl Oblast Directorate, at the oblast procuracy's request, A.F. Gusev, deputy head of the oblast administration, was dismissed from his job for participating in commercial structure activities for personal gain. In January 1994, the FCS's St. Petersburg city and oblast directorate initiated criminal proceedings against L.V. Savenkov, deputy mayor of St. Petersburg and chairman of the mayoralty committee on trade, public catering, consumer services and city food supply, who had attempted to organize the smuggling out of the city of 7.5 tonnes of caviar worth R40 million, as well as setting up production of a platinum group metal--osmium-187--for selling abroad. Among items confiscated from Savenkov were more than $10,000, other foreign currency, R3.5 million, credit cards and documents indicating existence of accounts in foreign banks, 15 kinds of foreign-made television and radio equipment, a Walther handgun with ammunition, and other unregistered weapons. On the basis of materials collected by the Russian FCS's Pskov Oblast Directorate, the Procuracy initiated criminal proceedings under RSFSR Criminal Code Article 78 (contraband) against A.I. Kabanov, deputy chairman of the oblast committee for the administration of state property, who had organized the smuggling of metals out of the country and weapons into the country. Eight persons were arrested with him. The materials were referred to court. The economic counterintelligence directorate has uncovered unlawful activities of a far-flung criminal association with the participation of central staff officers of the MVD and a number of other law enforcement organs (more than 20 persons altogether). In exchange for large bribes, they carried out the orders of professional criminal groups in the Moscow region--dropping criminal charges against their members who were under investigation for muggings, robberies, smuggling, and illegal possession of arms, as well as changing the measure to secure court appearance, reducing the sentence handed down by the court, and so on. Criminal proceedings were initiated and referred to the office of the procurator general of Russia. I would like to note that the experience of FCS units shows considerable difficulties that arise in investigating and stopping incidents of corruption among high-ranking officials, who actively use their official position, influence, and connections in higher echelons of power and administration to circumvent the measures aimed at unmasking and documenting their unlawful actions. It does not help to fight corruption in the top echelons of power that there is no legal--and much needed--mechanism to require persons authorized to perform state functions to declare their income, real and personal property, bank deposits, and securities. We also hope that the process of developing and adopting laws on suppression of corruption, organized crime, witness protection, and protection of members of law enforcement organs and special services will be speeded-up. [Tretyakov] How can the FCS help to solve the problem of holes in the borders--a very important problem in crime suppression? [Stepashin] The problem of holes in the borders is directly tied with the plundering of the national wealth of Russia. It is common knowledge on what an immense scale raw materials, components, and products are illegally exported abroad. Counterintelligence organs, within their competence, take steps in the existing circumstances to close the contraband channels. But the extent of the "transparency" of the borders makes it impossible to fight contraband effectively not just with our own resources and means, but also for the border troops, the customs committee, and internal affairs organs. Many issues need to be resolved not so much from the angle of "enforcement" agencies as through reducing the intensity of economic problems and regulation of export mechanisms. This involves first and foremost the transit of freight into Kaliningrad Oblast, a considerable part of which does not reach its destination and remains in the Baltic countries, from where it proceeds to the West. A major problem is bringing order into the entry, exit, and stay of foreigners, as well as persons without citizenship, in Russia. Today there is complete chaos in this. We can only guess more or less how many and of whom there are here. On the other hand, members of criminal groups, gangsters, easily obtain Russian foreign-travel passports in assumed names and travel abroad. We need a single interagency system of registration for foreigner entry, exit, and stay, an integrated electronic databank. This will enable us in principle to monitor the flow of foreigners, identify undesirables (terrorists, international crooks, persons wanted by Interpol and other law enforcement agencies) as they enter our territory. This, however, presents another problem. Such a registration system will only be effective if the border is "under lock and key." And what do we have now? We periodically run into a situation where known intelligence officers easily slip into Russia undetected through the borders of CIS countries, and we only learn of their presence here by accident. [Tretyakov] In this connection, what is the level and volume of contacts with the sister special services of CIS countries? [Stepashin] Being a legal successor of the Russian MB, including in matters of international cooperation, the FCS works on the basis of previously signed agreements on cooperation and interaction with special services and security organs of most of the CIS member states. We are doing some practical rewriting and preparation work to get analogous agreements with other CIS member states special services and security organs ready for signing. This creates and strengthens the contract-legal base for cooperation in the form of intergovernment and interagency international agreements. We maintain regular contacts with our foreign partners' representatives in Moscow, exchange delegations on the agency level, hold working meetings of experts. All of this permits the Russian FCS to interact with partners in CIS countries on various issues for the purpose of preventing harm to Russia's interests in political, economic, and military-strategic areas. Built on this basis, cooperation between special services produces concrete results. We have examples of successful counterintelligence operations conducted with partners from CIS countries in the sphere of disrupting illegal drug trafficking, combating terrorism, and smuggling arms and explosives. The cooperation that is developing along the lines of combating transborder organized crime also is producing results. In the sphere of economic counterintelligence, we work together on such matters as halting illegal exports of petroleum products from Russia, uncovering, preventing, and stopping crimes in the financial and banking sphere, ensuring security of transportation, and others. [Tretyakov] Can we hope that the FCS, while not ready today to deal a decisive blow to economic crime and corruption, at least is accumulating information that creates a beachhead for a future offensive? [Stepashin] First of all, I want to say that this problem has been neglected for too long. Therefore we cannot hope to solve it overnight. We work on the premise that we will have to conduct a protracted, so to say, trench warfare against economic crime, including corruption. This is the target we set for our operational directorates. Taking this into account, we currently considerably increased information analysis work. You see, in the new environment the economic mechanism in some elements develops spontaneously, which immediately is taken advantage of by dishonest businessmen and corrupt officials. It may not be very difficult to catch them red-handed, but to reveal the hidden springs of economic crime, its, so to speak, nature in different spheres of economic-financial activities is one of the most important tasks of information analysis work. We our analysts are oriented toward in-depth analysis of the information we receive, preparation of predictive evaluations, and conclusions for the higher political leadership of the country. They also incorporate proposals on changes needing to be made to legislative acts and normative documents in order to close the loopholes permitting abuse. This is, briefly, our contribution to, as you put it, the beachhead for a future offensive. By the way, although, as I said, in fighting economic crime we have always coordinated our work with other special services and law enforcement organs, with which we have signed (or are getting ready to sign) agreements on cooperation, it would benefit our common cause to delineate more clearly the sphere of competence between different agencies dealing with economic crime. [Tretyakov] Facts, versions, and rumors related to the murder and funeral of Otari Kvantrishvili undoubtedly plunged the society into pessimism regarding the balance of forces in this sphere. Everybody (or almost everybody) saw that today even the former KGB, let alone the MVD, is virtually powerless in facing the mighty "kingpins" of organized crime. Would you care to argue this? [Stepashin] Facts, versions, rumors--let us sort this out. Facts are the basis of versions that are now being developed by the investigative organs jointly with operational units. Rumors, on the other hand, which are spread mostly by journalists in the mass media, help to form precisely that kind of public opinion "regarding the balance of forces" that you are talking about. I cannot agree that these rumors "unquestionably plunged society into pessimism." My colleagues, who also are a part of society--and a considerable, active, and educated part of it at that--despite the absence of laws on organized crime (how many years have they been under discussion, and finally the State Duma recently adopted in the first draft the law on corruption), without sufficient material and technical support, and many other things that I will not enumerate because it has been said an uncountable number of times--today, loyal to their duty, do everything possible to disrupt the criminal activities of mafiosi clans without falling into the "pessimism" of feeling "powerless" in facing the "mighty kingpins of organized crime." And I must tell you that they are working in this direction increasingly more confidently and achieving the desired results. So, in my view, there are no reasons for pessimism. [Tretyakov] Democratic countries a have well-developed and efficiently operating system of parliamentary special service activities oversight. In your capacity as a deputy in the last Russian Supreme Soviet, you were one of the first people to begin to plant this practice on our soil. What is happening in this respect now? Who and how frequently will they inspect your agency; will you be presenting reports to special committees? How deeply, in your opinion, may parliament members get into your affairs? [Stepashin] The need for counterintelligence organ activity oversight is predicated on their role and place in the total Russian state security system and their use of specific forms and methods of activities in dealing with the tasks with which they are charged, and keeping in mind that carrying out certain functions does not involve a certain limitation of citizens' rights and freedoms [sentence as published]. The basis of the concept of overseeing counterintelligence organs activities must consist of two most important principles. First, it is a guaranteed observance of rights and freedoms of the individual in counterintelligence organs carrying out their direct functions, when restriction of rights is permitted only on the grounds, conditions, and in accordance with the procedure envisaged by federal laws, and only with respect to persons committing actions aimed at inflicting harm on individuals, society, and the state. Second, in carrying out and developing counterintelligence organ activity oversight forms, it is necessary to take into account their covert nature necessitated mainly by the specificities of combating intelligence and sabotage activities of foreign special services and organizations against the Russian Federation. There is no question that those carrying out oversight of counterintelligence activities must have a different scope of powers defined by their role and place in the system of state and society. Among those authorized to carry out such oversight within the scope of their powers established by the Constitution and other legislative acts of the Russian Federation are the president, the Federal Assembly, and the Russian Federation Government. There is also judiciary oversight. Currently, counterintelligence organ activity oversight is carried out by the Russian Federation president. The Russian Federation parliament has the right to oversee the use of the federal budget through the part of the means appropriated for the Russian FCS through the Accounting Chamber especially formed for these purposes. In addition, on matters of security, relevant Federation Council and State Duma committees may hold parliamentary hearings to which they may invite counterintelligence organ leaders. Judiciary control and oversight by the procuracy organs play an increasingly greater role and significance with respect to compliance with the law in counterintelligence organs carrying out their activities. [Tretyakov] What is the current "range" of FCS officers' pay? What percentage of officers leaving your agency do so for financial reasons? [Stepashin] Of course, any serious company strives to acquire a specialist who has received a good education, has excellent professional training, possesses knowledge and skills that are so much needed in the difficult situation that exists today, especially in the sphere of business. The so-called "range" of military rank pay for counterintelligence organ operatives is between R130,000 and R160,000. Otherwise, the cash pay of our officers, as well as of all Russian military servicemen, is set by the current legislation. If you take an "average" operative, that is, an officer with certain work experience, skills, years of service record, I can say that his cash pay does not exceed R280,000-R300,000 a month. Speaking the language of figures, for instance, in 1993 up to 29 percent of personnel were discharged at their own request and in connection with a transfer to civilian organizations and agencies. But I would not define the issue so narrowly. There is always a whole set of motives in leaving a job. I have to be honest: There are instances when officers who have developed a negative attitude towards the service decide to leave under certain circumstances--for example, after receiving lucrative offers from commercial structures. Does it create problems? Undoubtedly... For any special service the task of preserving and increasing the cadres' potential is a centerpiece issue. Its resolution affects to a large extent the coordination and effectiveness of counterintelligence organs operations. * * * When the answers to the questions submitted in advance were ready, I met with Sergey Stepashin and continued the interview verbally. [Tretyakov] Sergey Vadimovich, although you said (in particular, when you were in Kazakhstan and also in written replies to my questions) that the unlawful actions of a number of high-ranking bureaucrats--in the capital, as I gather--have been uncovered recently with the help of FCS; nevertheless, lately we have not heard of especially sensational resignations or trials. [Stepashin] You simply missed some resignations. For example, Kuntsevich, some functionaries in the State Committee for the Administration of State Property. [Tretyakov] I know of these, of course, but somehow did not connect them with FCS activities. Will you continue in this direction? [Stepashin] We work on it all the time. You see, we set two tasks for ourselves. It is the kind of prevention, where a case that is not fully documented is put to work, because we do not have a sufficient legislative base to get the case to court. This is a topic that has been beaten to death, but you understand very well that many cases simply fall apart despite the fact that there obviously is a crime--abuse of official position or economic (not in the old meaning but as it is currently understood). But it is practically impossible to prove it. Therefore we summarize the facts, and since I have the right to report directly to the president and the prime minister, I report it to them. And I can say that there has not been a single instance where a corresponding reaction did not follow. And second: Unlike our former vice president, I will never permit myself to mention a single name until a decision is made. This is a sacred rule; otherwise you are pushing me back into the 1930's. But I can tell you that there are a great many instances of this kind. The president now has signed several very tough edicts, which had been prepared with our participation; they will help in this work. I do not want to criticize the Duma--show me who does not engage in Duma-bashing these days--but for reasons you are aware of, right now it will not adopt such tough but necessary documents--there is a rather powerful lobby there that simply does not want them to come through. [Tretyakov] But then it follows that in the near future, until the new economic and political structure of the society settles in, crime, the mafia--call it whatever you like--will have a considerable handicap, will they not? [Stepashin] Undoubtedly. Both we and the MVD, working in new economic and political conditions, right now are behind in legal reinforcement. This is one thing. Another is that there is a group of people who by old socialist norms are law-breakers, but in reality are enterprising people, sometimes very famous, who, using loopholes in the law, not only make a lot of money for themselves but help others get richer. Where is that line? How do we find it? Americans have the same problem. It is an established democracy, as we call it, but, nevertheless, it is a fact that there exist large mafiosi groups in both the economic and political life of the United States. In 1991, I met with the FBI leadership and asked them: How do you fight this? Very simple: They have their own agent network, and moreover, certain agreed-upon rules of the game, which the criminals cannot violate with impunity. And they know it. And finally, the most important part: a perfect tax system. The latter we do not have so far. As soon as it develops, we will be able to work very forcefully and effectively. And, of course, the courts. This is what represents a headache today. We try to maneuver, talk about expanding rights of individuals, without understanding that today, in the environment of the disintegration of the USSR and the growing criminal element that is encroaching on political power, we have in some way given up the cut-and-dry understanding of human rights. I am not calling for a return to the 1930's, but survival of the society is at stake. Although in this we also have to find a certain line that justice cannot cross. [Tretyakov] I think there is a dramatic change taking place in the public mind now in its attitude toward the agency of which you are the head, even if we take its old name--the KGB. Some people, who in the past could not speak of this organization without hatred, devote expansive panegyrics to it and generally appeal to it as the last resort that can protect society and them personally from danger. Unfortunately, this shows that society is scared--and very much so--by what is happening. [Stepashin] You are right, the attitude is changing. And not only because people are scared (which unfortunately is true). No state service has undergone as much reforming over the past three years or has been X-rayed as much as the security service. I came into it in 1991 through the investigation commission on KGB activities, and I simply saw these people. And still it has retained its potential, and a certain integrity is still there. Wherever I go--and now I travel around the country a lot--the attitude is the same everywhere: We still trust them. And we have moved away from what we had been criticized for. The criticism was not against the KGB (by the way, this was a good acronym from the standpoint of contents--state security); the criticism was for one small part--the notorious Fifth Directorate that persecuted dissidents, and in fact very often stepped over the limit of the permitted and legal. But this was just a small part of the KGB--3 percent of its personnel. Although, of course, this was a real threat to individual freedom. However, we have to keep in mind three things here. That society was a closed one and this dictated certain actions of special services, which were secondary in relation to this function of preserving its closed nature. Second, and this is of principal importance for me. And by the way, President Clinton, addressing CIA personnel three months ago, actively emphasized this idea: Cooperation with special services is a sacred duty of every American citizen. Through such cooperation, including defending U.S. interests abroad, we defend the interests of all citizens of the United States of America. Is this a bad premise? And I know that a considerable number of U.S. citizens, including journalists, without being CIA agents carry out certain tasks for it, first and foremost of an informational nature. I consider it quite natural. And we also should use such channels. And the third, the most important part--the 1920's-1930's: repressions, terrible murders--nobody has any question that this was abhorrent. But this was mainly the work of the NKVD [People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs] and other organs. When we started looking into this, however, those who worked in the Committee for State Security became the fall guys, although they were mainly engaged in intelligence and many other things that constitute normal state functions. Now, after having worked here for several years, many things have become obvious to me. The reports, the most interesting memoranda that were going to Gorbachev, to the Politburo. I saw the latter's notations, the reaction--or, to be precise, most of the time the absence of any reaction. Apparently these things have become obvious to many people today, and that is why the attitude toward us changed. [Tretyakov] Since we have already wandered away somewhat from the economic crime topic, I wanted to ask you this question. Are there not too many special services in Russia now? To my knowledge, the so-called operational-investigative activities in Russia... [Stepashin] ...are a province of six entities. [Tretyakov] Now perhaps six, but in the Soviet Union there were only four. [Stepashin] One--only the KGB. [Tretyakov] Then we have to define more precisely what "operational-investigative activities" are. [Stepashin] Yes, there was the MVD, and the Procuracy, but all technical measures--only we, including for the MVD. [Tretyakov] And now there are six. And in the future, as far as I know, according to some plans--15 or 16. I think that when everybody "listens" to everybody, this creates more problems than security for the state. And, by the way, a much greater chance that these numerous special services will carry out tasks in the interests of internal political struggle than the state as a whole. [Stepashin] This is a difficult question. Where did it all start? The tragedy of the USSR disintegration. And when the question had to be decided on splitting up special services, the decision was generally correct--there should not be a monster, monopolization of the entire structure, including the operational-technical part, in the business of ensuring state security. At the time, I believe, the motivation was logical. By the way, it did not raise any particular questions on the part of anyone. Now regarding the current situation. That there are several services is good--there should be competition. This is a positive competition. But with respect to operational-investigative activities I agree: We need to reduce the number of structures that have a right to do this, because spreading the ability to conduct operational-technical measures takes these services from under control and I think that at a certain stage both the president and the government may lose this control. There is, however, another side to it, which is purely technical. We are somewhat behind in technology, but many commercial structures now have the ability to conduct the same operations, including tapping--today they are better equipped than we are, or even than the Main Protection Administration and the Presidential Security Service. We have to keep this danger in mind. In this area, technical countermeasures are needed. We have prepared a memorandum for the prime minister on this subject, regarding a tough control, and sometimes a ban, on what is being manufactured and sold in Russia in this respect. We talk a lot about banning arms, but this is also a weapon. Sometimes an even more formidable one--a psychological weapon, if you wish. As to these many services, in the law on the FCS that is now being prepared we will try if not to monopolize then at least to outline more precisely our primacy in conducting operational-technical measures. Even now we service a great number of MVD requests. We are now moving toward agreements between our special services. We have already signed an agreement with the SVR--the presidential protection service. Within the next few days we will be ready to sign the same kind of agreement with the Main Protection Directorate. There will be a whole package of orders in this area, including those issued together with the minister of internal affairs. Today, after three years of hiatus, we are coming to legal formalization of our relations. This is the first step. And this is our mutual desire, approved by the president. [Tretyakov] I would like to once again come back to the problem of borders. Actually, Russia currently does not have borders. [Stepashin] Russia does have borders. [Tretyakov] How transparent is the obviously existing apparent border between Russia and the Baltic countries? As compared, for instance, to the border between Russia and Poland in 1985? [Stepashin] Of course there are problems in this respect, but I think that before the middle of next year technically the borders will be tightly sealed. [Tretyakov] And what about Caucasus? [Stepashin] In the Caucasus, the situation is more difficult. On the president's behalf, I traveled to the North Caucasus republics in May. The latest trip was to Dagestan. There are numerous questions. Take for instance the border between Russia and Azerbaijan in Dagestan. In our opinion, it should be closed. The problem actually is not Azerbaijan per se but rather third countries--it is arms and many other things. We have different monetary systems. This causes substantial economic losses, first and foremost for Dagestan. This is obvious. But on the other hand... There are 200,000 Lezgins living on the territory of Azerbaijan, and 120,000, on the territory of Dagestan. Lezgins lived together for thousands of years. And now all of a sudden they will be told: This is it, a state border will cut through here. Their reaction is obvious. Two points are important here. First: Azerbaijan is a CIS state. Therefore all of this should be firmly taken to the interstate level, setting up joint protection of the Azerbaijani-Iranian border, including in the interests of Russia. Because the "transparency" of the border in the Derbent area is beneficial for both Russia and Azerbaijan. Second. What is more important: to declare that this is a state border or to enforce border regulations? The latter, of course. Therefore, we need to create conditions for normal contacts between inhabitants of border areas, but at the same time, having set barriers through customs, through border guards, through the FCS's operational capabilities, to keep the interests of third countries--both intelligence and contraband--from succeeding. In general, I would be very cautious in speaking of state borders with the former Soviet Union republics. I am deeply convinced that sooner or later we will be together. It will not be the Union in its old form, but to set a firm border means to draw a separation line both politically and psychologically. I talked on this subject, for instance, with Nazarbayev--he also supports this view. Kazakhstan's border with China? Yes, it needs to be closed. Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan? Yes, it needs to be closed. And with the participation of Russia. [Tretyakov] Sergey Vadimovich, I want to ask about a problem that seems very complex and acute to me. Moscow today has turned into something that Paris was in the 1920's, when the bulk of Russian emigration at the time concentrated there. But that was mainly the Russian diaspora. Today in Moscow, because the former USSR republics now have become independent states, we have at a minimum 14 diasporas, quite often also consisting of conflicting sides: pro-government and opposition Tajiks; Tajiks and Uzbeks; Dniester region residents and Moldovans; Azerbaijanis and Armenians; Georgians and Abkhazians, and so on, and so on. Not to mention the warring groups from our North Caucasus republics. All of them, by the way, have to "lobby" the Russian leadership, various government and parliamentary structures in Moscow. This means money, which can be obtained from drug trafficking, and on top of that arms. And controlling traditional Moscow criminal groups of "ethnic coloration." I will not enumerate everything--let me just say that they can start a real war against one another in Moscow. This is the situation in the capital city that is completely new for Russian special services, especially considering that special services of the former Union republics, even if they do not work here against Russia, have to keep an eye on the situation in "their" diaspora. [Stepashin] A timely question, because this problem exists and is becoming more acute, but we are only beginning to look into it. Yes, we know that there are such groups. Yes, we have some operational approaches through the prism of work against us on the part of special services of some CIS countries, but that problem which we have so far overlooked is a fact. We have looked habitually only at "classic" emigration--from China, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and so on. But we, much like the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have taken a long time to become aware that those people who come today from other CIS countries are no longer Soviet citizens, that is, they are not Russian in its current sense, and they may have their own interests. [Tretyakov] A question about our society "bearing arms" today. Since, as I assume, most weapons flow into private hands from the military, has the FCS established some control over the processes of weapons "leakage?" [Stepashin] I have a very good reason to believe that the bulk of arms do not come from the military. We do have these processes under control over there through military counterintelligence--this structure is subordinate to us. We do not always do it well, but nevertheless the system is in place. Considerable quantities of weapons were lost in the beginning, when the Soviet Union disintegrated, but unified armed forces still existed. This is when a huge number of "appropriations" occurred. A huge number! Quite enough to arm several tens of thousands of men. A smaller part was used to set up our own armed forces, and the greater part went into the market. This is the most important point. There is another aspect. As recently as a year ago there were many instances of uncontrolled production and sales of arms, including firearms, by many enterprises and organizations. Today it has been placed under control, albeit as yet incomplete. And the third source is the flow of arms coming as transit shipments through third countries. For instance, an Estonian commercial company purchased 300,000 TT handguns in China, which went into Russian markets. We catch them mostly in St. Petersburg--once we seized a consignment of several hundred handguns at once. But this is only one example. And fourth: I believe that we were too hasty in adopting the law on arms. I am categorically against selling arms to the population, because the population is not going to protect itself with these weapons--first and foremost they will end up in the hands of criminal elements. [Tretyakov] And the last question: on the "classic" presence of Western special services in Russia. [Stepashin] Nobody is making a secret of the trend for more vigorous activities by Western special services in Russia. This stems from three reasons. First: Western Europe and the United States are concerned about what is happening in Russia and where it may lead. Second--the economic difficulties, especially in the military-industrial complex, and the tremendous interest in our new technological developments. They know that we have great technological achievements on the level of the 21st Century. It is very easy to get your hands on them now. And the third reason is traditional. As long as the state exists, special service activities against other countries will continue. I am convinced that nobody intends to destroy Russia, but there are many who do not want this huge country, after it finally gets on its feet, to present increasing political and economic competition to the West.
