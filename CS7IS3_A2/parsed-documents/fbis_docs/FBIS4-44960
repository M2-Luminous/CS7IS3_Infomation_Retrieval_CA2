It is on the basis of these truths that relations between political movements and the principles of honorable men in the world have united and adopted firm positions in order to hoist the banner of truth and reject the system of Western trusteeship and hegemony over the free and independent peoples of the world. Part of the flowing river of live and battle-inspired friendships has been the relationship of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] to our Arab Socialist Ba'th Party. A party delegation from Iraq, headed by Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, member of the party's Iraqi Regional Command, represented the Ba'th Party at the general convention of the LDP, which was held during the last few days. Our newspaper AL-QADISIYAH held this interview with Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghafur in order that we learn more about his recent visit to Moscow: ['Ashur] You visited Moscow after the UN Security Council last month reviewed and discussed the subject of the blockade against Iraq and after Russia announced its position calling for lifting the blockade within the framework of this review [of Iraq's situation]. How was this Russian position reflected in your meetings with Russian political leaders? ['Abd-al-Ghafur] Through our meetings with party leaders, people representing political forces, and official leaders during our visit in Moscow we discovered that there is a common denominator among the opinions of the official leaders and some of the party leaders concerning the necessity of lifting the blockade against Iraq. This was summarized in the Russian position taken in the Security Council during the last review. The source of this position is the fact that Russia realizes what its interest is. Official and party leaders have asserted that continuing the blockade against Iraq would cause great harm not only to Iraq, but also to Russia and its people. It is sufficient for me to point out that Zhirinovskiy, leader of the LDP, as well as the vice president of the Russian Communist Party and Russia's first deputy minister of foreign affairs, have all asserted that the Russian people have expressed their support for the position taken by Russia in the Security Council because of the fact that this position is in the interest of the Russian people and expresses the adherence to the values of friendship that binds the Russian and Iraqi peoples. The expression of this fact came out clearly in our meetings, through the common denominator that we referred to, and due to the fact that Russia, at the official, party, and popular levels, feels that its interest dictates that it work toward having the blockade against Iraq lifted and achieving the implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. All this is in addition to the fact that there are common interests between the two nations. It is a known fact that there are extensive common economic and trade interests between Russia and Iraq that are governed by agreements that were in force before the tripartite aggression against Iraq. ['Ashur] Does this mean that Russian public opinion realizes what Russia's economic and political interests are and is urging Russia to move in the direction of taking a position vis-a-vis the blockade against Iraq? ['Abd-al-Ghafur] It is a known fact that one cannot totally separate politics from economics because of the close connection between them and the fact that they mutually influence each other. Due to this fact, there is a feeling which predominates among Russian circles--and which the Russian media, official leaders, and party leaders have begun expressing in one form or another--concerning the fact that Russia's international position should not be ignored. They say that Russia is a superpower and has international influence. These Russian official and party circles are attempting to assert this fact by means of taking some positions. At this point we could refer to the recent Russian position taken in Security Council meetings concerning the blockade against Iraq that shows a basic departure from the position taken by the United States. This is something that has happened for the first time. Russia announced its position, resembling that of China and France, which represents a positive development regarding the matter of continuing the blockade against Iraq and requiring the Security Council to honor its commitments within the framework of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. ['Ashur] In light of the present situation, what are your expectations concerning the Russian position during the next review to be held by the Security Council? ['Abd-al-Ghafur] In light of the situation that has cropped up in the international arena and Russia's attempt to define its role, we suppose that there will be a more positive development in the Russian position, during the next review, in the direction of implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, or at least with regard to setting a so-called "probationary period." Also, Russia has declared more than once that this matter should not be left unresolved, in accordance with the desire of Ekeus and the United States. ['Ashur] During your time in Moscow, you participated in the LDP convention as representative of our Ba'th Party. How do you assess the results of this convention on the various levels both inside and outside Russia? ['Abd-al-Ghafur] As we know, decisions made by parties in any particular country are that country's internal affairs, and what the LDP or any other [Russian] party decides is a matter that concerns Russia. However, the matter that concerns us is the LDP's position regarding the blockade against Iraq and the influence of the steadfastness of the people of Iraq, due to the leadership of our leader Saddam Husayn, on the direction taken by the convention. The convention reached a clear decision to undertake serious action to lift the blockade against the people of Iraq by means of exercising its influence on its bloc in the Russian parliament, the Duma, and by means of the ties of the LDP to the various political forces and other parties both inside and outside Russia. The LDP considers the people of Iraq to be a live example of the human struggle [being waged in the world], and the other parties and political forces also believe this. They consider Iraq to be a model of steadfastness and insistence, and they consider Saddam Husayn to be a symbol of the human struggle being waged against imperialism and U.S. hegemony. The LDP convention's final communique emphasized the necessity of resuming trade and economic relations with Iraq and breaking the unjust blockade being imposed on it, both because of the benefit that this would bring to the Russian people and because it would be in the interest of both the Russian and Iraqi peoples, and because this would strengthen the values of friendship existing between the two nations. When the speech for the Ba'th Party delegation at the convention was given, those present at the convention interrupted the speech numerous times with applause and cheers. They stood and cheered for Saddam Husayn. All the speeches by the delegations from parties and political forces from Germany, France, Bulgaria, and elsewhere saluted the positions taken by Iraq which has been steadfast in the face of imperialist hegemony, the delegations expressed how much they respect they had for the struggle being waged by the Iraqi people and their leader, Saddam Husayn, and they considered them to be an example to follow when confronting the so-called "new world order." Iraq's position, steadfastness, and progress in development and construction in spite of the unjust blockade were a source of admiration. Zhirinovskiy clearly referred to this in his speech, and this admiration was also shown, without exception, by those at the convention who represented the parties and political forces participating in it. In addition to this, support was shown by the remarks made by the members of the convention who expressed their admiration for the position taken by Iraq's leader and people. ['Ashur] Numerous political movements and parties have come up with a united platform that rejects U.S. hegemony over the world. How has this rejection been reflected in Russian public opinion, and did you find popular support for Iraq and for rejecting the political program of the imperialists? ['Abd-al-Ghafur] Party and official leaders in Russia have expressed their independent political opinion by means of their assertion of the fact that Russia was a nation that had strong influence over the course of international politics even before the emergence of the former Soviet Union. When they talked, they referred to czarist Russia and its influence in international politics and alliances. Then they would mention or try to assert that Russia currently possesses the elements of influence in international politics at least equal to the influence exercised by the former Soviet Union. I believe that this trend in what people are saying has been expressed by statements made by Russian leaders concerning Russia's positions vis-a-vis many international issues and positions and by means of what we have referred to concerning Russia's position regarding the Security Council's latest review of the blockade imposed on Iraq. This is also being expressed by the Russian media within the scope of the government and political forces, especially the parliament. ['Ashur] What is your assessment of the results of your visit to Moscow? ['Abd-al-Ghafur] We believe that the party's visit to Russia--which took place as a result of a resolution passed by the party's leaders in which it was mentioned that continual political momentum had taken place in the direction of lifting the blockade against Iraq--achieved its aims in terms of explaining and elaborating on Iraq's position and meeting its commitments to Iraq in the effort to lift the blockade. Russian leaders, both on the party and official levels, demonstrated an understanding of and appreciation for Iraq's positions as well as its responsiveness to Security Council resolutions. We hope that the Security Council's next review will more fully reflect the development and effectiveness in Russia's position with regard to the effort to lift the blockade. We elaborated on Iraq's role, the importance of its location, and its economic and cultural importance, since Iraq cannot at all be ignored. We also conveyed the fact that the values of the people of Iraq confirm Iraq's commitment to the positions of the nations, peoples, and political forces that have stood by Iraq in its struggle to lift the blockade. And we said that, with regard to trade and economic agreements, we will be mainly influenced by the positions taken by nations and companies vis-a-vis the blockade imposed on Iraq and their contribution toward lifting it. ['Ashur] Thank you very much, Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghafur, for giving us this interview. ['Abd-al-Ghafur] And I thank you and your esteemed newspaper AL-QADISIYAH.
