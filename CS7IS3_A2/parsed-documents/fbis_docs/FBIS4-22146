Sazhin] [Text] Despite measures aimed at the development of military industry and increasing the scale of research and development in the defense sector, India depends on the import of new technologies necessary for organizing production of modern types of weapons and military equipment. Advanced models of armament (main battle tank, light combat aircraft, helicopter gunship, missile systems) being developed in the country are largely based on foreign technologies. Thus, American or British-made equipment and assemblies are being chosen for an aircraft being created; a German power plant and transmission and a number of other systems and assemblies are being chosen for a tank being created. Overseas purchases of necessary technologies and materials, as well as combat equipment and weapons, are entrusted to the Directorate of Supply and Deliveries of the Department of Military Production and Deliveries of India's Ministry of Defense. The policy of import purchases being implemented by the Ministry of Defense today is determined basically by the economic feasibility of developing production of one or another type of weapon by Indian industry. At the same time, recognizing some technology or type of weapon as strategically important gives ground for allocating practically any amount for their acquisition. Usually, technical committees organize comparative testing in addition to a preliminary study of models and technologies planned to be purchased both in India and abroad. The decision to purchase one or another model is made only after expert examination or testing. Priority is given to technologies and materials used in the missile industry, new variants of weapons and military equipment, and spare parts for systems that are in service in the Indian forces. The total volume of imports of machine building products is distributed in the following manner (in percent): 17 for ships and vessels; 16.6 for control and measuring equipment; 13 for communications equipment; 12 for construction equipment. In addition, it includes aviation equipment, computers, boiler equipment, and parts and assemblies for motor vehicles. Petroleum, petroleum products, and petrochemical goods take up a considerable share in India's import balance (15 percent). About $3 billion were spend for these purposes in 1990. The percentage of steel and steel products delivered to the country is not great (3 percent). Large transactions for the purchase of import products exceeding 10 million rupees ($40,000 U.S.) are approved by a government body -- the Secretariat for Industrial Authorizations. Ministries, other government organizations, and private firms have the right to conclude agreements with foreign firms for lesser amounts. Industrial enterprises are authorized to import without licenses, drawings and technical documentation at a cost of up to 2.5 million rupees. More than 2,000 requests to purchase technologies abroad were submitted to the Secretariat for Authorizations during 1991. In order to attract foreign technologies, the government of India exempted from licensing joint ventures of 25 branches of industry located in backward areas of the country. At the same time, in the last seven years, imports of technologies virtually did not affect branches of industry associated with the production of military products. Metallurgy, electrical machine building, transportation machine building, and the services sector accounted for about 70 percent of the agreements on cooperation with foreign firms. On the whole, the percentage of agreements on technology transfer increased from 19 percent in 1984 to 27 percent in 1991, and the volume of foreign capital investments in the Indian economy increased 12-fold. The main developers and transferrers of new technologies in the country are: The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (includes 39 scientific institutes and laboratories and also two scientific associations), six specialized departments of the country's central government (science and technology, atomic energy, space, electronics, development of the ocean, environment, and ecology), organizations of defense research and development of the Ministry of Defense, branch scientific research centers of other ministries and departments, private scientific research centers (the largest belong to the groups Tata, Birla, Singhania, Sri Ram), specialized planning and design firms, and scientific research and development offices and laboratories of industrial enterprises of the state and private sector. The state plays the main role in financing all scientific research and development work, providing more than 85 percent of the expenditures for this purpose. The following countries have agreements on the transfer of technologies to India or joint ventures with India: the United States, Germany, Russia, Switzerland, Great Britain, Japan, France, Italy, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Canada, Denmark, and also Hong Kong. Agreements were concluded in 1991 in the amount of about 1.5 billion rupees (1.077 billion in 1987). The number of agreements signed with American firms has increased constantly: 148 in 1984, 189 in 1986, 217 in 1988, and over 200 in 1990. India's import-export policy at the current stage provides for 944 positions on a list of products authorized for import into the country under an open general license. This import practice extends to the software sector and other technical documentation in the field of information science. Duties on imports of computer programs have decreased 60 percent, but at the same time the maximum proportion of loan capital in capital investments increased to 80 percent. (This indicator is accepted as 60 percent for industry as a whole). For all types of goods, there is a widespread practice of pre- and post-shipment crediting of exports with a term of 6 months at the rate of 9.5 percent annually. Today the Indian leadership is encountering considerable difficulties in purchasing arms and military technologies abroad that have strategic importance. Restrictions of the Coordinating Committee (COCOM) for controlling exports of the latest technologies from NATO countries and Japan apply to it. These countries closely monitor to see that India's military industry and army do not receive access to the latest weapon systems. In addition, the West continues to be concerned that India does not transfer the technologies it has and products produced using them to third-party countries, primarily Russia and other CIS states. There presently are at least 150 American monitors in India monitoring observance of the provisions of the Indian-American memorandum on technology transfer (1985). At the same time, its leadership has more than once stated its desire to accomplish this monitoring independently, since the above-mentioned referendum does not contain any articles about conducting this type of inspections. Recently, this position by the Americans has led to certain difficulties for India and Russia when executing a joint transaction for the sale of cryogenic engines for missile systems. Indian programs in the area of creating ballistic missiles and also nuclear research are in obvious contradiction with the aspirations of the leading countries of the West to limit the proliferation of missile technologies in the world and also to narrow the range of states possessing nuclear weapons. At the same time, India advances the argument that its security today can be ensured only if it has at its disposal weapons which its neighboring states have. India's successful testing of the "Prithvi" missile system in September 1992 makes it possible to assert that the country is already able to produce missile weapons. This event caused considerable concern in the West. It is known that Soviet models of weapons and military equipment account for 50 to 70 percent of the armament of the Indian Army. According to the Indian press, its operation over a considerable period has demonstrated sufficient reliability and the necessary combat qualities. The simplicity of its servicing is also noted, which is also quite important for this country's army. Weapons received from the USSR underwent testing during combat operations in 1965 and 1971, and during operations conducted by Indian armed forces in Sri Lanka. Maintaining the achieved level of military and military-technical ties between Russia and India is important for both sides. The sphere of their cooperation may be expanded in the near future by the introduction of new forms in addition to tested forms, new ones taking shape in modern-day Russia.
