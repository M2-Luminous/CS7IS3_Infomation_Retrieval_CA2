U.S. Soil Conservation Service, Pond: Practice Standard 378, 1985. U.S. Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration, Engineering and Design Manual_Coal Refuse Disposal Facilities: Prepared by D'Appolonia Consulting Engineers, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa., 1975. III. Procedural Matters Effect in Federal Program States and on Indian Lands The rule applies through cross-referencing in those States with Federal programs. This includes California, Georgia, Idaho, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Washington. The Federal programs for these States appear at 30 CFR Parts 905, 910, 912, 921, 922, 933, 937, 939, 941, 942, and 947, respectively. The rule also applies through cross-referencing to Indian lands under the Federal program for Indian lands as provided in 30 CFR Part 750. Effect on State Programs Following promulgation of the final rule, OSM will evaluate permanent State regulatory programs approved under section 503 of SMCRA to determine whether any changes in these programs will be necessary. If the Director determines that certain State program provisions should be amended in order to be made no less effective than the revised Federal rules, the individual States will not be notified in accordance with provisions of 30 CFR 732.17. Federal Paperwork Reduction Act The collections of information contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance numbers 1029&hyph;0036, 1029&hyph;0039, 1029&hyph;0047 and 1029&hyph;0048. Executive Order 12778; Civil Justice Reform Certification This final rule has been reviewed under the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform (56 FR 55195). In general, the requirements of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778 are covered by the preamble discussion of the final rule. Additional remarks follow concerning individual elements of the Executive Order: A. What Is the Preemptive Effect, If Any, To Be Given to the Regulation? The final rule would have the same preemptive effect as other standards adopted pursuant to SMCRA. To retain primacy, States have to adopt and apply standards for their regulatory programs that are no less effective than those set forth in OSM's rules. Any State law is inconsistent with, or that would preclude implementation of this final rule, would be subject to preemption under SMCRA section 505 and implementing regulations at 30 CFR 730.11. To the extent that the final rules would result in preemption of State law, the provisions of SMCRA are intended to preclude inconsistent State laws and regulations. This approach is established in SMCRA, and has been judicially affirmed. See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Ass'n , 452 U.S. 264 (1981). B. What Is the Effect on Existing Federal Law or Regulation, If Any, Including All Provisions Repealed or Modified? This rule modifies the implementation of SMCRA as described herein, and is not intended to modify the implementation of any other Federal statute. The preceding discussion of this rule specifies the Federal regulatory provisions that are affected by this rule. C. Does the Rule Provide a Clear and Certain Legal Standard for Affected Conduct Rather Than a General Standard, While Promoting Simplification and Burden Reduction? The standards established by this rule are as clear and certain as practicable, given the complexity of topics covered and the mandates of SMCRA. D. What Is the Retroactive Effect, If Any, To Be Given to the Regulation? This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. E. Are Administrative Proceedings Required Before Parties May File Suit in Court? Which Proceedings Apply? Is the Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies Required? No administrative proceedings are required before parties may file suit in court challenging the provisions of this rule under section 526(a) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1276(a). Prior to any judicial challenge to this application of the rule, however, administrative procedures must be exhausted. In situations involving OSM application of the rule, applicable administrative procedures may be found at 43 CFR Part 4. In situations involving State regulatory authority application of provisions equivalent to those contained in this rule, applicable administrative procedures are set forth in the particular State program. F. Does the Rule Define Key Terms, Either Explicitly or By Reference to Other Regulations or Statutes That Explicitly Define Those Items? Terms which are important to the understanding of this rule are set forth in 30 CFR 700.5 and 701.5. G. Does the Rule Address Other Important Issues Affecting Clarity and General Draftsmanship of Regulations Set Forth by the Attorney General, With the Concurrence of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, That Are Determined To Be in Accordance With the Purpose of the Executive Order? The Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget have not issued any guidance on this requirement.
