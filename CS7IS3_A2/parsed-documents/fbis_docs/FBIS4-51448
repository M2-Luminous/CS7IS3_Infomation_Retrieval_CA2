State leaders, including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Zhu Rongji, attended the ceremony. Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said in his speech: We have successively appointed two batches of advisers on Hong Kong affairs since 1992. The past two years' experience has shown that the practice of appointing advisers on Hong Kong affairs has been successful. Shouldering a profound sense of responsibility toward the Hong Kong people and their future; utilizing their own talents, experiences, and advantages in their familiarity with various aspects of Hong Kong society; and applying various formats and channels, the advisers have made many valuable suggestions on some major issues concerning the final transitional period and on matters regarding the transfer of government in 1997 and a smooth transition of Hong Kong. They have played a very effective role as a think tank in the work of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, and even in affecting the central people's government's decisions on Hong Kong affairs. Meanwhile, Hong Kong affairs advisers have, by exerting their personal influence, played an active role in publicizing the Chinese Government's general and specific policies toward Hong Kong; have publicized the basic law; and have reassured people's feelings in general. Consequently, they have become an important link and network that facilitate connections and communications between us and the broad masses of Hong Kong people. Lu Ping said: The total number of the three batches of Hong Kong affairs advisers has reached 141. The contingent has expanded and has more extensive representativeness among its members. Pursuing the principle that Hong Kong affairs advisers have been appointed as individuals, we will listen to their proposals, and various different suggestions and criticisms; will make concerted efforts in unison; will properly perform the tasks together so as to realize our common objectives -- a smooth transition of Hong Kong and its long-term stability and prosperity. As 1 July 1997 draws near, not only the broad masses of Hong Kong people have not weakened their confidence in Hong Kong's future due to the Sino-British disputes over political system issues, but they have strengthened it. More and more Hong Kong people have demonstrated a profound sense of responsibility and involvement for a smooth transition of Hong Kong. Many friends have formed this conviction: Now that the Sino-British talks on political system issues have broken down, we must rely on our own strength [li liang 0500 6852] to ensure a smooth transition of Hong Kong. Such conviction has further enhanced our confidence in Hong Kong's future. Lu Ping stressed: Comrade Deng Xiaoping had said as early as a decade ago that "Hong Kong people will administer Hong Kong." In other words, "Hong Kong people consisting mainly of patriots will administer Hong Kong." He also pointed out that we should create conditions for Hong Kong people to smoothly take over the government during the transitional period. He urged "Hong Kong people of various circles to make efforts in this regard." We hope that upholding the stance on saying all they know without reserve as masters of their own affairs, Hong Kong affairs advisers will make valuable proposals on a smooth transition of Hong Kong, on a successful transfer of government [zheng quan shun li jiao jie 2398 2938 7311 0448 0074 2234] in 1997, and on maintaining long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. Zhou Nan, director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, presented the letters of appointment to the 49 new Hong Kong affairs advisers. Also attending the meeting were leading comrades Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen, Li Lanqing, Luo Gan, and Ji Pengfei.
