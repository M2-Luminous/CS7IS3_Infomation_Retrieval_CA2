Zyuganov Has Met With R. Nixon"] [Text] Gennadiy Zyuganov, chairman of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation [CPRF] Central Executive Committee and leader of the communist faction in the Federal Assembly State Duma, received former U.S. President Richard Nixon 8 March. An engaged discussion took place between them about Russia's internal political and economic situation and the prospects for Russia's development and for the development of Russian-U.S. relations. Having congratulated G. Zyuganov on the CPRF's success in the Russian Federation Federal Assembly elections, R. Nixon asked the leader of Russia's most popular party about his views on ways of extricating the country from the crisis, his assessment of the ruling regime's domestic and foreign policies, the CPRF's international ties, and its attitude to religion. The CPRF chairman unequivocally stated that the policy of so-called shock therapy is destructive for Russia and fraught with the possibility of social outbursts with unpredictable consequences for the whole world. At the same time, he noted that the Russian Communist Party will accept neither right-wing nor left-wing radicalism and is ready to cooperate with all political forces which stand for the revival of a strong Russia as a guarantor of peace and security throughout the world. "The reconstitution of a renewed Union, in which none of its peoples would have their sovereignty infringed, is only a matter of time," G. Zyuganov emphasized. The first stage in achieving this goal, he said, is to renew all ties between Russia and Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. The whole world will benefit from stability and calm being restored to this area, occupying one-sixth of the globe and packed with nuclear warheads. G. Zyuganov told R. Nixon about the permanent contacts between the CPRF and former union republics' communist parties and its international ties with more than 100 communist, socialist, social democratic, and other left-wing parties of the Old and New World. G. Zyuganov also noted that the CPRF and the whole of the Russian patriotic movement are uneasy about the one-dimensional nature of the U.S. approach to the political forces in Russia and the growth of anti-American sentiment in Russian society in connection with Washington's reckless support for the current executive, which is unpopular among the people; but they greet with enthusiasm the recently observed trend whereby the U.S. leadership is trying to gain a deeper understanding of the real situation in Russia. We have an interest, he said, in mutually advantageous cooperation on an equal basis between Russia and the United States, but on the condition that there is respect for the culture and spiritual values of the Russian people and the other peoples of Russia.
