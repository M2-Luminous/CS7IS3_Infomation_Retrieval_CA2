"A group of about 40 Khmer Rouge laid six mines along the track and after the train hit the mines, they opened fire on the carriages," Pich Kimsreang, the railway director, said. The engine was damaged and 11 coaches were derailed by the blast, he said. The ambush took place Thursday in the Bakan district of western Pursat province, he added. A firefight between the guerrillas and the railway militia went on for about an hour until the militia ran out of ammunition and ran to seek help from the local police or military, the director said. "The Khmer Rouge then occupied the train for about five hours and robbed all the passengers. They took all the valuable belongings including 10 motorbikes," he said. The guerrillas retreated when government forces arrived on the scene.
