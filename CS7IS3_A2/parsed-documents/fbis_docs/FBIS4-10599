FBIS4-10599 "drlat073_c_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-073 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 MEXICO Bishop Ruiz Cited on Status of Chiapas Talks Bishop Ruiz Cited on Status of Chiapas Talks PA1404161094 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 13 Apr 94 PA1404161094 Mexico City Radio ACIR Network Spanish BFN [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] [Text] Bishop Samuel Ruiz, from Cuautitlan, today talked about the peace negotiations in Chiapas. The bishop said that these negotiations are not bogged down. The bishop said that the conditions exist for continuing the pacification process in southeastern Mexico. In addition, he said that the rebel groups will not participate in Mexico's electoral process because they consider it an opportunity to achieve the transition to democracy. During the first working day of the Mexican Episcopal Conference's 56th full assembly, the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas in a news conference, together with Archbishop of Chihuahua Jose Fernandez Artiaga, and Bishop Luis Reynoso Cervantez of Cuernavaca, and [word indistinct] Altamirano Raul Vera Lopez, indicated that the Mexican Catholic Church agrees that peace, justice, and reconciliation in Mexico have priority. Many of the demands made in Chiapas have a national bearing, particularly in reference to Indian dignity and perfection of the democratic process in Mexico. Samuel Ruiz said that Camacho Solis, as representative of the federal government, and the members of the EZLN [Zapatista National Liberation Army] are very willing to continue the peace dialogue. In this regard, there are broad hopes, Samuel Ruiz said, for peace with justice to be achieved in Chiapas. To conclude, he made reference to the dialogues that have been set up between cattle men and businessmen of Chiapas to do away with divisions; particularly dangerous bellicose attitudes that prevent social peace in that southeastern Mexican state. Here is Juan Carlos Antoyo reporting from San Cristobal de las Cases: [Antoyo] Good afternoon, I would like to clarify that we are in Tuxctla Gutierrez. In our opinion, the bishop from San Cristobal does not seem to have knowledge of the last statements made with reference to this peace process by the EZLN, more specifically by Subcommander Marcos. Those reporters who have had access to the jungle, to the marking of the 75 anniversary of Emiliano Zapata's death, are under the impression, and Marcos assured, that currently, the necessary conditions do not exist for the dialogue to be resumed in Chiapas. They also said that while the EZLN remains on full alert it is not willing to carry out the internal consultation; therefore this is one more obstacle. One must recall that the EZLN had decided that to arrive at a decision on a second encounter, the internal consultation must take place first. This consultation has been suspended, this suspension has been in effect for approximately 20 days. Meanwhile I will tell you that the [word indistinct] Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno asked the National Commission on Human Rights [CNDH] to issue a recommendation on the investigations on the 21 persons under arrest. Twenty of these individuals who are at the [word indistinct] penitentiary have been on a hunger strike for 12 days. After visiting this penitentiary where these 20 persons, accused of belonging to and supporting the EZLN are incarcerated, the governor said that the recommendations made by the CNDH are very important for one who attempts to govern with social justice and to reestablish an agreement among the Chiapas residents. In a letter addressed to CNDH President Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, Governor Lopez Moreno indicated there are no doubts that the judicial system and the Attorney General's Office in general have acted in good faith and in keeping with the law. In order to clear up or eliminate any doubt, the CNDH resolution is therefore important. At the same time Marcos Arturo Lazar Villa, president of the Supreme Court of Justice of Chiapas, talked about the legal procedure that could be applied in the case of those 21 persons, among whom 20 are on a hunger strike. [Begin recording] [Antoyo] What is the legal situation they are facing? What can be done so they can obtain their freedom at some time? [Lazar] The defense attorney always tries to look for the alternatives for liberty. Currently, the alternatives prevailing are those that I have mentioned: the dropping of the charges, this corresponds to the Attorney General's Office. The amparo filed is another alternative; this is also being taken into consideration. There is also the possibility of [words indistinct] data. There are many possibilities available but everything depends on what the federal authorities will resolve. [end recording] To conclude, we want to report something that drew a great deal of attention. Today, during an interview with Milton Morales Arroyo, president of the local Congress, he said that the municipal presidents are partially responsible for the situation in Chiapas as they have forgotten a basic principle in politics, that is to respond to the people's demands. They have devoted their time to constructing public works, and in many of these mishandling of public funds has been detected.
