FR940426-1-00044 FR940426-1-00006 ATF is proposing to revise or add regulations in 27 CFR Parts 6, 8, 10, and 11, in areas suggested by the industry petition and in trade practice areas identified by ATF as appropriate for rulemaking. The proposed revisions and additions are discussed below. Scope of Parts 6, 8, 10 and 11 ATF is proposing to revise §§6.1, 8.1, 10.1 and 11.1 to reflect the recodification of the Federal Administration Act which included renumbering the trade practice section from section 5 to section 105 and to better reflect the function of the proposed regulations. Administrative Provisions in Parts 6, 8, 10 and 11 ATF proposes adding new regulations stating that ATF officers are authorized to examine relevant records of an industry member and to subpoena relevant records from any person. These new regulations would be codified as §§6.5, 8.5, 10.5 and 11.5. Current regulations do not contain any reference to ATF's statutory authority to examine and subpoena records and to require reports from industry members. Section 102(c) of the FAA Act (27 U.S.C. 202(c)) incorporates by reference the provisions of sections 49 and 50 of title 15, U.S.C. of the Federal Trade Commission Act which vests in ATF investigative subpoena authority and the right to examine and copy relevant data subject to an FAA Act investigation. In addition, section 102(d) provides authority to require such reports as are necessary to effectuate the purposes of the statute. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 49 and 50 as made applicable by section 102(c), ATF may examine, at all reasonable times, any documentary evidence which is necessary to determine whether the person, partnership, or corporation being investigated or proceeded against violated the FAA Act. The right to examine includes the right to copy any such documentary evidence. In addition, section 49 authorizes the issuance of a subpoena for any person, partnership, or corporation to produce records or give testimony relevant to an investigation of a violation of the FAA Act. In addition, pursuant to section 102(d) of the FAA Act, new regulations are proposed for parts 6, 8, and 10, authorizing the regional director (compliance) to require a letter report from industry members regarding information on sponsorships, advertisements, promotions, and other activities conducted by, or on behalf of, or benefiting the industry member. The reporting requirement will be used on a case-by-case basis, rather than as a recurrent and periodic reporting requirement such as a monthly report of activities applying to all industry members. ATF does not feel that a reporting requirement is needed for part 11, Consignment Sales.
