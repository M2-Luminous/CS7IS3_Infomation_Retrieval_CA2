Both agents, which act on lysosomes, inhibited replication of MV when added with the virus to the cell culture or used to pretreat the cells before exposure to the virus. Complete inhibition was obtained with 20-30 mM AC in a dose-dependent fashion, while monensin gave a maximum yield reduction (> 3 log units) at a concentration of 5 ï¿½M. Treatment of the cells with AC 1-2 h after adsorption was ineffective. Furthermore, blockage by 20 mM AC was precluded by exposure of the virus-cell surface complex to pH 4.6 for 10 min to induce membrane fusion. These observations were interpreted to favor endocytosis as the mechanism by which MV enters target cells. Figures 3; references 7: (Western).
