FR940503-2-00018 FR940503-2-00016 COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION Chicago Mercantile Exchange: Proposed Amendments Establishing a Report-Based Contract Month Cycle for the Live Hog and Frozen Pork Bellies Futures Option Contracts AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ACTION: Notice of Proposed Contract Market Rule Change. SUMMARY: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has submitted proposed amendments to its live hogs and frozen pork bellies futures option contracts. The proposed amendments will establish a ``report-based'' contract month trading cycle. Trading in each contract month of the cycle will occur only during a two-week period immediately preceding the release of the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) quarterly ``Hogs and Pigs'' report. In accordance with section 5a(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act and acting pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, the Acting Director of the Division of Economic Analysis (Division) of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) has determined, on behalf of the Commission, that publication of the proposed amendments is in the public interest. On behalf of the Commission, the Division is requesting comment on this proposal. DATES: Comments must be received on or before June 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Interested persons should submit their views and comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581. Reference should be made to the report-based contract month cycle for the live hog and frozen pork bellies futures option contracts. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Frederick V. Linse, Division of Economic Analysis, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581, telephone (202) 254&hyph;7303. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the existing terms of the live hogs and pork bellies futures option contracts, the CME lists ``regular cycle'' option contract months which are exercisable into each of the contract months listed by the CME for the underlying live hogs and pork bellies futures contracts. 1 Currently, all live hogs option contract months expire on the first Friday of the underlying futures contract month. All but one of the contract months listed for the pork bellies option contract expire on the last Friday that precedes by at least three days the first business day of the underlying futures contract month. 2 The CME presently lists for trading at all times the nearest five live hogs option contract months and the nearest four pork bellies option contract months. 3 1 For the live hogs futures contract, the CME currently lists the following annual cycle of contract months: February, April, June, July, August, October and December. For the pork bellies futures contract, the CME currently lists contracts months in the following annual cycle: February, March, May, July and August. 2 In the case of pork bellies, there currently are two option contract months based on the underlying February futures contract month: one contract month that expires on the last Friday that is more than three business days prior to the first business day of February and a contract month which expires on the third Friday of the November which immediately precedes the underlying February futures contract month. 3 For the pork bellies option contract, the CME lists the nearest five option contract months when one of the nearest five contract months is the existing option month that is based on the February futures contract month but expires during the preceding November. The pork bellies option contract's existing terms provide for the listing of 11 strike prices in intervals of two cents per pound at the commencement of trading in a contract month, including the strike price nearest to the previous day's settlement price and the next five strike prices above and the next five strike prices below that strike price. The pork bellies option contract currently provides for the listing of additional strike prices as necessary to maintain the listing of at least the next five strike prices above and the next five strike prices below the prevailing prices for the underlying futures contract month. The live hogs option contract currently provides for the listing at the commencement of trading in a contract month of all strike prices in intervals of two cents per pound that fall within the range of ten cents above and ten cents below the previous day's settlement price for the underlying futures contract month. In addition, the live hogs option contract currently provides that, when a contract month becomes the next-to-expire contract month, all strike prices that fall within a range of six cents per pound above or six cents per pound below the previous day's settlement price will be listed in intervals of one cent per pound. The live hogs option contract's existing terms also provide for the listing of additional strike prices as necessary to ensure that all strike prices at the specified price intervals are listed within the above-noted ranges of ten and, as appropriate, six cents above and below the prevailing prices for the underlying futures contract month. The proposed amendments would provide for the listing of a ``report-based'' cycle of contract months for the live hog and frozen pork bellies option contracts, in addition to the listing of the ``regular cycle'' of option contract months currently provided for in the contracts' rules. 4 Each report-based option will have a trading life of two weeks. Specifically, a report-based option contract month will be listed on the first business day of the calendar week preceding the week in which the USDA releases the quarterly ``Hogs and Pigs'' report 5 and will expire on the last business day of the week in which the report is released. 6 4 Under the proposals, the regular cycle option contract months for pork bellies will include both of the above-noted existing option contract months that are based on the February futures contract month. 5 These quarterly reports are released late in the months of March, June, September and December. The exact dates on which the reports will be released during a given year are published by the USDA during the last calendar quarter of the preceding year. 6 In some cases, the USDA Hogs and Pigs report will be released after trading ceases on the last trading day for the proposed report-based options. For example, the most recent Hogs and Pigs report was released at 2 p.m., Central Time, on Friday, March 25, 1994 (the USDA releases all Hogs and Pigs reports at 2 p.m., Central Time, on the scheduled release day, which typically is either a Thursday or Friday). The release time for this report would have followed the 1 p.m., Central Time, close of trading for live hogs and pork bellies on the last trading day of the report-based options for that month if such options had been available for listing during March 1994. In such cases, persons who hold report-based option positions after trading ends on the last trading day would have the right to choose whether to exercise such options into the underlying futures contract after the USDA report is released. In this respect, the option contracts' current terms permit persons holding option positions after trading ceases on the last trading day to submit to the CME a notice that they wish to exercise their report-based option positions until 7 p.m., Central Time, on the last trading day. For persons holding in-the-money report-based options, the option contracts' existing rules provide that such options will be automatically exercised by the CME unless instructions to the contrary are submitted to the CME by the option holder by 7 p.m. on the last trading day.
