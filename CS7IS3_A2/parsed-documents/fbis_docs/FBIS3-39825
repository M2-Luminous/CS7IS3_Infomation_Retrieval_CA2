The [party's] primary aims are to create part-time jobs in the health care sector and to combat crime. PvdA leader Kok intends to find this sum by restructuring the national budget. The PvdA is thereby boosting its commitment to combat long-term unemployment by increasing the funds earmarked for this purpose from 1 to 1.4 billion guilders. During the upcoming legislative period, [the party believes that] 35,000 additional jobs must be created for the long-term unemployed. However, yesterday, at the presentation of the PvdA platform, entitled "Samen aan het Werk" [Together at Work], Kok was unable to stipulate the budget lines along which cuts will be made. People within the party are reckoning on extra cuts being made in subsidies through applying priciples of profit, fighting against fraud, and paying greater attention to implementing the social security system more efficiently. With this platform, the PvdA wants to force national and local PvdA leaders to commit themselves over the next four years to enhancing efforts made to help the long-term unemployed get back to work. "An increasing number of people are out of work, while there is so much moonlighting being done. We must come to better grips with this," said Kok. The primary concerns include the financing, organization, and streamlining of rules and regulations. Kok maintains that there must be "greater flexibility regarding how allowances are used." The PvdA believes people receiving an allowance must be able to do "socially useful work." According to State Secretary H. Simons, the PvdA's leading candidate in Rotterdam, "obstacles to a higher levels of employment must be cleared away." Like Kok, he too believes that "social decline" can be combated by getting "people who were squeezed out of work some time ago" back to work. Just a few weeks ago, the PvdA announced that no further cuts were necessary.
