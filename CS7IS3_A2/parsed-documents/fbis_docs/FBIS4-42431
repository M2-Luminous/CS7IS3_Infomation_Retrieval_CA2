"The struggle against India could become a struggle now against Pakistan," said Mr Arzal Tahir, President of the Jammu and Kashmir People's National Party. There are signs of that already. Four members of Pakistan's National Assembly were hooted down at meetings in Birmingham and Bradford. The Pakistani embassy had to mobilize strong support to prevent this from recurring in Luton, north of London. Luton has a large population from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir [POK]. At a recent meeting at the School of Oriental and African Studies, where the Indian case was argued by former Foreign Secretary J N Dixit, several Pakistani speakers were strongly challenged as the Pakistanis presented their arguments about UN resolutions and human rights. Among those who challenged the Pakistanis was Mr Anwar Khan, who heads the Jammu and Kashmir Peace Committee. "There are so many flaws in their arguments, but people have been too scared before to challenge them publicly," Mr Khan said. He has been challenglng Pakistan's claims to Kashmir openly at meetings now. The mood is beginning to change, he said, adding: "There is a realistic element coming in now, a realisation that Kashmir will never go to Pakistan." The Pakistani strategy, he said, had been at first to encourage groups that sought independence. "Once the whole thing seemed to be gathering momentum, they put forward Tehriq E-Kashmir which wants Kashmir for Pakistan," he said. "Now many in the pro-independence groups are feeling betrayed." Most pro-Pakistan groups in Britain have membership from the Mirpur and Kotli districts of POK. They have Pakistani passports, which give the Pakistani High Commission a hold over them. "But even among them they are beginning to realize that Pakistan has its own agenda, and that they are being used," Mr Khan said. "This will not be a question of India or Pakistan but of democratic rule versus theocratic rule." A visible change is that groups opposed to Pakistan's claims have begun to come into the open. Dr S Durrani set up the Indo-European Kashmir forum two years ago primarily to speak for the plight of Kashmiri pandits [Bhramins]. Its members have now begun to campaign aggressively against Pakistan. "People were a little afraid at first because of the murder of Indian diplomat Ravindra Mhatre," Dr Durrani said. "But we have now put that behind us." Mr Khan's group and Afzal Tahir's group have also begun to speak critically of Pakistan's claims at public meetings. Mr Ifthikar Malik and Mr Mohammed Arif, two well known academics who oppose human rights violations in Kashmir, also oppose Pakistan's claims. The Pakistani lobby has also indirectly lost the support of British MPs.
