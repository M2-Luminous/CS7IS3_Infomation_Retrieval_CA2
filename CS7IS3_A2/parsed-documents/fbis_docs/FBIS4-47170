In accordance with a decision promulgated yesterday, import duties are being raised by several orders of magnitude on virtually all basic food products, including alcoholic beverages. The reasoning behind this action by the Ukrainian government turned out to be analogous to that taken by the Russian government. But whereas in Russia the introduction of the increased import duties was postponed until 1 July, in Ukraine they have already gone into effect. No matter how strange it may seem, the decision to introduce prohibitive import duties on food products was adopted at precisely the same time that the Ukrainian government officially announced that the decline of agricultural product output was continuing in this republic. (It is curiously interesting that two years ago, when the decline of production volumes in the agrarian sector was not so clearly expressed, decisions were taken on restricting the export of food products in order to protect the national consumer). Nevertheless, in accordance with the government's decision, the import duties on liquor-and-vodka items--as well as on drinking alcohol--rose from 50 to 350 percent of the contractual value, on chocolate--from 10 to 100 percent, on boiled sausage--from 20 to 100 percent, on meat and meat products--from 10 to 50 percent, and on sunflower-seed oil--from 20 to 60 percent. It is very evident that in the case at hand the government is pursuing purely fiscal goals--those connected with the critical condition of the Ukrainian budget. However, as some independent Ukrainian economists have conjectured, this measure will not exert any tangible influence on budgetary revenues. This is connected with the fact that the production cost of Ukrainian agricultural output is significantly lower than the analogous Russian output, as well as that being imported from beyond the borders of the CIS. And so one can hardly count on the fact that import volumes--and, correspondingly, the revenues collected from levying customs duties--will increase. Furthermore, in the CIS countries methods have been approved for quite some time now for avoiding the payment of customs duties so that traditional importers do not turn out to be losers as a result. The adoption of the present government decision, undoubtedly, would not have taken place without powerful pressure being exerted by the national producers of agricultural output (as likewise occurred in Russia at the time when the new import duties were approved). Ukrainian agrarians view the rise in import duties, on the one hand, as a possibility for increasing the sales of their products in the domestic market and--on the other hand (with the increase in prices on imported goods) as a possibility for sharply increasing the prices on food items being produced at Ukraine's enterprises. In any case, as a result of the increased duties, there will be a further upsurge of inflation--something which is already making the transition to hyperinflation. However, this governmental step could also have a positive effect--an improvement in the supply of Ukraine's major industrial centers with their own, domestically produced food items, as well as an increase in their export beyond the borders of the republic--first and foremost, to Russia. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |New Rates for Ukrainian Import Duties in Comparision With Presently Existing | |Russian Rates | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Item |Customs Duties (as a percentage) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Ukraine |Russia | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ethyl Alcohol |350 |150 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chocolate |100 |30 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Meat and Meat Products |50 |Duty-Free | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Boiled Sausages |100 |Duty-Free | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vegetable Oil |60 |5 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
