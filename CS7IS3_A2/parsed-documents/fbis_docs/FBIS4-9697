He believes such proposals are common in parties like Causa R when they do not win the people's support. "They try to eliminate all centers of free discussion and to denigrate all institutions. I think that proposal is not in harmony with the country's aspirations; we need forums for debate, centers for legislation, for the supervision of public services, not a totalitarian, dictatorial schema that is alien from any true decision-making by the people." Fermin thus expressed his absolute opposition to the proposal by Causa R's Deputy Pablo Medina and added that, as a democrat, a member of a party that wants a society in which all may participate and develop programs, he cannot support a proposal that is compatible with a totalitarian society, which propagates the view that the best thing is to eliminate parliaments, laws, and anything else that may be troublesome for minority groups that want to establish their power over the people and against the people. He believes that is the explanation behind Causa R's proposal. "This organization's behavior is contrary to the harmonious coexistence of the Venezuelan people." He said that Medina and his party have made an isolated proposal that will not go anywhere, "for this society has for many years grown accustomed to electing municipal councils, legislatures, mayors, governors, senators and deputies, all of which provide the foundation for popular representation."
