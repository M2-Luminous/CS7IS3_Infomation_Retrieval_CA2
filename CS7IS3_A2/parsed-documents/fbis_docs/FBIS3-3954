At a press conference after the close of the National People's Congress meeting, Li reiterated that China believes the problem should be solved through dialogue and negotiation, rather than pressure, when asked to comment on recent developments. He clearly reaffirmed China's opposition to the UN Security Council taking up the problem, because pressuring North Korea would not help the security of Northeast Asia but would only complicate matters and heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula. He also stressed Beijing's desire for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, noting that China as a signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty would never support an arms race. Li hoped other permanent members of the UN Security Council would support China's resolution on the North Korean nuclear issue.
