In 1994, the number of key projects in the province is preliminary fixed at 40 or more and the amount of planned investment is fixed at 10 billion yuan, an increase of 40 percent over that in 1993. In addition to the 20-odd projects, including the continued projects of the Shandong section of Beijing-Jiulong Railway, Yantai Port, Rizhao Port, and Dezhou, Weifang, Weihai, and Zouxian Power Plants, the expansion of Laizhou Iron and Steel Plant, and the projects of harnessing Huai He and Hai He, the province will also choose through screening some key projects from newly started large projects, such as the Shandong section of Jinan-Handan Railway, Jinan-Liaocheng Highway, Jinan- Dezhou Highway, Qingdao and Longkou Power Plants, Taian Chemical Industrial General Plant, Yantai Electronics [words indistinct] Plant, and [words indistinct]. To ensure that the funds needed by the above projects will be put in place in full amount and in a timely manner, the province will reform investment and money-lending systems. After the reform, construction projects will be divided into three major categories, namely, basic projects, technological projects, and competitive projects. Most of key projects belong to the scale of using the investment of a policy nature. The government will provide necessary manpower and material resources to make investment in these projects through economic entities and extensively absorb direct investment from foreign firms. Through [words indistinct] banks, the province will give preferential treatment and support to these projects in the fields of providing loans and issuing bonds. After the reform, the province will make a clear distinction between the investment rights of the provincial authorities and the governments in various cities, prefectures, and counties. Beginning from this year, the provincial authorities will primarily assume responsibility for the projects that have a bearing on the overall situation of the provincial economic development and the key projects that span several regions and spheres. The source of funds is primarily arranged by the state and the province, and a certain proportion of investment will be absorbed from various cities, prefectures, and counties. The funds arranged by cities and prefectures must be put in place on time. Otherwise, the province will arrange for new projects. The investment in basic projects of prefectures, cities, and counties should be arranged by the localities where the projects are located in line with the principle that whoever makes investment should be benefited. As for the less developed localities, in addition to gaining the state investment of a policy nature, the province will give an appropriate amount of subsidies. From now on, the government should gradually increase the investment in the competitive projects.
