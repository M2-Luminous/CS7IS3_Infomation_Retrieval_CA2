Aqazadeh who arrived here Monday made the remark in a meeting with the Japanese corporate leaders. Mentioning that Iran was the third crude oil supplier to Japan, he called for a greater market share in that country. Iran is the second highest crude oil producer among the 13 states who form the organization of petroleum exporting countries (OPEC) and the second crude oil exporter in the world. Iran is second in the world in terms of gas reserves, said the Iranian minister, adding that in the coming decade the country will become one of the major suppliers of gas and oil. Aqazadeh said Iran attaches special priority to meet Japan's needs in the oil and gas sector. He welcomed investments from foreign companies including Japanese for development of Iran's oil and gas fields in the second 5-year development plan (1994-98). Referring to Iran as an "important gateway" to the Central Asian republics, he suggested that the Japanese corporate manufacture their goods in Iran with the aim of exporting them to the Central Asian and Persian Gulf states. Aqazadeh voiced concern over the current situation of the oil market and said the price slump means a decline in the oil producers' income, slow down in their development coupled with more output to meet the world's growing energy demand, and finally lesser trade with industrialized states. The oil minister reminded that this would trigger an energy crisis in the future. The world today has no other way to put an end to its current economic malaise, except developing the economic interdependence among various regions, producers and consumers of energy, he stressed. Aqazadeh is to leave Japan for Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday on a 4-day visit.
