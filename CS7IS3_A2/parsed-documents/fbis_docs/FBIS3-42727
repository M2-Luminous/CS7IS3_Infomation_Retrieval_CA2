How might you evaluate the present situation in the region? [Kazimirov] "Karabakh" has, unfortunately, on the vast territory of the former Soviet Union, and beyond, perhaps, become a byword for ethnic and territorial conflicts primarily in the sense of duration, unlimited brutality, and irrationality even. This was not only the first armed conflict on the territory of the USSR but has also been the most protracted and bloody. I would put among its salient features the following: ancient historical roots and the gradual growth of a focal--more precisely, multi-focal--power conflict into a large-scale war; its expansion far beyond Nagornyy Karabakh, up to the borders of other states, to the dangerous brink of internationalization, and the massive use of modern heavy arms, including aviation, tanks, and other armored equipment, artillery, and salvo-fire missile launchers, very often against populated localities and civilian targets, what is more. Large casualties among the peaceful population, mass flows of deported and displaced persons, refugees, broad economic, power, and transport blockades infringing the interests of other states also, and flagrant and mass violations of international humanitarian law. All this makes simply imperative the need for a settlement of the Karabakh conflict, both speedy and lasting, what is more, which is possible now only with the active assistance and guarantees of the international community. These and other salient features of the conflict, including the parties' immense mutual distrust, irreconcilability, and inflexibility, and the general destabilization of the region are creating particular difficulties for an end to the bloodshed and a political settlement. Whence the need for impartial mediation and the limited nature of the peacemaking resources which may be engaged. Russia's mediation efforts are continuing with all due persistence and in the most diverse forms. The president and foreign minister of the Russian Federation are constantly keeping this issue in their field of vision. Messages between heads of state are being exchanged, and there are telephone conversations with them and trips by the president of Russia's special representative to the conflict region. A.V. Kozyrev's negotiations 18-20 January in Moscow with G. Gasanov and V. Papazyan, ministers of foreign affairs of Azerbaijan and Armenia respectively, and also with A. Gukasyan, representative of the leadership of Nagornyy Karabakh, were significant. A certain convergence of the positions of the antagonists on questions of the conclusion of an agreement on a complete cessation of military operations was noted. Mutual understanding concerning the intensive continuation of this work was reached. The military situation in the conflict zone demands this also. We regret that the new spiral of military operations has entailed heavy losses on both sides. This is unforgivable, especially since the negotiating process confirms the possibility of a peaceful resolution of all problems of the conflict. [Mekhtiyev] Nonetheless, could you describe in more detail the essence of the proposals that the leadership of the Russian Federation has addressed to the parties to the conflict? [Kazimirov] Since June 1992 practically our efforts have been concentrated on the accomplishment of a fundamental task--an end to military operations, total and universal, by way of the conclusion of an agreement among all the antagonists. We believe that this is the key to a resolution of other problems born of the conflict. This is dictated not only by natural considerations of humanity but also by a whole number of pragmatic considerations. We are insisting on an immediate termination of military operations, liberation of the captured territories, and the lifting of the economic and transport blockade and also on conditions for the return of refugees to the places they have abandoned. All this would create favorable conditions for the transition to the parties' political settlement of the contentious issues, including the definition and specification of the mutually acceptable legal status of Nagornyy Karabakh. I would recall that in April 1992 the parties to the conflict were offered an approximate outline of a two-stage settlement, which they received positively, on the whole. The expansion and intensification of the conflict in May-June 1992 held up the practical implementation of this plan of action and required additional measures on the part of the Russian mediator. New proposals of Russia aimed at de-escalating the conflict and normalizing the life of the peaceful population were handed over in June the same year. Russia's mediation efforts were stepped up particularly as of the fall of 1992. In developing the Sochi agreement between the defense ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia, which was of a military-technical nature, the parties were offered in October a draft political agreement on the principles and paths of a settlement in Nagornyy Karabakh. [Mekhtiyev] Is the Russian Federation coordinating its peacemaking efforts with the United Nations and the CSCE's Minsk Group? Some observers are conjecturing that there are certain differences in approach to a settlement of this problem between Russia and the CSCE Minsk Group. [Kazimirov] The activity of Russian diplomacy is closely linked with the peacemaking efforts of the international community. We are assigning the United Nations and the Security Council a particular role in a settlement and believe that it could grow. It is important that the Security Council and the UN secretary general have continued to keep events in this region in their field of vision. A mediation mission, which periodically visits Baku and Yerevan and also Stepanakert and Nakhichevan and conducts numerous meetings in Moscow, has been created especially for current business under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. Painstaking and quite diverse work is having to be performed along a broad front: first, directly with all the parties to the conflict, second, within the framework of the CSCE, which has created under its aegis the Minsk Nagornyy Karabakh Conference, and, third, individually with the participants in the Minsk Group and with United States, Italy, Sweden, and other states, including Turkey and Iran. There are no fundamental differences, I believe, between Russia and the Minsk Group in the approaches to a resolution of the problem. At the same time the Russian Federation is paying far more attention than the Minsk Group to the question of the formulation of an effective mechanism of the termination of military operations and is the most active in the framing, study, and detailed elaboration of this question. We are for the removal of all obstacles to the opening of the Minsk Nagornyy Karabakh Conference. We are concentrating particular attention on measures that could exclude the possibility of a resumption of military operations in the future. The Russian Federation is proposing the most practicable mechanism of assurance of a stable armistice in the region--the use of a disengagement force as a guarantor of observance of the armistice. [Mekhtiyev] Yes, indeed, Andrey Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation, has put forward an initiative--giving Russian troops in the region of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict and other "flash points" of the former USSR the status of peacekeeping force under the aegis of the United Nations or the CSCE. But the whole problem, as far as I understand it, is that Russia has as yet been denied a mandate for such operations.... [Kazimirov] It is a question wholly of the kind of peacekeeping resources that would be sufficient for dependably guaranteeing the armistice. If owing to the seriousness of the situation there could prove to be insufficient observers, the question of the use of a more effective means--a disengagement force--would arise. This could be a peacekeeping force of a third country, better, of several states, which would be capable of a multifaceted operation. Specifically, formations of European neutral countries with great experience of participation in peacekeeping operations along UN lines, Finland, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, for example, could be used as the disengagement force. But the main, obligatory condition for the commitment to the region of a disengagement peacekeeping force is the consent of all the parties involved in this conflict. And after a dependable cease-fire has been established, of course. [Mekhtiyev] The wording "neutral countries" unequivocally rules out, evidently, the possibility of participation in such an operation of such countries as Iran and Turkey, which have their own interests in the region? [Kazimirov] I repeat that the main condition will be the consent of all the parties to the conflict. If at least one of these parties objects to the participation of any third country in the operation or is altogether completely opposed to the commitment of a peacekeeping force to the region, this cannot, naturally, be imposed by force. [Mekhtiyev] But recent experience shows that the mere fact of the commitment of a peacekeeping force to some region of conflict without the elimination of the causes of the conflict itself does not always produce positive results. The commitment of peacekeeping forces in the Dniester region and South Ossetia, say, performed a stabilizing role, but there is another example also--the failure of the peacekeeping operation under the aegis of the United Nations in Somalia.... [Kazimirov] Each conflict has its own specific features, and the means that are applicable for the resolution of one conflict are ineffective in another. An analogy should hardly be drawn between Somalia and the Karabakh conflict. The KSDL [Senior CSCE Officials Committee] will shortly be studying the question of the use of a peacekeeping force of the CSCE members. This is a complex issue: the problems of the mandate and the funding of a peacekeeping force within the framework of the CSCE and international supervision of its activity need to be resolved in balanced fashion. [Mekhtiyev] What is the response of the parties to the conflict to the Russian plan for a peace settlement? [Kazimirov] We have the impression that each party to the conflict is becoming increasingly aware of the need for the use of the most effective means which guarantee a nonresumption of hostilities. The parties to the conflict are now acknowledging in words that it does not have a military, power solution and are calling this war senseless. We believe that such affirmations are insufficient and are insisting that they advocate precisely a settlement exclusively by peaceful, negotiated means and bolster this by practical action. It is time for the state and political leaders to adopt on this score firm commitments to their peoples and the world community. [Mekhtiyev] What topics were discussed in the course of your recent trip to Tehran? [Kazimirov] The consultations in Tehran were held on the initiative of the Iranian side. We responded to this proposal for the simple reason that military operations are being conducted in direct proximity to the borders of this state. We share the concern being expressed in this connection in Iran and other countries of the region. We agreed in the course of negotiations with the Iranian leadership, therefore, that the internationalization of the Karabakh conflict, so-called creeping internationalization, that is, the enlistment of a variety of mercenaries, fighters for the faith, and so forth included, was impermissible. This is fraught with the danger of a gradual expansion of the scale of the combat operations. Our states should aspire to constructive cooperation. [Mekhtiyev] As we all know, in the past year Russia has harmonized its mediation efforts with Turkey, but one has the impression today that there is a trend toward a lessening of contacts on this subject between Moscow and Ankara.... [Kazimirov] On the question of a peaceful settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict we are prepared to continue cooperation with the Turkish side, and if the need arises, consultations will be conducted with the leadership of Turkey also. [Mekhtiyev] Vladimir Nikolayevich, many attempts were made in the course of the past year to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, but none of these attempts was crowned with success. How realistic, in your opinion, is the achievement of progress in the course of Russia's present mediation mission? [Kazimirov] Attempts to resolve the Karabakh conflict at a stroke, at a rush, are doomed to fail--we have seen this repeatedly. This is why the mediation mission of the Russian Federation has put the emphasis on systematic work with the parties to the conflict requiring efforts and patience. A number of meetings of the president of Russia and of other Russian leaders with the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia and the leaders of Nagornyy Karabakh have been held. There have been visits by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to the conflict zone. There is every reason to believe that these peacemaking efforts will permit an easing of tension in the region. Russia's role in the process of a Karabakh settlement enjoys the positive appraisal of the parties to the conflict and recognition on the part of many states, including for objectivity and impartiality.
