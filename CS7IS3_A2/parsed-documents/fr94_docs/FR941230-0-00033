FR941230-0-00033 FR941230-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service 19 CFR Part 122 [T.D. 95&hyph;2] User Fee Airports AGENCY: U.S. Customs Service, Department of Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document amends the Customs Regulations to reflect the establishment of eight additional user fee airports. User fee airports are those which, while not qualifying for designation as an international or landing rights airport, have been approved by the Commissioner of Customs to receive the services of Customs officers for the processing of aircraft entering the U. S. and their passengers and cargo. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Peg Fearon, Office of Inspection and Control, 202&hyph;927&hyph;1413. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Part 122, Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 122), sets forth regulations that are applicable to all international air commerce relating to the entry and clearance of aircraft and the transportation of persons and cargo by aircraft. Under ยง1109(b), Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1509(b)), the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to designate places in the United States as ports of entry for civil aircraft arriving from any place outside of the United States, and for merchandise carried on the aircraft. These airports are referred to as international airports, and the location and name of each are listed in ยง122.13, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 122.13). In accordance with ยง122.33, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 122.33), the first landing of every civil aircraft entering the United States from a foreign area must be at one of these international airports, unless the aircraft has been specifically exempted from this requirement or permission to land elsewhere has been granted. Customs officers are assigned to all international airports to accept entries of merchandise, collect duties and enforce the customs laws and regulations. Other than if making an emergency or forced landing, if a civil aircraft desires to land at an airport not designated by Customs as an international airport, the pilot may request permission to land at a specific airport and, if granted, Customs assigns personnel to that airport for the aircraft. The airport where the aircraft is permitted to land is called a landing rights airport (19 CFR 122.24). Section 236 of Pub. L. 98&hyph;573 (the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984), codified at 19 United States Code 58b (19 U.S.C. 58b), creates an option for civil aircraft desiring to land at an airport other than an international or landing rights airport. A civil aircraft arriving from a place outside the United States may ask Customs for permission to land at an airport designated by the Secretary of the Treasury as a user fee airport.
