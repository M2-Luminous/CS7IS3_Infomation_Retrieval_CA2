Spanish experts in building materials-efficient housing are in Santiago de Cuba, where they will spend three days implementing a training program to turn out professionals who have mastered the technique. Eduardo Hernandez, head of the habitat commission of the nongovernmental organization (Sur) and Inez Sanchez, the representative in Cuba of that Spanish institution, exchanged views with the people of Santiago on the importance of moving forward in that specialized field. Graduate-level courses on restoration and materials efficiency in housing construction will begin in Cuban universities at the end of this year. The courses will last 15 days. It is hoped that, nationwide, some 500 technicians and 50 teachers will be trained in two years.
