He added that these measures were designed for most of the Latin American countries during an overall economic recession and when Central America had yet to act as a bloc. He said countries on the isthmus will have a greater negotiating capability when they strengthen their integration scheme and when the terms are based on their countries' reality "rather than simple standard guidelines implemented in the world." Zepeda Bermudez met with President Carlos Roberto Reina, with whom he discussed integration issues and the need to implement new development strategies in the area based on the countries' capability as a bloc. He said the six Central American nations will have less clout and strength at the negotiating table with regard to these measures if they act individually, because the area as a whole has a GNP in excess of $35 billion, which is equivalent to that of Chile. Referring to his rejection of President Reina's measures, the assistant SIECA secretary said no one can continue to believe in an institution that imposes general measures or thinks that the measures will be effective in Central America because they were effective in other countries. He said the area must have its own identity and it is necessary to discuss the situation with international credit organizations. He also recommends planning alternatives and a willingness to achieve development, which is what President Reina has implied, he said. Zepeda Bermudez said a social integration system is in its preliminary stages, complemented by the economic integration system which has existed for 33 years. He emphasized the importance of acting as a bloc, taking into consideration that this is the only way to face international financial organizations and the powerful countries' groups which have been created.
