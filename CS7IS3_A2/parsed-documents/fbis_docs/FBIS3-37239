Anatoliy Sobchak warned the West against believing in a Russia where reforms are at an end and where the nationalists hold power when he met the press in Oslo City Hall as one of the heavyweight figures in Russian political life. "Before I travel home on Monday I am going for a medal for the Russian team, because 60 percent of them come from the St. Petersburg area." He is patriotic on behalf of the 5 million people in the metropolis that was long called Leningrad. "The fact that half the officers and soldiers voted for Vladimir Zhirinovskiy the nationalist is a protest with a nonpolitical content directed against the conditions facing the soldiers who are being brought home from abroad. Often they have nowhere for themselves and their families to live; some of them have to move into tents out on the plains. These are people who in other countries have been used to good living conditions and some of their wages in hard currency. The important thing now is to get them good homes, also with help from the West. They must also be guaranteed civilian jobs, and here the authorities have set in motion a rapid program for the handing out of free land to officers and soldiers, and this is helping," Sobchak told AFTENPOSTEN. "The important thing that has happened in Russia -- as important as the revolution in 1917 -- is that in the elections in December we also adopted a new democratic constitution. This put a final end to the Soviet era; for the first time a Russian constitution contains guarantees of fundamental human rights. This -- and the fact that we had elections that were fought between several parties -- means more than Zhirinovskiy, whom the media in the West have blown up out of all proportion," he said. [Udgaard] But economic policy has been changed. The IMF is skeptical. "It has not been right to give loans from abroad to the government. It has not succeeded in using this money in a sensible way. Loans from abroad must be given directly to enterprises, to those who can increase production and earn money again quickly," Sobchak said. Now Norway's Kvaerner and a group of firms in St. Petersburg -- former military enterprises which today are looking for a new role -- are to come together to build a new installation for waste treatment in St. Petersburg, he said after a meeting with the Kvaerner management. He is prioritizing closer ties with neighboring regions in the Nordic area, and said with manifest pride that the borders are now so open that in 1993 for the first time there were more Russians who visited Finland than there were Finns who crossed the border in the opposite direction. This week Sobchak, along with his counterpart from Moscow, has been taking part in Oslo local council's conference on industry and commerce and he is hoping for more economic contacts. "I have met with Mayor Ann-Marit Saebones and we will try to bring the exhibition of Edvard Munch's portraits over to St. Petersburg. We ourselves want to send works from the Hermitage, the czar's magnificent art collection, and from the Russian Museum to Oslo," Sobchak said. Sobchak's stay in Oslo will last almost a week, with a detour to Lillehammer. But it is in fact NATO's supreme commander at Kolsas, British General Sir Garry Johnson, who has brought him to Norway -- and into the mountain where the alliance sits on its secrets. Not many Russians have been there as yet, as far as we know. Sobchak has taken part in the "closed" conference, Viking Review, and spoken on the subject of collective security in northwestern Russia and the Baltic Sea region.
