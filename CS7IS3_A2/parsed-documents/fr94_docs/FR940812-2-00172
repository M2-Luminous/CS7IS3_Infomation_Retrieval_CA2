FR940812-2-00172 FR940812-2-00065 LIBRARY OF CONGRESS Copyright Office [Docket No. RM 93&hyph;5A] Cable Compulsory License; Major Television Market List AGENCY: Copyright Office, Library of Congress. ACTION: Notice of policy decision. SUMMARY: In light of the 1992 Cable Act's direction to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to update the ยง76.51 major television market list, the Copyright Office is reaffirming its 1987 Policy Decision accepting Commission market redesignation for purposes of the copyright cable compulsory license. Broadcast signals entitled to mandatory carriage status under the FCC's must-carry rules in effect on April 15, 1976, as a result of a Commission market redesignation order, are to be treated as local signals for purposes of the cable compulsory license. The Copyright Office declines to take a position at this time as to the possible copyright effect of a future FCC reranking of major television markets. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective date August 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Eric Schwartz, Acting General Counsel, U.S. Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20559. Telephone: (202) 707&hyph;8380; Telefax (202) 707&hyph;8366. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On June 28, 1993, the Copyright Office issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) informing the public that it was considering the impact of the Federal Communications Commission's recent update of its major television market list, 47 CFR 76.51, on copyright liability under the cable compulsory license, 17 U.S.C. 111. 58 FR 34594 (June 28, 1993). The Commission's action, Report and Order in MM Docket 92&hyph;259, 8 FCC Rcd 2965 (1993), was in response to the ``Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992'' (1992 Cable Act) which adds a new section 614(f) to the Communications Act of 1934 requiring the FCC to ``update section 76.51 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations.'' The Commission amended three markets on the list by adding Chillicothe to the Columbus, Ohio market; New London to the Hartford-New Haven-New Britain-Waterbury, Connecticut market; and Rome to the Atlanta, Georgia market. 8 FCC Rcd at 2978. The Commission also announced that a major revision of the major television market list was not necessary at that time, and that any future changes would be made on a case-by-case basis. Id. The NOI fully described the history and copyright significance of the major television market list. See 58 FR at 34594 (June 28, 1993). To summarize briefly, the major television market list contained in ยง76.51 of the Commission's rules is a ranking, based on audience size, of the top 100 television markets in the country derived from Arbitron's 1970 prime time household rankings. Adopted in 1972, the list named the communities comprising each individual market 1 and related, inter alia, to the carriage obligations of cable systems under the former FCC distant signal and must-carry rules. With the elimination of the distant signal rules in 1981 and, especially, the invalidation of the must-carry rules in the Quincy Cable T.V., Inc. v. FCC, 768 F.2d 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1169 (1986) and Century Communications v. FCC, 838 F.2d 292 (D.C. Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1032 (1988) cases, the FCC no longer made changes to ยง76.51. The 1992 Cable Act 2 resuscitated the major-market list by requiring the Commission to update it. 1 Markets containing the names of more than one community are known as ``hyphenated'' markets. E.g., Roanoke-Lynchburg, Virginia. 2 The 1992 Act restored must-carry requirements, but adopted a different standard (``area of dominant influence'' or ``ADI'') for applying them. The Supreme Court has reviewed the must-carry rules and, while they currently remain in force, remanded them to the trial court to make factual findings justifying their retention. Turner Broadcasting, Inc. v. F.C.C., 62 U.S.L.W. 4647 (June 27, 1994). Section 76.51 has relevance for the section 111 copyright cable compulsory license in two ways. The first is in determining whether a broadcast signal is local or distant. Compulsory license royalties are determined, for the most part, by the number of distant signals a cable system carries. When Congress created the cable license in 1976, it defined a broadcast station as being local to a cable system when the station ``is entitled to insist upon its signal being retransmitted by a cable system pursuant to the rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on April 15, 1976.'' 17 U.S.C. 111(f). This passage is a direct reference to the FCC's 1976 must-carry rules, in which the major television market list played a significant role. Under those earlier rules, any cable system community within 35 miles of a market identified in the ยง76.51 list was subject to mandatory carriage of any broadcast station licensed to a community within the market. Hence, as provided by section 111 of the Copyright Code, cable systems in those circumstances may carry stations located within the major market as a ``local'' signal, thereby avoiding the distant signal cable compulsory license royalty fee.
