Russia will raise the matter at the next G7 summit in Naples, Chernomyrdin told a U.S. congress delegation in Moscow on Wednesday, government spokesman Valeriy Grishin said. He said the American delegation, headed by Republican minority leader Richard Gephardt, had expressed support for Russia's plan. Chernomyrdin also said his government was not putting all its hopes on foreign loans. He said the $1.5-Bn credit the International Monetary Fund had recently agreed to give Russia was mainly a political matter. He said there were those in the United States who sought to restrict Russia's access to the world market and undermine its role there. What Russia wants is not easy terms but equal partnership in trade, he said. Grishin said that at the meeting, held behind closed doors, the U.S. delegation had expressed support for the Chernomyrdin government's policy of reform and that Gephardt had promised to make a public appeal to America's business community "not to be afraid to invest in the Russian economy."
