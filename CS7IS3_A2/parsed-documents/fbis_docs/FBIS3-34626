The "threat assessment" paper, released at a recent meeting of the consultative committee attached to the Defence Ministry, has drawn attention to the massive Pakistani military build up in recent years and termed it serious. Describing Pakistan as a major military threat, the note warns: "Its internal compulsions and the narrowing edge (of the Pakistani forces) vis-a-vis our armed forces may tempt it to resort to a military option at an opportune time. This could come about if it perceives India to be weak-willed and embroiled in internal turmoil.' The Defence Ministry points out that from the 1987 peak budgetary allocation for the Indian armed forces has been declining in real terms every year. lt warns that economic measures cannot be continued indefinitely without leading to adverse effects on the capability of the Army. Pakistan is spending 7 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defence, as against India's 2.5 per cent. The country's armed forces have been consistently inducting modern equipment and expanding their numbers, the note stresses. After acquiring 300 tanks from China. Pakistan is now shopping for more from the UK, France and other countries. It has increased its anti-tank capability with the induction of anti-tank missiles from China. Similar acquisitions have been reported for Pakistani army aviation artillery, air defence artillery engineer and infantry units, the note says. It draws attention to the induction of surface-to-surface missiles with a range of approximately 300 kms, again purchased from China. Force levels of the Pakistan army have gone up sharply with induction of two armoured brigades, four infantry brigades, two artillery divisions and one surface-to-surface missile brigade. Future plans of the army include induction of such force multipliers as electronic warfare capability, induction of AWACS [Airborne Warning and Control System], raising of army aviation units and specialised troops like "ski-troops" for Siachen operations. To top everything, it acquired nuclear capability. The Defence ministry's threat perception on China is far less serious in the wake of the gradual warming of Sino-lndian relations. The Ministry feels China is unlikely to disturb status quo along the Indo-Tibetan border -- at least till the turn of the century. However, it notes that China's stepped-up arms sales to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar [Burma] are an attempt to gain a strategic foothold in the South-East region. Among the activities of China which have a direct bearing on the security environment in the Indian sub-continent is the whopping increase in its defence budget -- 14.8 per cent--thus allowing for rapid modernisation. A Rapid Reaction Force has been created in each of China's military regions. A final point of concern -- the country has upgraded its military infrastructure in Tibet, setting up vital communication channels. Above everything else is China's comprehensive and full indigenous nuclear programme. The major elements of her nuclear arsenal include a stockpile of nuclear devices, multiple independent recovery vehicle capability, delivery systems, surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, satellite communications and surveillance capability. In her quest for superpower status, China is building up her economy, not only in the areas of agriculture, industry and science but also her defence structure, according to the Defence Ministry perception. In the regional context China expects tc play a dominating role -- initially in the Pacific Rim, gradually extending it to South East Asia and the Indian Ocean.
