The results of the survey of all lower house Diet members regarding the Japanese bureaucratic system indicates that politicians are unhappy about the current relationship between themselves and bureaucrats. In a similar survey on bureaucrats which NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN conducted last November, 66 percent of bureaucrats said that they approved of the practice of bureaucrats making policy decisions. Thus, the results of the two surveys clearly indicate that politicians and bureaucrats hold different views. As for the balance of power between politicians and bureaucrats after the inauguration of the coalition government, 51 percent of lower house members said that "bureaucrats have become stronger." In last November's survey, only 22 percent of bureaucrats gave the same answer. This indicates that politicians are more conscious than bureaucrats of bureaucratic domination. As for why they feel bureaucrats have become stronger, 45 percent of lower house members said "Diet members from the ruling coalition parties are inexperienced," while 29 percent said that "the coalition government has a weak foundation." Thus, its seems that a majority of them believe the problem lies in the lack of political leadership. As for bureaucrats' current profile, 77 percent of lower house members said that they feel either "dissatisfied" or "slightly dissatisfied." In this regard, many politicians say that "changes should be made so that politicians can make policy decisions." On the other hand, 42 percent of bureaucrats say "nothing can be done about bureaucratic initiative," and 24 percent say that "the current system under which bureaucrats make policy decisions is more effective." Asked which government ministry or agency has become more powerful since the establishment of the coalition government, a significant number of politicians cited the Ministry of Finance. As for a plan proposed by Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] secretary general, to designate Diet members as vice ministers and administrative vice ministers for each government ministry and agency, 62 percent of lower house members approved of the idea. However, while a majority of lower house members from Ozawa's very own Shinseito completely endorse this idea, many members from the Social Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito [Clean Government Party] are cautious about it. Thus, there are mixed views among the ruling coalition parties regarding this idea. As to which government ministries or agencies were considered to be unnecessary, the Hokkaido Development Agency landed at the top of the list. The Okinawa Development Agency ranked second, followed by the National Land Agency. Fourth on the list was the Economic Planning Agency, which has lost face because of its poor showing in making economic forecasts and which has been criticized as being excessively influenced by the Finance Ministry. Asked what they felt was lacking among politicians, nearly half of the lower house members cited "knowledge regarding policies and a willingness to study the subject." As to what they felt was lacking among bureaucrats, many politicians cited "a broad perspective" and "flexibility."
