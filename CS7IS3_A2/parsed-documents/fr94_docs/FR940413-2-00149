FR940413-2-00149 FR940413-2-00070 IV. Summary of Comments The Commission received 69 comment letters on the proposal. A separate summary of comments was prepared and is available in the public file. The Discussion section of this order addresses specific issues addressed by the commentators. V. Discussion The MSRB's rule proposal seeks to end ``pay to play'' abuses in municipal securities underwritings. The MSRB has determined that the most effective means of accomplishing this goal is through adoption of several provisions consisting, as described above, of a business disqualification provision, a solicitation restriction and disclosure and recordkeeping requirements. These provisions reflect well-established methods for dealing with conflicts of interest and other instances where improper influence is used to secure an unmerited benefit. The Commission believes that the MSRB's proposal is tailored to accomplish its stated goals with minimal disruption in the municipal securities industry and the state and local political process to which that industry is linked. The Commission agrees with the MSRB that its proposal represents an appropriate response to a compelling problem and, therefore, has determined to approve the proposed rule change. A. Statutory Standard The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, and in particular, with sections 15B(b)(2) (C) and (G) of the Act. 51 Section 15B(b)(2)(C) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section 15B(b)(2)(G) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules that prescribe the records to be made and kept by municipal securities dealers and the periods for which such records shall be preserved. Because the MSRB's rules are to be preventive in nature, Section 15B defines the scope of the MSRB's authority in terms of purposes rather than subject matters. This authority provides the MSRB with flexibility to deal with future problems in the municipal securities industry. 52 Thus, Section 15B provides the MSRB broad rulemaking authority to implement its enumerated purposes. 51 Sections 15B(b)(2) (C), (G); [15 U.S.C. §§78o&hyph;4(b)(2) (C), (G)]. 52 The legislative history to the 1975 Acts Amendments adopting Section 15B indicated that Congress did not believe it would be desirable to restrict the MSRB's authority by a specific enumeration of subject matters. ``The ingenuity of the financial community and the impossibility of anticipating all future circumstances are obvious reasons for allowing the [MSRB] a measure of flexibility in laying down the rules of the municipal securities industry.''
