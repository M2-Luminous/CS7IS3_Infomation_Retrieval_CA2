The uneventful approval of this reform by 120 votes to six, with one abstention, allows President-elect Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle to take his oath for a six-year term on 11 March. Chile thus returns to the traditional six-year presidential terms that was applied until the coup d'etat of 11 September 1973. The Constitution promulgated by the military junta in 1980 approved an eight-year term, which Frei described as "too long." A four-year term without reelection was approved for President Patricio Aylwin, but an agreement was finally reached to reinstate the traditional six-year terms. To approve this constitutional reform, the opposition and the ruling party had to vote together to comply with the high quorums required to introduce any change in the Constitution that was bequeathed by the military regime. The session of the so-called Plenary Congress began shortly before noon after a brief two-minute delay, even though most legislators are on their summer vacations. The minimum quorum required was met with 114 of the 166 legislators in attendance. Those who voted against the reform were three conservative National Renewal Party deputies, one Independent Democratic Union deputy, dissident Socialist Party legislator Mario Palestro, and Senator Ronald McIntyre, who represents the Navy's stance and was not elected but appointed by former dictatorial President General Augusto Pinochet.
