Recently Mr. Lu Jian, President of the International Futures Brokerage Company Ltd, of China, expressed his view on this question. China's futures market has successfully gone through the difficult stage from theory to practice after the founding of the Shanghai Metal Exchange and the Shenzhen Exchange in 1992. However, China's futures market in 1992 was far from being perfect. It is still in its embryonic stage. Only the year of 1993 was the crucial year for development. During that year, the scale of the futures market had become much larger. The market had formed a network, covering various major cities throughout the country. Generally speaking, the development of China's futures market is as follows: 1. China's futures market is rapidly changing from spot trading and forward spot trading towards standard futures contracts. With the development of market economy, the share of futures contracts of the market is rapidly expanding. They serve as a definite supplement to the spot market. 2. The varieties of commodities on the futures market have considerably increased. When the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges were first founded in 1992, the goods for futures trading were only limited to nonferrous copper. In 1993, they included grain, petroleum, sugar crops and even standard futures contracts for treasury bonds. This had diversified the varieties of commodities on China's futures market. 3. As far as every futures exchange is concerned, there are considerable varieties of goods offered at various new futures exchanges which have opened their doors since the second half of 1993. Let us take the Beijing Commodity Exchange as an example. Commodities offered at the exchange now include rolled steel and treasury bonds in addition to nonferrous metal. Even in futures exchanges which have been in business fairly early such as the Shanghai Futures Exchange, they have added rice, petroleum, diesel oil and others to the list of goods offered at their exchanges. This makes their offer of goods more diversified and comprehensive, and further expanded their scope of business. 4. From the point of view of market management, the membership of the futures exchange has also become more diversified. Most of the members of the futures markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen in 1992 were production units. The percentage of specialized brokerage companies in the membership rose in 1993. These specialized brokerage companies have played a significant role in helping China's futures market develop itself along the right track. For example, the International Futures Brokerage Company Ltd, of China has membership in the world's three famous futures exchanges only one year after its founding. This has winded up the history whereas China's futures trading has no place in the international futures market. Due to the tremendous growth of China's futures market in 1993, people often call 1993 the "Year of Futures." China's futures market is able to make remarkable progress within a short period of more than a year because of its solid economic foundation. China had officially established its market economic system in 1992, putting 70 percent of the producer's goods and 90 percent of the consumer goods on the market. This had pointed out the important role of pricing signals. Prices were relatively stable when the system of planned economy held sway in the past. However, under the conditions of market economy, prices of many raw materials and commodities fluctuate a great deal in different seasons and years. Therefore, enterprises and peasants are faced with many incalculable factors in the market economy and greater risks as compared with the past. How can they avoid such risks? The only method to avoid such risks is to protect their profits by hedging. Therefore, the emergence and development of China's futures market is something inevitable. After a year of rapid development, China's futures market has entered the year of 1994. That does not mean that the market has slowed down. Mr. Lu believes that 1994 remains the "year of futures." He gives the following three reasons: 1. After China enters the 1990s, it has maintained a high rate of economic growth. Its rate of economic growth is expected to reach 12 percent in 1993. It can still maintain a growth rate between 10 and 12 percent. Even if there will be some fluctuations in the next several years, such ups and downs would only affect the rate of growth. The overall trend will be characterized by a sustained growth. The development of the futures market is closely linked with the rate of economic growth, because economic growth means the expansion of investments and trading. Therefore, we may say that in 1994, China's futures market will still witness a year of growth and improvement in 1994. 2. In the course of macro-economic control during the second half of 1993, various enterprises once against suffered from new chain-debts. They owed each other money, scrapped contracts and cheated each other. Therefore, many production and supply and marketing enterprises incurred heavy losses in spot trading and forward spot trading. This was mainly because underground spot trading and the illegal practices in handling transactions. The system of open outcry, the signing of standard futures trading contracts and the system of floor trading have enhanced the transparency in doing futures trading and protected the prestige of all traders. Meanwhile, investors may engage in trading by paying a small amount of margin only. Thus, they may be able to control a large amount of commodities with a small amount of money. Moreover, the implementation of standard futures contracts has helped solve the problem of transportation for spot trading and made things convenient for the enterprises to do trading. Therefore, more production, supply and marketing enterprises have participated in doing futures trading since the beginning of 1994. This is an inevitable trend in the course of developing market economy. 3. Only when the futures market established in 1993 enters the year of 1994, will it be possible for all its members to play their role well. After a certain period, China's futures market is no longer able to meet the needs of its members in doing futures trading. From this point of view, the development of the 1994 futures market is a continuation of the progress made in 1993. As a new event in the development of market economy, China's futures market is still faced with some problems at the present moment. Currently, a considerable number of futures brokerage companies in China's coastal regions and some major cities in China's inland provinces, which have the experience of handling futures trading in Hong Kong and Taiwan, carry out fraudulent activities that run counter to the principle of open trading. For example, they often mislead their clients by providing them with wrong information, and make illegal profits. This had seriously harmed the interests of the investors. Nevertheless, we must not doubt the future prospects of the futures market because of this. In order to further improve China's futures market, the relevant departments of the state must work out administrative rules and regulations and laws on futures trading, and make the control of futures trading a regular system and procedure. In addition, it is necessary to set up a government-recognized authoritative association for futures trading and implement a membership system. Efforts must be made to enforce a system under which all futures brokers must take a standardized test to ensure their competency. Right now, the method has already gone into effect. Consequently, it is expected that China's futures trading will take on a new look in the near future.
