He said: Enterprises' immediate project of deepening reform will underscore the "replacement of mechanisms." His commission and other relevant departments have already drawn up a plan for this purpose. To deepen the reform, efforts will be made to "expedite reform in its entirety, achieve breakthroughs at key points, and carry out supporting projects comprehensively" to make sure that enterprise reforms will deepen. Wang Zhongyu said: While implementing this plan, we must proceed from a new angle and establish new concepts so that enterprise reform can reach a higher level. Under this plan, the rights and benefits that the state enjoys as an investor and the limited liabilities it undertakes must be commensurate with its investments. This plan also specifically provides that state enterprises must have a stronger influence and play a dominant role through controlling and purchasing stocks and by using limited state capital to dominate more capital. The plan also specifically states that perennially unprofitable enterprises and insolvent enterprises must be allowed to go bankrupt according to the law, and that assets should flow rationally so that they can have the maximum effect and help attain the anticipated goals for reform. Wang Zhongyu said: "Expediting reform in its entirety" means that the two regulations -- the "Regulations Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" and the "Regulations Governing the Supervision and Control of State-Owned Property" -- must be implemented along with the establishment of a modern enterprise system. In other words, enterprises must enjoy all the privileges and fulfill all their obligations prescribed in the regulations, and state-owned property must be controlled more effectively so that a modern enterprise system can be reliably established on the basis of reforming the labor, personnel, and wage systems and implementing the "Accountancy Norm" and "General Principles for Financial Affairs" as well as the two sets of aforementioned regulations. "Achieving breakthroughs at key points" means that efforts must be made to expedite the development of major enterprises and regions. Over a two-year period, 10,000 large and medium state- owned enterprises will be designated to implement the "Enterprise Law," the regulations on changing operating mechanisms, the accountancy norm, and the guiding principles for financial affairs; to finish reappraising their stocks and assets; and to basically complete changing their operating mechanisms. While implementing the regulations for supervising state-owned property, the state will, by groups and by stages, set up supervisory boards at 1,000 mainstay enterprises to exercise supervision over the state-owned property of these enterprises whose operations are closely associated with the national economy and people's livelihood. Meanwhile, under the State Council's consolidated leadership and planning, 100 large and medium businesses will be selected to experiment with modern operations in order to explore ways to operate these businesses like corporations. At the same time, a dozen or so cities will be designated to carry out supporting reforms with the objective of optimizing capital structures and increasing the strength of enterprises. The economic and trade commission and eight other departments have already drawn up plans for carrying out pilot projects in about 10 cities concerning replenishing enterprises, separating their responsibilities, and lightening their burdens as well as letting insolvent enterprises go bankrupt. As for "carrying out supporting projects comprehensively," cities will be asked to take advantage of their abilities to launch comprehensive reforms and deal with key problems that have been plaguing large and medium enterprises for a long time. Meanwhile, mechanisms for strengthening coordination between general and specialized departments will be established so that problems can be dealt with comprehensively. Wang Zhongyu said: Our plan has gone into effect with a positive response and support from local governments and enterprises. Owing to problems confronting enterprises, the measures prescribed in the plans are quite strong. For example, to carry out the "Bankruptcy Law" and to speed up enterprises' organizational restructuring, it has been prescribed that markets' trading property rights will be established in cities so that property use can be optimized. With respect to separating enterprises' social functions, cities that have been designated to carry out the pilot project will establish some labor service markets so that they can gradually undertake various social functions, such as placing surplus workers through various channels. Different methods will also be adopted to help enterprises reduce their unwarranted debts according to different circumstances. Wang Zhongyu indicated that he expected that the plan will encounter many problems but that his commission is determined to follow through with the plan, seize the opportunity to expedite enterprise reform, act in a practical manner in dealing with the problems that the old system has caused enterprises, and create the conditions that can enable large and medium state-owned enterprises to move into the market without burdens.
