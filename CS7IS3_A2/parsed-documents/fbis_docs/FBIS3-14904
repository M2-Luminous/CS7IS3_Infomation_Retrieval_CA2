"We hope Russia will abandon its unconstructive approach of tying the troop withdrawal timetable to an agreement on military pensioners," Reinart told BNS. He emphasized that, in Estonia's view, an agreement on social guarantees for retired military should not determine the circle of military pensioners entitled to remain in Estonia. "The aliens law and the government decree explicitly state the categories of those persons, while the agreement deals only with technicalities: how they are to be paid, how they receive medical aid, who and how pays for their medical treatment, etc.," the diplomat explained. Reinart voiced the hope, however, that the general agreement on troop withdrawal, which the delegations have almost completely finalized, will be initialed during the upcoming round of talks. He underscored that the withdrawal timetable, which Russia still hasn't presented, is part of the agreement and that the agreement cannot be initialed without the schedule. When Estonia learned about Moscow's plans to protect the Russian- speaking population of the Baltic states and the CIS countries, it became "perfectly clear" why talks on economic issues are making no progress, Reinart said. "(The Russian program) plainly states that Russia should not promote economic ties with countries which, in its opinion, treat Russians badly, so we can't expect a breakthrough in economic talks," he maintained. The solving of humanitarian issues, including the problem of citizenship, is blocked by diametrically opposite interpretation of the 1940 events and the states' succession, the Estonian diplomat claimed. Reinart said the border issues working group plans to tackle demarcation of the sea border. The issue of adjoining areas will not come up during this round of talks, since Russia hasn't replied to Estonia's proposals. The next round of Estonian-Russian talks is scheduled for March 1-2. Reinart and Russia's top negotiator, Vasiliy Svirin, will give a press conference on March 2.
