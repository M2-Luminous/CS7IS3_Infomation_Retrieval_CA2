In China, where the telecommunications network infrastructure is underdeveloped, the demand for mobile communications is expanding very rapidly as means of communication supplementing the telephone networks. Given the situation, the companies are eager to start producing the cellular phones in joint-venture projects as early as this year. European and U.S. companies are already operating in China's cellular phone market, with the U.S. firm Motorola holding 60 percent of the market. As for Japan, its biggest cellular phone manufacturer, the Matsushita Communication Industrial Company, is getting ready to start up its local production in the spring. With the four other Japanese companies following, intense competition is likely to flare up among Japanese and U.S. companies. NEC plans to set up a joint-venture company in China during the first half of this year and to begin production by the fall. As a production base, Wuhan is considered to be most desirable. The initial scale of production by the company is to be 10,000 sets a month. Fujitsu wants to begin producing its cellular phones within this year at Nanjing Fujitsu (in Nanjing), which is a joint venture company set up in 1992 to produce optical communications systems. It has not decided on the scale of its production, but once demand expands, Fujitsu says it "will think about setting up a new joint venture company." Hitachi and Oki Electric Industrial are now holding talks [with China] with the intention of producing locally their cellular phones. While they have yet to negotiate on details, they are likely to be able to set up new companies and start producing within this year. Oki Electric Industrial probably will set up its production base in Shanghai. The number of China's cellular phones is said to have been less than 1 million at the end of 1992. But China is a country where less than 2 percent of people have ordinary phones. Therefore, the demand for mobile communications systems like cellular phones and pagers is growing rapidly. The total market for the systems was half a million sets in 1993, and it is expected to increase to nearly 1 million sets in 1994. The number of subscribers to cellular phones in Japan is about 2 million at present. An officer of a major communications equipment manufacturer said, "The potential demand in Japan cannot come even close to that of China." Thus, that Japanese industry's venture into China is likely to increase. As far as pagers -- which are becoming as popular as the cellular phones are -- are concerned, the Matsushita Communication Industrial Co. is now engaged in local production at its joint venture company set up in Beijing in June 1992. In addition, NEC and the Casio Computer Co. are set to begin production at their joint venture companies soon.
