Of these, 371 persons were nominated by the electorate, 254 by working collectives and 176 by parties. Among the latter the Communist Party is the leader -- 108 candidates (27 candidates in Donetsk oblast, 14 in Lugansk oblast and eight in Kharkov oblast). Other parties are significantly lagging behind the leader: Rukh -- 26 persons; the Ukrainian Republican Party and the Socialist Party of Ukraine -- 17 representatives from each; the Party of Labor -- three persons; the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists -- two persons; the Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party and the Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine -- one representative from each. However, the Central Electoral Commission pointed out that these figures did not reflect the absolute representation of the parties because many political party members were nominated either by the electorate or by working collectives.
