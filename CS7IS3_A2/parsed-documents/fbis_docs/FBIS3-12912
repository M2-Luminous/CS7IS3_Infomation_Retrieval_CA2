Will it survive the crisis? ['Arafat] The peace process has been interrupted. I would like to stress that it has been interrupted and not broken off. We hope that President Clinton will save the situation. [FOCUS] What measures do you expect Clinton to adopt? ['Arafat] Clinton should support the resolution on international presence that we submitted to the United Nations. It is included in the Declaration of Principles (DOP). The DOP should be fulfilled in the interest of our people. Clinton must exert pressure to ensure the disarmament of the Israeli extremists in the occupied territories. Finally, the Israeli Government must clarify the role of the army in the massacre. [FOCUS] Do you believe Rabin when he says that he wants to clear up the attack? ['Arafat] I believe that Rabin will take corresponding measures if Clinton asks him to do so. Otherwise, I would be skeptical. Rabin must do everything possible to ensure the security of the Palestinian people. [FOCUS] Thus, you are not demanding the abandonment of all settlements? ['Arafat] We are not demanding heaven on earth. We know Israel and the Israelis. We are cousins. We know them very well. There is no doubt that some settlers are fanatical. The Israeli Government must take measures against them because the fanatics want to undermine the peace process and to kill Palestinians. [FOCUS] How do you assess the chances for peace, leaving the massacre out of consideration? ['Arafat] The truth is that the Israelis do not want to implement the results of the negotiations. Rabin stated: "'Arafat should sweat." And then the massacre occurred. [FOCUS] What will now happen? ['Arafat] If the peace process should be stopped, and if Israel does not ensure the security of my people, a Balkanization will take place, and the Middle East will shake.
