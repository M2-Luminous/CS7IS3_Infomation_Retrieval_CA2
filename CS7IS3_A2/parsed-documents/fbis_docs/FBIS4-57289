Others, "fed up with handpicked candidates [dedazos] and decisions adopted by party leaders [palomazos]," are organizing new movements to demand internal democracy. These are two sides of the tricolor party's current reality. After the defection of four important PRI members -- Demetrio Sodi de la Tijera and Miguel Basanez in the Federal District; Rodrigo Moreno Rodriguez in Guanajuato; and Guillermo del Rio Ortegon in Campeche -- forecasts hold that other PRI members will leave their party given their disagreement with the way in which Senate candidacies were recently decided. Regarding the increase in internal demands for democratization, PRI representatives for 12 of the capital's 40 districts yesterday announced the creation of a Citizens Liaison and Consultation Board [Coordinacion de Enlace y Consulta Ciudadana], which essentially strives for truly democratic selection of tricolor party candidates to the Chamber of Deputies. The new group's coordinators -- Oscar Hidalgo, Jose Manuel Mota Lopez, Jose Luis Guerra, and Ricardo Palacios -- said "PRI members are fed up with handpicked candidates and decisions adopted by party leaders." They warned that if there is no democratic selection of candidates for the posts of deputies and assembly members in the Federal District, the consequences will be not only the resignation of many activists but also a considerable decrease in votes for the PRI on 21 August. They said both PRI activists and sympathizers participate in the new organization. Jose Luis Guerra reproved the fact that candidacies are decided by the leadership, without taking into consideration the rank and file. He protested: "Those of us who work with the rank and file are not taken into consideration. We are the ones insulted every time we knock on doors." Leaders of the Citizens Liaison and Consultation Board, which has ties with Democracy 2000, announced they will submit a proposal to the PRI's leadership in the Federal District, whose president is Manuel Jimenez Guzman. The proposal is to cast votes to elect the candidates for the lower chamber. This would not only include the participation of party activists but also of sympathizers, because they are the ones who usually determine the victories. They warned that the disagreement recently expressed by former Chihuahua Governor Fernando Baeza Melendez might multiply among people running for the post of Federal District deputy. Democracy is an urgent necessity, Jose Manuel Mota Lopez insisted, adding that if the PRI leadership and Ernesto Zedillo truly want to honor Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta's memory, they should recall what the assassinated politician said in his 6 March speech -- that PRI members do not want candidates whose active membership surprises even the tricolor party's members. Mota Lopez said: Zedillo must fulfill his pledge to continue Colosio's political program. He noted there are many members of the PRI who are deputies or assembly members without having earned that right, who now want to swap posts between the lower chamber and the assembly. Many of those PRI members "have never taken a stand," Mota Lopez added during a news conference yesterday. He explained that in addition to the risk of more defections and a considerable decrease in PRI votes on 21 August, this could result in protests at the chamber and assembly facilities in the capital. The text of the document that formally creates the Citizens Liaison and Consultation Board begins by stating that "a transition process in Mexico's democratic culture is under way." The document continues: "The armed rebellion in Chiapas, Luis Donaldo Colosio's death, the national stock market's ups and downs, and the increasing insecurity which prevails since Cardinal Posadas Ocampo's violent and still unsolved assassination have prompted civilian society to increase its demands for a change in the political system, above all in the way in which the next electoral process will be handled." "Nevertheless, high-ranking groups insist on keeping the country in a state of political indecision and uncertainty, without allowing opportunity for democratic transition, which is now so urgent and necessary." It then reasserts its immediate goal: "The PRI should respect the statutes, declaration of principles, and partisan action program, and it should let the rank and file and the citizenry participate in the process of selecting candidates for different public posts." Jose Manuel Mota Lopez reiterated his warning about the risk of more resignations among PRI members, commenting: "I do not know why they are afraid of democracy."
