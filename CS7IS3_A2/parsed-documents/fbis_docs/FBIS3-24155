In It, the Fifth Wheel Is the Betrayed Voter"] [Text] Hardly had the postelection passions subsided, hardly had the rallies and the political terror abated, when two individuals returned to Crimea from Russia, each of them capable of influencing the fate of the peninsula. The first--the Russian Yevgeniy Saburov--turned up here in order to test his reforming abilities, carrying out the slogans of Yu. Meshkov. The appearance of the other, Nikolay Bagrov, who had been staying with St. Petersburg relatives, could act as a brake on the beginning of the Crimean president. Nikolay Bagrov made a statement about this without beating around the bush at the very first press conference: "I confirm my disagreement with the pre-election program of the president. It is impracticable. But I must help Crimea get out of the economic crisis." Three weeks ago, Yuriy Meshkov, already aware of the resignation of his rival, played to the public, saying: "Such a smart specialist as Bagrov cannot be disregarded. I will be happy cooperate with him." Now that the Supreme Council of Crimea has voted down the speaker's resignation, the variously directed politicians will have to come together in a single harness. Will it be for long? It is not inconceivable that the enforced Bagrov-Meshkov union will be delayed. Crimean political scientists predict that at the end of March, Leonid Makarovych will offer Nikolay Vasilyevich the position of Crimean presidential representative. The deputies of the Supreme Council of Ukraine are talking about the same thing in the corridors of power. And the Crimea and Ukraine Committee stated: "Bagrov the politician will not work well with Meshkov, and this will be to the benefit of Ukraine." The clash of the three political figures is capable of changing the Crimean situation in unpredictable fashion. Especially since Yuriy Meshkov, upon coming to power, suddenly failed to find around himself a team of like-thinkers and was compelled to turn to all of the ministers and committee chairmen and their deputies with the call, "Everyone stay where you are." "No one is going to displace you," he exhorted the denizens of the Council of Ministers. Much the same had been promised the government bureaucrats by their future leader, Yevgeniy Saburov. However, these promises were perceived without rapture. They evoked a reaction of concealed sabotage: Many of the Council of Ministers' deputy chairmen left in a state of diplomatic illness. And their former head Samsonov packed himself off on leave, offering Yuriy Meshkov his deserted office. The Crimean president, however, suffering greatly for lack of a residence, resolved the sore point in his own way, taking an office in the former oblast Communist Party Committee of Crimea, which earlier belonged to Leonid Grach. Now the wounded leader of the Communist Party republic committee is counting on compensating the loss through the political continuity of the new owner of the apartments. And in some ways, he is decidedly not far wrong. Yuriy Meshkov began work at his new post with a "swelling of the staff"--the formation of his own administration and a group of advisers comprising 60 people. Observers have already called these actions unconstitutional: According to Crimean legislation, the president heads the government; the ministers act as advisers, and he is not entitled to an administration. The prime ministership of Yevgeniy Saburov likewise seems fairly shaky. Since the Constitution provides only for the position of deputy prime minister, now occupied. The man in this position is Anatoliy Franchuk, who has worked well with the president.... While Yuriy Meshkov, who until recently worked for the Crimean Constitution, is attempting to disengage himself from the trap of its articles, he will not be up to any new edicts. But then, the president is feeling out contact with Crimean parties and movements. The other day, he even conducted a roundtable with their representatives. But in the opinion of Majlis deputy chairman Refat Chubarov, this will hardly improve relations between the Tatars and the president: The sides have taken a wait-and-see position. Much more concrete is the disposition of the Ukrainian Civic Congress of Crimea [UGKK], which resolved to consolidate its forces and the Tatars' "against the expansion of pro-Russian tendencies in Crimea." "Crimea is becoming yet another stage in the genocide against everything Ukrainian," announced UGKK representatives to Nikolay Mikhalchenko, head of the Ukrainian president's service dealing with internal politics. And, in their words, they forced official Kiev to do some serious thinking. This thoughtfulness was probably transmitted to the parliament as well, which decided a few days ago to fix the logical stress marks in the Crimean question. The decree adopted by the Supreme Council of Ukraine "On the Status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea...." "explicates" that Crimea cannot change the state borders of Ukraine, or enter into political relations with foreign states, or have its own military formations and monetary system. In the course of a month, Crimea's parliament is advised to bring the Constitution and laws of the republic into conformity with Ukrainian ones. However, during the discussion of this ticklish question at the session, broadcast transmission from Kiev was strategically blocked by the local radio station. Is it not for this reason that official Simferopol is still in no state to evaluate the resolution of the Ukrainian people's deputies? It seems that the very authors of the document did not count on concrete results. And not only because the decree makes no provision for responsibility for its nonfulfillment. Simply, the month's time allotted Crimea runs out on 24 March--at the height of the election campaign. "The document has no legislative weight--it just states the situation. This is natural; after all, the de facto author of Crimean autonomy is the president of Ukraine," summarized A. Tkachuk, deputy chairman of the deputy commission dealing with questions of legislation and legality. The newly fledged decree is capable of impeding only the introduction of the ruble in Crimea. As R. Shpek, minister of economics, explained, "This would complicate the accounting process and the tax system. L. Kravchuk proposed to Yu. Meshkov that he present "ruble" calculations. He did not do this in time. And now it is too late." To Crimeans, pecking at the pro-Russian/ruble plan of their president, only one thing is left that is not forbidden out of all the pre-election promises--the introduction of Moscow time. It seems as though the Crimeans are not to see the mountains of gold guaranteed by Yuriy Meshkov. Just as earlier, they did not receive the political tranquility promised by Nikolay Bagrov. Will the hopes of the third--Nikolay Bagrov--be fulfilled? Opinions were shared at NEZAVISIMOST's open microphone.
