He added that his offer stands but the talks will start as scheduled on Feb. 4 regardless of the union's decision. Speaking at a news conference in Warsaw, Baczkowski said that the trade unions were invited to take part in "major structural negotiations on issues which are fundamental to the living standards of the society and aimed at working out social guarantees for the coming years." The deputy labour minister said it is "sad and incomprehensible" that the talks will have to be held without Solidarity. Responding to one of the demands of Solidarity to start enterprise pact-guaranteed negotiations between the government, trade unions and employers, Baczkowski said that the talks could begin only when the labour code has been amended as farmers' trade unions and local governments are not named as partners in the negotiations. Member of the Presidium of the Solidarity National Commission Jerzy Ostrouch said that in the light of Baczkowski's statements, the union's decision not to join the talks was right. He claimed that "one has to do something with the budget first" and then talk about social guarantees for future.
