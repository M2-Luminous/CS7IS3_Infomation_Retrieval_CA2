Peace was too, and it arrived on board a plane hoping for a better future, and this was the message Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres brought with him. Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, accompanied by a large delegation of the Jewish and Palestinian communities residing in the Colombian capital, received Peres at Catam Military Airport in western Santa Fe de Bogota. Peres, on a brief tour of Latin America that includes only Mexico, Colombia, and Chile, will discuss topics such as economic rapprochement and technological cooperation with Colombian officials. The topic of peace predominated, however, during the foreign minister's news conference at the Catam runway. The Colombian foreign minister said: "Peres is a protagonist of peace. Colombia must pay homage to him for his efforts and the success he has had in both this first chapter of peace between Israel and the Palestinians and for everything he is doing in the Middle East, as an example to the world on how peace should be made." Peres stressed the importance of the democratic process he witnessed upon his arrival. "Colombia, despite the bad press, has always been a country that is stronger due to its votes rather than its bullets. I am certain the results of today's elections will allow it to continue down the path of economic recovery and growth in other sectors." "Just as you are doing, we are trying to consolidate peace among our people and in our region. In Israeli, we are determined to continue with the upcoming chapters of peace in the process we have begun," Peres said. With contagious optimism, the Israeli foreign minister expressed his conviction the peace being built in the Middle East will be a solid and lasting one. "I believe the entire world is progressing from a history of wars to the creation of peace. Nothing that is important in life can be achieved through war. What can be achieved through war has ceased to be important," he added. According to the foreign minister, the step that was taken with the implementation of the Palestinian autonomies in the Gaza Strip and the Cisjordanian city of Jericho, as established in the declaration signed by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel in Washington last September, is irreversible. "I believe we are deeply interested in securing peace for our children. We are tired of war. Neither side has achieved anything by military means," he said. The peace process in the Middle East is loaded with obstacles, however. Perez' view is pragmatic. Asked about the statement by PLO President Yasir 'Arafat about the recent call for a "holy war" for the liberation of Jerusalem, Peres said actions are far more important than words, adding "we are satisfied that despite Arafat's statements he has continued to fulfill our agreement." Peres emphatically said: "Jerusalem will remain a united city, the capital of Israel. Jerusalem is politically closed but religiously open. We are not going to turn it into a Berlin, divided in two. It will be open to all religions." Peres anticipated a new era in relations with Catholics and Muslims. "We will sign an agreement with the Vatican in Jerusalem and exchange ambassadors this year. This was not an ordinary political move. It is something that took 1,994 years to happen. All of the sacred sites will remain open to all religions," he reiterated. For Peres, the key element of the changes that are occurring worldwide is the economy. "If one has an adequate economy, one obtains adequate results," he said. He affirmed, therefore, there will be no peace in Israel if this country remains an island of prosperity in a sea of poverty. "We will do everything within our means to improve standards of living in all parts of the region, not only in Israel." Peres mentioned an economic example of the importance of peace in the region. According to him, the Middle East spent more than $1 trillion in 10 years to buy bombs. If half this amount had been spent on education, the Middle East would be a very prosperous region, he said. Peres offered his country's technological assistance to Colombia. "We will gladly share whatever experience we have in the agricultural field. Israel has improved its agricultural production by 1,200 percent in 25 years without water or land." He said Latin America is also experiencing a profound transformation, a factor which plays a significant role on the world stage. "Colombia, one of the four most important countries in Latin America, will play its proper role," he said. Nevertheless, Peres reserved his highest praise for the Colombian foreign minister. "We are very happy to improve relations between Colombia and Israel. The Colombian foreign minister's visit to Israel was very successful. She made a magnificent impression on us."
