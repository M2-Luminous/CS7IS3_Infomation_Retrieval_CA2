FR940202-0-00110 FR940202-0-00013 Differences From Proposed Rule and Revised Proposed Rule and Final Rule The May 3, 1985, proposed rule identified approximately 43,000 acres for designation as critical habitat. In preparing the revised proposed rule, it was discovered that the 43,000-acre critical habitat figure was in error and should have been reported as approximately 45,805 acres. Therefore, this final rule and associated documents refer to the 45,805-acre figure as the correct acreage figure from the May 3, 1985, proposed designation. The area encompassed by the 10 critical habitat areas has been adjusted from approximately 45,805 acres (18,322 ha) in the original proposed rule to 48,025 acres (19,210 ha) in the revised proposed rule to about 38,000 acres (15,200 ha) in the final rule. In adjusting the boundaries, 1,400 acres (560 ha) were deleted from critical habitat on the Santa Ynez River and 3,620 acres (1,448 ha) were added, resulting in a net increase of 2,220 acres (888 ha). This adjustment was recommended by the Forest Service and was based on the results of additional field research on the status, distribution, and behavior of the least Bell's vireo on the Santa Ynez River during the 1986 breeding season. An additional 120 acres (48 ha), adjacent to the northern border of Gibraltar Reservoir, were also recommended for deletion by the Forest Service but the Service does not believe that this change is warranted because this area contains potential nesting habitat. All the land suggested for either withdrawal or addition to the Santa Ynez River critical habitat is under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service. The additional 3,620 acres (1,448 ha) that were added are under Federal jurisdiction, withdrawn from mineral entry, and without any private or commercial interests. Two adjustments have been made in the Santa Margarita River critical habitat area. About 420 acres (168 ha) of upland private property were removed based on a refinement in the legal description. This adjustment did not exclude any vireo habitat. About 9,600 acres (3,840 ha) on Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base were removed based on the finding that an existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Service and the Marine Corps for vireo management is providing an adequate level of protection to the vireo and its habitat. Although this area is essential to the conservation of the species, the Service finds that a formal critical habitat designation is unnecessary because the MOU contains provisions for section 7 consultation for proposed actions that may destroy or adversely modify vireo habitat. The Service also finds that a level of protection equivalent to or greater than that provided by a critical habitat designation can be achieved for the vireo on this portion of the Santa Margarita River through cooperation with the Marine Corps under the MOU. The management actions implemented under this agreement have significantly benefitted the vireo population at this locality. It has increased from 98 territorial males in 1986 when the MOU was established to 212 territorial males in 1991. However, the Service will reconsider its position to designate critical habitat on the Camp Pendleton reach of the Santa Margarita River if conditions warrant. The Service will use its authority under sections 7 and 9 of the Act to insure compliance with the prohibitions on unauthorized take. One adjustment has been made in the San Luis Rey River critical habitat area: About 80 acres (32 ha) of upland private property were removed based on a refinement in the legal description. This adjustment did not exclude any vireo habitat.
