President Zhelev during the talks stressed that the integration into the European structures is this country's foreign policy priority, the president's spokesman said after the meeting. Dr. Zhelev raised the issue of the ratification of the agreement for Bulgaria's association with the European Union. Commenting on this matter, Mr. Lubbers pledged that the Dutch parliament will ratify the document this summer. The guest also told the Bulgarian president that a group of businessmen from the Netherlands will visit this country to investigate the conditions Bulgaria has to offer to foreign investors and the possibilities for setting up joint ventures. President Zhelev further briefed Mr. Lubbers on this country's stance on the Yugo-conflict and commented on its views against the sending of Turkish blue helmets to join the UN peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. He said that this country believes an involvement of a country neighbouring to former Yugoslavia is likely to escalate the conflict and impede the peace process. The Dutch delegation today met National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and the Parliamentary Committees on National Security and Foreign Policy. The talks again focused on the situation in the Balkans and the developments in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Speaking at a news conference later today, Prime Minister Lubbers said he was convinced that the two countries have opportunities to further promote their business cooperation. He also said he was aware of the obstacles arising from the painstaking transition to a market economy this country is currently going through. According to him, this is where the Netherlands can offer its help within the framework of the Council of Europe and the Partnership for Peace initiative. Mr. Lubbers identified positive trends in the development of the political contacts between the two countries and went on to say that the Bulgarian defence minister will soon pay a visit to the Netherlands. Answering a journalist's question, Mr. Lubbers said the Netherlands would not oppose the idea of calling a conference on the Yugo-conflict on the territory of a neutral neighbouring country as long as this does not waste more time further postpone the end of the war. This afternoon the delegation left Bulgaria.
