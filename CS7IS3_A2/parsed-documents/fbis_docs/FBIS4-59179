Thanks to God, who is allowing and enabling the voice and vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as the loudest voice of protest against the terror against the Bosnian people, against the ruthlessness and aggressive propaganda from the West, to express our compassion for your terrible and enormous suffering. Our message to you from here is that, God willing, we will use all of our strength to support you. The great leader of the Islamic revolution has left as his legacy to us the right and obligation as a nation to help all of our neighboring brothers. The people are ready to offer all possible help, even above their means, not only in the form of propaganda, political, or financial help, but in every way. We hope that other Muslims will also feel the same obligation and that they will remember the suffering your state is experiencing--a state of Muslims, and not a state with just one Muslim community. Hatred of you is the reason for the Bosnian tragedy that we are watching. This is not a feeling proscribed by Islam or by your faith. This is an aggression against the purity and holiness of Islam and Muslims. This is why all Muslims are firm in their decision to stand by you bravely and resolutely. I am sure that the emissary of Islam, our dear God, shares your pain and suffering, the religious rights and [words indstinct], for you have been the victims of aggression and terror, and because they want to destroy you simply because you are Muslims. God willing, Muslims will see the light. Muslims are ready to stand before their enemies and oppose them. They must stand up and resist the Serb criminals. They must fight against all forces that remain silent in the face of crime, against the advocates of war who instigate new attacks and aggression. I hope, God willing, that these dark nights will end as soon as possible. The dawn of your victory is coming. We will witness the day when Islam rises and become a mainstay in the area. You will be strong, [word indistinct] with us and other Muslims in the world. God willing, the flag of Islam will be erected there so that the light of Islam can shine in the area. I humbly pray to Almighty God to give us as soon as possible the gift of living in happiness, beside one another, in prosperity, celebrating our joint success. God willing.
