They made it clear that the political forces opposing President Dzhokhar Dudayev would resort to coercive measures only in case that the official formations in Groznyy are the first to use arms. A representative of the headquarters who preferred to stay anonymous declared that last Sunday the opposition manage to conduct its congress in the regional center of Znamenskoe. As many as 2500 delegates were present at the congress. However, as Groznyy reports, the opposition's congress was disrupted because the majority of those invited to the congress boycotted it. Meanwhile, the congress' delegate Ruslan Martagov told our Interfax correspondent that the congress took place despite a tough confrontation on the part of Groznyy. In his words, the congress urged that Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev and Vice President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev should immediately resign and the republic's parliament should pass a decision on democratic elections. According to the opposition, this decision should be adopted before June 15 and then the parliament should announce about its self-disbandment. As the opposition believes, new elections should be held not later than August 1994. The authorities should release all political prisoners and transfer all authorities to the Temporary Council of the Chechen Republic being created by the opposition. The resolution adopted by the congress underlines that the Temporary Council created in winter 1994 takes all the functions of the representative power until the time of the new elections.
