At a news conference here to introduce the new product, Paul Allaire, chairman and chief executive officer of the Xerox Corporation of the United States, said that the Chinese-designed new product was not only a "pride" for the Xerox Corporation, but also a "glory" for Shanghai and the whole of China. He said that like other Xerox products, the new copier enjoys the full quality guarantee of his company. A new factory will be built in Brazil later this year to manufacture the new copiers with parts provided by the Shanghai Xerox Company and it will begin exporting to southern Latin America early next year, he said. Joseph Donaro, general manager of the Shanghai Xerox Copier Company, said that in developing the new copier, Chinese workers and technicians received full support and assistance from the Xerox Corporation of the United States. "So we should say the new product is a crystallization of cooperation between Chinese and American engineers and designers," he added. The 5416 copier -- 550 mm wide, 340 mm high and weighing 45 kilograms -- is the smallest of Xerox copiers. It takes just 30 seconds to start it. Since it opened in 1987 with a total investment of $30 million, the Shanghai Xerox Company has built 60,000 copiers, 1,300 of which have been exported to Western Europe. It has acquired a 50 percent share of the Chinese mainland's market.
