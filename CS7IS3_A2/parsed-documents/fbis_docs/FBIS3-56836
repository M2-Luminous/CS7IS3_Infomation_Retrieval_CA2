As Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar reported at a press conference in Tallinn Tuesday [18 January], several days ago President Lennart Meri conferred on V. Reinart the diplomatic rank of special envoy, "the same as Russian delegation head Vasiliy Svirin." The premier noted that V. Reinart had previously been a member of the Estonian delegation and knows well the specific nature of the negotiations. In conversation with an INTERFAX correspondent, M. Laar refuted the accusations made in Moscow by Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service, that the Estonian secret services were engaged in intelligence work against Russia. "Estonia does not engage in intelligence work against Russia," the prime minister emphasized.
