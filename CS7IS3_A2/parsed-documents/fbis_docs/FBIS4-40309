Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, he pointed out that "a real war of criminal clans is beginning in the country now. They use the most advanced technical means of destruction. That's why there has appeared an urgent necessity to adopt extraordinary measures," he stressed commenting the presidential decree on strengthening the fight against crime. Asked about the situation concerning espionage, Stepashin said that his department is especially concerned at the activity of the special services of North Korea. He mentioned the recent deportation of five North Korean citizens from Russia who tried to find information on the components of nuclear weapons. According to Stepashin, three days ago several Korean citizens were detained in the Primorye Territory for similar reasons. Having noted the active work of the US special service, Stepashin expressed his opinion that "the present level of openness is damaging our country." On Thursday [16 Jun] Stepashin intends to visit Vladivostok and Nakhodka (Primorye Territory).
