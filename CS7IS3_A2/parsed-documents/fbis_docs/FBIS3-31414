The Academy's refusal was determined. Based on the decisions of the Extraordinary Serbian Assembly, the Serbian authority takes the Kosova Academy building and its property. Many personalities of the state, politics, and science who have protested against the Serbian warnings to abolishing the Kosova Academy, are expecting the international support for protecting the highest Albanian science institution in Kosova.
