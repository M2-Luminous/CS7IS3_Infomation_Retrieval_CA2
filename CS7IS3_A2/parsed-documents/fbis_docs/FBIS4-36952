Dr. al-Majali was seen off by Deputy Prime Minister Dhuqan al-Hindawi and several cabinet ministers. On His Majesty King Husayn's Washington visit, Dr. al-Majali spoke to [Salim 'Ali Dhiyab], our correspondent for political affairs: [Begin recording] [Al-Majali] Undoubtedly, there must be constant reconsideration of Jordanian-U.S. ties to further promote and strengthen them in the interest of the American and Jordanian peoples. The summit between his majesty the king and President Clinton constitutes a peak in these ties, which we know to be special. This summit will remove any of the difficulties that might have emerged along the path of these good ties, which continue to be promoted. [passage omitted] [Dhiyab] Dr. al-Majali: With regard to inter-Arab coordination, I do not want to ask you whether you are satisfied with it. But, how strong is it at present? [Al-Majali] As a matter of fact, the word coordination continues to be misunderstood. Coordination is not seriously observed, as we wish. We understand coordination to mean that each party is properly and unambiguously informed of the position of the other party. If the two parties agree on certain issues, that would be fine and great. But if the two parties disagree, this should not mean that there is a dispute. For each party must respect the other's view. This is how coordination should be viewed. It is regrettable that inter-Arab coordination has not reached the desired level. [Dhiyab] But, in practical terms, is there currently coordination among the three Arab sides? [Al-Majali] Of course. Coordination has remained intact. Coordination has remained an ongoing process. Whenever there is an opportunity, coordination takes place. Nonetheless, people do not meet all the time. Whenever there are new developments, the other parties are informed of them, and consequently these developments are discussed. This is what always takes place. [passage omitted] [end recording]
