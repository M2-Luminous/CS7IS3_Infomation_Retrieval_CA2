Four glass bulbs with filaments tipped with 50g of silver, were filled with argon of 50 Torr(A), 300 Torr(B) and Xe gas of 5 Torr(C), 100 Torr(D), respectively, and ignited one by one in the low gravitational field of space. The evaporation temperatures were maintained at 1150 degrees Celsius at which the exhaust gases were barely detectable in all cases for the ground experiment. The smoke appeared as a ball of smoke particles growing around the evaporation source instead of rising as it would under Earth gravity. It could hardly be seen for (A), but it was observable for (B) and (C) and there were bursts of smoke gushing out from (D) in various directions. The experiment suggested the vapor could be confined locally around the source with high pressure and temperature by the surrounding gas in the low gravity. This suggestion cannot be interpreted by any conventional model of evaporation in the gas. Introduction ``Evaporation of materials in the gas atmosphere'' is a technique for producing ultra-fine particles by evaporating materials in an inert gas under atmospheric pressure [1] and has been used in various fields of science and industry. But far less attention has been given to the investigation of the process of evaporation of materials in a gas atmosphere than to that of the process of evaporation in a vacuum. This is mainly due to the fact that each evaporation process in a gravitational field is accompanied by the convection of gas, rendering analysis of the process difficult. The evaporation of materials in gas is a very ordinary phenomenon, seen in such natural phenomena as the evaporation of water on the surface of the sea and in boiling water and such industrial applications as in smelters, fractional distillation, distillation, etc. However, evaporation by heating in a gas on the ground is always accompanied by convection and subsidence, which are complicated phenomena in themselves. This makes it difficult to duly grasp facts in the experiment. Fonda [2] has proposed an empirical evaporation formula of tungsten filament in an incandescent lamp bulb, where he assumed a stagnation layer of flow on the evaporating surface (Langmuir sheath) and that the evaporation rate was to be controlled by the diffusion velocity in this layer. This concept was originated by Langmuir and has been used for the analysis of those kinds of problems up to the present time [3,4]. The thicknesses of these layers are not deducible theoretically, but they are estimated to be within the range of millimeters of the actual evaporation rate on the ground. For the gas evaporation under low gravity conditions, the thickness of the stagnation layer is as large as the distance from the evaporation source to the inner surface of the vessel, it is in the order of ten centimeters which is ten squared times as thick as the one for the ground experiment. It means the evaporation rate is too suppressed to deposit a smoke consisting of fine particles in the low gravity especially in evaporation of gas at high density; the real situation is to be discovered by the low gravity experiment. Outline of Flight Experiment An experimental metal particle generation device was used in the experiment (Fig. 1). Four glass bulbs with filaments tipped with 50 mg of Ag, were filled with Ar gas of 50 Torr, 300 Torr and Xe gas of 5 Torr, 100 Torr and were ignited one by one in a low gravitational field in space. The pictures of the developing smoke were recorded on VTR and brought back with the used bulbs to the laboratory on the ground (Fig. 2, not reproduced). These bulbs will be cut open and the deposited particles to be examined under electron microscope. Fig. 1. Schematic Illustration of Experimental Faculty Results All four bulbs worked, and the heating temperature was kept well within the lower constant of 1110 to 1150 degrees Celsius, which temperature was too low to develop smoke under Earth surface conditions. The heating temperature of the bulb (D) was also kept the same for four seconds at the beginning of evaporation, but it rose to over 1200 degrees Celsius, and the filament blew out in two minutes. The recorded pictures of smoke are very dark for the bulb (A), and no smoke can be observed; however, for the bulbs (B), (C) and (D) smoke balls appear around the filament. These are spherical in shape and consist of particles which developed around the evaporation source instead of rising as convection smoke. The brightness of (B), (C), (D) was seen to increase consecutively (Fig. 2). Especially in the case of (D), a few branches of smoke burst out in various directions at 1,100 degrees Celsius. This smoke burst was expected in this experiment (Fig. 3, not reproduced). Fine particles of uniform size from 20 nm top 50 nm were found deposited on the inside walls of the bulbs (A),(B) and (C), but in the bulb (D) the particles of Ag were widely distributed in size from 20 nm to 10 mm with clear habit. Observations The conventional idea of evaporation in gas is that a ``Langmuir sheath,'' a sheath of certain gas molecules, which is not affected by convection, exists on the surface of the evaporation source and vapor molecules are supposed to be moving there through diffusion. As a boundary condition, the saturation vapor pressure of the temperature of evaporation source is assumed and, on the external surface of the sheath, the vapor pressure is assumed to be 0. The diffusion speed calculated on the basis of these assumptions is considered to be the evaporation speed. The diffusion speed is decided by the thickness of this diffusion sheath. Actually, the thickness of this sheath is decided by the condition of convection, but it is difficult to generally predict the thickness. In reality, there is no other way than estimating the thickness from the results. Under conditions of low gravity or when there is no convection, the whole inside of the vessel is the diffusion sheath. So, the thickness becomes overwhelmingly larger compared to a case in which there is convection. This theoretically reduces the diffusion speed to an extremely low level, almost stopping evaporation. The results of the experiment, however, differ largely from such a surmise. In either case, evaporation of the sample silver was observed and smoke of particulates was generated. In an experiment ball (D), in which Xe gas with a large atomic weight was enclosed under high pressure of 100 Torr, the smoke ball became unstable and smoke was observed gushing out through many points. This phenomenon cannot be explained at all with the conventional theory that evaporation is the diffusion of vapor. In this experiment, one experiment ball was used per parameter. However, preliminary experiments conducted so far, using drop capsule and airplanes [6-9], guarantee that the observed phenomenon is not accidental. It is significant that the phenomenon, observed in the preliminary experiments, was also observed this time under long time stable conditions with the lowest gravity. To explain this fact, this writer and others have proposed a new model for evaporation in gas.[5] In this model, evaporation is not considered to be simple diffusion. It is considered that, as in the case of vacuum evaporation, evaporation is caused by the spontaneous emission of vapor atoms from an evaporation source. Emitted atoms reach the wall as they are in vacuum. In a gas, the atoms collide with the gas, are scattered and mix with the gas. Then the atoms spread inside the vessel through scattering. When the emission speed is greater than the diffusion speed, the difference stays somewhere in space and constitutes a part with high vapor density. The higher the gas pressure and the larger the atomic weight, the slower the diffusion speed of vapor becomes, raising the density of vapor that stays in space. This idea is explained with the following equation. Formula D,p and J respectively show diffusion coefficient, vapor density and emission atom flow. By solving this equation, the vapor density distribution as shown in Fig. 4 obtained. This example suggests the possibility of forming of a part of saturation vapor. Its supersaturation degree tends to rise as gas pressure and the mass number of atoms are increased. It is considered that the instability of the smoke interface and the gushing of smoke as observed in the experiment ball (D) are caused by the vapor pressure when it surpasses gas pressure. Fig. 4. Calculated vapor density distributions Likewise, heat is considered to concentrate near the evaporation source in the state of low gravity without convection. The relationship between abnormally a high filament temperature of smoke and its premature snapping in the experiment ball (D) is being analyzed by opening the experiment ball. This report does not touch on the particles that were generated as they are now being analyzed. However, we report here that ultrafine particles of silver with a good homogeneousness of almost 20 nm were obtained from the experiment ball (A),(B),(C). Applications 1) Space high-temperature nuclear fusion reactor Achievement of high-temperature nuclear fusion, utilizing high-temperature, high-density concentration that can be obtained in high-temperature gas in the state of weightlessness in space. 2) Material synthesis utilizing gas atmosphere reactions. The improvement of production efficiency of high-performance diamond membrane and semiconductor material utilizing the high-density concentration of reacting gas. 3) Improvement of performances of ultrafine particles application material by homogenizing particles.
