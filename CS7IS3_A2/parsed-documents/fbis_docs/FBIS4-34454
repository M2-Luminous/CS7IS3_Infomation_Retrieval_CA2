FBIS4-34454 "drlat118_m_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-118 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 Brazil Canceling Argentine Visit Unrelated To Support for Salinas Canceling Argentine Visit Unrelated To Support for Salinas PY1806034694 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 2149 GMT 17 Jun 94 PY1806034694 Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS Spanish BFN [Text] Brasilia, 17 Jun (AFP-NA) -- The Brazilian Foreign Ministry on 17 June expressed its malaise over the stance taken by Argentina during the Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and government held in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) last week concerning its endorsement of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari as a candidate for the GATT presidency. Notwithstanding this, a Brazilian diplomatic spokesman told AFP NEWS AGENCY that the suspension of Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's visit to Brasilia -- scheduled for the end of June -- until July was a "coincidence" and had nothing to do with the other issue, as had been hinted at by the local press on 17 June. The Itamaraty (seat of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry) spokesman reported that having officially announced the candidacy of Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero for GATT's presidency on 7 June, the Brazilian Government informed its Latin American counterparts. On that occasion, Argentina and Mexico -- without making any type of commitments -- allegedly had been in favor of Ricupero's candidacy to replace Irishman Peter Sutherland. This is why it was considered in "poor taste" that another candidate was proposed and supported in the absence of the Brazilian delegation (when President Itamar Franco left the summit due to the unexpected death of his nephew and private secretary, Ariosto Franco). The same source said, nonetheless, that this will neither affect Brazil's good relations with Argentina nor the Common Market of the South [Mercosur] integration process, nor negotiations on the establishment of a South American Free Trade Zone sponsored by Brazil. The suspension of Cavallo's trip to Brazil was made at the request of the Brazilian Finance Ministry, which at the time originally scheduled for his visit -- the end of June -- will be putting the final touches on the implementation of the new currency at par with the dollar -- the real -- scheduled for 1 July. Cavallo's visit surely will take place at the end of July after the Mercosur summit in Buenos Aires that will be attended by Argentine President Carlos Menem, Brazilian President Itamar Franco, Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle.
