Bencard, Ines Bronowski: "Costly Compromises"] [Text] The district attorney's office in Halle and the criminal police in Eisleben are now bringing charges for subsidy fraud in connection with the cleanup of ecological contamination in the new laender. As far as is known, millions have been paid out from the Trust Agency and land treasury through Trust Agency-owned Mansfeld Umwelt- und Recycling GmbH and the nonprofit cleanup company Mansfelder Land to the Eisleben recycling company MFD, without the corresponding work having been done. What was brought to light in the Mansfeld region indicates what is in store for the federal government and the laender from the regulation on financing the ecological pollution. This business of the cleanup billions, which the taxpayers have to come up with, has triggered a boom in a highly profitable market--and for dubious suppliers as well. After the Mansfeld scandal came out, Hettstedt district administrator Hans-Peter Sommer, for example, demanded that Trust Agency chief Birgit Breuel impose public oversight of contracts, performance, and payments. Here things are not so good. In many cases Birgit Breuel's Berlin agency has issued insufficient regulations for the treatment of ecological pollution in privatizations, criticized the Federal Supreme Auditing Institute in its most recent annual report: - In the privatization contracts the concept of "ecological pollution was predominantly not unequivocal and not uniformly applied;" even the cost of cleanup, restoration, and maintenance costs was extra. - In one out of every two contracts signed by the end of 1992, the Trust Agency did not limit its cost liability. - As late as the second half of 1992, in four out of 10 contracts the Trust Agency had not locked in "the participatory rights which, among other things, assure the authorization and followup of ecological pollution measures by the Trust Agency." The agency is trying to play down the whole thing. "The Auditing Institute," dismisses Heiner Bonnenberg, among others, head of the Trust Agency's Directorate for Environment and Pollution, "criticizes everything we do." He has to admit, however, that "oversight is in fact our problem." The reason: According to Bonnenberg, many privatizations were completed under "time and quantitative pressure." Without compromises many interested buyers would probably simply have turned away for fear of incalculable pollution risks. The Trust Agency often had to make pragmatic decisions. For this reason the Trust Agency, before the 22 October 1992 Federal Government-Laender-administrative agreement on sharing the cleanup costs, agreed to participate extensively in the cost--in some cases up to 90 percent. About 3,000 contracts, perhaps even 1,000 more, contain such agreements. No one knows what the actual cost of the cleanup will ultimately be. To be sure, with its "pollution assessment" instrument the Trust Agency has tried to achieve an overview of about 3,000 cases within two years. Without clearly defined opportunities for cooperation and control, however, that will scarcely be enough. In the Trust Agency's "planned final balance" of 270 billion German marks [DM], Trust Agency head Breuel insists that, out of precaution, she has reserved funds amounting to DM 12 to 15 billion for environmental cleanup. Will that be enough? "There are always surprises," Birgit Breuel concedes. Another uncertainty factor in the billion-mark poker about pollution is the definition problem: How far should the cleanup actually go? At least in the privatization contracts, the Federal Supreme Auditing Institute charges, there are no such specifications. This problem could be expensive not only for the Trust Agency. Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer, at any rate, fears that for the billion-mark amounts which various expert estimators mention "one could probably return the soil of the entire ex-GDR to its virgin state." Cleanup can thus mean only one thing to Toepfer: Making subsequent utilization of each surface possible without danger for humans and environment. The minister therefore urgently requests passage of the Federal Soil Protection Law, which exists as a draft bill and is now being sent around for comment. The draft bill provides for nationally uniform specification of the demands for pollution cleanup by means of legal regulations. This would pave the way for the Technical Soil Directive demanded by Toepfer, which is to establish exact criteria for the condition of the soil for certain applications. It has not even been clarified how, after the Trust Agency concludes its operational business in 1994, the pollution agreements are to be continued. "Whether another successor institution will be created," says Bonnenberg, "or whether a department of the Federal Ministry of Finance will take over, has not yet been determined."
