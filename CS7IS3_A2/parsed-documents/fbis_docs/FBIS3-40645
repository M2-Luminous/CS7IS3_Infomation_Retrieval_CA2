Its direct effect will be on our self-preservation. First, we will be compelled to meet 2 to 3.3 percent of our domestic demand for food through imports. Food products including fish, meat, dairy and poultry are subject to these clauses. Grants on food products will have to be reduced. At first, it will be reduced by 20 percent. Consider the fact that Japan gives 700 percent grants. Even after giving a cut of 20 percent, 680 percent remains.The U.S. and European nations also give some 300 percent grants. In general, it is common to see various types of agricultural grants ranging from 60 percent to 150 percent. A 20 percent reduction in it is really not much. We have only 6 percent in grants. Further reduction would prove fatal to the farmer. Our commerce minister claims, since we have foreign exchange deficits, the Dunkel clauses will not apply to us, whereas the finance minister says that he has managed to get rid of the deficits. Now, we don't know who is telling the truth and who is not. The fact is though, that whether we are having deficits or not will be determined by GATT, depending on what the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have to say, not what our own commerce, or finance minister says, and we will have to abide by that. Cutting agricultural grants will result in fertilizer-price increases. Fertilizer consumption will decrease, and we have sown such seeds that, with the dearth of fertilizers, food production will also decrease. To improve production, the demand for certain imported fertilizers, will go up. They sell for less than the local fertilizers, since tariffs have been relaxed. this will cause the indigenous fertilizer factories to shut down. Asia's biggest fertilizer plant will close down with heavy losses, and 20 smaller ones will also shut down. Approximately 12 to 15 thousand laborers will become unemployed. As our fertilizer production closes, foreign manufacturers will start quoting prices as they please, and everyone knows what can happen. Then we will have to import food grains. The commerce minister says that it will not exceed 3.3 percent of our needs. But he is forgetting that if imports exceed 3.3 percent, then it will be hard to control it. The new proposals state that if food imports should exceed 3.3 percent, then the duty may be increased, and that too not more than 30 percent. Why doesn't he tell the nation like it is? Our food consumption includes defense needs. We had better decide also how much of a store we have in this area. This is a risky business. Our enemy can always take advantage of this. We should not forget that when we were fighting a war with Pakistan, the U.S. was sending us essential supplies on a weekly basis, and we had to stop ourselves when we had almost finished our business. We have attained self-sufficiency with great difficulty and now, the new proposal is going to ruin our farmers. The government will no longer determine grain prices, and the small farmer will be compelled to compete with dynamic pricing during harvest. It is possible that the foreign companies involved in food trade will fill their coffers at such time. With their affluence, they will buy out all available grains, export massively while the Indian market will be rendered uncompetitive, and our grain production will decidedly suffer. In this buy-sell, export scenario, there will be nothing for the Indian farmer. He will remain poor. Thus there is no profit in sight for the Indian farmer. It is also not clear how the country benefits. The commerce minister does not tire of saying that adopting Dunkel proposals will increase export opportunities for Indian agriculture, but he is forgetting that no country is going to want to import any thing before the quality and purity of our products are put through exacting standards. Many times already, Indian goods could not be exported because of not meeting international standards. Intellectual property rights issue will seriously influence agriculture, animal husbandry, and the pharmaceutical industry. Now even seeds, and other areas of national interest in agriculture are laid utterly open for multinational firms to enter into. These companies will use their affluence and advertising to sell their seeds to our farmers. We have not forgotten the East India Company days. Paddy and wheat fields all through Bengal and Bihar had been converted to indigo fields, and slowly we grew deficient in food. There is also the risk that our eating habits may have to be modified. Once a farmer buys the seeds of these companies, he will got caught in their evil web. Because they hold the patents, even the seeds obtained from farming may remain their property. Because of TRIPS [Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights], we will have to amend and abide by our patent laws, but the price of drugs is certain to climb unrestrained. TRIPS will also end mandatory licensing and technology transfer will become impossible. Since it becomes possible to patent production, and in a way imports are being considered patented things, manufacturing foreign drugs locally will also have to come to an end. It is only natural that they will start selling at the import price, which will be the price of the producer. For example, four tablets (500mg each) of cifrolfoxesin sells in India for Rs.43.50, in the U.S., for Rs.300, in Pakistan for Rs.302.75, and in England for Rs.363.60. The price of 10 tablets (400mg each) of norfloxecin is Rs.33.61, in India, whereas in the U.S. it costs the equivalent of Rs.613.77. Similarly, 40 tablets of famatidine costs Rs.26.24 in India, and in the U.S., the same costs Rs.511.78. Cancer drugs, and drugs for heart disease which get manufactured in foreign countries, will sell in India for the equivalent of their price. The removal of mandatory licensing and relaxing of import restrictions are going to result in drug manufacturers not worrying to sell for lesser price in India. Manufacturing patents will also restrict the methods of production, even if we should be able to produce drugs locally. Indian industry will suffer thus. Our health and welfare program will remain so only on paper. In the event of a ten-twenty fold increase in life-saving drugs, who will be able to procure medicines for supplying to government hospitals? Even as it is, we are unable to give free medicines in our public hospitals, and with these developments, it is going to become difficult to even run these hospitals. The effects of TRIPS won't stop with just seeds, or drugs. It will affect our whole scientific research and industry. Our space and atomic programs, as well as our laboratory experiments will be affected. The genetic, and biochemical research projects will suffer. India will fall back in scientific achievements. In the area of public service, foreign banks have already infiltrated to quite an extent. Most of our businessmen prefer to keep their wealth in foreign banks. If allowed to enter the life-insurance scene, these foreign financial institutions have the opportunity to walk away with huge amounts of money. Since there is no mandatory seniority requirements anymore, such an entry will affect our developmental programs. Our backward areas will suffer even more. By accepting intellectual property revisions, we will also have to overhaul our existing patent laws. This is an attack on constitutional sovereignty. The Constitution recognizes our right to make indigenous laws, but now we will have to adopt them to fit those laws made under GATT. What will happen then to our parliament and assemblies? The whole responsibility for agriculture, and pharmaceuticals rest with state governments in our country. But the right to revise many of their laws has now been given to GATT. This is an impingement of the basic rights of Indian citizens to food, livelihood, health, autonomy, and democracy. Signing this agreement amounts to ignoring the treaty-precedents of our country, which is the backbone of our Constitution. This international agreement has far reaching implications, and the effects are not yet completely known. It will impact such rudimentary things as our culture, consumption, and habits. It will affect our politics, and our security. So, the significant question here is whether in signing such an agreement, only the executive branch of the government should be involved, or the approval of the Parliament and people also sought? Can the government be given the license to meddle with the very basic character of the nation? According to the Indian Constitution, some powers are veted with the state governments, and only they can make decisions with regard to these matters. Now may the central government take decisions in such matters without concurring with these state governments? Whatever rights have already been given to state governments through the second and third articles of the Constitution, may the central government now snatch them away, and give them to an international entity, without verifying the Constitutional provisions? Will article 253 of the Constitution provide extensive answers for these nagging questions? Do the citizens of India have the basic right to food, livelihood, and health, or not? Many constitutional questions like these will arise, and they will need to be answered satisfactorily. It is even more important to find out which is more important, the government, or the nation? Does the government have the license to work against the country's interests? The truth is that adopting such harmful proposals as Dunkel's can never be said to be in the nation's interest. Does any government have the license to let its country's future be taken hostage like this? It should be realized that in the GATT talks, and in the Dunkel proposals, the jargon mentions "contracting parties," not "people." In the new GATT, Indian national interest has been greatly compromised. Throwing in the scare of seclusion, the central government wants to convince the nation of economic benefits, but it has only benefitted the already rich nations in opening up Indian market with the greatest ease to their goods, and in making India a showroom for multinational companies. In textiles, which was our greatest export product, we have not been able to get any significant breaks. Quotas still exist, and the European Community has only said that in ten years, they will open up for Indian exports. But it is not clear what percentage of their textile-market will be opened to us. If we are unable to bring things under control in textiles, we may face the unemployment of multitudes of workers. The Indian government did not show firmness in these negotiations. They behaved like a `banana' republic, whose spine broke in just one blow. It threw down its arms in front of the utmost stringent international financial establishment. It was completely missed that being left out of certain things is not in itself a mistake or degradation. Since we would not sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we have been left out of space programs. But, these are the only two areas, where we have developed indigenous technology significantly. We must not forget that India's population is considerably larger than that of the G-7 countries together. We are a market in ourselves because of our huge population, natural resources, capable engineers, and scientists. There is a tradition here that started in ancient times predating Koutilya [eminent economist of antiquity], and we have held our place in international trade. The potent truth that this country could become an economic stalwart once again, has been ignored. The country should be equipped to fight to win in the battle of economic independence. The political parties that realize this truth must cast aside their minor differences and join hands towards this major common cause.
