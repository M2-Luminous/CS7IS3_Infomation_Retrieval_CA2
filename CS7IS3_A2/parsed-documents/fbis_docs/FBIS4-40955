Much Dearer, `Roskhleboprodukt' Corporation Chairman Believes"] [Text] As is frequently the case in our country, gloom abruptly turned to uncommon joy at the mention of the upcoming harvest. It was clear to everyone that, if there are more ears in the fields, Russia will not have to buy grain abroad this year. This is remarkable, of course, but we will have to pay more for bread at the store. And there had been rumors that the price of bread would go up in June. Unfortunately these rumors have been borne out. Bread has been and is still getting dearer, and the price will continue to go up. Maybe not in June, but in the middle or at the end of the summer 1 kg of bread will cost around 950 rubles [R]. As always, the search for a culprit has begun. Agrarian Party of Russia Chairman Mikhail Lapshin stated that this fact is "in no way connected with demands by the peasantry to boost state support for the agro-industrial complex." Moreover, Mikhail Ivanovich stressed: "Agricultural producers categorically oppose price rises since they gain nothing from them. The peasant's cut of the retail price is just 8-10 percent, whereas it is the government that is allowing bread prices to be ratcheted up without restraint by increasing the cost of grain storage, transportation, and processing and the actual trade in bread." It is extremely difficult right now to keep track of the grain situation in our country, and the picture is pretty clouded anyway because everyone is playing their own game. Nevertheless Leonid Cheshinskiy, president of the "Roskhleboprodukt" federal contracting corporation, believes that "the corporation is in no way to blame for the price." Everything is getting more expensive -- raw materials, fuel and energy resources, and all types of services. In his opinion, the biggest share of the price hike is accounted for by bank credit. Grain currently being stored and processed at the corporation's enterprises has been bought on credit at the bank rate, hence the increase in the bread price is going to average 20 percent a month. In addition, however, Leonid Stepanovich acknowledges that the corporation was unable to purchase all the grain and that grain was left with the farms. Many oblasts purchased it from peasants at a price which, as a rule, did not exceed R90,000 a tonne. So they used it to bake more or less cheap bread. At the present time there is practically no grain left on the farms, so now it has to be taken from state resources. The grain has already been paid for, it has incurred interest charges and storage and processing costs, and the price of grain has now risen from R120,000 to R150,000 on the other side of the Urals. The situation is also made worse by the fact that in order to bring a tonne of wheat from Omsk, for example, you need to pay R100,000. As a result the full cost of that tonne will be R250,000. So you can calculate how much a kilogram of bread will cost at the store. But all the indications are that the main problem still lies ahead. The fact is that the Russian Ministry of Agriculture and Food has already determined purchase prices for arable produce. How can the price be determined if, according to the president's edict, this is supposed to be done by the market! The answer can be found in letters from the Ministry of Agriculture and Food that have turned up in the editorial office. Apparently, "because of the undeveloped nature of the market infrastructure, the lack of experience of working in market conditions, and the high level of inflation, agricultural production, procurement, and processing enterprises are experiencing considerable difficulties in determining an advantageous market price." So the Ministry has set guideline purchase prices. For example, this year wheat will be bought for R220,000 a tonne compared to R65,000 last year. Add to this mark-ups and costs totaling another 30 percent, and you end up with the price we have to pay for bread at the store. This is how the market determines the cost. And then the whole cycle starts up again: If grain goes up, so does meat, and therefore the cost of technology and gas goes up too.... Basically, nobody is to blame. It is unclear who can break this vicious circle. Possibly the "Roskhleboprodukt" corporation, which has basically become a private company and naturally has an interest in buying grain as cheaply as possible, even abroad if need be.
