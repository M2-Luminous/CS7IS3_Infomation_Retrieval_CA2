The MPLA chairman took the opportunity to express the MPLA's solidarity with the ANC as it prepares for multiracial elections in South Africa. The audience was also attended by MPLA Secretary General Lopo do Nascimento. Tokyo Sexwale believes that the name of Savimbi is becoming synonymous with something evil. Addressing a news conference this afternoon shortly before leaving the Angolan capital, that ANC official noted that his party will not allow South Africa's elections to result in a bloodbath. [Begin recording] [Sexwale, in English with Portuguese translation in subtitles] We support the talks that are taking place right now in Lusaka between the various parties from Angola but, in supporting those talks, we want to make it absolutely clear that in our view, and in the view of correctness, those talks that are taking place must not overlook the fact that elections have taken place here and some people did win those elections. The defeat of the Angolan elections, which were the outcome of the popular opinion of the people here is the defeat of the elections that will take place tomorrow in South Africa. You asked me a question about Mr. Savimbi. He is an old man. He is an Angolan. He has been on the run for too many years now. The appeal is to give his people a chance. Around the world, the name Savimbi has come to be known as a name representing some form of evil but, as an African, I think he should work toward a situation where one day the name Savimbi can be associated with reconciliation. [Unidentified correspondent] Is there not the danger that Buthelezi or Terreblanche might become another kind of Savimbi in South Africa? [Sexwale] I think until right now, we are also....[pauses] We have made an appeal to those people in the right wing in South Africa, both black and white, the ultra rightwing, like Mr. Buthelezi, like Terreblanche, even at this late hour, when we have completed negotiations, we appeal to them to (?seriously join) the process for elections on 27 April. But I must indicate that, in support of those negotiations that are taking place and in support of the defense of the elections, I think we want to point out that we, in South Africa, have always held the MPLA as our friend. In Zimbabwe, we once held the organization of Mr. Nkomo as an ally, but they lost elections and we accepted the will of the people of Zimbabwe (?behind) Mugabe. We accept, therefore, the will of the people of Angola behind the MPLA. [end recording]
