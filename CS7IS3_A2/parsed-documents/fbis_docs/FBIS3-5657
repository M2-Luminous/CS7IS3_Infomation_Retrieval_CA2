This is the ministry's response to the U.S. Embassy here over its concern on the caning sentence passed by the court on an American teenager, Michael Fay. The ministry noted that Fay's sentencing was the outcome of a fair and transparent legal process. Fay was given every opportunity to defend himself with representation and counsel of his choice. It stressed that the Singapore judicial process cannot apply different standards to persons subjected to the same law. Therefore, it is not correct for the U.S. to say based on the facts on the treatment of other similar cases, this punishment is extreme. The ministry pointed out that Fay is not the first teenaged person nor foreigner to have received the sentence of caning under the Vandalism Act. Twelve Singaporeans and two foreigners, aged 18 to 21, have received caning sentences for vandalism since 1989. The ministry cited some previous vandalism cases. In 1990, a 20-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to a month jail and three strokes for damaging public property. Last year, there was a similar case where a 19-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to three months jail and three strokes of a cane. The ministry said in contrast to these cases, Fay admitted in all to 18 counts of vandalism and six counts of misdeeds. These facts, among others, show that the court sentence meted out to Fay is neither extreme nor unprecedented. Fay, who is 18, was sentenced last Thursday to four months in prison and six strokes of a cane for vandalism. Fay is appealing against the sentence and he is currently on a [Singapore] $75,000 bail.
