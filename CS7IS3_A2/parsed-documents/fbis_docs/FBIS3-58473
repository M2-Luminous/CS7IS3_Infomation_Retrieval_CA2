If anyone still had any doubts, then those doubts were removed a short time ago -- half an hour ago -- by a communique from the Quirinale [president's office]. The communique says: In accordance with Article 88 of the Constitution, tomorrow morning President Scalfaro will receive Senate Speaker Spadolini at the Quirinale at 1130, and he will receive [Chamber of Deputies Speaker] Napolitano at 1700 that afternoon. [passage omitted] The Quirinale's communique says, I repeat: In accordance with Article 88. This is the article concerned with the early dissolution of the chambers of parliament, and it stipulates that the president should consult with the Senate speaker first and then with the Chamber of Deputies speaker before proceeding to dissolve parliament. The chambers should be dissolved by Sunday [16 January], when [President] Scalfaro will then set aside his reservations about Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's resignation. [passage omitted]
