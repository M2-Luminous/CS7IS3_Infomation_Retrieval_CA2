Returning to reality usually means (?returning to the essence of the matter), which, like every other nucleus, is covered in darkness. This should have been borne in mind by those who, entering political waters, assumed the responsibility of leading the Albanian people in Kosovo toward the aim that, as everyone knows, is outside the domain of serious political thinking. The intoxicating seductiveness of the idea of Kosovo as an independent state, which would be represented by these very people in the capital cities of Europe and the world with the accompanying sounds of an anthem and a guard of honor, is returning to Rugova's supporters as a bitter pill that they do not want to swallow but cannot spit out either. The painful sobering up has divided the Kosmet [Kosovo- Metohija] political elite. The rift in Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo and clashes between the party and the government of the so-called Republic of Kosovo that has been concealed for a long time have escalated in the past few weeks. The party was left by Jusuf Budzovi, Ismet Salihu, Ibrahim Berisa, and Dr. Rexhep Islami. Rugova, Agani, and Hiseni have stayed in the Presidency of the so-called Republic of Kosova. The clash between the government and the party leadership must have reached the upper limit considering that Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister of the self-declared Kosovo state, is being asked to resign. Shkelzen Malici is publicly saying that the government is playing more the role of an improvised ministry for relations with other countries than is making vital decisions. The problem also arose as the consequences of the undefined hierarchy and control within the secessionist leadership. Ibrahim Rugova has so far been the untouchable boss. The illegally elected parliament now formally no longer exists. The so- called government has been reduced to the prime minister and one minister, even though 17 ministries had been planned. So, everyone is accountable to Rugova, and he is accountable to no one. Perhaps the motives for these clashes, whose cause is a lot more deeper and is encroaching the most sensitive sphere, the sphere of finances, should be sought in this backdrop. This is supported by a statement by Fehmi Agani, who is still loyal to Rugova. He said that the distribution of financial resources and the collection of the compulsory 3-percent tax from the workers of Albanian nationality in the country and outside it are beyond control. Rexhep Cosia, who split with Rugova earlier, holds the same view. The proximity of money is directly proportionate to the proximity of authority and every separation from it leads to resistance and proofs that something is wrong with the present authorities. The former self-proclaimed prime minister Jusuf Zeinulahu also spoke up recently. He admitted what he had been aware of right from the beginning. According to him, the Assembly and the Government of the so-called Republic of Kosovo were formed ad hoc with directives from the political parties of Albanians, and are not legitimate. Zeinulahu's public statement about something that many people were aware of has stirred the spirits in the leadership of the so-called Albania alternative and opened the road to the struggle to preserve the present positions, while creating covers in retreat. In this light one should view the participation in the debate in KOHA by the former high official of the Central Committee of the League of Communists and the spectacular return of Veton Suroi, who left a long time ago. That something strange is happening is also confirmed by separate visits to the United States, first by Bukoshi, and then Rugova, and the statement by the former, which was not approved of by the Democratic League of Kosovo. In an interview for the Voice of America, Bukoshi said that the status of an autonomous region for Kosovo can be accepted as the first step toward the ultimate solution of the Kosovo issue. This statement represents a major turnabout in relation to the sacred stand hitherto on Kosovo as an independent state. This raises the question as to why a section of the Albanian political leadership has redefined its position and accepted the existence of Yugoslavia and a dialogue with its legal organs. It is difficult to believe that this a result of regret or bad conscience before one's own nation whom they pushed into an abyss. One could say that this is more a result of the unwilling acceptance of the fact that, on the one hand, no country in the world recognized Kosovo as an independent state, and on the other, that the state of Yugoslavia is sufficiently strongly standing on its legs, and that it is capable of thwarting the political exhibitionism of forced secession without difficulties. In these circumstances an increasing number of Kosmet Albanian politicians and intellectuals are trying to extend their political activities with conciliatory stands. Belligerent statements and the policy of extreme demands have not yielded any results, and the advocates of the idea that the page should be turned over, or even begin writing a new book of political activities by Albanians in Kosovo, are becoming increasingly vociferous.
