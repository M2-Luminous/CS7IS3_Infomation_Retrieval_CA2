He described his appointment as defamatory. NOTICIAS reports that (Mateus Mufambira) has sent a letter to President Joaquim Chissano asking him to remove him from that post in his capacity as the official responsible for appointing persons to such posts. In his letter, (Mateus Mufambira) says he was appointed without Renamo consulting him beforehand concerning his availability. He also says he has never been a Renamo sympathizer or member. Carvalho Pensado, political adviser to Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama, told NOTICIAS that he cannot understand such hypocrisy on the part of (Mateus Mufambira). Pensado added that (Mufambira's) appointment came as a result of previous contacts and that (Mufambira) himself had expressed a willingness to occupy that post. (Mateus Mufambira) is a teacher at Primeiro de Maio Preuniversity School in Nampula. He was born in Buzi, in Sofala Province.
