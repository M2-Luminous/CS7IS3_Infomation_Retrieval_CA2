"In Cairo, Foreign Minister Peres and Yasir 'Arafat announced an agreement on self-rule and on the terms of withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho," Clinton told the World Jewish Congress. "I think another big milestone has been achieved today," he said. The negotiations in Cairo were designed to implement the historic accord signed in Washington last September and setting December 13, 1993, for the military pullout of Israel, which balked at negotiations over details of the plan for weeks. Clinton said that the U.S. approach is to ensure the successful implementation of the declaration of principles and will show the Israelis that the agreement can not only enhance their security but provide a self-government for their Palestinian neighbors. Meanwhile, he described the U.S. commitment to maintaining and enhancing the security of Israel as "ironclad" and a precondition for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. "To achieve our goal of a comprehensive settlement," Clinton stressed, "we insist that the Arab boycott of Israel end now."
