Vavilov, first deputy minister of finance of the Russian Federation, by V. Andreyev; place and date not given: "High Taxes or High Responsibility?"] [Text] The problem of nonpayments can be called one of the main ills of the Russian economy which also affects the fiscal interests of the state--many enterprises simply stop paying taxes, the absence of funds in their settlement accounts being given as the explanation. At the same time, the potential of regulatory state organs with regard to the nonpayers is quite limited. Our interlocutor, A. Vavilov, the first deputy minister of finance of the Russian Federation, discussed measures that the state intends to take in order to restore order in this area. [Andreyev] Andrey Petrovich, how could a situation emerge in which even the tax inspector is not in a position to collect the amount of taxes due from an enterprise? [Vavilov] The essence of the nonpayment problem is in the fact that enterprises are no longer held accountable for the nonpayment of anything. In conjunction with a lack of funds, they do not pay taxes to the budget, do not pay their suppliers for goods and services, and so on. At the same time, some enterprises have, in addition to the settlement account, foreign-exchange, deposit, and other accounts to which the tax inspectorate has no access. Besides, even the most inveterate nonpayers as a rule own certain property that is not directly related to production operations--passenger cars, and so on. Even in a case where the bank has on file the demand of the tax inspectorate to debit funds without acceptance, an enterprise will manage to acquire such property or make other payments (for example, pay bonuses to its employees) bypassing the settlement account. Under the current procedure, the tax inspector who represents state power is powerless. [Andreyev] However, if someone is not in a position to pay his debts in a normal economy, he may simply be declared bankrupt. Even here a creditor is entitled to bring a relevant lawsuit in the court. Can the tax service be empowered to at least act as a regular creditor does, and can a debt to the state be considered possible grounds for making a claim for all property of the enterprise? [Vavilov] This is precisely the essence of measures proposed by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Russia in order to create an effective system for the collection of taxes. First of all, the tax service will be granted the right to levy execution upon any accounts of a given legal entity or individual in the event that taxes are not transferred to the budget in a timely manner. The tax inspectorate will also be granted the right to confiscate toward the unpaid taxes a proportion of the property of enterprises which is not directly related to the main line of production. Finally, in the extreme case that these funds for the settlement with the budget are lacking, reorganization measures or bankruptcy procedures may be used against the enterprise. Of course, the latter scenario is quite painful and undesirable, but it will be used unequivocally against enterprises whose debt to the state and whose financial situation leave no hope for the normalization of the situation. We also plan to introduce certain punitive sanctions to be used against companies implicated in the violations of disbursement discipline and procedures for settlements in cash. Certain restrictions also existed in this area before, but violators were virtually not liable in any way. [Andreyev] Are there plans to introduce any new taxes or change their rates, in addition to what was envisioned by the December decrees of the president? [Vavilov] At present, we are not planning to make any major changes in the tax system itself. As of now, the most urgent task is to create an optimal mechanism for the collection of taxes. [Andreyev] In what manner will the government solve the problem of mutual nonpayments by enterprises as far as the prevention of the growth of defaulted debt is concerned? [Vavilov] On the suggestion of the Bank of Russia, a calendar sequence of payments will be introduced. At present a debtor enterprise receiving funds for its products may dispose of them as it sees fit, allocating them, for example, to term deposits or conversion instead of paying the debt whereas in the immediate future, the enterprise will be able to dispose of the funds received only after it settles with the state and other creditors. Even the possibility of introducing a unified bank account with settlement, currency, deposit and other subaccounts is being considered as an extreme measure. Other, less radical scenarios for solving the problem are possible. However, control over the honoring of their obligations by enterprises will be restored, one way or another.
