He described the nature of the dictatorial system ruling the world. He referred to the false propaganda and machinations of arrogant powers against Islam and the Iranian nation as clear signs of their fear of the lofty ideals of the Islamic system. The great leader of the revolution said the emphasis of the Muslim nation and government of Iran on the independence of nations and their sovereignty over their own natural resources and wealth suits none of the world powers. He said: Today, no call for justice is raised from any country except the Iranian nation and Government against the oppression committed under the blanket of the new order of domination of nations in the world. That is a fact which is confirmed and admired by all fair-minded observers throughout the world. His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said the struggle of the Iranian nation in the eight-year war imposed by the Iraqi regime and the unjust powers backing it was a cause for all arrogant powers to fear the Iranian nation. He said: While the world's political and economic powers plunder, at the lowest prices, the natural resources of developing countries, or countries held back, the Iranian people, with their slogan of independence and struggle against arrogant powers, continues its course. The leader of the Islamic revolution said the great and glorious resistance of the Iranian nation over the past 15 years has been a source of hope to other nations. Describing the conspiracies of the ringleaders of arrogance to crush the resistance of the Iranian nation, he said: America's guileful remarks in expressing willingness to establish ties with Iran is not tantamount to its acceptance of past mistakes or an undertaking to mend its ways in the future. It is a deceitful and evil move. The great leader of the Islamic revolution said: America has said establishing ties with Iran would be subject to the Iranian nation discarding its fundamental stances. One of which principles is noninterference by arrogant powers in the affairs of the Iranian nation. They should know that the great Iranian nation, which has an ancient culture and a glorious, historical past, has become like tempered steel after overcoming great difficulties and would never accept domination by America and arrogant powers. Stressing the alertness and presence of every Iranian on various scenes, the leader of the Islamic revolution said: Today, a great national, Islamic, and divine movement prevails throughout Iran and the Iranian nation is proud of what it has achieved up to now. The president, statesmen, Majles deputies, and the judiciary officials have all risen from the bosom of the people and have popular sentiments and direction. And the country's officials should, in a joint effort with the help of the people, endeavor to overcome shortages and eradicate problems. They should traverse this clear course by utilizing the blessings of Islam, the Koran, divine guidance, and the Imam's [Khomeyni's] instructions. Referring to the Koran's verses and wisdom about the necessity for Muslims to be alert, aware, and watchful the great leader said: Those who are intoxicated with lust and power are negligent. They consider as their enemy those who have been awakened by God's guiding light. Therefore, they are trying to make them ignorant like themselves and distract them from their right path. And the Iranian nation, because of its great divine victory in raising the banner of Islam and making proud the name of God and the prophets in the world, must today regard the mention of God's name and divine guidance as a fundamental issue and shed any negligence in various aspects of its life.
