Article 5 reforms the Stamp Tax Law, and Article 6 extends the deadline set in Article 22 of the Basic Budget Law for the executive branch to submit the draft budget to Congress each year. Article 7 establishes norms regulating the concession of national public projects and services. [Begin recording] [National Convergence Senator Bernardo Celli] We are remembering that people are an important factor in all social processes. The current law is a combination of something economic and something social. [Radical Cause Deputy Alberto Muller Rojas] Congress must maintain control over certain legal instruments that have the potential to seriously and adversely affect Venezuelan citizen. [AD Senator William Davila Barrio] We are opposed because we are talking about a matter that will have a deep impact on the state as well as society. [end recording] After the Special Powers Law is enacted and published in the official gazette, the president of the Republic has 30 days to implement all the measures contained in the law. That means the special powers will only be granted to the president for 30 days.
