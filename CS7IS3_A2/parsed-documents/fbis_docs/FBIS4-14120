Faysal al-Husayni told reporters the Palestinian delegation here would inform Christopher of some of the issues obstructing the launch of Palestinian self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. Christopher is expected here later Wednesday, after arriving in Riyadh earlier on the first leg of a Middle East tour designed to give fresh impetus to the peace process. He would be told of the difficulties "so that he can try to convince the Israelis to change" some of their positions, al-Husayni. Israeli and PLO delegations resumed their talks here Wednesday to try to iron out the remaining differences to seal an accord to launch self-rule. Al-Husayni, who is the main PLO leader in the occupied territories, said although the issue of jurisdiction in the territories remained "the main obstacle" there had been a breakthrough. He said both sides had agreed that the Israeli military controlling the three lateral roads linking Israel to the settlements in Gaza would have the right to question non-Israeli and non-Palestinian foreigners. If the visitors were accused of a serious crime, then they would be handed over to Palestinian authorities, al-Husayni said. But the two sides still disagree on who should have the right to try a Palestinian who attacked a settler, he said, adding he was not taking part in the talks. He insisted the future Palestinian authorities should be given "full powers," saying incomplete powers would reduce their ability "to provide total security," in Gaza, where Jewish settlements will remain, and in Jericho. Meanwhile in Jerusalem Palestinian leaders said they would urge Christopher to press Israel to ease its restrictions on the territories. Sa'ib Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace talks in Washington, said the situation in the territories and the continued Israeli settlement would be "the main subject on the agenda" at a meeting planned with Christopher in East Jerusalem on Friday. Christopher is expected to travel to Israel from Egypt on Thursday for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin Friday before heading to Syria on Saturday. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said on Tuesday it was "not impossible" that he would meet with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on Thursday in Cairo, but it depended on how the talks progressed. Arafat is expected here Wednesday overnight, an Egyptian official said.
