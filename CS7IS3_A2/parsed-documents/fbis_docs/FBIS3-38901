Agreements are also being offered to traditionally neutral countries like Sweden and Finland, in addition to those East European countries that want membership in the alliance. Russia too has received an invitation, and it is in principle favorably disposed to it. NATO has its own grounds for regarding the participation of countries like Finland and Sweden as desirable. Then too, broad participation will reduce the former East bloc countries' fear that partnership is only a polite way of leaving them to fend for themselves. Finland has to carefully consider its own advantage. A partnership arrangement with NATO is not a first-class security policy issue for us. If we take the right action, we can derive a modest benefit from it, but one worth aiming for. If we act clumsily, we will end up a member of the wrong group in the wrong context. Before the end of last year, the government was still vacillating to a great extent, but now it seems to be making up its mind. The government Foreign Affairs Committee said on Wednesday [19 January] that it in principle takes a positive view of the goals of this partnership since the NATO initiative is aimed at stabilizing conditions in Europe, not creating new dividing lines. A report is now being drafted on the matter. Cooperation, especially with Sweden, is considered to be important, and our own contribution is seen as lying primarily in peacekeeping, an area in which Finland has experience. According to the committee, Finland is not interested in military cooperation proper. Whether partnership is a NATO waiting room for the East European countries or not, Finland's proper place is clearly not on the same bench. Finland's current interests do not lie in any military alliance, but in the European Union (EU) membership for which we have applied. The EU will also be the first and most natural frame of reference of our future cooperation on security policy. However, the mere idea of a "peace partnership" need not frighten people. After all, the term itself is a typical product of the military policy poster paint shop, bland and without content. Nevertheless, if Russia and most of the former socialist countries agree on their own arrangments and if our neighbor, Sweden, is also interested, it will be worth Finland's while to be among them, if only because of their discussion contacts and the publicity that NATO meetings bring with them. The wisest thing for us to do is to bear in mind that haste makes waste and be selective about choosing those forms of cooperation that are suitable for us in particular. Peacekeeping is a very appropriate area even if the whole way it operates has to be reconsidered following the painful experiences of the Balkans and Somalia. If the network of partnership agreements in time achieves an improvement in the flow of information and understanding across Europe's old dividing lines, so much the better. The idea of a peace partnership arose in NATO when the East European countries wanted security guarantees from that organization that it could not provide. The initiative is as as far as NATO's unity and political determination will go at the present time. The East European countries will have to be content with it. Partnership promises Finland a new form of cooperation that is not very central, but which will nevertheless make it possible for us to attain some limited advantages.
