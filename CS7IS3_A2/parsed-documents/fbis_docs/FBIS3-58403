Hasselbach had said that Haider has had personal contact with the Austrian neo-Nazi scene. FPOe Press Spokesman Peter Westenthaler: "This is absolute nonsense." FPOe Secretary General Karl-Heinz Grasser said there never has been any contact between Haider and the two neo-Nazis Gottfried Kuessel and Walter Ochensberger. Grasser also said that the FPOe would take legal action against DER STANDARD and Hasselbach. However, the FPOe did not object to Hasselbach's book entitled Die Abrechnung [Settling of Accounts], where Kuessel speaks of links between neo-Nazis and the FPOe. FPOe Secretary General Grasser called Hasselbach's statements a "complete web of lies." Reinhart Rohr, Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] chairman for Carinthia, sees these reports in a different light. "If Hasselbach's allegations are true," it becomes clear why Haider should consider the investigations into the letter-bomb attacks [carried out in Austria last December] "hostile to the state." FPOe Deputy Helmut Prasch criticized the fact that the SPOe seems to attach greater importance to the statement of a neo-Nazi than to "statements by a democratically elected Austrian politician."
