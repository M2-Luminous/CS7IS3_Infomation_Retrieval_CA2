Background and Specific Comments Requested On March 11, 1994, the Independent Petroleum Association of America petitioned the Department of Commerce to initiate an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862), to determine the effects on the national security of imports of crude oil and petroleum products. On April 5, 1994, the Department of Commerce formally accepted the petition and initiated an investigation. The findings and recommendations of the investigation are to be reported by the Secretary of Commerce to the President no later than December 31, 1994 (i.e., within 270 days). For further details on this investigation, see the Federal Register of April 12, 1994 (59 FR 17335). Consistent with the interest of the U.S. Department of Commerce in soliciting public comments on issues affecting U.S. industry and national security, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is holding public hearings as part of the investigation. The presentations at the hearings will assist the Department in determining whether imports of crude oil and petroleum products constitute a threat to the national security and in formulating remedies if such a threat is found to exist. The Department is particularly interested in comments and information directed to the criteria listed in ยง705.4 of the National Security Industrial Base Regulations (15 CFR parts 700 to 709) (the ``regulations'') as they affect national security, including the following: (a) Quantity of the articles subject to the investigation and other circumstances related to the importation of such articles; (b) Domestic production and productive capacity needed for these articles to meet projected national defense requirements; (c) Existing and anticipated availability of human resources, products, raw materials, production equipment, facilities, and other supplies and services needed to produce these articles; (d) Growth requirements of domestic industries needed to meet national defense requirements and the supplies and services (including investment, exploration and development) necessary to assure such growth;
