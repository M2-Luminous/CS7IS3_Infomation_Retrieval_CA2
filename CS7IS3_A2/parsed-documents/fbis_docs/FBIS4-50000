Jiang Zemin said: China and the United States bear an important responsibility for the future of the world and the destiny of mankind. We should do something for the people of the world. Although there are some disputes, some problems, and differences between the two countries, in the final analysis, efforts should be made to improve relations between them. This is required for world peace and stability. Jiang Zemin said: Practice demonstrates fully that Sino-U.S. relations are not merely limited to bilateral ties but are closely related to the international situation. In the past, Sino-U.S. relations developed more smoothly whenever both sides were able to overcome their differences in social systems and value concepts, proceeded from their common interests, developed mutually beneficial cooperation, and continually expanded common points on the basis of mutual respect, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, and treated each other on an equal footing. However, Sino-U.S. relations met with difficulties or setbacks, or even regressed whenever these principles were violated, differences over ideology were stressed, the other side's interests were ignored, views were imposed on others, and sanctions and pressure were applied. These historical lessons are very profound. Jiang Zemin stressed: A good opportunity has presented itself for the development of Sino-U.S. relations. It is hoped that both sides will grasp the opportunity, respect each other, seek common ground while reserving differences, and work together on the basis of the principles set forth by the three Sino-U.S. communiques, so as to enable their relations to develop on a healthy and normal track. During the meeting, Jiang Zemin praised Dr. Kissinger for working vigorously to develop Sino-U.S. relations with the foresight of a strategist and the courage of a statesman, saying that this is commendable. Kissinger said: I have always been against the use of the most- favored-nation trading status [MFN] as a means to exert pressure on China; I am also against putting pressure on China. I hope to see greater improvements in U.S.-Sino relations. Present at the meeting were Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, and others.
