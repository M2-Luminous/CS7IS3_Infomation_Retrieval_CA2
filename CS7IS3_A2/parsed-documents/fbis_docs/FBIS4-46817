Yesterday the members of the Seimas received materials prepared by the Ministry of the Interior, surveying the present state of criminality in Lithuania and attempting to predict the future. One member of the Seimas jested sadly that after these facts and forecasts, the average inhabitant of Lithuania might as well shoot himself, because otherwise he will be shot dead anyway. Several numbers and facts. Seventeen thousand two hundred fifty-seven crimes were registered during the four months of this year. This is 20 percent less than during the same period in 1993. One hundred forty-four crimes are registered daily on the average, or 36 crimes less than last year. The largest number of crimes for 10 thousand inhabitants has been registered in the cities of Neringa (74.1), Klaipeda (73.8), and Vilnius (60.3), and in the districts of Lazdijal (65.7), Kedainial (63) and Panevezys (62.3). This year, every sixth registered crime was of a serious nature, last year it was every tenth one. The increase in serious crimes this year is linked with the increase of crimes of violence per person, in particular of intentional murders, robberies, public thefts. One hundred fifty-eight intentional murders were committed, there were 20 attempts at murder. This is, respectively, 61 intentional murders (62.9 percent) and 5 attempts (33.3 percent) more than last year. Deliberate relatively grave bodily injuries have increased more than two times (from 97 to 207). Every seventh stealing of citizens private property was accomplished by open theft or robbery (last year -- every ninth one). The number of robberies of private property has increased from 136 to 239, or by 75 percent, this year, as compared with 1993. Twenty-four such crimes were registered during the four months of this year, while there were only 4 of them during the same period last year. Firearms are being used more frequently in committing crimes. One hundred seven such crimes, or 11 cases more than last year, were registered during the four months of this year. Five cases of destruction of property or injury due to the use of explosive devices were registered each month, on the average. There was a total of 77 cases of deliberate destruction of property by way of arson. This is 36 cases, or 87 percent, more than last year. Cases of violence against the citizens private property have increased almost three times this year: from 43 to 127. Ten cases of violence against state or public property were registered. No such cases were registered last year. Cases of fraud have become more numerous. Two hundred seventy-five such cases of larceny involving citizens' private property, or 45.5 percent more than last year, have been registered. Fraud in the area of economy has become more frequent. Twenty-four cases of larceny by way of fraud involving state or public property were registered. This is six times more than in 1993. This year, every sixth crime has been committed in public space (only every ninth one last year). Street crimes have increased in particular -- 36 percent more of them have been committed than in 1993. The Ministry of the Interior forecasts that in view of the large quantities of illegal firearms and the relatively easy acquisition of explosives, the ratio of dangerous crimes per person shall increase as the consumption of alcohol and narcotics increases. Considering the minimal level of wages paid to the employees of state institutions, a conclusion is made that corruption and abuse of the official positions will not decrease. It is believed that because the frontiers are poorly controlled, the smuggling of narcotics and weapons should increase. Thefts of automobiles are not likely to diminish, since this is a very profitable variety of criminal enterprise. The Ministry of the Interior considers as its most important task the struggle against organized crime, the creation of a system for the prevention of crime and the violations of law, as well as the strengthening of the material base and the prestige of the police.
