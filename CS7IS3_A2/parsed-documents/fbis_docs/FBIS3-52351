According to the chairman of the panel, Mr. N. Pant, the error occurred when the control command exceeded the maximum limiting value. The panel, however, confirmed that all the major systems, including the giant solid booster and the liquid propulsion systems of the PSLV worked as planned. There is no lacuna in the rocket design also. The finding of the panel was released by the Indian Space Research Organization in Bangalore today.
