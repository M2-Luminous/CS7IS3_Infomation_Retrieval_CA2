C. Tsai] [Text] Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui's current trip to Southeast Asia has won recognition from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Li, who started the unofficial visit on Feb. 9, is scheduled to return to Taipei late Wednesday. He has met with Philippine President Fidel Ramos, Indonesian President Suharto, and Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Likphai during the three-country tour. H.I. Lu, chief of the DPP caucus at the Legislative Yuan, said Wednesday that the president's tour certainly has had a positive impact on both Taiwan's international relations and economic policy toward Southeast Asian nations. The government has been promoting its "southern strategy" to encourage Taiwan manufacturers to increase investments in Vietnam and member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which groups Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Brunei. "The DPP is positive toward Li's efforts in strengthening Taiwan's external relations and in helping Taiwan investors find more investment channels," Lu noted. The DPP lawmaker, however, pointed out that the president alone should not dominate Taiwan's foreign affairs. Foreign relations should be the common responsibility of both ruling and opposition parties, he said.
