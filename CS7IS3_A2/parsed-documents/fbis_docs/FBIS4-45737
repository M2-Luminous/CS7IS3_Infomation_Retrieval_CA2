However, measures curbing pollution in the city are still inadequate, in view of the growth of pollution. Though industrial pollution is initially under the control, environmental pollution is still rather serious. For instance, organic contamination in the water of the Guangzhou part of the Pearl River is getting worse. Disposal of urban refuse is still a headache. Harmful industrial rubbish has not yet all been collected together to be disposed of. Growth of the number of motor vehicles is too fast, and their exhaust gas resulting in polluting the air. Noise pollution along the sides of main traffic lines remains high. Environmental administration over the tertiary industry is lagged behind its development. Urban residents are seriously suffering from waste water, waste gas and noise caused by the food industry there. Some enterprises are still shifting their responsibility of curbing their own pollution to society, aiming at making profit at the expense of people there. According to an official from the Guangzhou Municipal Environmental Protection Committee, Guangzhou would be built into a metropolis of international standard in five years time, and 1994 is a crucial year for the realization of the goal. Protection of environment must keep up with the development of economy. The plan for the protection of environment must be worked out in conformity with the total urban construction plan and the plan of municipal economic development. Departments of Urban construction, municipal administration, environmental protection and public utilities must take effective measures to speed up construction of projects for disposal of waste water and urban refuse, strengthen administration over and harness motor vehicles' exhaust gas, strengthen supervision over environment of food industry and control motor vehicles' noise pollution so as to improve environment for people's living. At the same time, Guangzhou municipality will further improve its laws and regulations on environment, endeavor to make publicity of the importance of environmental protection so as to enhance people's understanding of environmental protection.
