The representatives of the Chinese and British Governments held 17 rounds of the talks on the election arrangements between April and November last year. Prior to the talks, the spokesman said, the two sides reached an understanding that the content of the talks would not be revealed. But the British side has unilaterally made public the content of the talks, distorting and attacking the position of the Chinese side in an attempt to shirk the responsibility of sabotaging the talks. The Chinese side was thus compelled to make public the facts, the spokesman said. The long statement of the spokesman consists of seven parts: -- The British side stubbornly stuck to its political reform bill that violates the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law of the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong and the relevant understanding and agreements reached between the two countries; -- The British side attempts to interfere in China's sovereign affairs; -- Agreements and understanding reached between the two sides on the issue of electorial committee must be abided by; -- The original meaning of the elections for the functional organizations must be persisted in; -- The issue of "through train" can only be solved in the frame of the decision of the Chinese National People's Congress and relevant stipulations of the basic law; -- The Chinese side has made tremendous efforts for reaching an agreement on the elections for municipal council and district boards; and -- The British side deliberately sabotaged the talks. The statement also includes a conclusion part. The essence of the Sino-British dispute over the political system in Hong Kong is not a question of whether to develop democracy in Hong Kong. Instead, it is one of whether to act in good faith in relations between nations and whether to converge with the Basic Law so as to realize a smooth transition in Hong Kong, he said. The dispute arose from Britain's change of policy on the Hong Kong issue. Facts will show that such a change runs counter to Britain's own interests and will bring about damage to Hong Kong, he said. The Sino-British talks have broken up because of the sabotage of the British side. The Chinese side deems it necessary to solemnly reaffirm that in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Britain's administration of Hong Kong will come to an end by June 30, 1997, and the Chinese Government will resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, he said. With the expiry of Britain's administration of Hong Kong, its last district boards, the municipal council and the Legislative Council, as part of the framework of the political system thereby Britain administers Hong Kong, will definitely come to an end, he added. Beginning on July 1, 1997, the political framework of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be formed according to the decision of China's National People's Congress and relevant stipulations of the Basic Law, he said. In conclusion, the spokesman stressed that Hong Kong will return to the motherland's embrace in due time, and no one can stop this process. The Chinese Government and people have full confidence and ability to resume the exercise of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong on time, implement the principle of "one country, two systems", carry out the Basic Law and maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong, he said.
