"Down with communism," "Thieves," "Government go on the dole," they shouted. A "Solidarity" delegation presented Michal Strak, head of the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], with a petition in which they demanded, among other things, that the budget bill be amended and the packet of bills related to the "Pact on State Enterprise" be passed by 15 March. If this deadline is not met, "Solidarity" Chairman Marian Krzaklewski does not rule out the possibility of a strike. For a while Strak left the premises of URM, but he was heckled and quickly went back inside the building. "There are 40,000 of us here," announced Krzaklewski as he started the demonstration at Pilsudski Square. As he was in front of the URM building, he estimated that approximately 100,000 people were taking part in the demonstration. It was indeed an enormous demonstration, but the former figure seems to be closer to the truth. The crowd of protesters stretched from the URM building to Krakowskie Przedmiescie Street (approximately 5 km away). "Those who are in power right now have declared: It does not have to be this way any longer. It does not have to--because it is worse," said Krzysztof Mlodzik, chairman of the Secretariat of Mining and Energy. He warned the authorities that "if they want a conflict with `Solidarity,' they will have one." "We do not want to support the perfidious practices that have been deceitfully called privatization," said Tomasz Wojcik, chairman of the Lower Silesia Region; he demanded "giving property to citizens en mass." At the head of the demonstration, Ursus unionists were competing with the supporters of the National Committee. When the former were shouting "Down with judecja [probably reference to the Democratic Union allegedly being dominated by Jews]" and "Down with Walesa," while National Committee supporters were chanting "Solidarity." "We do not want to die of hunger in line with the election promises," "Sejmocracy should be submitted for file-checking," "Instead of paying too much for electricity, let us chase the communists away from here," "Take your hands out of our pockets," "Nation is working, government is wasting," "Kuron gave soup, Miller showed his behind," "Communists are promising things, nation is suffering hunger," "SdRP-PSL [Social Democracy of the Polish Republic-Polish Peasant Party]: You have given us the games and circus. Now is the time for bread," were only some of the slogans heard during the demonstration. The most popular slogans were "Down with communism," "Communists--affair mongers," "Communists go to Cuba." "Where is your honor, where is the fatherland," people shouted in front of the URM, where there is the inscription "Honor, Fatherland." Lodz Region representatives were carrying an effigy representing Waldemar Pawlak (with horns) and Lech Walesa (wearing a ribbon with the word "Traitor" written on it). The effigy of Pawlak was burned in front of URM. The union members shouted: "Down with Miller, the affair monger" (Leszek Miller is a deputy from Lodz), "Lodz wants jobs, not the dole." The unionists threw a 1.5-meter red casket over the barriers surrounding URM. They carried, among other things, a black plaque with a white inscription: "The government, rest in peace." A railway orchestra was playing; one could hear whistles, trumpets; many participants of the demonstration were wearing union caps and shirts. In a speech in front of URM, Marian Krzaklewski said that the reason for the demonstration was, among other things, the fact that in another year characterized by economic growth, incomes are on the wane. "Solidarity" supports a "market-solidarity" state, and not a state of "capital oligarchy." If the latter is formed, "Solidarity" will overthrow it. Krzaklewski suggested that the work week be reduced by two hours, which he believes would allow us to decrease unemployment by approximately 300,000. The group of demonstrators from Ursus was not able to continue the demonstration from URM to the Belvedere, where they say "the greatest evil " lies. The determining factor here was the behavior of protesters from Gdansk Region.
