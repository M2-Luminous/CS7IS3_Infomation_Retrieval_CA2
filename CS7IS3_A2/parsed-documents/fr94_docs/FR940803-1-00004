FR940803-1-00004 FR940803-1-00002 7 CFR Part 1205 [CN&hyph;94&hyph;001] RIN 0581&hyph;AB14 Proposed Amendment to Regulations for Collecting Cotton Research and Promotion Assessment AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Agricultural Marketing Service is amending the Cotton Board Rules and Regulations by raising the value assigned to imported cotton for the purpose of calculating supplemental assessments collected for use by the Cotton Research and Promotion Program. The amended value reflects the 12-month average price received by U.S. farmers for Upland cotton for calendar year 1993. DATES: Written comments concerning the proposed rule must be sent in triplicate and received no later than September 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Craig Shackelford, USDA, AMS, Cotton Division; PO Box 96456; Room 2641&hyph;S; Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456. All comments will be made available for public inspection at that address between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Craig Shackelford, (202) 720&hyph;2259. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under Section 12 of the Act, any person subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the District Court of the United States in any district in which the person is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling, provided a complaint is filed within 20 days from the date of the entry of the ruling. The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). There are an estimated 10,000 importers who are presently subject to rules and regulations issued pursuant to the Cotton Research and Promotion Order. This proposed rule will affect importers of cotton and cotton-containing products. The majority of these importers are small businesses under the criteria established by the Small Business Administration. This proposed rule would raise the assessments paid by the importers under the Cotton Research and Promotion Order. Even though the assessment would be raised, the increase is small and would not significantly affect small businesses. The AMS Administrator therefore has certified that this rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR Part 1320) which implement the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .) the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule have been previously approved by OMB and were assigned control number 0581&hyph;0093. The Cotton Research and Promotion Act Amendments of 1990 enacted by Congress under Subtitle G of Title XIX of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 on November 28, 1990, contained two provisions that authorized changes in the funding procedures for the Cotton Research and Promotion Program.
