Musa's meeting with top Foreign Ministry officials ended a short while ago, and Shlomo Raz reports: [Raz] I would even take a greater risk than Foreign Minister Peres and state that, in fact, the problems between Israel and the PLO are very near solution. Some work on preparing drafts and formulations will be required, and Foreign Ministry legal adviser Yo'el Singer and the PLO's Abu-al-Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] have begun working on this. At the same time, in Peres upcoming meeting with Yasir 'Arafat next weekend, they will be able to finalize the issues of the procedures at the border crossings and the extent of the withdrawal from Jericho. That means that the first stage of the negotiations on Gaza and Jericho will be completed and, except for a few civilian issues, the implementation of the agreement can begin. Shim'on Peres, Yosi Beilin, Uri Savir, and others met with Musa. After the meeting, which ended a few minutes ago, Peres was asked whether the agreement is really close: [Begin Peres recording] I hope so. I believe we have a good opportunity to do this, but it has not happened yet. I would rather be careful and not describe things that have not yet happened as facts. At the same time, a basis was created which, perhaps, allows for the attainment of such an agreement. I believe 'Amr Musa gave us a picture of the way things are viewed on the Egyptian side, which is not much different from the Israeli view. [end recording] [Raz] When Peres says that things look alike on both the Israeli and the Egyptian sides, he is referring to the fact that Egyptian President Husni Mubarak met with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat yesterday. Hence, we can deduce what Musa is basing his optimism on, beyond what he is willing to share with us here. Earlier today, Musa met with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. After that meeting, Musa said he brought a message from President Mubarak to Rabin. This discussion covered the whole range of negotiations with the Arabs but focused mainly on the Israel-PLO talks or, to be more specific, on the issue of the talks on Gaza and Jericho First, which will resume next week in Davos, Switzerland; the Taba talks, which are taking place at this time; the economic talks, which are to resume in Paris; and, naturally, the Washington talks. Musa spoke about the current set of talks: [Begin Musa recording, in English] There are a set of talks. I hope, I even trust, that they will push forward the Israeli-Palestinian process. I must say that I am not pessimistic. [end recording] [Raz] Musa says he is not pessimistic regarding this set of talks; however, speaking in closed forums, he said that he is very optimistic. The Egyptian foreign minister is currently having lunch, after which he will depart for Cairo after holding what has become routine meetings between Israeli and Egyptian officials, which stem from the willingness of all the parties to demonstrate that Egypt is playing a special role in the regional processes. [Segal] Could we perhaps add today's remarks to what Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said yesterday about Israel's security stands beginning to yield fruit? Does this mean that they will be accepted? [Raz] I believe we can say that. In general, the solution of the problem of the bridges and border crossings will be such that the control will, in fact, remain in Israel's hands, but a technical solution is being sought so that Israel's presence at the bridges will not be visible. [Segal] Electronic means will be used. [Raz] Electronic and other, perhaps less sophisticated, means that are not visible to the naked eye will be used. A senior Israeli political source called it the invisible man's technique: It sees but is not seen. The parties, therefore, met each other half way. Israel gave in on maintaining a physical presence but not on actual control. The differences over the Jericho issue have not been bridged yet, but it would seem that the Palestinians are inclined to understand that Israel will not give them corridors to al-Nabi Musa or the Muratas baptism site. They will be allowed to construct a resort on Palestinian-owned lands on the northern shores of the Dead Sea.
