FBIS4-36192 "drnes109_l_94012" FBIS-NES-94-109 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Air Force Raid Seen as Signal to Syria, Hizballah Air Force Raid Seen as Signal to Syria, Hizballah TA0306113394 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 3 Jun 94 p A1 TA0306113394 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Commentary by Ze'ev Schiff: "A Signal to Damascus"] [Text] The fierce Israeli Air Force attack against a Hizballah training facility in the Syrian-controlled area of the northern part of the al-Biqa' should be construed, among other things, as an Israeli signal to Damascus to the effect that Israel does not regard the talks between them as reason for preventing an operation against the extremist Shiite organization. The Syrian angle was debated in Israel prior to the operation. In consultations held prior to the operation the political process with Syria was raised. The freeze in the talks between the two countries undoubtedly had an indirect effect on the decision adopted. Seeing that there is no danger of a military operation against Hizballah foiling such talks, the military consideration finally prevailed. Hizballah in any case is continuing its attacks against the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and SLA [South Lebanese Army] in south Lebanon without any consideration for the peace talks. In its operation Israel has signalled to Syria and Hizballah that its security considerations alone determine its mode of operation. Those who made the decision to attack were aware of the possibility that Hizballah would retaliate with Katyusha attacks against our northern settlements -- as was actually the case yesterday. Israel believes, however, that the attack did not violate the understandings reached with U.S. mediation following Operation Accountability. According to this understanding Israeli settlements and Lebanese villages should not be attacked unless fire is directed from within them. Hizballah, however, is continuing its war against Israel in south Lebanon and has hit many IDF and SLA soldiers. The Israeli operation was in turn directed against a military training base for Hizballah fighters, most of whom are sent to carry out attacks in south Lebanon. From the military point of view yesterday's attack can be considered to be one of the severest blows ever suffered by Hizballah. Many previous Air Force attacks ended with only few Hizballah casualties, whereas this time the organization suffered dozens of dead and wounded. The numbers involved constitute a considerable percentage of Hizballah's total fighting cadre, and are higher than the total casualty toll Hizballah suffered in Operation Accountability. The operation was carried out after 0200, under complete darkness, which indicates the kind of ability Israel's Air Force has developed for night operations. Lebanese sources say that the first wave was carried out by jet fighters, which were later joined by a second wave of helicopter gunships. It is clear that without early intelligence regarding the details of Hizballah's training base it would have been hard to locate the targets there. According to one assessment, Mustafa al-Dirani's abduction and interrogation in Israel improved Israel's familiarity with Hizballah and its military infrastructure.
