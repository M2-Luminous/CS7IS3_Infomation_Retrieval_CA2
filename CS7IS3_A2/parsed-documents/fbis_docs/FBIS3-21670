Interior Minister Dr. Muhammad Harbah deputized for the prime minister. The session opening was attended by a number of ministers; (Bernard Farahi), representative of the UN drug-control program; and (Kendall), secretary general of Interpol. The opening was also attended by assistant ministers, heads of desks and departments at the Interior Ministry, representatives of the popular organizations and trade unions, a number of Arab and foreign ambassadors in Damascus, and the heads and members of the delegations participating in the session. Dr. Harbah delivered a speech in which he welcomed the participants in this session, noting the importance of its convening in Damascus. He added that this shows Syria's interest in the issue of narcotics. The interior minister referred to the drug combating law issued last year. He said this law has two characteristics: First: The law views drug addicts as individuals who must be treated. He added that the country has established specialized sanatoriums for the treatment of addicts and has avoided legal pursuit of addicts if they approached a sanatorium for treatment. He added that an establishment has been set up to care for and rehabilitate addicts who had received treatment in sanatoriums so that they can adapt to the society and prevent their deviation. Second: The law calls for applying tough measures, including the death penalty, against all those who commit crimes of trafficking, cultivating, or manufacturing drugs. The interior minister added that in 1987 Syria formed a national committee for narcotics and psychotropic drugs. This committee is charged with laying down general policies and coordinating cooperation between the various drug combating quarters in the country and their Arab and international counterparts. He added that an independent directorate for drugs was established in Syria with the aim of activating and reinforcing preventive, combat, and treatment measures. Minister Harbah added that Syria has participated in laying down and endorsing the Arab strategy for combating the illegal use of narcotics and psychotropic drugs, the phased steps stemming from this strategy, and in adopting an ideal unified Arab draft law on narcotics. Dr. Harbah said: Syria concluded bilateral cooperation agreements in the drug combating field with Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, and Oman. It also signed the Arab agreement for drug combating adopted by the Arab Interior Ministers Council at the beginning of this year. It has been cooperating with the Arab Center for Security Studies and Training in holding narcotics seminars. On the international level, Harbah stressed that Syria is a party to the international agreements on narcotics and a member of the subcommittee on illegal drug trafficking in the Near and Middle East. He added that Syria signed bilateral agreements with Turkey, Cyprus, and Iran for cooperation in combating drugs. He said that it also participates in regional seminars and meetings on combating drugs. The minister reiterated the importance of this seminar and presented many basic working points. Noting the importance of self immunity, he said: We, in Syria, work hard to implant in our youths religious, social, and cultural deterrents which are an important factor and impregnable shield which protect people from falling victim to narcotics. We also work toward tackling ignorance, family divisions, and illiteracy. The interior minister underscored the role of educational institutions as well as cultural, social, and sport clubs in looking after youths and protecting them. He also highlighted the role of popular organizations and trade unions which contributed to enlightening people. Consequently, he added, the narcotics problem remained very limited and was not a cause for concern. The interior minister added: In order to continue the war on drugs, illegal cultivation of narcotic plants should be stopped, drug combating personnel should receive continuous training to enhance their performance, and the extradition of drug criminals must be included in agreements signed between countries.
