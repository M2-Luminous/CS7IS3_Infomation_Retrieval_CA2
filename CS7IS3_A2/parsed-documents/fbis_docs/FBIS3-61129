The constituent conference of the Liberal Convention of Moldova, a social and political organization uniting in its ranks representatives of the intelligentsia, youth, business circles, and the industrial complex, was held on 11 November. The conference adopted the bylaws and formulated the program goals of this new movement. The Liberal Convention advocates the consolidation of all reform forces of society and the creation of real conditions for the extrication of Moldova from the socioeconomic crisis and the surmounting of the contradictions of the transitional period leading to a free economy and an open, democratic society. Not participating in the elections directly, the Convention will support political parties operating from liberal and progressive positions. Below we reproduce the text of the Declaration of the Liberal Convention of Moldova. The collapse of the totalitarian system in Europe and the disintegration of the last empire have created conditions conducive to the people of Moldova's return to a civilized and democratic path of development. We, the citizens of this country, are now faced with a vitally important task, the essence of which is the formulation and practical implementation of an efficient and viable model for the further evolution of society. The experience of the dramatic existence under the conditions of self-assertion as a sovereign and independent state accumulated by the Republic of Moldova permits the conclusion that society's aspiration to self-organization has two paths--that of evolution based on the dynamism of social and political processes or the path of degradation, that is, conversion into a primitive system of the administrative-distributive type, in other words, totalitarian. Parties formed in the majority of cases per the industrial principle or in corporate interests are predominant in the country's political life. The absence of a real confrontation of ideas and the confusion in ideologies are entailing confusion also in political actions and the conceptual approaches to a surmounting of the crisis and internal contradictions of the transitional period. One more or less clear direction--the so-called "social market economy," which frequently directly echoes the trend toward a return to the administrative-command system--is being manifested in Moldova's sociopolitical reality. The main shortcoming of this direction is the attempt to preserve the absolute role of the state and the public sector in people's economic and social activity, enabling the oligarchy nomenklatura, incompetent and bankrupt under the new complex conditions, as a rule, to retain power. The elaboration and creation in Moldova of a socioeconomic and political system capable of stimulating the efficiency and dynamism of the country's new evolutionary development may be realized on the basis of the creative application of the basic principles that ensure the efficiency and dynamic balance of democratic, industrially developed countries. In this context, the ideas of liberalism could bring our society, deformed for so many years by the totalitarian regime, closer to the political, economic, and social culture of civilized countries. Being a copy of modern Western civilization, liberalism represents the core and essence of liberal democratic reforms. On the threshold of the election of a new supreme legislative body of the country, a need for the consolidation of all forces advocating liberal democratic reforms in the united Liberal Convention of Moldova has arisen at the present time. The purpose of the Convention is effective support for political forces capable of embodying in practice real liberal doctrine and stimulating social development, creatively and consciously employing to this end the principles of liberalism as a philosophy of social being, spiritual condition, and sociopolitical practice. The Liberal Convention of Moldova will operate in the name of realization of the following goals: In the Political Sphere: The consolidation of the state independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova--the objective conditions and constitutional framework necessary for securing the economic progress of the Moldovan people and the liberalization of political life and the economic activity of the country's citizens.
