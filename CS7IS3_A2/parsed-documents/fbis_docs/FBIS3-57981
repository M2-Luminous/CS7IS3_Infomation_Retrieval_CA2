Muslims and Croats definitively agreed only on another meeting. The presidents of Croatia and Bosnia, Tudjman and Izetbegovic, will meet in Bonn on Saturday [8 January] to agree on further details for a cease-fire in central Bosnia. Currently, the Muslims are engaged in a successful offensive against the Croats there. However, cease-fires are not a way out of the crisis, European Union negotiator Lord Owen says: [Begin Owen recording, in English with superimposed German translation] We have never argued for cease-fires. We have always said that there must be a political solution, and I have not changed my opinion about that. Only after a political agreement has been achieved can there be a ceasefire. [end recording] However, the political agreement is not yet there. The Croats still do not want to discuss access to the Adriatic Sea for the Muslims in the Croatian town of Neum. Only the Croatian town of Ploce is being discussed as the location of a Muslim free port. There is no agreement on future borders, either. Only meetings between various Muslim and Croatian committees have been agreed, which are supposed to discuss details of an exchange of prisoners and of humanitarian aid.
