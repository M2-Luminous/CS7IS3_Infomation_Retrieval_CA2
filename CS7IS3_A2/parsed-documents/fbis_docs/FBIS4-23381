[passage omitted] Djama Elabe, the chairman of the Party for Democratic Renewal, is outraged at what happened. He has condemned the intervention of the police. Listen to him: [Begin Djama Elabe recording] Under the pretext of dislodging people from anarchic [as heard] buildings, the government today used what I would call provocation. They used tanks; they used an entire army. They dislodged these people. As you know, most of these people are people who have been displaced because of war. They came from Obock. They live near this district. Instead of solving the problems and helping people to settle in a home again and restoring peace, tanks and the army are sent to dislodge people and we strongly condemn what happened today. Many people were wounded. We have even been told that people had died. We condemn the attitude of the government which is currently losing control. Over the last few days, we have witnessed attitudes....[pauses] It really seems that the government is experiencing physical fear because everything is getting out of hand. They have destroyed the country politically, economically, socially, and it now seems that they are destroying men and women as well. It is in order to hide their political failure, in order to restore hatred between people, and to divide our people. [end recording] That was Djama Elabe. It must also be pointed out that the chairman of the United Djibouti Opposition Front, Mohamed Ahmed Issa, also known as Cheiko, was arrested at his home this evening.
