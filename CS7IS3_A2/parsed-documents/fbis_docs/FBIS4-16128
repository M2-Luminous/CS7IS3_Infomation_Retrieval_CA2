The aim of the meeting was to promote the concluding of a contract between the Latvian Government and Amoco, granting the latter drilling rights on Baltic sea territory belonging to Latvia, where, according to geologists, oil can be found. Provided the contract is signed, Latvia will be entitled to a part of Amoco's profits from selling the extracted oil. In addition, the company will train Latvian geologists over a period of five years. As DIENA was told by Aristids Lambergs, member of the Economy Commission, there will be no expense for Latvia; it is only a question of agreeing upon profits. If an agreement is not signed, the company will drill on Swedish territory, which would mean no profits for Latvia at all. According to geologists, the oil deposit is like an underground barrel straddling the Latvian and Swedish border, and it can be reached by drilling on either side of the border. Amoco has already signed a contract with Sweden. The signing of a contract with Latvia is being impeded by the fact that until now the sea border between Latvia and Lithuania has not been delineated. There are oil deposits situated where the two borders meet, and Lithuania may be able to make claims as well, depending on what the two governments decide. Actually, Latvia has found the demands of Lithuania unacceptable, but a compromise can be expected in a short time, nonetheless. Due to the preliminary agreement signed by the Latvian Government and Amoco in 1993, the term for granting the license is 2 July of this year. The Latvian Government established a commission today which is to resolve problems connected with the above mentioned contract. According to the company's proposal, the license must be confirmed by parliament. A. Lambergs emphasized that the Commission for Economy regards this project as useful and important for Latvia. Amoco is a U.S. company which extracts oil around the globe, and is the sixth largest company of its kind in the world.
