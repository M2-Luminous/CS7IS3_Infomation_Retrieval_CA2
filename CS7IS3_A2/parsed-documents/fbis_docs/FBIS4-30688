SCC is studying the advisability of joint ownership of satellite facilities as well as contracting with Orion for the sale of circuits in the Asian market. The launching of a single satellite costs over 30 billion yen and SCC's intent in this case appears to be an effort to reduce costs and risks through a joint venture with a U.S. firm and to boost its global sales capabilities. SCC plans to launch its third satellite in December 1997. A proposal has been presented for the joint ownership of transponders to be loaded on the third satellite and Orion has already proposed a specific number of transponders to be loaded on the satellite. President Taniguchi indicates, "We would like to make our decision by yearend on whether we will proceed with the joint venture." Currently, Japanese telecommunication satellite operators are restricted to domestic services only, but approval to provide international services is expected to be issued in the fall. SCC will enter the international market with the launching of the third satellite, but past satellite accidents have caused financial difficulties for the firm, leading it to consider the joint venture route with a U.S. firm. Rival Japan Satellite Systems (JSAT) plans to enter the international market with the launching of its third satellite in August 1995.
