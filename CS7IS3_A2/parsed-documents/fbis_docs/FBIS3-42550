M. Kuzhevskiy, V. M. Petrov, I. P. Shestopalov; UDC 581.521] [Abstract] Sources of radiation in interplanetary space are essentially three: galactic cosmic rays, solar-flare cosmic rays, and recurrent fluxes of low-energy particles from the Sun. The most dangerous of the three are solar-flare cosmic rays, on which there exists the smallest volume of data. Forecast methods associated with a search for flare precursors in the optical, radio, and x-ray ranges are unreliable in predicting solar proton events. The work reported here is a continuation of earlier work by Shestopalov et al. in which the researchers demonstrated that proton flares arise in the course of processes that encompass not only various layers of the solar surface, but also interplanetary space. Moving a step farther, the researchers here show that the preflare period involves not only changes on the Sun and in interplanetary space, but also a disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere and magnetic field and a generation of particles in near-Earth space. Active regions are observed on the Sun during the period, as are coronal formations and their ejection into interplanetary space. Large proton- and electron-filled ordered magnetic structures appear in interplanetary space, and the flux of galactic cosmic rays diminishes. On Earth, magnetic activity increases, causing in turn an increase in the amplitudes of magnetic storms in those areas. In addition, magnetospheric protons with energies of 40 MeV or greater are recorded in interplanetary space. Figures 5, references 15: 13 Russian, 2 Western.
