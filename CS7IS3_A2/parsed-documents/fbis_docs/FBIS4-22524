FBIS4-22524 "jpusr038___94053" FBIS-USR-94-038 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 15 April 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS Air Traffic Control Chairman Interviewed Air Traffic Control Chairman Interviewed 944E0663A Moscow VOZDUSHNYY TRANSPORT in Russian No 5, Feb 94 pp 8-9 944E0663A Moscow VOZDUSHNYY TRANSPORT Russian CSO [Interview with Valeriy Shelkovnikov, chairman of "Rosaeronavigatsiya" [Russian State Commission for Airspace Use and Air Traffic Control], by V. Karpiy: "We Are Prepared for an Open Dialogue"] [Text] I am certain it is not necessary to introduce V. Shelkovnikov, the chairman of the Commission for Air Traffic Control [ATC], to most of our readers, because his name has appeared very often in the pages of VOZDUSHNYY TRANSPORT throughout the newspaper's history. Some will remember him as the chief of the TsUVD [Air Traffic Control Central Administration], as the chief of the GlavUVD MGA [ATC chief of the Ministry of Civil Aviation], or as the president of the International Aviation Safety Fund. Friends will recall that, aside from the 27 years he has worked in the ATC Service, there were years spent in polar aviation, in the Nothern Civil Aviation Administration, and in supervising the group testing the first automated system--"Start." Generally speaking, he has served in all the positions, right up to chief of a zone center, and then the Main Center... And now he is in air traffic control once again. And this is how we began our interview. [Karpiy] Valeriy Georgiyevich, 4 years ago you left the civil aviation ATC Service which you headed for more than 6 years, and then suddenly 6 months ago you returned. What compelled you to make such an important decision in both cases? [Shelkovnikov] There were several reasons why I left the position as head of such a large service as ATC, but I will tell you about the principal one. In 1989, when it had already become completely clear that the coming years would bring very big changes to the country's civil aviation, I realized that I had no right to take part in this process without knowledge of the principles and standards of the world aviation community, from which we had been very carefully sealed off for a long time. Especially taking thousands of people with me... Then the idea developed of forming an independent public organization--the Aviation Safety Fund of the USSR, which has now become international. I was named its president, and in my 5 years of work there I went through an excellent "academy" of civil aviation, where I learned a great deal. For that reason, I began looking at a number of things which one would think were obvious through entirely different eyes. But I returned to the ATC Service in June 1993. Frankly speaking, this return was also very unexpected for me. The fact is that when I worked in the FAB [Aviation Safety Fund] I had occasion to work with controllers and meet with the heads of services as before. It is still a mystery to me why they decided to ask the prime minister to appoint me as president [sic] of "Gosaeronavigatsiya." [Karpiy] How did you feel when you learned of this request? [Shelkovnikov] If I had known where I was going, I would have been a little more conceited person, and I probably would have considered this very flattering. But...it is clear that each of us has to bear his own cross. [Karpiy] You said that you knew where you were going. Six months had passed since then. Didn't you have to modify your views on the state of affairs in the ATC Service and the processes which were and are under way in it? [Shelkovnikov] Practically none. Extremely complex processes, which are painful at times, are under way in our service and in civil aviation as a whole. I realize that they are unavoidable. Previously, all aviation operations were under the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Today, in line with the government's concept of air transport development, which I consider correct, airports are detached, airlines are being formed, and the ATC Service is defining its place in this process. But because it was built up and developed as a unified organism for decades, it is not so simple to divide it into parts, and painlessly as well. [Karpiy] And the ATC Service, I think, is affected more than others. The things that it is being blamed for, including the charge that it is almost paralyzing air traffic... [Shelkovnikov] The wage rates and fees? All the expenditures on air traffic control will make up 6.8 percent of civil aviation's overall expenditures in 1994. Is this a big or a small amount? But who has tried to understand whether this is a great organization, whether it has been maintained and is being modernized in good time? I do not think many will answer with knowledge of the matter. [Karpiy] But tell us... [Shelkovnikov] Today, the coordination and planning of airspace use and air traffic control in the Russian Federation is being handled by centers of the Unified ATC System and ATC departmental organs. So Russia's YeS UVD [Unified ATC System] has 142 centers; one of them is the main center, eight are zonal centers, 70 are regional centers, and 63 are auxiliary air route centers. We are responsible for flight safety on every one of the 239,903 kilometers of airways in Russia. As of 1 June last year, more than 2,500 pieces of basic electronic equipment, more than 17,000 units of communications equipment, and so forth were being operated in our services. Impressive?! And all this should function without interruption, smoothly, and absolutely reliably, for if something happens, a crew in flight will be deaf and blind. But after all, our service has very expensive equipment which requires heightened attention by many thousands of persons with the highest qualifications. Multiply what I have told you by the confusion in the economy, the inflation, the nonpayments, the severe price increases for every part, assembly, and unit, for what we need to keep mobilized, trained, disciplined, and highly intelligent people in the service when there is almost an "individual hunt" for each one of them by commercial structures and while you are faced with something which very remotely resembles a budget which would keep the service "afloat." And besides all this, there are the lives of millions of persons for whom the controllers bear responsibility. So you be the judge--whether 6.8 percent is a large or a small amount. And I have only raised the edge of the curtain we work behind. Add here the support for especially important flights, use of the airspace by the VVS [Air Forces], Naval Aviation, specialized aviation, general aviation, and departmental airplanes and helicopters. [Karpiy] The ruble and the dollar are considered to be of primary importance today. You mentioned the "hunt" for aviation specialists by commercial structures, where the earnings are higher and the work is a little easier. Have you received offers from the commercial interests as well? [Shelkovnikov] Yes, they have made offers. But inasmuch as I am here, I do not think it necessary to explain what I chose. Moreover, after returning, I was both glad and proud of my comrades--a great many first-class specialists and managers of services had remained on the job and did not change their work, which they had chosen as a career. Although they have had to stand the siege and are still besieged from various sides, including from their own families at times. And this is under conditions in which it is becoming harder and harder to work. [Karpiy] Why? Didn't you list all the factors--inflation, nonpayments? [Shelkovnikov] No, not all of them. The main problem is the equipment we are using, which has been worn out by a factor of 42 percent on average. And this means that it is deteriorating more and more each day and requires more and more attention and expenditures of labor and finances. Unless this process is brought under control, 82 percent of the equipment will be worn out in 5 years. We cannot permit this--after all, we bear the responsibility not only for our fellow countrymen and our airways--foreign airlines are also flying here. And since they bear responsibility for our fellow citizens when they fly in foreign airspace, we are just as responsible, under international laws, to ensure safe passage by foreign aircraft over our territory. But how do we do this when there is equipment somewhere in the North which was sent by the Americans under Lend-Lease during World War II? If all the automated airway ATC systems date from the periods of their development--1971 to 1980? I could continue this list for an extended period, but it is clear that this problem cannot be solved without major capital investments. And without this, the principal task cannot be performed--the reason why the ATC Service was formed--provision for flight safety. Unfortunately, this is the opinion that exists in the country: "These are your problems, so you resolve them." This an extremely incorrect approach. During my work in the FAB I had occasion to study this matter thoroughly in various other states, and only where the society--the people--consider it to be their direct responsibility to provide for flight safety is it equal to the occasion. After all, it is not for nothing that one of the first truths in the "ICAO [International Civil Aviation Organization] Aviation Accident Prevention Manual" states: "If in your opinion the cost of safety is too high, it means you know what an aviation accident is." The world aviation community and all civilized peoples are contributing immeasurably more to flight safety than we are. Sooner or later there will be a critical change in the public consciousness here, but we must not pay for this change in blood. But we are paying, you know--the latest tragedy in Irkutsk is an example of that. [Karpiy] But you are aware of the country's budget situation, and how many holes there are in it. [Shelkovnikov] And that is the reason we are looking, looking, and looking to see where we can save the airlines' money. Straightening the routes. What is this? It is saving fuel and the service life of aircraft. Jointly with the Genshtab [General Staff], we are planning to save 5 billion rubles per year in this operation alone. This is an unlimited field for activity, and we have asked the airlines to send their suggestions. Altogether, 15 have responded. But after all, pilots all over the world are flying where it is not prohibited, unlike here, where we fly only where it is has been authorized. I am certain if we succeed in making the best possible use of airspace, we will eliminate the fuel crisis in aviation. One more example: at present only 5.8 percent of Russia's airspace, a very small amount, is open for international flights. The route from Europe to Asia is over Russia, and the more airways we open, the more profit we will receive from air navigation fees. Foreign airlines are waiting for these routes, they are prepared to pay us and prepared to invest money in the ground equipment for these airways--if only the length of time their aircraft spend in the air is reduced. But in carrying out this work we are running into dozens of obstacles and we have to prove the obvious truths to many departments. [Karpiy] But does the opposite happen? [Shelkovnikov] It happens, but not often. Valeriy Mikhaylovich Zubov, a doctor of economic sciences and head of administration for Krasnoyarsak Kray, asked us to "open" airspace equivalent in area to five Frances over the kray's territory. We fulfilled his request, and a government decree was issued on 10 November 1993 "opening" 28 sections of international airways over Krasnoyarsk. He stated in addition: "I realize that the controllers have no money..." and he is undertaking the organization...of a joint-stock company whose responsibility would be to equip the airways and train people. This person understands that if aviation is the only transportation for most of the people in the kray, who should be concerned about aviation if not the local authorities?! [Karpiy] Valeriy Georgiyevich, you cited quite a few problems whose importance is indisputable. All the same, aren't there sore points which require priority attention from you personally? [Shelkovnikov] The Moscow AUVD [Automated ATC] Center. Some 15 years have passed since it was put into operation. The roof has not been maintained here, the displays have begun breaking down... But after all, the Moscow Zone is one of the most saturated in the world. We are now concentrating our efforts here to rectify the situation. We have a big problem with the Rostov "Strela" system. This is in the south of Russia, the exit to the Black Sea. It has been 12 years since it was built and it has completely exhausted its service life. But how can we close this zone, where aviation is being rapidly developed now? Stavropol, Anapa, Sochi, Krasnodar, Rostov-on-Don, and Mineralnyye Vody have become international airports and "Strela" is the "step" to them. We are looking for the means to get out of this very difficult impasse. Kaliningrad. One of the independent states has undertaken the control of air traffic in space belonging to Russia without its consent here. This took place 2 years ago, and now the situation must be rectified and this area must be modernized. There is no end of work in the Far North and the Far Eastern region. [Karpiy] Where you had to limit traffic density, which resulted in a heated response everywhere? [Shelkovnikov] Yes. This followed a near miss by two Boeing 747's on opposite headings in the Khabarovsk Zone. One of them belonged to the Japanese All Nippon Airline, and the other to British Airways. They moved apart in direct proximity to each other. According to the scientists' conclusion, the risk of a collision was three times greater than what is acceptable. Tragedy was avoided only because collision avoidance equipment was available on both aircraft. The crew of the British Airways aircraft received the command "To the right and up," and the Japanese aircraft received the command "To the right and down." A stressful situation for the crews and passengers were injured... The causes? Our first impression was that a person, the controller, was at fault. When we investigated more thoroughly, we realized that we were not looking for the guilty person there. Organizational flaws--this is what nearly led to a disaster. The cutback in personnel and the absence of an operator put an excessive load on the controller. He did not receive the command from Tokyo and did not expect the two aircraft to be heading toward each other. There was no radar control or relay transmitter. Economizing on the means needed to provide for normal communications--these are the main "culprits." It is good that the commission included psychologists, who demonstrated that a person was physically not in a position to resolve the situation. Well, there were quite a few claims made against the Far Eastern Region management, of course. This time, they managed... [Karpiy] But what if they hadn't? You will forgive this cruel question. [Shelkovnikov] There would have been three national tragedies--in Russia, in Britain, and in Japan, since dozens of people would have perished. And if we add to this that the British Airways aircraft was insured for $1.2 billion and the Japanese aircraft was insured for $1 billion, who would have paid this money? Russia has no insurance for the risk of collision, while Singapore, New Zealand, and Great Britain have such insurance coverage even when an ATC system much more reliable than ours is available. [Karpiy] So we must be insured... [Shelkovnikov] We also need amounts much higher than in those countries I mentioned. The worse the system, the greater the risk of collision, and hence the higher the insurance rates. It is a vicious circle. [Karpiy] And you caught it from our press... [Shelkovnikov] At the scientists' recommendation, we chose the lesser of two evils before completing modernization of these sections, that is, before March: we have limited the density of air traffic. Incidentally, we are not the first to take such a step; this is a normal practice throughout the world. The lives of innocent persons cannot be risked under any conditions. Even if we have to incur financial losses. [Karpiy] As far as I know, you sent a commission to Khabarovsk which was almost equivalent in composition and powers to those that the government assigns for catastrophes. [Shelkovnikov] During my 3 years with the Aviation Safety Fund, I managed to size up the conceptual approaches to disaster prevention which exist in the world. They are very simple. The first truth is that the persons at the top must concern themselves with safety and not delegate this part of the work to anyone. No matter whether it is the president of a country, the head of an administration, the president of an airline, the commander of a crew... Because safety is a most sacred thing. The second truth. If there has been some violation in one field of human activity or another, we should thank God that a disaster did not occur. And the incident should be investigated as if there had been a catastrophe. There has been a dangerous convergence of aircraft... It can be "farmed out" to local aviation authorities. Will they investigate it objectively? Will they have enough resources, knowledge, and experience? I don't know. But if there had been a disaster, a government commission and hundreds of people would have been involved. So thank God there was no disaster, and do everything possible right here, with the fresh tracks, to find all the causes which nearly led to a disaster and exert every effort to ensure that there is no recurrence on a larger scale. And psychologists must be on the commission. Often only a specialist in the area of human psychology is in a position to determine why a controller, a pilot, or an engineer acted in one way or another. It is not difficult for an administrator. He quickly finds the guilty party and states: You have violated such and such a paragraph, such and such a point..." And that is all. But where is the guarantee that someone else, perhaps even more experienced, will not make the same mistake?! The aviation world has abandoned searches for a guilty party--there are numerous other services for this. The aviation world looks for the reasons for errors and ways of preventing them. And it is putting a large amount of funds into this work. Because there is nothing minor in aviation, and what is at first glance a most insignificant near miss may result in an avalanche of events leading to a catastrophe. Do you remember what went on here quite recently, just 10 or 12 years ago? [Karpiy] When even the term "flight safety" was not used and they spoke about "the quality of flights?" [Shelkovnikov] Absolutely correct. If there were a disaster, you know, they quickly looked for the guilty parties and issued an order on two or three pages, as a rule, even with a "secret" classification--and that was all! And here we have come to the third truth. Throughout the world, when there has been an accident and the cause has been found, a very powerful propaganda machine is put into action. We read in the ICAO document: a highly effective means of preventing aviation accidents (AP) is the publication of information bulletins on the cirucmstances and causes of accidents and incidents and a graphic illustration of the events. If a pilot has learned from the mistakes of others and the incidents in which they were involved, there would be less... Until we reach the point where I can purchase a book on a catastrophe at any kiosk (in the United States, for example) and carefully study at home everything related to it and what led to it, we will incur losses. Our specialists have nothing to study. There are no aviation newspapers or magazines for the general reader as well as the specialist. In America you can buy and inquire about the huge volumes published by the Bureau of Accident Investigation. And there you will find information about what took place, and why and where it took place, as well as recommendations on how to avoid a tragedy. And the airlines buy these materials, they study them, and they learn from others' mistakes. There is propaganda for you! But here? As far as I am aware, your only newspaper in the world's largest aviation power--VOZDUSHNYY TRANSPORT--is barely remaining "afloat." [Karpiy] If not worse... [Shelkovnikov] So what kind of preventive measures and propaganda on aviation accident prevention can we speak about if we have no means of influencing the minds, the feelings, and the conscience of a person who works in a very complex field such as civil aviation?! There are many questions. [Karpiy] Yes, you are right, there are many questions. I would like to learn your point of view in more detail on a critical problem such as air navigation fees; on participation in accident investigation by associations of controllers, pilots, and other public professional organizations; on your attitude with respect to controllers' strikes; with respect to the disintegration of the former union's unified airspace; and about the prestige of the controllers' profession. Moreover, I am certain that not only we journalists, but your allies and opponents, are prepared to take part in a discussion of these and other problems related to the activity of "Rosaeronavigatsiya." [Shelkovnikov] We are prepared for an open dialogue with everyone for whom aviation and everything associated with it has become their life's work. [Karpiy] Thank you for the interview.
