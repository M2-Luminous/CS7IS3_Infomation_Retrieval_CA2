Both sides should seize the opportunity created by the formal meeting between Chinese and U.S. head of governments to help maintain the sound momentum which has begun in relations, Premier Li Peng told a group of U.S. senators here this afternoon. "China's door is open to you. I hope that after this visit you will know more about China and further explore many possibilities for bilateral trade and economic cooperation," Li said during the meeting with a U.S. Senate delegation led by Bennett Johnston, chairman of the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Li said a year of joint efforts has led to active improvements in Sino-American relations, especially as the formal conference between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Seattle was of great importance for the development of bilateral relations. "To catch this opportunity to strengthen communications and cooperation in different fields and on different levels will not only be in the interests of our two countries and peoples but be helpful to the peace, stability and development of the whole world, and of Asia in particular," Li said. Li said the differences between the two countries should be resolved on the basis of equality, mutual respect and seeking common points while preserving differences. "The differences are in a less important position than that of our common interests, and should not affect bilateral relations on the whole," Li said. He said China and the United States have common interests in preserving world peace and Asian stability, and promoting mutually beneficial cooperation in every field. Li said that the trade and economics of the two countries are comlementary, and it is in the best interests of both sides to enhance cooperation in these aspects. As China is undergoing a large-scale modernization and foreign capital is entering more spheres, "we are glad to see that American enterprises in the manufacturing industries as well as some leading securities firms have ventured into China," he said. Li held that China welcomes entrepreneurs from the United States as well as from other countries to invest in China's coal, electricity, oil, telecommunication and railway industries. He said China has a huge market. In the next seven years China's imports will hit the 700 billion U.S. dollar-mark, which will render Sino-U.S. Cooperation in trade and economy promising. "We believe that foresighted American statesmen and entrepreneurs will not remain aloof from this market or turn a deaf ear to this precious opportunity," Li said. During the meeting Johnston said that now people have more reason to believe that it is in the best interests of both countries to build a strong and close relationship. He said the development of bilateral trade will be invigorated when a permanent and formal relationship is set up between China and the United States and that the most-favored-nation trade status is no longer debated annually. Johnston said that he will, as usual, do his best to promote bilateral, especially economic and trade, relations. The delegation, which arrived in Beijing 4 January at the invitation of the Chinese Institute of Foreign Affairs, consists of 25 persons, including seven senators. It was reported that the visit in China by such a huge U.S. Senate delegation has been quite unusual. As scheduled, during their five-day tour of China they will head for Guangzhou, the capital of south China's Guangdong Province, after winding up their stay in Beijing.
