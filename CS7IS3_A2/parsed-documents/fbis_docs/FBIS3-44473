The resources are concentrated in an area called Panzhihua in Sichuan Province. More funds will be poured into the renovation project of an existing titanium separation plant, which is capable of producing 100,000 tons of titanium concentrate a year, and a titanium dioxide extraction plant. By the year 2000 the annual output of titanium concentrate will reach 300,000 tons and that of titanium dioxide, 25,000 tons. A high-grade titanium extraction plant will also be built to further process the 300,000 tons of titanium concentrate into 100,000 tons of high-grade titanium slag, according to the development blueprint. In addition, more vanadium extraction plants will be built by the end of this century in a bid to produce 100,000 tons of vanadium slag and 22,000 tons of vanadium pentoxide a year. Qin Wanxiang, mayor of Panzhihua, told XINHUA that the city is co-operating with some domestic research institutes to study ways to extract from tailings scandium, which, like vanadium and titanium, is widely used in the space, electronics, petrochemical and medical industries. Statistics show that more than 20 million tons of vanadium, or 63 percent of China's total reserves, and 890 million tons of titanium, or 93 percent of China's total titanium reserves, are located in the Panzhihua area. The vanadium deposit is the third-largest and that of titanium is the largest in the world. Twenty-eight years of construction have made Panzhihua a medium- sized city and the largest metallurgical center in southwest China. Products including high-grade iron and steel, vanadium slag and titanium concentrate have been exported to Japan, Southeast Asia and Europe. However, due to the small scale of technology and investment so far, the utilization of vanadium and titanium is still in the primary stage, according to the mayor. The products are mainly sold as low-grade raw materials and the production capacity is low. Qin said that the Ertan hydroelectric power station on the Yalong river, which is expected to be completed by the year 2000, will provide sufficient electricity for the new development plan.
