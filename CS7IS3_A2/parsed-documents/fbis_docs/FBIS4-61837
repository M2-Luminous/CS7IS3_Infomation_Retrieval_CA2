But war veterans will undoubtedly meet up to recall the past and lay wreaths at the graves of their fallen comrades-in-arms. The single official gesture related to the event was a statement by President Algirdas Brazauskas published today, which to all intents puts the occupiers and liberators of Lithuania on the same level. The head of state said that Lithuania had been occupied more than once and trampled upon by more than one occupier during the years of the Second World War. At the same time, the president notes that thousands of Lithuania's citizens -- Lithuanians, Russians, Poles, and Jews -- had contributed to the joint struggle against Hitler. No one has the right to erase them from history, belittle their sacrifice, or wipe their names from the national memory.
