At the group's general assembly in Cologne, Board Director Manfred Schneider announced that both domestic and foreign capacities will be increased. The group's turnover in the first quarter of 1994 went up by 6.3 percent, to 11 billion German marks [DM], with positive impulses mainly coming from foreign trade. The group's operating results improved by 18 percent, to DM755 million. This favorable development mainly resulted from rationalizations that involved a reduction in staff by 4,500, to 150,300 over a period of 12 months, concluding at the end of March. Two groups of shareholders holding different opinions confronted each other in the debate. While the first group praised the board for Bayer once more for being "top of the class in the chemicals industry," the other group was mainly critical. In no fewer than 47 countermotions, the Bayer management was accused of numerous failures. One of the criticisms was that the wages Bayer pays in the Third World do not meet FRG standards. Schneider addressed the negative effects of the health structure act. These effects will be "counteracted" by reorganizing sales and including generic products in the group's range. The purchase of a parcel of shares (28.3 percent) of the U.S. company Schein Pharmaceuticals at $312 million is only a first step. The majority could be purchased over the next seven years. On the reduction in the number of Bayer shareholders to just under 300,000, Schneider said that a large part of Bayer shares is now probably managed by funds. Good results and appropriate dividends are the best way to increase the attractiveness of Bayer shares even further. At the general assembly, 48.8 percent of the DM3.4 billion in capital were represented. All items on the agenda were adopted with a vast majority.
