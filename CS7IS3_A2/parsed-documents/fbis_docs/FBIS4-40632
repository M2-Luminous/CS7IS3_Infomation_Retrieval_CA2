Geliskhanov maintained that at least 300 to 400 bandits offered resistance to the government troops in the residential district. The ringleaders' names, he said, are still being checked out, but it is now clear that in addition to Labazanov who is hiding from justice (he and his close associates escaped from the sealed area 30 minutes before the storming leaving his fighting men to the mercy of fate) and a heavily wounded Suleymanov (who is being treated as an outpatient and being closely guarded by state security operatives of Chechnya) there were men from another group -- the one led by Temishev -- acting among the criminals. The head of the Chechen security service has no doubt that the names of some other "activists" will become known in time. But these facts and the operational-detection work begun by his department give grounds to assert that leaders of the anti-Dudayev opposition were directly involved in the 12 and 13 June events in Groznyy. Geliskhanov assured NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA that he has at his disposal information that the armed action by the Labazanov-Suleymanov group was only part of the action planned by the opposition for 13 June. For reasons still unknown to Geliskhanov's department, the opposition let down the "criminals" by breaking an agreement on a joint action against the authorities. The confidential tone of the conversation with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA must have been what made it possible for Geliskhanov to declare that the war of the republic's authorities on the criminal world will continue, and very soon. The place of deployment, the numerical strength of the gangs and the weapons they have -- all these things are known. The government troops will begin in the coming few days to eliminate three more groups like the one already destroyed. In the opinion of the head of the state security of Chechnya, both the attempt on the life of the president in late May and the Labazanov-Suleymanov armed rebellion (for which purpose, Geliskhanov thinks, Khoza Suleymanov was released from the Russian "Butyrka" prison) were organized by Russia, which took advantage of the anti-Dudayev opposition's burning desire to come back to power in the republic. In his exclusive wish to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Sultan Geliskhanov remarked "it's time to stop trusting people who bill themselves as politicians," and added that "both in Chechnya and in Russia they have paid in blood for this sort of myopia."
