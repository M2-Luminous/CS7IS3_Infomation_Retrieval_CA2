At a speech delivered to the chamber of commerce of Belgium and Luxembourg and the ACP states (Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific), he stressed that (black) Africa was changing and the continent's image as the "black" continent which it had until a few years ago no longer corresponded to the reality of the situation. The Zambian president, who peacefully succeeded Mr. Kenneth Kaunda following elections in 1991, an almost unique event in Africa, has been on a three-day visit to Belgium since Wednesday, during which he is to meet European Community officials. Mr. Chiluba, a former trade unionist, added that "new leaders" and "new regimes" had appeared, who were asking for time in order to continue with democratization. "The best way of helping us in this matter is by investing in my country," he added. Mr. Chiluba believes that Zambia now possesses a pluralist political system. "I could be beaten at the next elections," he stressed. The Zambian president also affirmed that his government had been insisting on the privatization of the economy since 1991. "Previously" (under the regime of the single party of the left, editor's note) it had been 80 percent nationalized. Other priorities are the fight against inflation and investments in roads and education. Mr. Chiluba was received by King Albert II on Thursday morning. Following a meeting with the ambassadors of the ACP states, he met in the afternoon with European Commission President Jacques Delors. Friday morning, he will be meeting with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, and the secretary of state for cooperation development, Mr. Erik Derycke, over a working lunch.
