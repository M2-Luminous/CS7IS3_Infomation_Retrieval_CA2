Nobody there apart from the oblast party committee first secretary knew what was behind the barbed wire. Now the shroud of secrecy has been lifted and the residents of Pochep have found out that chemical weapons are being stored nearby. But it was another discovery that particularly bothered them: It is planned to build a facility here to destroy the said weapons. Local residents posed the reasonable question: "Surely Bryansk Oblast, which was contaminated by radiation from Chernobyl, should not also become an area for destroying chemical weapons?" Signatures are being collected in opposition to the plant's construction.
