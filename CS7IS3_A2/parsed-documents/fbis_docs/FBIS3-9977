In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Rangel's spokesman, [name indistinct], said that hearings will begin on 17 March in two House of Representatives committees, and although the bill will not be submitted to a vote, these hearings will serve to broach the subject. The document was sent to the capitol in May 1993, bearing the title, "Bill for Free Trade With Cuba," and although it did not receive the support of the entire Congress, it became an important point of discussion both inside and outside the Legislative Branch. In a letter to the U.S. Government, (?Congressman) Rangel asked why the United States trades with Vietnam, China, and Russia, yet cannot do so with Cuba. Rangel's bill -- Rangel is one of the U.S. Legislature's black leaders -- is supported by another 30 legislators who argue that it is the population of Cuba that has suffered the damages caused by the embargo. According to spokesman [name indistinct], Rangel gets calls from people all over the United States who wish to show their support for lifting the blockade against Cuba, people who also inform the government of their interest in a change of policy toward Havana. He pointed out that the legislator has also received strong support from large groups within the Cuban community who live not only in Miami, but in, among other places, New York, New Jersey, and Chicago. He said there has been a recent increase in the number of voices from various parts of the United States who are calling for the lifting of the embargo against Cuba, including those who were formerly in favor of the embargo.
