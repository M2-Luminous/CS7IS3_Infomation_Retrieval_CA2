He will start making a full-fledged effort to iron out differences of opinions among the ruling coalition parties early next week. However, members of the ruling parties think that it is likely that the cabinet will be reshuffled around 28 February because some members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] are beginning to say that an early cabinet reshuffle is unavoidable. In addition, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, whose fate as chief cabinet secretary has become a focal point of the cabinet reshuffle, disclosed his intention on 19 February to abide by the prime minister's final decision. However, it is expected that the SDPJ and other parties will oppose the idea of having a cabinet reshuffle before reaching a conclusion on revision of the political reform bills. It is certain that the conclusion will be delayed until next month. Therefore, the prime minister is assuming the stand of making the final decision on the timing of a cabinet reshuffle while carefully observing the outcome of the coordination-making process within the ruling parties. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, in his speech delivered in Nagoya on 19 February, commented on the issue of a cabinet reshuffle, saying: "Generally speaking, we are not in a situation of reshuffling the cabinet because we just started deliberations on economic matters and the budget issue." He also said: "It is up to the prime minister to decide to reshuffle his cabinet. I am a party representative and I will express my opinion whenever necessary. Fundamentally, I will do my best to support the Hosokawa administration. I am not in the position of clinging to the post of the chief cabinet secretary or being reluctant to give it up." In this way, he explained his intention to abide by the prime minister's decision. As for the scale of the reshuffle, the prime minister initially wanted to minimize it by removing Takemura from the post of chief cabinet secretary and assigning him to another cabinet post. However, due to strong opposition from the SDPJ and Sakigake [Harbinger], he plans to make a medium-scale cabinet reshuffle to lessen the impression that it is designed to "dump Takemura." In addition to Takemura's case, personnel reshuffle of officials in charge of political reform -- whose remaining tasks are to revise the political reform bills and to draw up bills for division of single-seat constituencies -- and the possibility of appointing SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to a cabinet post will be the focal points of the cabinet reshuffle. Among the ruling parties, the SDPJ is the only party whose chairman is not a cabinet member.
