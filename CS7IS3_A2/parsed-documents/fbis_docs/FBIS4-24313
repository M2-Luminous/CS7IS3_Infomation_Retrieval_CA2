AIM cites Dhlakama as saying the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] is already involved in fraud, and his organization is worried about and will refer the matter to the CSC. Dhlakama added if the CSC cannot resolve the problem, Renamo will write to the Security Council asking it to deal with the matter. The Renamo leader alleged that fraud began when electoral registration teams included Frelimo Party members instead of ordinary Mozambicans as had been planned. Dhlakama also accused the government of not providing food to members of the opposition parties monitoring the registration of voters. Meanwhile, Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana says Dhlakama's accusations are worrisome because they cast serious doubts over the National Elections Commission's role. Jose Estevao Muchine, director of the Elections Administration Technical Secretariat, said Dhlakama is not telling the truth. Muchine said electoral arrangements are being jointly made with Renamo and other party officials, adding that the Secretariat has never received reports of such allegations.
