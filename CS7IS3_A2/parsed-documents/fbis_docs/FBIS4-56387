The charge was echoed in editorials, articles, and interviews with priests and Indians displaced by the fighting, mainly in the daily EL UNIVERSAL and the weeklies IMPACTO and SIEMPRE!. In its 24 February editorial, entitled "The Apostle of the Activism," IMPACTO says: "In his statements Bishop Ruiz has been on the verge of giving in to his activism and revealing himself as a fundamental part of the machinery that manufactured the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), the guerrilla organization in which he may have cloaked his true ambitions. We need not wrack our brains analyzing his statements, observations, recommendations, and `conciliatory' remarks to realize that Bishop Ruiz runs the risk of being overtaken by emotion and shouting: We won! Or Did I win?" It goes on to say that Samuel Ruiz "knows more than he is admitting publicly" and that "to achieve his objective the bishop used the hunger and poverty of the Indians." In the editorial in its 3 March edition IMPACTO says: "No one should be fooled if the politicized clergyman goes further and seeks to divide up the country for himself. The `enlightened' bishop has already set the tone and with his hosts of catechizers, diocesans, nuns, and, in short, members of religious orders from here and there, has had an excellent laboratory in which to cultivate the wrath, frustrations, and offensive and denigrating neglect of the Indians to set them against the government and then harvest the fruit of a forbidden tree." IMPACTO does not think that either Manuel Camacho Solis ("owing to his personal ambitions") or the Zapatist delegates would dare to "unmask" the bishop and finger him "as a commander of the guerrillas." In its 2 March issue SIEMPRE! asserts in an editorial that Samuel Ruiz, along with Camacho Solis and Commander Marcos, "have turned the war in the Lacandon Forest into a Hollywood spectacle in which each actor seeks to play the day's leading role." It sees the Chiapas conflict as "shady and odd," and the manipulation of it by Zapatists and peace-makers "seems more like a theatrical production staged for the mass media than a bloody war the main cause of which is supposedly the social tragedy of the Indian communities." It concludes: "Only time will put each of the players who have taken part in this war in their proper place. The central figures in it have been neither the Indians nor Zapata the revolutionary but rather three men who for different reasons are hungry for publicity and power." In a feature article entitled "Landowner, subversive, and enemy of the middle class. The other face of Don Samuel," SIEMPRE! reveals in the same edition, without citing sources, the properties that the bishop allegedly owns, some of which were used to train the guerrillas: "Two of the ranches are in the municipality of Ciudad Cuauhtemoc, Chiapas, one called Santa Clara and another La Gloria, previously San Caralampio. There are those who say that the bishop has hundreds of guerrillas hidden at present on this ranch, as they prepare to take action in southeast Mexico. "The bishop acquired other real estate in the area near the Guatemalan border: Gloria Huanacaston (purchased by someone named Braulio Hernandez); Tepancuapan (bought by Father Alfredo Inda Andrio); La Esmeralda, San Lorenzo, El Naranjillo, El Porvenir 1 (which is believed to have been used by Guatemalan guerrillas as a hospital and rest area), El Porvenir II (also bought through Father Inda Andrio), the San Pedro ranch, and the Guanajuato ranch." Last week EL UNIVERSAL published a series of interviews with Indians and priests in which they accused the bishop of promoting the armed struggle. Diego Andres, the priest in Bochil, Chiapas, indicated that the leader of the EZLN is a former seminarian from the diocese of San Cristobal and that the catechizers, with the support of Samuel Ruiz, have gone around giving military training to believers. Otilio Lopez Lopez, a former vicar of Ocosingo, related that three years ago he spoke out against the imminent uprising to Jeronimo Prigione, the apostolic nuncio in Mexico, who merely told him that there were a "heap of charges" against Samuel Ruiz but that the Vatican had not yet given him any instructions. According to him, the Gospel that the San Cristobal bishop is promoting is "ideologized, with pamphleteer phrasing and classist slogans." He cited the names of priests who had to leave because they did not agree with the bishop's line: Heberto Jose Morales, a former rector of Chiapas Autonomous University, Antonio Patino, Elias Martinez Bulmaro Gordillo, Aurelio Zapata, Cecilio Baraibar, Oscar Macias, and Jose Reyes Angel. He mentioned others who asked to be transferred to another diocese, among them Pedro Ramuco (today in Zamora), Pablo Arenas, Jose Conrado Ruiz, and Jose Inocencio Galvan (in Guadalajara). According to EL UNIVERSAL, representatives of more than 8,000 Indians from 35 communities were in Mexico City to try and see Prigione to find out whether Pope John Paul II had replied to the letter in which they complained about Samuel Ruiz, who because they failed to support his "liberation church" "punished" them by refusing them the sacraments. The letter, which was submitted to the pontiff during his visit to Yucatan last August, said that as a result of the "punishment" imposed by Samuel Ruiz, 460 children had not been baptized, 262 couples had not been married, and 884 persons had not received confirmation; they added that Ruiz's "catechizers are forcing the Indians to sing `Juan the landless' and `30-30 carbine.'" The Indian leaders who were interviewed, "Brother Juan" and "Brother Pedro," said of the bishop: "Don Samuel is a friend of the Zapatists. He organized everything."
