The press service reports that the fleet headquarters previously informed our Ministry of Defense of the move, arguing that it was caused by the necessity of bringing a group of officers from the disbanded 318th division from Odessa to Sevastopol. The request was denied, since Ukraine's Ministry of Defense is perfectly capable of transporting the officers itself, either by sea or by air. Official assurances to this effect have been given to the Black Sea Fleet command. The press service stresses that Admiral Baltin and his aides have now resorted to a step that could aggravate the already complex situation concerning the Black Sea Fleet. At the same time, the press service notes, there is concern at the fact that the fleet command allocated a specialized mobile ship for the action, which is normally used for amphibious assault landing. Besides, an escort ship and two fully armed antisubmarine ships have cast off in Sevastopol today. The Admiral Golovko rocket cruiser and other combat vessels of the Black Sea Fleet are also being put on alert.
