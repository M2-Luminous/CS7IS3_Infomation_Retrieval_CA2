The agreement giving Gasprom one-fourth of the natural gas unit, which will be incorporated at the same time under the name Gasum, was signed on Saturday [12 March] while Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was visiting Neste. An agreement on increased gas imports from Russia was signed at the same time. Imatran Voima [IVO], the other state-owned energy company, also signed an energy agreement with Russia on Saturday. IVO signed a framework agreement to modernize and improve a total of 16 thermal power plants and their related district heating systems in the area around St. Petersburg. The agreement calls for work worth close to 1 billion markkas. The Russian gas company Gasprom is the world's largest producer of natural gas, and it has already bought shares in other Western gas companies -- in Germany, for example. Gasprom's purchase of Neste's natural gas unit is completely in line with the concept governing the firm's activities in the rest of the world, says Rem Vyahirev, Gasprom's chief manager. The Gasum Corporation will begin its activity on 1 May this year and will operate as a subsidiary of the Neste Group. Plans also call for listing Gasum on the stock exchange, but that will not happen for at least a year -- after the company has produced its first balance sheet, says Neste President Jaakko Ihamuotila. Gasum's balance sheet will total about 2.5 billion markkas, and its capital stock will amount to 40 percent of that amount, or about 1 billion markkas. Gasprom is therefore subscribing to 25 percent of the stock. Gasprom became a part owner of Gasum at Neste's initiative, says Ihamuotila, who says the fact that the gas supplier is also a partner in the sales and distribution firm represents a strengthening of the Finnish natural gas market. "It guarantees us an uninterrupted supply of gas," said Ihamuotila, who pointed out at the same time that guaranteed deliveries have never been a problem in the past either. New Transport Capacity Ihamuotila predicts that by the turn of the century, natural gas consumption in Finland will have increased 50 percent over its current level of just over 3 billion cubic meters per year. Under the import agreement signed on Saturday, imports from Russia will rise to just above 4 billion cubic meters per year over a 20-year period. Increased imports mean that transport capacity from Russia and within Finland will also increase: A new compressor station north of St. Petersburg and a parallel pipeline from there to the Finnish border are planned. Planning is also under way for a parallel pipeline between Imatra and Lappeenranta and from the latter locality to Kouvola and Mantsala. Door Open to Norway Neste estimates that Finland's annual natural gas requirement could rise to nearly 8 billion cubic meters per year if the Finnish gas pipeline is extended to the west coast and if natural gas is also used to produce electricity. An option on further imports from Russia is included in the agreement signed on Saturday, but Neste also wants to keep the door open for gas imports from Norway. The Finnish Government also says that a second source of natural gas is necessary if the gas network is to be expanded. The Russian interest in Neste's Gasum does not markedly alter the Nordic gas picture. Both Finland and Norway are still waiting for Sweden to reach a decision on natural gas so they will know whether a pipeline can be built to Sweden's Uppland coast. That pipeline would then link up with the pipeline being extended to Uusikaupunki on the Finnish side. No political decision is expected in Sweden before this fall's election, but Swedish industry may very well take the initiative in introducing natural gas imports from Norway. Industry wants to ensure its supply of energy even if Sweden goes ahead with plans to phase out nuclear power. A Nordic gas pipeline would also suit Gasprom and the export firm Gasexport because it would open up the possibility of exporting Russian gas to Sweden as well. The Norwegians and the Finns are both hoping for a relatively quick decision by the Swedes. The Norwegians must decide whether to extend their gas pipelines further south in the direction of Central Europe, where there is a big market. For their part, the towns on Finland's west coast, which are potentially big gas consumers, will soon have to make decisions about their future energy supplies. The increased quantities of Russian gas that Neste agreed to on Saturday will be used mainly by combined power and district heating plants, where they will replace coal as an energy source. Gasprom, which was formerly a state-owned Russian firm, is now a corporation in the process of being privatized. Some of the stock has been sold to employees, and some has been bought by the regional gas companies that all deliver their gas through Gasprom. Last year nearly 100 billion cubic meters of gas were exported, and the company plans to increase its exports beyond that. IVO To Be Paid in Coal and Oil For its part, the agreement that Imatran Voima signed on Saturday to modernize Russian power plants will improve energy efficiency and reduce effluent at power plants in our near vicinity. IVO had previously participated in mapping out the possibilities for modernizing power plants in neighboring areas. "Financing is always a tough problem, and we are doing what we can to help find alternative forms of payment," says IVO Vice President Anders Palmgren. Under the terms of Saturday's agreement, the Russian partner will pay for the modernization of the power plants using the energy raw material that is saved as a result of that modernization, meaning primarily oil or coal. The projects will also be paid for partly in electricity exports. Palmgren says that exchange or barter arrangements of many different kinds may be considered. IVO's agreement to import electricity from Russia through the end of the century is not affected by Saturday's agreement. Palmgren says that a possible extension of that agreement will not be discussed before 1997.
