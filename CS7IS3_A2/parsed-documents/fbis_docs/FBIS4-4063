Since the First Session of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu, while upholding the party's basic line, have seriously implemented the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; have conscientiously adapted themselves to the new situation of accelerated reform and opening up as well as to the socialist market economic structure; have fully performed and constantly improved their procuratorial functions; have strictly enforced the law and handled criminal cases; and have resolutely punished according to law serious criminals, including those who committed economic crimes. In this way they have actively served reform, opening up, and economic construction, and have made new achievements and progress in procuratorial work. 1. Concentrate on Investigating and Handling Embezzlement, Bribery, and Other Major Economic Cases; Promote the Deepening of the Anti-Corruption Struggle In 1993, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu placed the stress of their work on combating embezzlement and bribery. Particularly after the Party Central Committee made new and important arrangements for the anti-corruption struggle, procuratorial organs at all levels promptly joined the struggle; concentrated on investigating and handling major cases; punished embezzlers as well as those who offered or accepted bribes; promoted the deepening of the anti-corruption struggle; and provided legal protection and service to Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and economic construction. Within the year, the province placed on file and investigated 2,841 cases of economic crimes, including embezzlement and bribery, 7.1 percent more cases than handled in 1992. Of the 1993 cases, 1,314 or 46.3 percent were major cases; the high percentage was unprecedented. Twenty-six cadres of county or provincial department level involved in 23 criminal cases were investigated and dealt with. The procuratorial organs instituted proceedings against 1,668 people in people's courts, and recovered 94.65 million yuan from the direct economic losses of the state and collectives. We placed the stress of our work on investigating and handling cases of embezzlement, bribery, and other crimes, particularly major cases involving personnel of party and government organizations, judicial departments, administrative law-enforcement departments, and economic management departments. (1) A number of criminal cases involving functionaries of party and government organizations were investigated and handled. In 1993, the procuratorial organs in Jiangsu investigated 191 functionaries of party and government organizations involved in cases of embezzlement, bribery, and other economic crimes, including some cadres at the county or provincial department level. Although criminal cases involving party and government cadres were small in number, they have done considerably serious harm and hurt the blood- and-flesh ties between the party and government and the people. Moreover, they could promote unhealthy tendencies and induce more crimes. (2) Some criminal cases involving judicial personnel and administrative law-enforcement personnel were sternly dealt with. In 1993, we investigated 29 judicial personnel involved in economic crimes. We also handled a number of embezzlement, bribery, and other economic crimes involving such administrative law-enforcement departments as the Administration of Industry and Commerce, taxation departments, and customs offices. For instance, Cheng Renmin, deputy director of the Zhangjiagang Customs Office, colluded with two office accountants to embezzle more than 400,000 yuan of public funds. Cheng also diverted 500,000 yuan of public funds to be used in his personal profit-making undertakings. (3) A number of criminal cases involving banking and economic management departments were detected. In 1993, procuratorial organs at various levels in Jiangsu resolutely implemented the central authorities' policy decision on strengthening macro-economic regulation and control, and helped rectify the banking order and improve the management of the securities and real estate markets. They promptly investigated and handled cases of embezzlement and bribery, as well as cases of using public funds in speculation on stocks, real estate, and futures. They detected 108 criminal cases involving 122 persons of the Banking Department. Wang Guangyi, secretary of the leading party group of the Bank of Agriculture and president of the Keyin Real Estate Development Company in the Runzhou District of Zhenjiang, and four others took bribes of 240,000 yuan renminbi and HK$20,000 from real estate speculators. After they were prosecuted by procuratorial organs, they were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from five to 13 years. The procuratorial organs in various localities also detected a number of cases in the supply and marketing, materials, grain, and other economic management departments. (4) Resolute efforts were made to combat such crimes as trademark falsification, tax evasion, and fraudulent export tax refund. Trademark falsification, tax evasion, and fraud greatly jeopardize the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. In 1993, the province investigated 252 cases of trademark falsification, 167 percent more than in 1992. Of those cases, 57 involved illegal business volume of more than 100,000 yuan each, and three involved illegal business volume of more than 1 million yuan each. Fraudulent export tax refunds are a new form of crime. In 1993, this province discovered 14 cases in this regard and placed them on file for investigation. As far as economic criminal cases which are under investigation by Jiangsu procuratorial organs are concerned, currently such crimes as corruption and bribery are rampant. The major characteristics of such cases are: First, the amount involved in such crimes is increasing. In 1993, the average amount involved in each case totalled 35,000 yuan, up 40 percent over 1992. Thirty-nine corruption and bribery cases were filed for investigation, each involving more than 100,000 yuan, plus six embezzlement cases, each involving more than one million yuan. Second, the number of cases involving more than one person has increased, and many cases are characterized by collusion between insiders and outsiders. Among filed cases, there were 720 people jointly committing crimes. Third, many crimes are committed by youth, and many of these are major cases. Among filed cases, there are 232 criminals under 25. Some embezzled large sums of money when they took their posts; others spent freely and indulged in wanton pleasure after receiving huge amounts in bribes. Fourth, more and more criminal elements abscond with funds. In 1993, 93 criminals absconding with funds were apprehended; some carried funds worth hundreds of thousand yuan. 2. Crack Down on Major Criminal Activities and Maintain Political and Social Stability In 1993, procuratorial organs across Jiangsu continued to carry out the policy of giving heavier punishments over a short time according to the law and of cracking down on major criminal activities in order to maintain social stability and ensure that Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and economic construction proceeded smoothly. Particularly during the "summertime crackdown" launched across Jiangsu in June-September, procuratorial organs at various levels earnestly carried out their duties, closely coordinated with public security organs and courts, and cracked down on a number of criminal elements of major cases. In 1993, procuratorial organs at various levels accepted applications for approval by public security organs to arrest 31,157 criminals; authorized the arrest of 28,708 criminals, an increase of 17.3 percent over 1992; and prosecuted 28,063 of the 31,157 criminals transferred from public security organs. During crackdowns, we concentrated on curtailing crimes that seriously endanger social order and public security as well as people's lives, properties, and security; we mercilessly punished such major criminal elements as murderers, robbers, rapists, major thieves, hooligan groups, "train and road bandits," and "river bandits." In 1993, 8,903 criminals of major cases were prosecuted across Jiangsu. To quickly punish criminals from major cases, procuratorial organs at various levels were involved early in the investigations and preparatory examinations by public security organs; examined and verified facts and evidence; proposed ways to obtain evidence; adhered to the principles of having irrefutable facts and conclusive evidence as well as avoiding quibbling over side issues; and ensured they not miss any opportunities in procuratorial work. Procuratorial organs across Jiangsu were involved in 1,211 criminal cases which were still under investigation by public security organs; participated in the inspection of the crime scene 1,294 times; participated in preparatory examination and case discussions 2,354 times; and presented 2,082 proposals for obtaining evidence. In 1993, procuratorial organs across Jiangsu earnestly participated in comprehensive management of the social order and strived to strengthen the social effect of the "crackdown" campaign. First, they coordinated with the courts to organize meetings on a certain scale for public trials and verdicts, publicized knowledge of the legal system, and educated the masses by exposing crimes. Second, focusing on areas and sections where public security problems were conspicuous, they coordinated with the concerned departments and made great efforts to launch special crackdown and management projects. Third, they established public security networks, rectified public order, and implemented preventive measures. Fourth, they doubled their efforts to educate, redeem, and help juvenile delinquents. Fifth, they doubled their efforts to investigate the execution of a criminal's sentence outside prison and to help and teach those exempted from prosecution. Sixth, they earnestly launched a procuratorial advise campaign in light of handling cases, urging units in such localities where public security is worse to implement reform measures so as to prevent and reduce crimes. 3. Strengthen Supervision Over Law Enforcement To Ensure the Unified and Correct Implementation of the Laws of the State As state organs in charge of supervision over laws, procuratorial organs shoulder heavy responsibility for supervising law enforcement and for maintaining the dignity of the laws and regulations of the state. Last year, procuratorial organs at all levels in Jiangsu Province conscientiously fulfilled their duty of supervision over law enforcement, strengthened supervision over investigations by public security organs and over criminal trials by people's courts, earnestly conducted procuratorial work at detention centers as well as procuratorial work on civil cases and cases involving administration, and scored new achievements. (1) Strengthen Supervision Over the Investigations and Trials of Criminal Cases. Last year, while insisting on using facts as the basis and laws as the criteria, procuratorial organs throughout the province strictly checked up on cases submitted to higher authorities for approving the arrest and prosecution of suspects; conscientiously made a distinction between those who were guilty and those who were not, as well as between different kinds of guilt; prevented mistakes and omissions; and corrected violations of the law. While punishing criminals in accordance with the law, they protected innocent people from criminal investigation. They decided not to grant approval for the arrest of 3,005 criminals among those submitted by public security organs, and decided to arrest and prosecute 90 more criminals in addition to those submitted by public security organs. While supervising the trial of criminal cases, we focused attention on improving the work of protesting a verdict. At the beginning of the year, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Procuratorate conducted a special survey on the work of protesting a verdict, proposed measures for improvement, improved guidance for and examination of protest cases, and resolutely supported the correct opinions on protesting a verdict put forward by people's procuratorates at the lower level. Last year, procuratorial organs across the province lodged a total of 53 cases with people's courts in protest of their verdicts in accordance with the law; they corrected some cases which had been given improper court verdicts. Yin Fengxiang, chief of the accounting section of Taizhou's Chengbei Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, embezzled 240,000 yuan. After being prosecuted by procuratorial organs, he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment with five years' probation after both first and second court hearings. The punishment meted out to him was unusually lenient. The Taizhou People's Procuratorate persisted in its correct opinion to protest the verdict. With resolute support from the Jiangsu Provincial People's Procuratorate and intervention by the Taizhou People's Congress and the Yangzhou People's Congress, the sentence for criminal Yin Fengxiang was finally changed to eight years' imprisonment plus the deprivation of his political rights for two years. (2) Improve Procuratorial Work at Detention Centers; Supervise the Implementation of Court Verdicts and Rulings on Criminal Cases, and Court Decisions on Reeducation Through Labor and Remold Through Education Under Custody in Accordance With the Laws. Last year, procuratorial organs throughout the province focused attention on examining and correcting the implementation of court rulings and decisions not in accordance with the provisions of the law; the use of money to avoid jail terms; and the collection of unwarranted fees from reducing a penalty, granting parole, and accepting bail on medical reasons. They proposed a total of 11,413 opinions on correcting such violations of the law. The detention center at Dafeng County arbitrarily accepted money for bail and pledges, and released 14 criminals serving jail terms. After procuratorial organs timely proposed their opinion on correction, all the released criminals were again taken into custody to serve their jail terms, and all the money taken for bail and pledges was returned. Wu Yilin, former deputy chief of the Dongtai Public Security Bureau, was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for fraudulent practice out of personal considerations. Less than two months after he began serving his jail term, his penalty was reduced to 11 months. After procuratorial organs proposed a correction in accordance with the law, the court ruling on the reduction of his penalty was annulled. In addition, procuratorial organs in all areas placed on file, investigated, and handled criminal cases committed by 17 working personnel of custody and remold centers involving corruption, taking of bribes, releasing inmates without authorization, and subjecting inmates to corporal punishment and maltreatment. (3) Improve Procuratorial Work on Civil Cases and Cases Involving Administration, and Fulfill the Duty of Legal Supervision Over Court Trials on Civil and Administration Cases. Throughout the entire year, procuratorial organs throughout the province handled a total of 702 appeal cases lodged by citizens and legal persons against verdicts and rulings given by people's courts on civil cases, economic cases, and cases involving administration; placed 163 cases on file for investigation; and lodged 16 cases in protest of court verdicts. The number of protest cases lodged by the Jiangsu Provincial People's Procuratorate alone totaled seven. They made suggestions to judicial organs on conducting a trial again, or served circulars on correcting law violations; the number of such cases totaled 45. While handling protests against verdicts given on civil cases and cases involving administration, we also paid attention to discovering and investigating favoritism, malpractice, the taking of bribes, and the bending of the laws committed by judicial personnel in making a court judgment. While handling a case on contract disputes, Xu Zhongchen, judicial officer of the economic court of the Changzhou Intermediate People's Court, abused his power, accepted bribes offered by the litigants, and bent the law in making court judgments. After having conscientiously conducted a thorough investigation of the facts, procuratorial organs lodged a protest against the erroneous verdict in accordance with the law, meanwhile resolutely investigating Xu Zhongchen's taking of bribes and bending the law. 4. Procuratorial Organs Safeguarded the Legitimate Rights and Interests of Citizens As Well As the Normal Functions of State Organs by Earnestly Investigating Cases About "Rights Infringements" and Negligence of Duties, As Well As Complaints and Petitions Last year, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu established files for investigating 618 cases concerning negligence of duty and infringement of citizens' democratic rights. That was an increase of 5.5 percent over a year previous. By so doing, we retrieved economic losses exceeding 95 million yuan. While carrying out our assignments, we focused our attention on investigating cases of corruption, extortion by torture for confession, unlawful detention, malfeasance, and major accidents caused by negligence of duty; because of our efforts, the prosecution of lawless behavior continued to deepen. It is noteworthy that the problem of lawless detention--such as the holding of hostages [ren zhi xing fei fa ju jin 0086 6347 0992 7236 3127 2153 4391]--was still quite conspicuous. Owing to disputes over debts, creditors often unlawfully abducted and detained the debtors' relatives as hostages. Last year, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu established files for investigating 53 of 100 cases of this nature, and freed 87 people held as hostages. Last year, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu also established files for investigating 350 major accidents caused by negligence of duty. That was 5.9 percent over the preceding year; cases of this nature caused 240 million yuan of direct economic losses and the death of 335 people. Regarding the investigation of people's complaints as an important aspect of safeguarding citizens' legitimate rights and interests, Jiangsu's procuratorial organs last year played a fairly effective role in this regard by cracking down on crime, protecting the innocent, upholding justice, and keeping promises they had made to the people. Compared with 1992, the number of people's complaints presented either through letters or personal visits increased 35.3 percent, totaling 36,940. People were particularly eager to report all sorts of crimes. Procuratorial organs investigated 17,709 of the 20,890 first-time reports they accepted. That was 63.9 percent greater than accepted in 1992. Many major cases, serial cases, and unresolved cases were cracked because of clues provided by the masses. While investigating complaints, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu also followed the principle of seeking truth from facts and correcting all mistakes, established files for investigating 564 cases of various complaints, and reinvestigated complaints presented by people who disagreed with procuratorial organs' decisions not to arrest people they reported and not prosecute them. Certain mishandled cases were corrected. Last year, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu handled 74 collective petitions and 81 letters calling for emergency handling, and calmed petitioners and solved the problems in different ways according to the circumstances. 5. Stronger Contingents of Procuratorial Personnel Were Built, and Police Officers' Political and Professional Qualities Were Improved Last year, procuratorates at all levels in Jiangsu, upholding the principle of building stronger contingents of procuratorial personnel while handling day-to-day operations, made new headway in building stronger procuratorates and strictly managing procuratorial personnel. First of all, we organized police officers to study the guidelines of the 14th national party congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," thus arming the minds of procuratorial personnel with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This has heightened their awareness of implementing the party's basic lines, and their sense of responsibility and mission in discharging their duties and following the correct political course under the new situation. Second, we actively carried out ideological and political work relevant to the characteristics of procuratorial organs, and by so doing we educated procuratorial personnel on professional ethics, responsibilities, and discipline as well as the need to serve the people wholeheartedly. We also carried out competitions for excellence, commended advanced units and individuals, and guided police officers to wage arduous struggle and be brave to make contributions. At one time or another, the provincial procuratorate commended units and individuals having distinguished themselves in cracking down on crime and corruption, and issued a circular urging procuratorial personnel to learn from Comrade Ji Zhong, director of the Haimen County Procuratorate Office, who selflessly and diligently dedicated himself to his work even when he was stricken by cancer. Wuxi's procuratorial authorities also launched a series of educational activities on comparing contributions and striving to become the best. Procuratorial organizations are important forces in the fight against corruption, and those organizations themselves are considered as key departments which need to be investigated in the anticorruption campaign. Last year we seriously made efforts to check ourselves in the anticorruption campaign. First, we arranged to have leading cadres of procuratorial organizations at various levels, especially cadres at and above department level, take part in democratic life meetings to check if they met with the five requirements set by the party Central Committee on self discipline, the three supplementary provisions set by this province, and the "10 forbidden things" set by the Central Commission on Politics and Law. We checked and corrected our behavior against those requirements one by one. We conducted positive education for the broad masses of procuratorial cadres and policemen. We attached importance to the "three rectifications and being strict in three things," namely rectifying our ideology and being strict in conducting education, rectifying our workstyle and being strict in administration, and rectifying discipline and being strict in setting demands. On this basis, various procuratorial organizations all established and improved rules and regulations to ensure honesty in performing official duties. Second, we seriously straightened up and corrected the situation of wanton collection of fees by using procuratorial power. We investigated and rectified all companies and economic entities established by procuratorial organizations in the province, and adopted measures to close or transfer those companies and economic entities. Third, we seriously investigated cases of violation of law and discipline by procuratorial workers, and made decisions on punishing 17 procuratorial cadres and policemen who violated the law and discipline. At the end of last year, we also made an all-round investigation on the enforcement of law and discipline by procuratoratial organizations throughout the province. We corrected and improved all problems discovered in the investigation. Fellow deputies: The procuratorates in this province made certain achievements in 1993. We gained understanding in the following five areas: (1) Serving economic construction is the guiding ideology which must be firmly adhered to in carrying out procuratorial work. (2) Enforcing law in a strict manner and investigating and handling cases in a relentless manner are correct guiding policies for promoting the constant improvement of procuratorial work. (3) Firmly adhering to the party's leadership is an important principle of procuratorial work. (4) Consciously accepting supervision by the people's congresses and various circles is a guarantee for enforcement of law in a just manner. (5) Persisting in integrating the work of procuratorial organizations with the mass line is an effective way to improve procuratorial work. Reviewing the work over the past year, we have found that there are still shortcomings and problems, although we have made some achievements. For example: The ideological understanding and methods of work of some procuratorial personnel still cannot fully meet the new requirements in the establishment of a socialist market economy; a small number of leaders are not resolute enough when they meet with difficulties and resistance in the enforcement of the law; procuratorial work has been carried out unevenly in various places, some locales lack effective measures, and their results are not prominent in investigating and handling major and serious cases; some places cannot promptly investigate and handle clues due to a lack of manpower; organizations for handling civil cases are not sound, and the progress of their work is slow; and investigative work is relatively weak due to backward equipment and facilities, lack of funds in handling cases, and other reasons. Fellow deputies, 1994 is crucial to China's reform and opening up. It is essential that we have a comprehensive legal system to regulate and safeguard the establishment of a sound socialist market economic structure. As state organs in charge of supervising law enforcement, procuratorates shoulder a major responsibility in safeguarding uniform and correct law enforcement and in bringing China's law enforcement in line with its socialist market economy. Its tasks are heavier and more difficult. Under the leadership of the party Central Committee and the provincial party committee, and guided by their plans, our current struggle against corruption has achieved interim success. However, corruption as a social phenomenon in history will exist for a long time. Accordingly, the struggle against corruption will be a protracted, complicated process. Presently the lack of strict law enforcement to crack down on crimes exists in varying degrees throughput the province. In some economic crimes, investigation has encountered fairly large resistance. The masses still have doubts about the struggle against corruption. Thus, the drive to crack down on corruption and bribery still has a long way to go. Although the situation is generally stable as far as public order is concerned, destabilizing factors still exist in force. The lack of a good social order is still a matter of general concern among the masses. Cracking down sternly and swiftly on grave criminal offenses remains an important task for procuratorial organs. In 1994, procuratorial organs at all levels in the province will earnestly implement the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, as well as those of the national conference of chief procurators and the seventh plenary (enlarged) session of the eighth provincial party committee; use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as our guide; uphold the policy of "grasping two links simultaneously, attaching equal importance to both"; strengthen their role in legal supervision; strictly enforce the law; vigorously investigate cases; concentrate efforts on cracking major and important cases; deal blows to all kinds of criminal activities; protect the citizens' legitimate rights and interests; safeguard political and social stability; and ensure the establishment and development of a socialist market economy. To provide them with an ideological guide for this year's work, the provincial procuratorate asks all procuratorial organs in the province not to waver in their thinking that: 1) procuratorial work shall serve the cause of establishing and developing a socialist market economy; 2) strict law enforcement and vigorous investigation constitutes the heart of procuratorial work; 3) it is necessary to strengthen their role in legal supervision and firmly safeguard uniform and correct law enforcement; 4) it is necessary to crack down on corruption in accordance with the law, and to consolidate and develop the fruits of the anticorruption drive; and 5) it is necessary to enforce strict discipline within procuratorial organs and improve the ranks of procuratorial personnel. In day-to- day work, they are asked to take further steps in the struggle against corruption in three areas: 1) to continue concentrating their efforts on investigating major and important cases, particularly important criminal cases involving leading cadres; 2) to strengthen law enforcement supervision and strictly investigate law-breaking and criminal cases, such as failures to strictly enforce the law; and 3) to investigate criminal cases involving legal entities.
