The governing parties' pithy campaign slogan of yesteryear has fallen on fertile soil. Also in the opposition. How nice it is to have a common continuity when it is a matter of covering up the fiasco of the German tax policy with phony figures and hollow words and misleading the citizens. The decisive elections are approaching, and the chancellor as well as his adversary agree that German taxes are not to be increased. There will be a little redistribution, to be sure, but, and there too they are agreed, that is not the same as a tax hike. Both of them are tacitly taking for granted that the new taxes known as the solidarity tax (CDU [Christian Democratic Union]) and the supplementary tax (SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]) have already been passed and are thus not new. The campaign promises of lower taxes will be broken. It is a sure thing that the next finance minister in Bonn, regardless of his party affiliation, must implement two directives of the Constitutional Court justices and, in addition to the supplementary or solidarity tax, must undertake something which will equate to higher property taxes, estate taxes, assets taxes, and/or value-added taxes. All the parties in Bonn know that and are laughing softly. The grand coalition against the taxpayers is a done deal. Both camps have further snatches up their sleeves. The chancellor would like to raise gasoline prices to save the railroad system, his opponent cites other methods to achieve the same purpose and, apart from that, broods on the budgetary risks. And despite all their bombast, neither gives the slightest insight into how the maximum-taxation country of Germany is to become a region in which achievement will once again pay off. Regardless who leads the next government, it will skim generously off the top of their subjects' incomes--including church tax, roughly 62 percent. A grasp of this magnitude will not be an isolated occurrence. For single persons, incomes will, according to the tax tables, be taxed at this rate up to 120,000 German marks [DM]. Regardless who leads the government, it will continue taking also from its subjects' consumption and capital assets--most of which were created from taxed incomes. From the standpoint of its impact on the national economy, the pincer attack on capital assets and incomes can only be depicted in gloomy colors: The creation of capital assets is hampered in threefold fashion with all the negative consequences for investments, growth, and standard of living. How, under these circumstances, the collective vigor and entrepreneurial spirit of these subjects are to bring about a revival of the economy, and how the urgently needed new jobs are to be created in the process, will remain the secret of the grand coalition parties. Less of a secret is the assumption that the entrepreneurial spirit of the ripoff victims will discover the higher marginal utility in the development of countermeasures. The figures confirm the expectation: The transfer of capital to Luxemburg and Switzerland continues unabated; the cash money in circulation increased from early in 1990 to the end of 1993 from DM65 billion to DM212 billion. Doing unreported work on the side and tax evasion have what it takes to become trivial offenses and a mass phenomenon. If they would stop and think a little, it should occur to all the parties that their uninhibited "right on" is leading into a cul-de-sac. Eminent economists, with the Bundesbank in the lead, have been preaching consolidation and savings for years. No one in Bonn is listening. Where is the party that will honestly and bluntly point to the predictable budgetary gaps and, instead of making nebulous taxation promises, tells the responsible citizen in clear terms that it will save the missing billions, and where it will do so?
