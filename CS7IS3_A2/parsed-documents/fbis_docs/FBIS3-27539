In a 110-page state of the nation message to the parliament, the Russian president said: "The creation of a system of regulations of market economy is not a regress, but movement ahead, development of the reform, strengthening of the Russian state." Market reforms in the country are impeded by excessive monopolism, according to the president, who warned that demonopolization is not an easy process and will take considerable time. The taxation system is also to be considerably changed. "At least it should be understandable and stable during a year. The number of taxes is to be reduced and the rules of their payment eased," Yeltsin said. Summing up the results of two years of economic reforms in the country, the president stressed that the "cost of reforms was high." The high cost of reforms which Russians have to afford is explained by the difficult starting situation in 1991 when the economy was in a very complicated state, Yeltsin said. Besides, he continued, the price of the reform also increased because of the political stand-off in the country which lasted for two years. Mistakes of state authorities in carrying out reforms comprised yet another reason. He accused the government of not working for reform, but concentrating on "solving routine problems."
