It is considered symbolic that for Russia the year 1994 is beginning with the U.S. President's Moscow visit and the Russian foreign minister's visit to Beijing. According to a high-ranking Russian Foreign Ministry official, these visits confirm that Russia's foreign policy is balanced and looks equally to the West and the East. The visit is being held according to agreements on regular contacts and high-level consultations on issues of interest between the two countries. These agreements were reached during the Russian president's visit to China in 1992. During the forthcoming talks in China, the two sides plan to discuss issues of preparation for the second Russian-Chinese summit. The negotiators will consider a wide range of issues of bilateral relations and regional and international problems of their common interest. It is obvious that Russian-Chinese relations have an influence on stability and security in Asia and all over the world, Mikhail Beliy, head of the First Asian Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told ITAR-TASS on Monday. Positions of the two countries coincide on many international and regional issues, but naturally there are differences as well. The countries are working to settle them. The Russian delegation will visit the province of Guangdong and familiarise itself with the special economic zone in Shezheng. The idea of creating such zones has provided a great stimulus to the development of China's economy. This idea has not yet been studied thoroughly in Russia, but is now being actively considered in the country. Possibilities of and prospects for the development of economic and trade cooperation are to be discussed in Beijing. The volume of bilateral trade (38 per cent of which was accounted for by machinery exports to China) amounted to 7.2 billion dollars in 1993, a record for bilateral trade. The trade balance, 2 billion dollars, is in favour of Russia, though it has a clearing debt to China. It is worth mentioning that China is second only to Germany among Russian trade partners. Progress has also been made in military and technical cooperation. Moscow exported SU-27 military aircraft and S-300 missile systems to Beijing. The countries are conducting border negotiations. A treaty on settlement in the eastern section of the border was signed in May, 1991. A joint delegation from the two countries is still working on the western section. "There are unsettled border problems, but there is no animosity, no danger of explosive situations", the Russian Foreign Ministry official believes. During Andrey Kozyrev's visit, the sides are to sign a treaty on check points on the Russian-Chinese border and a protocol of consultations between the two countries' foreign ministries. There are 21 such check points (19 of which are operating) and the treaty is to fix the rules for their work and envisage new ones to cope with the increased traffic between Russia and China. 2.5 million people crossed the border last year. Comprehensive development of Russian-Chinese relations and cooperation is in the interests of the two countries. It is mutually advantageous and promising, Beliy said.
