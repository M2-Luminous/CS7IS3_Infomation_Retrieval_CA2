It includes seventeen kinds of goods, including petroleum and its derivatives, natural gas condensate, polyethylene, sulphanol, caustic soda, snake venom, tobacco, cotton fibre, caviar, hand-made rugs, precious, ferrous, and non-ferrous metals, and also articles made of them. The export of electric power is also banned. This decree, the document stresses, was adopted to ensure more effective use of the republic's export potential at a time when the Azeri market economy is being established, when the system of mutual settlements in foreign trade and measures to protect the domestic market are being toughened. It allows, until the adoption of corresponding legislative acts, regulating commercial relations with foreign countries, including CIS nations, to sell goods and render services outside Azerbaijan only if they are paid for in advance or if a letter of credit is made out. At the same time, the decree prohibits advance payments for goods purchased in foreign countries and services rendered by firms abroad. It is permitted to use letters of credit for this purpose. Restrictions have also been imposed on barter transactions.
