Good morning, listeners. Last night, as has been widely broadcast, certain developments took place in Bophuthatswana. There is a security firm which has several Boer Commando members in service, and which asked if we could come and assist them with the protection of certain industries and personnel. A commando group was then put together under the command of the Akasia Commando leader, and they moved in and took positions around the properties guarded by this security firm. This was late last night. They remained there as long as they were needed. There were no incidents there, but then certain other shopping complexes, about 2 km away, were being looted by a mass of people. This was typical of the looting in Bisho and also in several parts of South Africa, where unrest has been instigated by the ANC [African National Congress] and the Communist Party and has always ended with such plundering.
