It is an attempt to expand Caricom's [Caribbean Community] reach in the region. The draft is to be presented to regional leaders at the heads of government conference in Barbados next month. The ACS is to bring together Caricom member states with non-English speaking Caribbean territories and their neighbors on the South and Central American mainland. Trinidadian foreign affairs officials say there is consensus on the main aims and objectives of the ACS, but the Caracas meeting will tackle outstanding issues, such as membership and the administrative structure of the association. The ACS was one of the recommendations put forward by the West Indian Commission. Nicole Huggins tells us more: [Begin Huggins recording] The formation of an Association of Caribbean States was recommended as a means of expanding the trading options of Caricom states, and also as a way of inserting Caricom into the evolving hemispheric bloc. Local foreign affairs officials seem to believe that the leaders of the countries involved have the political will to bring the idea to reality. Three meetings have been held this year in Jamaica, Dominica, and Mexico. The final meeting on the draft proposal is carded for Caracas. There seems to be consensus on the main aims and objectives of the ACS: the creation of a larger area for economic relations, foreign policy coordination, and technical cooperation. But key issues such as the size, structure, and location of a secretariat are still to be worked out. A method of funding the ACS is yet to be defined, and in a region encompassing independent and nonindependent territories, membership procedures are still being discussed. One major departure from the Caricom Treaty is for ACS members to have greater flexibility in choosing to be part of an ACS project. This differs significantly from the Caricom Treaty, which requires all member states to agree for almost anything to be attempted. If the ACS gets off the ground, it could be the vehicle for which Caricom countries have been looking to bring their small economies closer to those of their larger Caribbean and Latin American neighbors. But with that comes a challenge, according to some regional experts, to ensure that Caricom is not swallowed up by its own creation. [end recording]
