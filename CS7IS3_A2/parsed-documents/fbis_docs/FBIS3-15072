Press Conference at Russian Defense Ministry"] [Text] Russia's sensational political initiative in the Balkans and the role that our Airborne Troops in the UN peacekeeping forces played therein were discussed at a press conference for Russian and foreign correspondents given 26 February by Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, and Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne Troops. From the moment that NATO presented the warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina with an ultimatum, the Russian leadership has taken a firm and unequivocal stance, Col. Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov told journalists, namely that a solution to the Bosnian problem must be sought by peaceful, political means. That is why, he went on to say, not only would the intended aerial bombing of Serb positions not speed up the peace settlement process but it might on the contrary stiffen the sides' positions and lead to a fresh escalation of the war in the Balkans. The chief of the General Staff stressed that, by threatening to carry out bombing raids on targets around Sarajevo, the NATO command has thus put itself in an ambiguous position. It has been publicly stated that the use of force should be the instrument that will enable the situation around Sarajevo to be normalized. In actual fact Western diplomats acknowledge that bombing would be regarded in the North Atlantic Alliance as the collapse of its strong-arm policy. That is why the alliance greeted with relief the news that, owing to the efforts of the Russian president and Russian diplomats, it had proved possible to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy arms from a 20-km zone around Sarajevo, while our "blue helmets" in the UN peacekeeping forces acted as guarantors of this plan's implementation. The arrival of the Russian soldiers is a key element in the implementation of Russia's plan for a political settlement of the crisis in Bosnia, Col. Gen. Kolesnikov noted. No matter what people in the West are now saying about the fear that the NATO ultimatum has supposedly inspired in the Serbs, he said, trust played a crucial role in the Serbs accepting our proposals. "The trust which they have in Russia and its peacekeeping forces." The chief of the Armed Forces General Staff told journalists that, in response to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's proposals, the Russian president asked the Federation Council to agree to allocate an additional troop contingent of 300 men to participate in the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The upper chamber of parliament took a positive view of this proposal 25 February. What is more, Col. Gen. Kolesnikov pointed out, the Federation Council instructed the country's government on the Russian Defense Ministry's submission to urgently resolve the question of a pay raise for the personnel of the Russian UN contingent in Yugoslavia. The Russian Defense Ministry in conjunction with the Russian Foreign Ministry has also been tasked with immediately formulating a system of social guarantees for the personnel of the "blue berets" involved in peacekeeping operations on Yugoslav territory. Col. Gen. Kolesnikov said in conclusion that Russia is starting to play a more active, autonomous role in settling the crisis in the Balkans, bolstering its diplomatic efforts by making a specific military and peacekeeping contribution. The statements, initiatives, and actions by the Russian political and military leadership and diplomats have once again proved that it is not strong-arm but political means of settling the Yugoslav conflict that are inexhaustible. And we will try to stick to them in the future. Col. Gen. Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne Troops, who returned from Belgrade 24 February as part of a government delegation, told journalists how Russia's proposed plan for settling the Bosnian crisis is being implemented. A key element in this plan was for Russian "blue helmets" to come to Sarajevo within a limited period. Despite the mountainous locality and the sudden snowfall, Col. Gen. Podkolzin said, a convoy of combat hardware with 400 Russian Airborne Troops led by Colonel Viktor Vorobyev arrived in Bosnia precisely on schedule. The local population -- not only the Serbs, but also the Croats and Muslims -- gave our Airborne Troops a cordial, enthusiastic reception like the frontline soldiers in victorious 1945. At present, journalists were told by the commander of the Airborne Troops, our "blue helmets" are performing a peacekeeping mission in the Bosnian capital's so-called buffer zone between the opposing sides -- the Serbs and Muslims -- they occupy 16 km of the front. They have also taken Sarajevo Airport under guard along with the French "blue helmets." With regard to the plan for our Airborne Troops' future stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Col. Gen. Podkolzin pointed out that they form the backbone of the UN 2d Russian battalion, which will be stationed in the Sarajevo region. As for the additional contingent of 300 men, whose posting to Bosnia-Herzegovina has been approved by the Federation Council, it will be sent in mid-March. Thus, the total number of Russian "blue helmets" on Yugoslav territory will shortly reach 1,500 officers, warrant officers, and contract troops, which, according to the commander of the Airborne Troops, will also help boost Russia's peacekeeping efforts in the Balkans. In response to your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent's question regarding guarantees of our soldiers' safety in Bosnia, where the 100,000-strong Muslim Army includes around 10,000 mojahedin who fought in Afghanistan, the commander of the Airborne Troops said that this was the main topic of conversation during his meeting with British General Rose, commander of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who gave assurances that all steps are currently being taken to ensure the safety of the "blue helmet" contingent, including the Russians. Other questions from journalists were also answered during the press conference.
