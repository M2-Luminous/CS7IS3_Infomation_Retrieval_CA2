[Ghawshah] Good evening. [Mu'addi] The PLO Executive Committee is holding intensive consultations and contacts. Has the Palestinian leadership reached a firm decision on the future of Israel-Palestinian negotiations? [Ghawshah] The Palestinian leadership held a meeting yesterday to deal with various developments. The meeting was also attended by the heads of the delegations to the negotiations in Taba, Paris, and Washington. The Executive Committee studied the positions that it received. In fact, the position we received from the Israeli Government and Rabin was disappointing. The Israeli Government's decisions were not up to the level of the incident and did not remove the obstacles to the peace process. The Executive Committee and the Palestinian leadership studied this issue, and they will follow up these various developments tonight. [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah: Will the Palestinian side respond to the U.S. call to hold bilateral meetings in Washington? [Ghawshah] This depends on what the negotiations will deal with. It also depends on whether there are new issues, and whether it is only a change in the venues of meetings and in the external appearance rather than the substance. There are many issues that must be discussed with the U.S. Administration in order to learn about the objective, level, and timing of such meetings. The PLO is thus ready, in principle, to participate in the negotiations. However, we believe that the issue is not whether to participate in negotiations and accept the U.S. invitation. The issue is at what level such negotiations will be held and what topics will be discussed. The Palestinian leadership will also discuss this issue in tonight's meeting. [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir: Your colleague, PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, today said the PLO will not resume negotiations unless the settlers are disarmed. Is this an official decision by the PLO leadership? [Ghawshah] This issue was also discussed. Several requests were proposed. We are of the view that disarming the settlers is a basic and necessary issue. The forces that maintain internal security and public order are regular forces, whether the Israeli Army troops or, when the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho is completed, the Palestinian security and police forces. Hence, we believe that keeping the settlers under arms is in violation of both the law and all agreements. This is a basic issue. We also believe that the real threats to security are in fact threats to Palestinian security. This is contrary to Prime Minister Rabin's allegations that Israel wants to guarantee its own security. Evidence has shown that the Palestinian people are the ones who need protection and security guarantees. It is not the first time that the Palestinians have been attacked by settlers, whether in the form of stopping traffic on roads or attacking defenseless citizens in their houses and cars. We see no logical explanation for the Israeli Government's position that permits extremist organizations to carry arms. These issues should be discussed, whether with the United States or other parties before finally deciding on whether to participate in the Washington negotiations. [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir: What are the PLO leadership's irreversible terms to resume the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations? [Ghawshah] The PLO leadership has proven its good intentions, demonstrated great flexibility, and made many concessions. It still demands that there should be a commitment to implementing the agreement and to the dates set. The only issue in the Declaration of Principles that needs no negotiations is the dates to begin and end the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Rabin made this a negotiable issue because it is not a sacred issue. What terms and issues are we talking about? We believe that the continuation of these policies by Rabin and his government will deprive the negotiations of their role and feasibility. The basic issue is that a real and serious change should be made in the Israeli Government's position on the peace process and on implementing the agreements. We also believe that foremost among these issues must be a clear Israeli position on the settlers and disarming them. Protection for the Palestinians must be secured and UN observers should be put in place in order to maintain Palestinian security and prevent encroachments on it, whether on the part of the settlers or through the methods used by the Israeli Army, which has killed or wounded dozens of our people's sons. At a time when the Palestinians are prevented from expressing their feelings or burying their martyrs, we see on television pictures of settlers wandering freely with their weapons. Thus, what negotiations are we talking about? We pose a basic question: What peace does Rabin want? Does he want peace that will guarantee security, stability, and prosperity for Israel, or does he wish to continue his policies that appease the Likud, the settlers, and others. This appeasement cannot be part of a peace that takes into account party, internal, and electoral considerations. [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, the last question is: Do you think that a meeting between Prime Minister Rabin and PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat could facilitate the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations? [Ghawshah] We believe that the first step should be serious and practical decisions by Rabin on the massacre and the savage crime perpetrated against our people's sons in the Ibrahimi Mosque, as well as on the acts of violence carried out by the Israeli military circles, which killed and wounded dozens of our people's sons. We believe that what will really facilitate the negotiations and any future meetings are effective measures taken by both the Israeli Government and Rabin in order to show real readiness for negotiations to achieve peace. Foremost among these measures is the disarming of the settlers and a clear announcement of commitment to implementing the agreement and its set dates. [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive Committee member, thank you very much. [Ghawshah] You are welcome.
