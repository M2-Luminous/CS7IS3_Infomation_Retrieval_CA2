These decrees allowed the Council of Ministers to promulgate the Law on Bank Debits, Law on Concessions for Construction and Maintenance of Public Works, and Law on Reforms of the Public Budget Law. Regarding the Law on Bank Debits, the only modification made to the original draft bill was that stock market operations will only be taxed for first operations and will maintain the 0.75 percent profitability rate. This law will go into effect on 2 May. The government hopes to collect 100 billion bolivares with its implementation. Regarding the Law on Concessions for Construction and Maintenance of Public Works, it is estimated its passage will promote the construction of public works, benefiting the community which will receive these new works and the state, which will not disburse any money for their construction. [Begin Guillermo Alvarez, Central Information Office minister, recording] The profit margins offered by the past law ranged from 40 to 45 percent of the investment, which was evidently not attractive for investors. Now we have placed the profit margin at 75 percent. It may even reach 90 percent eventually with the authorization of Congress. This is very important because it permits us to undertake works the government would have otherwise been unable to take on. [end recording] As was known previously, the Law on Reforms of the Public Budget Law only contemplates the modification in the presentation date, which for the first quarter of the year was moved to the first 15 days of the month of June.
