Hata and Kantor will meet for about two hours over breakfast to seek a breakthrough in resuming the failed trade "framework" talks and also discuss multilateral issues, the sources said. Relations between Tokyo and Washington have soured over trade following the collapse of the trade negotiations in February when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton met. Hata's trip to Marrakech will formally be decided in a buck-slip cabinet meeting Wednesday morning, they said. The foreign minister is to leave Japan on Wednesday noon for Morocco and return to Japan on Sunday, according to the sources. Hata was originally scheduled to leave Tuesday but was delayed due to the political turmoil following Hosokawa's sudden announcement last Friday that he will resign . Hata, also deputy prime minister, is tipped as a strong candidate as the successor to Hosokawa. On Monday, the Japanese Government sent Nobuo Matsunaga, the government representative for external economic affairs, to Marrakech in case Hata cannot attend the four-day GATT session that wraps up Friday. Also in Marrakech, Hata will meet Australian Trade Minister Bob Mcmullan and Leon Brittan, the European Union's trade commissioner, separately Thursday, the sources said. Hata may also meet U.S. Vice President Al Gore if possible, the sources said.
