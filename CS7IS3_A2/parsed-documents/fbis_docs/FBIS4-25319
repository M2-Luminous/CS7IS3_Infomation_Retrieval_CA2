According to the circular, it is stipulated that foreign businesses are allowed to invest in the construction of airports for civil purposes, including runways, taxi-ways, and parking aprons. In these jointly-funded projects, more than 51 percent of the authorized capital must be controlled by the Chinese side, and such posts as chairmen of the boards of directors and general managers must be taken up by Chinese personnel. The circular states that foreign enterprises engaging in the investment of airport flight area may, subject to approval, expand their scope of operation appropriately to include terminal buildings, cargo warehouses, ground services, aircraft maintenance, hotels, restaurants, food and fuel supplies, and other supporting projects of the airports. The air traffic control system, however, will still be monopolized by the state, and foreign investors are not allowed to be involved in either investment or operation. The joint investment by foreign businesses and Chinese aviation and transportation enterprises will be conducted by setting up Sino-foreign aviation and transportation enterprises in the form of joint ventures or cooperative entities. Foreign businesses may also buy shares of Chinese enterprises specializing in air shipment, or both sides may hold shares reciprocally. In these enterprises, shares held by foreigners should not exceed 35 percent of the authorized capital, and the rights of voting held by their representatives in the boards of directors should not exceed 25 percent. Apart from the stipulation that chairmanships of boards of directors and general managers are to be assumed by the Chinese side, other members of the management at and below deputy general manager level may, if necessary, be selected and appointed by the general managers. In terms of taxation, foreign-funded enterprises will enjoy the same treatment as similar domestic enterprises. Foreign airport authorities and aviation manufacturers are not permitted to set up aviation and transportation enterprises in China. Foreign investors planning to set up joint-funded aviation enterprises should obtain approval from CAAC first, which should be further examined and approved by relevant state departments. The operating activities of these enterprises should be put under control and supervision of CAAC and other administrative bodies of various regions.
