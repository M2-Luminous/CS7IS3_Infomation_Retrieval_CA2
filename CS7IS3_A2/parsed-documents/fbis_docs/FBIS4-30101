Slogans reading "Long live the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song!" and "Long live the glorious Workers Party of Korea [WPK]!" were hung in the hall. The meeting was attended by Comrade Pak Song-chol, member of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and vice president; Comrade Yang Hyong-sop, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly [SPA]; Chang Chol, vice premier of the Administration Council and minister of culture and art; Yu Mi-yong, chairman of the Central Committee of Chondoist Chongu Party; Kang Hyon-su, responsible secretary of Pyongyang municipal party and chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal People's Committee; Yom Tae-chun, chairman of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland [DFRF]; responsible functionaries from public organizations and personages concerned; functionaries from central organizations and workers from all walks of life in the city. The meeting began with the playing of the national anthem. Paek Nam-chun, director of the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF], made a commemorative speech. [Begin Paek recording] Comrades, today our people across the country are fully demonstrating chuche Korea's dignity and grand appearance by resolutely smashing antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers of the imperialists and international reactionaries with singlehearted unity with the party and the leader [suryong]. The ardent wish to achieve the reunification in the nineties with great national unity has been increasing with each passing day among fellow countrymen at home and abroad. Under this heartwarming circumstance, we are significantly marking the 21st anniversary of the publication of "Let Us Prevent a National Partition and Reunify the Country", an immortal work of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song. On this historic occasion, our people are recalling with deep emotion justness and invincible vitality of the five-point policies for national reunification put forward by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the sun of the nation and lodestar of national reunification. We are filled with a firm resolution to break through difficulties laid in the way of reunification with the strength of national unity and to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland by all means. The great leader's immortal work, "Let Us Prevent a National Partition and Reunify the Country", was published at a very grave time when confrontation between the lines of reunification and division was aggravated to an extreme pitch in our country owing to two Koreas policy of separatist forces at home and abroad and when the new danger of a permanent division was being created before the nation. As everyone knows, a dialogue between the North and the South was provided for the first time according to the policy for broad-range North-South negotiation elucidated by the great leader in his speech on 6 August 1971, and the 4 July joint statement, which assumed the principles of independence, peace and great national unity as its basic content, was published. Since that time, the spirit for national reunification has rapidly been enhanced among the South Korean people, together with all the Korean people, and the anticommunist confrontation line has begun to be shaken to its roots in South Korea. Embarrassed by this, the South Korean ruling bunch openly infringed upon the three principles for national reunification, which it pledged before the nation, at the instigation of outside forces, and fabricated the fascist Yusin system. In addition, the South Korean ruling bunch intensified North-South confrontation and advanced along the road of betrayal to pursue permanent division. Finally, on 23 June 1973, the South Korean ruling bunch went so far as to publish a special statement announcing the creation of two Koreas as its policy. The situation that prevailed at that time urgently demanded that active measures be worked out to prevent the danger of permanent division impending before the nation and to open the path for national reunification. On 23 June 1973, immediately after the South Korean ruling bunch published a special statement, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth the five-point policy of national reunification as a revolutionary measure decisively to smash the permanent nation-splitting moves of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges and open an epochal phase of national reunification. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Our proposal is to remove military confrontation and ease tension between the North and the South, bring about multilateral collaboration and interchange between the two parts, convene the great national congress composed of representatives of people of all levels and political parties and social organizations in the North and the South, institute the North-South confederation under the single name of the Confederal Republic of Koryo and enter the United Nations under that name. When this proposal for the country's reunification is put into effect, a great turning point will be brought about in accomplishing the historic cause of peaceful national reunification based on the principle of the North-South joint statement, as commonly desired by our people and the world's people. The five-point policy of national reunification laid down by the great leader was a patriotic reunification formula most correctly reflecting the unanimous aspirations and will of all the fellow countrymen who desired a peaceful reunification of the country and opposed a permanent division of the nation, and an immortal militant banner which set forth a broad vista and the way of national reunification and vigorously inspired all the people to the struggle to realize it. [applause] The policy for removing military confrontation and easing tension set forth by the great leader in his five-point policy for national reunification is a just policy which gave a clear answer to the most urgent and important question for removing misunderstanding and distrust between the North and the South, for achieving national reconciliation, and for achieving the nation's peaceful reunification. The proposal for realizing multilateral collaboration and interchange between the North and the South is a most reasonable plan enabling us to promote the unified development of the nation by linking severed ties of the nation. The proposal for convening the great national congress composed of representatives of people of all levels and political parties and social organizations between the North and the South, which the great leader put forward in his five-point policy for national reunification, is a chuche-oriented reunification policy which enables us to resolve the issue of national reunification in compliance with the will and demand of the nation through the nation's own strength by making the people from all walks of life in the North and the South broadly participate in accomplishing the cause of national reunification. In particular, the proposal for instituting the North-South confederation under the single name set forth by the great leader is a unique method for achieving national reunification most promptly and most reasonably without giving any disadvantage to either the North or the South under the condition in which different ideas and systems exist in the North and the South of our country. This proposal clearly reflects the consistent patriotic position of our party and the government of the Republic to achieve national reunification at an early date by ending confrontation between fellow countrymen and the division at any cost, based on the national unity between the North and the South. The five-point policy for national reunification put forward by the great leader is a most reasonable and realistic reunification policy that can be accepted by all the people who love the nation, and by the people who want national reunification, because of its thoroughgoing patriotic position, justness, and fairness that are reflected in all articles and clauses. The three principles of national reunification--the great common reunification program of the nation--are comprehensively embodied in the five-point policy of national reunification. The basic spirit contained in these principles is the firm reunification will and patriotic ideal to achieve the reunification into one Korea by opposing division. The five-point policy of national reunification also contains concrete measures and methods for expediting the independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland by preventing the nation's permanent division. The five-point policy is a declaration of one Korea that opened a bright future for resolving the reunification issue by giving a hard blow to the two-Koreas moves of the splittists at home and abroad, and is a great programmatic guideline of national reunification that intensively reflected the aspiration of the entire nation to reunification. Indeed, the five-point policy for national reunification is an immortal reunification program which can be put forward only by the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the peerless patriot, the sun of the nation, and the lodestar of national reunification, who has devoted his whole life to achieving the country's independence and the nation's grandeur and prosperity since he embarked on the road of revolution, taking upon himself the destiny of the country and the nation, and who is leading all of the people to the single road of national reunification, while feeling grieved over the nation's division more than anyone else. [applause] Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of our party and people, who has been carrying out great exploits for the cause of our revolution and the cause of national reunification, has wisely led the struggle to realize the five-point policy for national reunification put forward by the great leader. The dear comrade leader has not only vigorously pushed ahead with the work to explain and propagate the five-point policy for national reunification at home and abroad, but has also taken various epochal measures to realize this new peaceful reunification policy. The 59th expanded meeting of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, convened in accordance with the dear comrade leader's plan discussed the matter on convening a great national conference to be participated in by representatives of political parties and social organizations and representatives of all strata in the North, the South, and overseas and proposed, in the name of the political parties and social organization in the North, to the people of all strata, political parties, and social organizations in South Korea the convocation of a great national conference to consult and solve the question of national reunification, the utmost desire of the nation. Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader our party and the Government of the Republic vigorously struggled to thoroughly implement the five-point policy for national reunification and to open a new phase of national reunification with the independent strength of the nation. Thanks to the dear comrade leader's wise leadership in the struggle to implement the five-point policy for national reunification it was possible to impose big blows on the maneuvers for a permament division of the nation by splittists at home and abroad and to vigorously encourage and inspire the compatriots at home and abroad into the accomplishment of the cause of national reunification. At this significant meeting which marks the 21st anniversary of the publication of the great leader's historic speech, "Let us prevent national division and reunify the country," I respectfully extend utmost honor and warmest gratitude, along with the infinite reverence and burning loyalty of all of the Korean people, to the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the sun of the nation and the lodestar of national reunification, who is brilliantly elucidating the road ahead for national reunification with the rays of chuche, leading our people to the single road of victory and glory. [applause] [end recording] The reporter said that the past 20-odd years from the time when the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song declared the five-point policy for national reunification up to now were the 20-odd years of serious confrontation between the reunification forces and the splittist forces and the days of struggle during which the whole nation vigorously fought to repel the splittists' challenges and to achieve the cause of national reunification and revealed the criminal maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists, the South Korean puppets, and the Japanese reactionaries to block our national reunification. The reporter then said that the imperialist reactionaries who have forced the untold sufferings of division and misfortune upon our nation for a long time and are perpetrating the maneuvers to crush [apsal] the Republic under the pretext of our nonexistent nuclear issue, and the flunkeyist nation-sellers in South Korea who have followed the imperialist reactionaries, will not be able to escape the condemnation of all of the Korean people and continued: [Begin recording] Comrades: It is not allowable for our nation, who has been forced to endure the sufferings of division caused by outside forces for nearly half a century, to live in uneasiness, failing to achieve unity and reunification until today, exposed to the danger of an unpredictable nuclear war on top of the tragedy of national division. We should put an end to the division of the nation with the nation's united strength and achieve the country's reunification. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Reunifying the country by ending the history of division and confrontation for nearly half a century is the unanimous demand and will of the entire nation. To achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country it is imperative to achieve the great unity of the entire nation. Today, all of the Korean people in the North, the South, and overseas are faced with the heavy but honorable task of expediting the cause of the independent and peaceful reunification of the country with united the strength of the entire nation, by thoroughly implementing the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for national reunification laid down by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for national reunification laid down by the great leader is a most reasonable and realistic political program for national unity and a great charter of national reunification which can be acceptable to anyone who loves the country and the nation and who desire national reunification. [applause] Our nation's only way out under today's stern situation [chosondoen chunomhan chongsehaeso] is all fellow countrymen's strongly uniting under the uplifted banner of the 10-point program of the whole nation for national reunification. The people from all walks of life in South Korea and overseas compatriots must consider the 10-point program of the whole nation for national reunification to be the nation's common guideline and firm will and continuously and vigorously wage the struggle to implement this program. In compliance with the aspirations of the time and the demand of the people of the DPRK and the United States, the United States must no longer seek sanctions against us but come out, with a sincere attitude and position, to the DPRK-U.S. talks, which can peacefully resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Strong-arm measures or sanctions can in no way be a way to resolve the nuclear issue but will only bring a catastrophic situation [kanggwonina chejenun kyolko haengmunje haegyorui pangdoro toelsu opsumyo kugossun ojik pagukchogin satae manul chorae halppunimnida]. Even though our people hope for a fair solution to the nuclear problem and value peace and security in the country, they will not beg for this even at the expense of national dignity and independence. We believe the visit to Pyongyang by a former U.S. President a few days ago will produce an affirmative result. The Japanese reactionaries must renounce the hostile policy toward the Republic, a policy that they have pursued motivated by a foolish intention to realize their old dream of the greater East Asia prosperity sphere. The Japanese authorities must ponder over consequences from their maneuvers against the Republic and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, honestly apologize for all the crimes committed so far, and punish the criminals. Sanctions against us are immediately sanctions against the South and a declaration of war to the 70 million Koreans [urie taehan chejenun kot namedaehan chejeimyo chilchonman kyore-e taehan sonjon pogo imnida]. The South Korean authorities must renounce the policy of depending on outside force, take the stand of national independence, give up the policy of confrontation between the fellow countrymen, and seek national reconciliation and unity. It is our consistent position to meet with anyone--who truly wants the independent, peaceful reunification of the country from the stand of great national unity and national independence--and jointly seek the way of peace in the country and its peaceful reunification. The premier of the DPRK Administration Council, thinking it lucky that the South Korean side expressed its position to hold top-level talks with us, sent a message today upon authorization to the South Korean prime minister, a message that welcomes and agrees to the South side's proposal for holding a preliminary contact for the North-South top-level talks. I express support to it in the name of the participants in this report meeting, considering that it reflects our side's consistent position and policy to bring an end to North-South confrontation and open a new phase for national reunification independently and peacefully through top-level talks. [applause] The year 1995 is a meaningful year that marks the 50th anniversary of the fatherland's liberation and a historic year designated to be the starting year of our nation's reunification. We must make positive efforts to adorn 1995 as the year of national reunification at all costs. After strongly uniting, under the banner of the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation, all the compatriots at home and abroad must vigorously struggle to achieve reunification based on the most reasonable confederal system involving one nation and one state, two systems and two governments. The dear leader of our party and people Comrade Kim Chong-il is the symbol of socialism, our life and existence, and the destiny of the fatherland and the nation [uriui saengmyongigo saenghwarin, sahoejuuiui sangjing imyo chogukkwa minjogui unmyong isimnida]. All people in the northern half of the Republic must defend and glorify our-style socialism and hasten reunification, in the nineties, by cherishing deep in their hearts the belief of sure victory, that they always win only if there is the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, and continuously and highly displaying their enthusiasm and loyalty, which were more highly demonstrated on the 30th anniversary of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's start of work at the party Central Committee. All the workers must score great upsurges in all fronts of socialist economic construction in hearty response to our party's revolutionary economic strategies. No force in the world will be able to block the path of our people who, upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, are vigorously marching forward under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. [applause] Let us all vigorously struggle to hasten the complete victory of socialism and the fatherland's independent, peaceful reunification, after strongly uniting around the party and the leader [suryong]. [applause] [end recording] The report meeting ended with the chorus of the song "Korea Is One."
