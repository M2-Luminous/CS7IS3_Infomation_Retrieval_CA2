FR940523-0-00005 FR940523-0-00003 The rule describing procedures and practices for applying for and obtaining this grant assistance is already in place under the Rural Business Enterprise Grant program. This rule simply adds education and training of adult students as an eligible grant purpose under the program. Requiring prior notice and comment would result in substantial delays in making the use of these grant funds available to the public for education purposes. Public controversy over adding this eligible use of grant funds is unlikely. The Agency, however, is also providing for public comment so that, in the event that members of the public do wish to suggest alternative rule provisions or courses of action in implementing this program, they will have an opportunity to give RDA the benefit of their views in the near future. In the event that public comments are received, the Department will consider them, and issue such amendments to those rules as may be appropriate, as quickly as possible.
