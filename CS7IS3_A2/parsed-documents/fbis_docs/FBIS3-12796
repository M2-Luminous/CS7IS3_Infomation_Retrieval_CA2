In a statement to MENA's Damascus correspondent, Qaddumi said that it is necessary to expedite the withdrawal from the Palestinian territories under the commitment made by Israel and witnessed by the United States on 13 September 1993. Qaddumi added that it is also necessary to disarm the settlers and remove the political settlements that Rabin, when he became prime minister, said were dispensable. Qaddumi, who is visiting Syria, affirmed that recent events have proven that the Zionist movement is a racist movement. He announced that the PLO will ask the United Nations to revive its resolution equating Zionism with racism, which the United States has tried to delete from UN records. Qaddumi emphasized the need to create secure areas at friction points in the occupied Arab territories, notably in Jerusalem, Hebron, and Bethlehem. He urged the international community to make serious efforts to encourage the peace process by adopting prompt decisions to dispatch international forces to protect the Palestinians living under occupation and to pressure Israel to make an immediate withdrawal. He said Jerusalem, Hebron, and Bethlehem must be placed under international protection until the final phase of the political settlement arrives. Qaddumi said this final phase must come soon and that there is no need for a transitional period. He pointed out that such prompt measures will encourage Palestinian-Israeli coexistence and warned that delay might inflame the region and pose a threat to security and peace. Qaddumi urged the United States, in its capacity as peace sponsor, to shoulder a great responsibility and take concrete steps to give impetus to the peace operations, not merely issue an invitation for negotiations and seek to defuse international anger by such an invitation. Qaddumi concluded his remarks by saying that the United States must adopt concrete measures, via the United Nations, to provide the necessary protection for the Palestinians and halt the Israeli settlers' criminal actions. He called for pressure on Israel to make it disarm the settlers and remove the political settlements.
