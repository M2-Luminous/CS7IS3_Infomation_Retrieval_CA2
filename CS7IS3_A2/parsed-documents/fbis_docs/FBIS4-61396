The letter circulated today highlights the party's achievements and in particular, the fact that the majority of citizens had voted for the Constitution only thanks to active support given to the Constitution by the LDP. The letter contains complaints over the fact that "the LDP leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had not been given the right to form a new government and was not even received by the president after the elections." Among other things, the LDP high council complains that the leader of the victorious party was not admitted to the mass media, that there is not a single minister from the LDP in the government and that "both the party and its leader are being outrageously attacked and unscrupulously slandered." The LDP leadership expressed "surprise" at an interview given by Boris Yeltsin to the FIGARO newspaper in which Yeltsin "indirectly accused the party and its leaders of advocating fascism."
