SUMMARY: The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared for a proposed highway project in Sumter County, Alabama. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Joe D. Wilkerson, Division Administrator, Federal Highway Administration, 500 Eastern Boulevard, suite 200, Montgomery, Alabama 36117&hyph;2018, Telephone (205) 223&hyph;7370. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FHWA, in cooperation with the Alabama Department of Transportation, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve a segment of U.S. Highway 80 in Sumter County, Alabama. The improvements begin near the Alabama/Mississippi State Line at an existing four-lane road and extend approximately 33 kilometers (20.5 miles) to Alabama State Route (SR) 28 west of the Tombigbee River. U.S. 80 east of SR 28 is a two-lane facility on existing four lane right-of-way. The improvements to the travel corridor are considered necessary to provide for the existing and projected traffic demand. The type of roadway being considered is a four-lane controlled access freeway. Alternatives under consideration include: (1) Alternate route locations, (2) taking no action, and (3) postponing the action. Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have an interest in this proposal. A scoping meeting will be held in the Hightower Community Center, 615 Second Avenue, York, Alabama. The program will begin at 1:30 p.m. Central Standard Time on Thursday, March 3, 1994. A public involvement meeting will follow the scoping meeting. In addition, a public hearing will also be held. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the meetings and hearings. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearings. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.
