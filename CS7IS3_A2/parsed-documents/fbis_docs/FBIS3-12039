The action plan is one of the most important issues discussed during the conference, which opened on 21 March in Buenos Aires. It includes three great chapters: a cooperation program between the most developed members of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), an action plan for the Telecommunications Development Office (BDT), and a special program for the lesser-developed countries. The initial program contains seven clauses: politics, strategies and financing; action and development of human resources; development plans, network and frequency management planning; integrated rural development; radio broadcasting; information services; and the application of new technologies for development. These clauses are in the second chapter, in addition to others which mainly refer to coordinated activities of regional and world interest for assisting individual countries. It is expected that they will be complemented with multilateral and bilateral projects carried out and supported by the BDT and its co-participants in development. The first chapter deals with upcoming development conferences. There will be a world conference in 1998 with at least two regional meetings before then. A decision was also made to create two commissions to study the development of telecommunications. The third chapter contains a special program for lesser-developed countries to be financed with resources of the ITU, which specifies that both developing and developed countries will benefit from the programs. The BDT action plan emphasizes the need to develop telematics (technology of telecommunications and informatics) and electronic networks to support the remaining proposed programs. It also features a program to handle the specific needs of those countries with the lowest incomes and levels of services. It is expected that at least 70 percent of the funds of the ITU, a specialized UN organization, will be used to support activities for lesser-developed countries. The second chapter of the plan, the largest and most specific, emphasizes a proposal to "plan frequency management networks" and to help the development of communications infrastructure in developed countries. Regarding "integrated rural development," the project seeks to extend telecommunications with remote rural communities in developing countries to cover rural activities such as agriculture, education, transportation, and health. The second chapter also proposes a project for "the development of telematics and electrical networks" connected in the future by "electronic highways" which will allow developing countries access to information, education, and training.
