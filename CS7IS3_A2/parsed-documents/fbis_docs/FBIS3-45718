Qiao's first trip to Germany is regarded as a major event in the history of Sino-German ties. Sources from the NPC described the tour as "successful" and said that "anticipated results have been achieved during the visit." The visit has promoted mutual understanding and friendship, and expanded bilateral cooperation, exchanges between the two parliaments in particular, the sources said. The visit shows that the two sides attach great importance to further enhancing bilateral ties and have made earnest efforts to this end. The economies of the two countries are mutually complementary. So there exists a sound basis for developing bilateral cooperation. The situation over the past three years has demonstrated that the evaluation of bilateral ties that Qiao has made is completely correct. Qiao said during the visit that the two sides should treat and handle their mutual relations from a strategic viewpoint. Meanwhile, Qiao met with many German entrepreneurs, spent hours touring the Mercedes-Benz bodyshell and assembly plant in Sindelfingen, and discussed with the leaders of the Siemens Company future cooperation between the two sides. While visiting the Sindelfingen plant, Qiao was informed about the passenger car and commercial vehicle ranges as well as the Daimler-Benz group's current projects in China. Edzard Reuter, chairman of the Daimler-Benz AG, was confident in Sindelfingen's economic cooperation with China. "We are determined to reinforce our activity in this region and to continuously maintain and extend our relations with our partners," he noted. Reuter said that more contracts will be concluded with China and more investments made in that country in addition to the current and planned major projects such as the production of buses, equipping the metro systems in Shanghai and Guangzhou, delivering 23 Airbus planes as well as developing and producing telecommunication satellites. Qiao said he has full confidence in such cooperation.
