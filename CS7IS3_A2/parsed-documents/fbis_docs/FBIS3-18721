The supporters of the two government parties have about as much in common as two partners in a marriage that failed. Most FDP voters think more highly of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] than the CDU/CSU, more highly of Scharping than Kohl, and they want another coalition -- one with the SPD rather than the CDU/CSU. This is the result of a survey carried out by the Bielefeld Emnid-Institute for DER SPIEGEL. Between 25 January and 16 February, a total of 2,500 people were interviewed and another 1,000 between 21 and 23 February, a sample that is representative for the 60 million federal citizens who are entitled to vote. The objective of the survey was to clarify before the series of elections, due to open next Sunday [13 March] in Lower Saxony, what the Germans thought of the parties and what the parties's chances were eight months before the 16 October Bundestag election. The CDU/CSU voters are in a depressive mood. Only 55 percent believe that Kohl and the coalition will win the fall election. In April 1990, eight months before the last Bundestag election, it was 94 percent. At the moment, things look rather gloomy for the CDU/CSU. It is supported only by 35 percent of the electorate, less than in any Bundestag election since 1953. The other figures: SPD, 39 percent; FDP and Alliance 90/Greens, 8 percent each; the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS], 4 percent; Republikaner and Instead Party, 3 percent each. There are fluctuations, but in the weekly Emnid surveys, the SPD has constantly been stronger than the CDU/CSU and the FDP and Greens have always been above 5 percent, while the Republikaner and the PDS almost always, and the Instead Party always remained below 5 percent. The figures for the various parties issued by the institutes are more or less identical, something Kohl refuses to believe ("The differences between the institutes have meanwhile become bizarre"). Only those provided by Forsa (Dortmund) are significantly different, attributing to the SPD an unrealistic 43-46 percent. The big parties have become smaller. No longer 91.2 percent as in their best days (Bundestag election 1976), but only 74 percent would opt for one of them at the moment. While in the past it was often less than 1 percent, it is now 10 percent that intend to vote for other but the established parties, which meanwhile also include the Greens. Yet, the parties can be sure of their voters less than ever. The share of "convinced supporters" has fallen from 35 to 16 percent. No longer 73 but only 45 percent know exactly what party they will support in the Bundestag election. [passage omitted]
