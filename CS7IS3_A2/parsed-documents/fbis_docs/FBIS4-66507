Checks and "roundups" have become more frequent, and residents have the impression that the state is trying to regain control. Is Blida a unique city in Algeria? Here is a city, formerly known for its tolerance, which is a victim of intolerance and fundamentalism. Here is a city that was one of the beacons of nationalism and today is home to certain huge fortunes that have become the main sources financing terrorism. To walk around Blida today is to be plunged into a nightmare. The "city of the roses" is no longer what it once was. Anguish and fear can be read on people's faces. For the past several months in this city, terrorists have been imposing their law as nowhere else, taking advantage of a certain passivity on the part of residents, even of complicity by some of them. "Habitual criminals," in the expression used by someone who knows the life of the city well, have decided that women must wear the veil so the women of Blida, with some rare exceptions, obey. It is true that they merely wear a scarf over their heads without adding the other "ingredients" that would make "Islamic women" of them. This is not the first time Blida has succumbed to the fundamentalists' blackmail. For the past month and a half, the city has been without newspapers because a letter sent from heaven only knows where forbade tobacconists from selling newspapers. These tobacconists have not even tried to fight back and obeyed this "order" with extraordinary ease. The Moorish baths are, for the most part, closed to women because, in the name of Islam, certain individuals decided that they do not have the right to use them. Nor have women's hairdressers escaped this exaggerated machismo on the part of the fundamentalists. All of them closed then suddenly reopened, letting people wonder about the fundamentalists' sudden "change of heart." In Blida meat costs 350 Algerian dinars [DA] whereas everywhere [else] the armed groups have tried to impose a price of DA150 Algerian, unsuccessfully, it needs to be mentioned. Is this because certain wholesale meat dealers in the area, people wondered, supply funds for terrorism and because the terrorists thus cannot saw off the branch of the tree on which they are sitting? "Blida is on its knees; the city has been taken hostage by the terrorists," a leading figure in the city told us angrily. The city is in the grip of criminal groups. These past few months the presence of security forces was weak. However, Blida has the reputation of being a garrison city. Has the state surrendered in the face of the terror imposed by these adventurers? Why is there this absence of reaction on the part of the civilian authorities and the military command in charge of the area? The latter had every reason to make a show of strength especially inasmuch as, according to good sources, ambushes were sprung on military convoys traveling the road between Chrea and Blida, a road that has come under the absolute control of the fundamentalists for some time. Is it because these responsibilities were not assumed in a normal fashion? According to our sources, certain high-level officials responsible for running the city do not even live there and barely spend three days out of seven there. This slackening off has resulted in grumblings. There has even been talk of grousing among officers who do not understand why there is no response when the state has the means to liquidate the terrorist phenomenon.
