FR941110-0-00188 FR941110-0-00016 A State can use its licensure civil money penalty system for Medicaid purposes when it has demonstrated its effectiveness in accordance with §488.406. These provisions state that alternative State remedies for facilities participating in Medicaid may be imposed if the State demonstrates to HCFA's satisfaction that the alternative remedies are as effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies as the HCFA remedies. Comment: A few commenters recommended that civil money penalties be significantly reduced, because if a facility receives a civil money penalty of $5,000 or more, that facility loses its ability to train nurse aides. Response: As stated above, the $10,000 per day civil money penalty limit is established in the Act. While the Act gives the State and the Secretary the discretion to impose a penalty as high as the limit, we will not, as a matter of policy, lower civil money penalty amounts in specific cases to preclude facilities from losing their ability to train nurse aides. If a civil money penalty of $5,000 or more is imposed on a facility, it is indicative of the fact that an egregious situation of immediate jeopardy exists. In this case, we believe the facility's ability to continue to train nurse aides is compromised and the facility should lose approval of its nurse aide training and competency evaluation program. However, as we have already stated, we anticipate that the higher penalties will seldom be imposed, as situations involving immediate jeopardy occur far less frequently than those with no immediate jeopardy. Comment: One commenter recommended revising proposed §488.230(f)(2) to specify that a civil money penalty may not be one of the alternative remedies imposed when a facility does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of payment and HCFA will or the State must terminate a provider's agreement. Also, the commenter recommended that neither HCFA nor the State may impose more than four penalties against a facility on the basis of a single survey and the maximum total penalty amount that may be imposed against a facility during any twelve-month period is five hundred dollars per licensed or certified bed. Response: The Act does not preclude the imposition of a civil money penalty remedy as an enforcement option when the facility does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of payment or is terminated. In fact, section 1919(h)(7) of the Act discusses the special rules applicable when other remedies additional or alternative to termination are imposed. Concerning the specified amount of the penalty that can be imposed per licensed or certified bed during a specific time period, the Act does not specify such a limitation, and utilizing these limitations would unnecessarily restrict the authority of the Secretary and the State to tailor a civil money penalty remedy to the specific situation of noncompliance. However, the Act does set dollar limitations for each day of noncompliance. Therefore, the Act contemplates that all deficiencies will be aggregated for the purposes of determining the number of days of noncompliance (as opposed to the number of deficiencies). Comment: A few commenters requested that we clarify if survey agencies may exceed the specified penalty ranges when a facility alleges compliance but a revisit by HCFA or the State finds noncompliance. One commenter recommended that the penalty be doubled in this situation even if it exceeds the penalty limit. Another commenter suggested replacing may with shall at proposed §488.230(f)(3) so that this section reads, ``HCFA or the State shall increase the daily penalty if the facility alleges compliance *␣*␣*.'' One commenter disagreed with §488.230(f)(3) concerning HCFA's or the State's ability to increase the daily penalty if the facility alleges compliance but a revisit finds noncompliance. The commenter recommended including an objective and quantifiable basis for increasing such penalties or deleting this regulatory provision. Another commenter suggested increasing the civil money penalty when a facility alleges completion of its plan of correction, but a revisit finds the facility has not completed its plan. Response: As noted above, we are revising redesignated §488.438 to provide that a civil money penalty would be decreased to the lower range of penalty amounts if a revisit determines that the immediate jeopardy is removed but the noncompliance continues. However, if the noncompliance, that continues constitutes repeated deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of requirements, the civil money penalty would be increased, as specified in sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(A) and (h)(3)(C) of the Act. A civil money penalty could be increased to the upper range of penalty amounts if deficiencies for which a lower level penalty amount was imposed have become sufficiently serious to pose immediate jeopardy. We are also revising §488.438 to provide that civil money penalties are increased, even if a new penalty amount exceeds the range for nonimmediate jeopardy, when deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of requirements for which a civil money penalty was imposed are repeated. We cannot accept the suggestion to increase a civil money penalty if a facility does not follow its plan of correction. When a remedy is lifted for a facility, it is based on that facility's substantial compliance with the requirements, not on the facility's adherence to its plan of correction. The health or safety of a resident could be jeopardized by a situation in which a plan of correction was followed but the facility was still not in substantial compliance with the participation requirements.
