And immediately the debate on social problems -- formulas for creating new jobs, systems for making both hiring and firing more flexible, suggestions for reintroducing and increasing the wage limits, which disappeared 25 years ago -- has been rekindled. "We will judge the government on the facts," Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] and the trade unions have repeated so far. Now that the scenarios are becoming clear, we will attempt to analyze them with Confindustria Director General Innocenzo Cipolletta. [Siva] With regard to the Berlusconi government, Confindustria has moved from a position that was so independent as to be interpreted as diffident to "confident expectation." Have you changed ideas? [Cipolletta] No. We remain convinced that we made the right choice in insisting on the association's independence. But I am not slow to admit that we have had certain difficulties in communicating effectively the meaning of this line. The country has a history of collateralism which has given us the habit of interpreting every taking of a position as a tactic. Moreover, in a substantially bipolar political situation, a Confindustria which is independent from the majority line-up has automatically been seen as tipping in favor of the opposition line-up. [Siva] Hence the story of an old grudge between [Confindustria] Chairman Abete and [Prime Minister] Berlusconi is not true? [Cipolletta] No grudge. Even if a few years ago, when Confindustria sounded the alarm on the perverse effects of the escalator clause, Berlusconi took a different position, considering as negative any measure which could depress consumption. But today I am convinced that our independence is an advantage which also strengthens the government's independence vis-a-vis Confindustria. [Siva] Will it be easier or more difficult to hold a dialogue with new Labor Minister Mastella and new Industry Minister Gnutti? [Cipolletta] It is a positive fact that they belong to a line-up which has based its program on principles inspired by liberalism: fewer shackles on corporations' activities in the labor market; less state presence in the economy. This is a philosophy which we share. And we believe that from now on there will be no alibis for not applying any of the liberal choices for which the electorate voted in the present majority. [Siva] What do you think of the scant enthusiasm with which various government exponents judge the past cooperation between trade unions and enterprises? [Cipolletta] The cooperation policy since the second half of the 1970's was essential in providing weak governments with a sufficiently broad basis of consensus in Parliament. Today, with the new parliamentary system, the government is not forced to share its choices. This means that the method of cooperation with the social partners will have to be based essentially on mutual information: The government will consult us and will then have to make its own decisions. [Siva] When disputes come to a head, however, recourse to the government makes it easy for you and the trade unions. Perhaps in order to obtain an avalanche of early retirements. [Cipolletta] I do not deny that it has made it easy for everyone. However, I would say that today many company crises have been resolved or are in the process of being solved, and that the social partners are more mature. If I could give a word of advice to the government, it would be to send out a message of confidence specifically on the maturity of companies and trade unions, beginning by saying that they need to resolve the problems on their own. If any of us thinks that they can always count on an understanding government, no one will devise solutions. [Siva] Renewal of public and private contracts, the labor and job markets, privatizations. Which of these problems needs to be solved most urgently? [Cipolletta] Privatizations. In recent months this process has been held up by obstacles of an ideological nature, either in the name of the defense of national interests, or in the name of industrial democracy, which in fact reveal the rejection of market rules. As to the renewal of labor contracts, the most difficult are those in the public sector, which are a true test of the government's desire for innovation. I would hope that the trade unions realize, after 40 years of protectionism, that if public workers are given increases, the administration will have to fire people. If then the trade unions decide to go into battle, with agitation in the public services, the risk for the country is high. [Siva] And the renewal of private sector contracts? [Cipolletta] In many sectors where exports are doing well, there will be room for a salaries policy. [Siva] Do you believe that increasing the number of jobs by 1 million in a couple of years is credible? [Cipolletta] According to Confindustria's estimates, a 1.6 percent increase in GDP in 1994, 2.8 percent in 1995, and 3.4 percent in 1996 could create around 700,000 new jobs. But the forecasts can also be higher, within a short time period, if, alongside the recovery of the economy, rules are enacted which make the labor market more flexible. If companies can hire people without the requirement to hold labor in any event, even when faced with a hole in the market, their readiness to increase employment will be even greater.
