FR941028-0-00084 FR941028-0-00009 Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of final §773.25, with respect to information shown on AVS relating to the status of a violation and with respect to ownership or control information which has not been entered into AVS by a State, the authority of a State regulatory authority will be subject to OSM's program oversight authority under 30 CFR parts 733, 842, and 843. OSM relies primarily upon the States to determine whether State violations have been abated or not. SMCRA section 510(c) explicitly states that an applicant must demonstrate that any current violation ``has been corrected or is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, department, or agency which has jurisdiction over such violation *␣*␣*'' See also 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1). Further, where State ownership or control information has not yet become part of AVS, the information has not yet entered the Federal information stream and has not yet become OSM's immediate responsibility. Such information is, in effect, still the primary responsibility of the State regulatory authority and potentially subject to correction through procedures of the State regulatory program. If correct information fails to enter the AVS, that may represent a weakness of the regulatory authority's decisionmaking process. Accordingly, that process may require review. With respect to the State's decisionmaking process, principles of primacy require that OSM review State actions in these matters in accordance with OSM's program oversight under parts 733, 842, and 843. In the exercise of program oversight however, it is also probable that OSM would review particular decisions with a view to determining whether the State regulatory authority complied with the provisions of its approved program. Accordingly, in the event that a State determines not to enter an ownership or control link into AVS, OSM will review such decision when it has reason to believe, through information provided in a citizen's complaint or otherwise, that the State's ownership or control decision is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion under the State program. In final §773.25, OSM has deleted language contained in the proposed rule which would have provided that when OSM disagreed with the decisions of State regulatory authorities, OSM would take action, as appropriate, under §843.24, oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership or control or the status of violations. This language has been deleted for two reasons. First, the proposed language was redundant. Paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of final §773.25 already provides that State regulatory authorities' decisions are subject to OSM's oversight under parts 733, 842, and 843 of 30 CFR. As a section of part 843, the provisions of final §843.24 would thus be applicable under appropriate circumstances. Further, the agency was concerned that additional language specifically requiring OSM to take action under final §843.24 could somehow be construed as a limiting factor on OSM's authority to take action under parts 733 or 842 or under other sections of part 843 as provided by previous paragraph (b)(3)(ii) or 773.25. Paragraph (c) of final §773.25 establishes evidentiary standards applicable to the formal and informal review of ownership or control links and the status of violations. The provisions of the final section are substantively similar to the provisions of the comparable provisions of the proposed rule. Certain minor changes described below have been made to the proposal. Paragraph (c)(1) of final §773.25 provides that in any formal or informal review of an ownership or control link or of the status of a violation covered by a violation notice, the agency responsible for making a decision is required to first make a prima facie determination or showing that the link exists, existed during the relevant period, and/or that the violation remains outstanding. The language ``existed during the relevant period'' has been added to the final rule to clarify that, even when a person is not a current owner or controller of a surface coal mining operation, a previous ownership or control link to that operation may be the basis for permit denial where the surface coal mining operation has an outstanding violation and that violation had its inception during the previous period of ownership or control. The requirement of a prima facie determination or prima facie showing is satisfied by evidence presented establishing a presumption of ownership or control. A prima facie determination is made when the agency is reviewing the evidence itself, in an informal process; a prima facie showing is made when the agency's determination is the subject of a formal administrative or judicial review process. When the agency makes such a determination or showing, the person seeking to challenge the link or the status of the violation than has the burden of proving the necessary elements of his or her challenge to the link or to the status of the violation by a preponderance of the evidence.
