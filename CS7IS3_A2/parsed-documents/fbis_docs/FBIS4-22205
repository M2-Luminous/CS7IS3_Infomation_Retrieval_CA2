Col. Nykyfor Lysytsya, special correspondent of NARODNA ARMIYA: "Apropos the Results of the Academic Year. The Word `Flier' Comes From the Term `To Fly'"] [Text] There are lately more and more officers who have only rarely lifted their airplanes into the skies during the past academic year. The 14th Air Army alone numbers 62 such pilots. An additional 74 young pilots have each spent only five to six hours in the air. The average flight time among the air fighters amounts to a little over 20 hours each. Much has already been said about this state of affairs. Let me, therefore, confine myself to noting that the main reason for this is a lack of fuel. The so-called rotation of flight personnel -- in other words, transferring officers from one unit to another -- has also played a negative role in this. The situation is difficult. What is the solution? After all, we do not anticipate a significant improvement in the provision of material-technical supplies for flights in the coming academic year. These issues have been raised on many occasions at various conferences, seminars, and meetings in the air army, which is under the command of Lt. Gen. Viktor Lyashenko. Working together, they arrived at certain conclusions and drew up some specific recommendations. To begin with, they decided to ensure that the best trained specialists --the airmen first class and the airmen-snipers -- maintain their proficiency level. This solution is quite justified. The combat capability and combat readiness of the air units and subunits depend on these people. As a rule, they can also serve as instructors, as so-called auxiliary instructors, for those who care about their professional training. In addition, an airman first class needs significantly fewer hours in the air to maintain his skills than an airman second class, and fewer still than an airman third class. This also means that they use much less airplane fuel, which is in short supply. Hence, the main combat crews on airplanes and helicopters are composed, as a rule, of airmen with the highest qualification. They fly more flights. And they are first to be issued fuel. That is how things were done this year. But it will be necessary to abandon this principle next year. First, the number of airmen first class is growing smaller -- many are being discharged into the reserves. Some are losing their ranking because of other objective reasons. Second, a large gap is developing between the different strata of flight personnel. Those who were ranked second and third class are now lagging behind and losing their qualification. Metaphorically speaking, the forest is being left without new growth, and this will inevitably produce negative results. That is why they decided to include airmen second class and even airmen third class in the main fighter crews -- to enable them to fly and improve their skills. But they will select only promising officers for this, born aviators, as they say, whom a minimum number of flight hours will suffice not only to maintain their qualification, but also to raise it. And what will happen to those who are not included in the main combat crews? This year they were assigned to the training regiments, where flights are conducted on L-39's. This, at least, allowed them to retain the level of airman second or third class. They plan to continue this practice during the next academic year as well. However, the leadership of the Air Force needs to take the necessary steps to organize this form of additional training at the proper level. There were times when airmen who had been assigned to fly were ignored by practically everybody. As a result, the issue of raising qualifications did not arise, even though considerable sums of money were spent. Today, we cannot afford not to think and not to be concerned about the future of military aviation. And this future lies with the lieutenants raduating this year from military schools. They do not yet have a class qualification. They also have much less flight experience. Suffice it to say that their graduation from school was postponed for a month because of a shortage of fuel for scheduled training. The regiments to which they have been assigned are also hard up for airplane fuel. The lieutenants cannot expect to make solo flights in the cabins of fighter planes in the near future. Consequently, the leadership of the air army proposed to gather all the young pilots into one training regiment, assign experienced instructors to this unit, and organize further training for these airmen. This will enable them to raise their qualification to airman third class. Then, if they are not assigned to the main combat crews, it will be possible to maintain them as a reserve of class specialists [klasni spetsialisty]. It is essential that the proposals put foward above find official support from the Ministry of Defense. The creation of a training regiment composed of lieutenants and other organizational measures deserve serious attention, as well as the allocation of funds. In the end, these costs will inevitably prove to have been justified. After all, this is a matter of investing funds in a cause that is vital to the state.
