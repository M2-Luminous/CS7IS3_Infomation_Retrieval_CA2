FR940407-0-00020 FR940407-0-00004 In this note, Utah suspended its definition of ``affected area'' insofar as it excluded roads that were included in the definition of ``coal mining and reclamation operations'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200. This is consistent with the November 20, 1986, partial suspension of the Federal definition of ``affected area'' (51 FR 41960). A difference between Utah's proposed definition of ``affected area'' and its Federal regulatory counterpart is that Utah's proposed definition of ``affected area'' uses the term ``coal mining and reclamation operations, '' while the Federal definition of ``affected area'' uses the term ``surface coal mining and reclamation operations.'' This difference, however, is not substantive. The Utah regulatory term ``coal mining and reclamation operations,'' as defined at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200, is substantively identical to the Federal regulatory term ``surface coal mining operations,'' as defined at 30 CFR 700.5. In addition, the Utah regulatory term ``coal mining and reclamation operations'' specifically incorporates the term ``surface coal mining and reclamation operations,'' which is defined at Utah Code Annotated (U.C.A.) 40&hyph;10&hyph;3(17). The Utah statutory definition of ``surface coal mining and reclamation operations'' is substantively identical to the corresponding Federal statutory definition of ``surface coal mining and reclamation operations'' at section 701(27) of SMCRA and the Federal regulatory definition of that term at 30 CFR 700.5. Furthermore, the term ``coal mining and reclamation operations'' is used throughout Utah's regulations at Utah Admin. R. 645, which implement the provisions of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act (the State Act) at Title 40, Chapter 10, of the U.C.A. Thus, the use of the term ``coal mining and reclamation operations'' in Utah's proposed definition of ``affected area'' is both consistent with Utah's regulations at Utah Admin. R. 645 and is consistent with and no less effective than the term ``surface coal mining and reclamation operations,'' as used in the Federal definition of ``affected area.'' For the reasons stated above, the Director approves Utah's proposed amendment to the term ``affected area'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200. 2. Definition of ``Road'' The only difference between Utah's proposed definition of ``road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200 and the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5 is that Utah uses the term ``coal mining and reclamation operations'' in its definition, while the Federal definition of ``road'' uses the term ``surface coal mining and reclamation operations.'' As discussed in finding No. III.C.1. above, this difference is not substantive. Thus, Utah's use of the term ``coal mining and reclamation operations'' in its proposed definition of ``road'' is consistent with and no less effective than the Federal definition of ``road.'' In addition, as was discussed in item No. III.A. above, Utah agreed, as part of the September 4, 1992, agreement (provision I.2.a.), to conform the withdrawal of its supplemental policy statement. By letter dated June 10, 1992, Utah notified OSM that the Board of Oil, Gas and Mining did, in fact, withdraw the supplemental policy statement, effective December 5, 1991 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;771). Accordingly, the Director approves Utah's proposed amendment to the term ``road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200, accepts Utah's withdrawal of the supplemental policy statement, and removes the required amendments codified at 30 CFR 944.16(n)(1) and (2). 3. Definition of ``Public Road'' Utah's proposed definition of ``public road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200, among other things, adds language that limits the use of this term to the purposes of parts Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;103&hyph;200, 645&hyph;301&hyph;521.123, and 645&hyph;301&hyph;521.133. These parts of the Utah program contain rules for designating lands unsuitable for coal mining and reclamation operations. Thus, Utah's proposed definition of ``public road'' is applicable only to the Utah rules for designating lands unsuitable for such mining. This limitation is consistent with the Federal definition of ``public road'' at 30 CFR 761.5, which applies only in the limited context of areas designated by Act of Congress as being unsuitable for surface coal mining operations (56 FR 58846, 58849, November 22, 1991). Thus, Utah's proposed addition of the above-referenced language to its definition of ``public road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200 is consistent with and no less effective than the Federal definition of ``public road'' at 30 CFR 761.5. The Director approves Utah's proposed amendment to the term ``public road'' and removes the required amendment at 30 CFR 944.16(o).
