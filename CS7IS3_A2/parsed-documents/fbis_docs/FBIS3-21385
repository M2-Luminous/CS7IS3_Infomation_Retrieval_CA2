The Germans have also reassured the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, during his just-concluded visit to Germany of clear political support for German programmes aimed at expanding Indo-German economic cooperation. The German Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, has conveyed his intention to nominate one of his ministerial-level colleagues to monitor the progress of economic cooperation and to remove obstacles, if any, in the process. Both the countries have also agreed to synchronise their efforts for further democratisation of the United Nations, to reflect the existing ground realities, including expansion of the Security Council by increasing the number of permanent members with veto. Both India and Germany are keen for a place in the extended Security Council with veto power. In the next few months three high-level delegations from Germany, each headed by a minister such as the Minister for Development, Minister for Economic Cooperation and Foreign Minister are slated to visit India to provide fresh impetus to growing Indo-German cooperation in various fields. According to official sources in the External Affairs Ministry, in the context of German view of playing an important role in world affairs, Bonn has formulated a priority programme, "Asia concept policy," for opening itself up towards "high growth" Asian countries like Japan, China and India. The market in Russia and Europe was not considered to be sufficient to meet the growing German capabilities in fields like science, technology, economic, investment abroad. These sources are quite optimistic that in the near future large-scale German investments could be expected in various spheres of cooperative economic interaction for mutual benefit and advantage, though it is "very difficult to quantify" the outcome of the visit so early. However, Mr Rao himself said that he was satisfied with the outcome of his German visit. These sources further pointed out that the reception the Prime Minister received in Germany was much warmer and greater than the one he received during his first visit in September 1991. These sources asserted that during the Prime Minister's talks with German leaders at no point the issue of nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) figured. Thus a report circulated by some news agency to say that the issue figured during the talks was totally baseless. The sources further stated that the German official sources also denied having given any such briefing at all.
