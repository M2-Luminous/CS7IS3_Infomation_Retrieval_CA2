[Abdullatif] We want all troops, irrespective of their nationality, to leave our country. This military intervention under the smokescreen of the UN operation has brought even more instability to our country after years of civil war. Everyone involved carries the same responsibility, including the Germans. [Kretz] Will a new civil war erupt? [Abdullatif] Our people are tired of war. We want to bring about stability and achieve peace without foreign assistance. [Kretz] How should that happen? [Abdullatif] We will work to disarm ourselves and create a new administration. Then, other countries could also help us. Disarmament should not involve violence. There should also be no more military conflicts between the two big clans, General Aidid's Habargidir and clan leader Ali Mahdi's Abgal. [Kretz] Would Aidid be prepared to assume the post of president? [Abdullatif] If he is called upon do so, he will. In the end, he is a prominent person, and it was he who chased the former dictator Barre out of the country. However, we will not resort to weapons and democratic elections will be held. [Kretz] Don't you need foreign assistance to rebuild the country? [Abdullatif] We have established contacts with other African countries that will assist us in reconstruction. We would like Germany to be the first European country that we will visit. We told that to the German ambassador in Nairobi, and we would welcome German assistance. The Germans are always welcome in Somalia. The condition is that they do not come in uniforms.
