Zhiltsov under the rubric "Flight Safety: Search, Resolution": "The Rescue Capsule..."] [Text] ...increases considerably the likelihood of rescue for people in accidents on land or at sea, as well as in natural disasters. Aviation hardware is improved from year to year, but unfortunately it cannot yet be said that the number of accidents and crashes is being reduced, and people are killed every year. But it is not a matter of the hardware alone--natural catastrophes, before which people are helpless, make their contribution as well. But we are quite able to reduce the number of casualties; we need only take up the matter seriously and remember that the greater number of lethal instances are observed in the first hours after a disaster, when shock, confusion, disarray, serious injuries, great loss of blood and lack of essentials lead to irreversible consequences. Suffice it to recall the demise of the Admiral Nakhimov, the earthquake in Armenia or the tragic incident with the submarine in the bitter polar waters. So many casualties could have been averted if help had come even an hour sooner! The rescuers, it is true, did not arrive on time in those specific cases for entirely objective reasons--the remoteness of the location of the catastrophe, the lack of the equipment necessary in such cases, damage to rail sidings and airfields. Only air drops of specialists and technical gear, and moreover immediately, could have radically altered the situation. Far from every specialist, unfortunately, is able to make a parachute jump, the more so into an unprepared area or into the water, in many cases in pitch darkness as well. The rescuers themselves could be turned into the target of rescue as well in bad weather conditions or on rugged terrain. One also cannot fail to take into account that the separate dropping of people and gear often leads to unjustifiably large losses of time. An analysis of catastrophes and natural disasters that have occurred makes it possible to conclude that the effectiveness of first aid measures, and all aid in general, is determined by the following conditions: --the availability of means to deliver rescue gear, equipment and rescuers to the site of the catastrophe; --the presence at the site of the catastrophe of specialists who can provide for the effective utilization of emergency-rescue and medical equipment in the area of the catastrophe or natural disaster; --the time to bring the gear into readiness for utilization. These conditions are met only through the air drop of highly trained, first-class specialists together with the appropriate gear (equipment). A special container for the group air drop of rescue specialists and the necessary gear has been developed for just that purpose at the Experimental Machine-Building Plant [EMZ] imeni V.M. Myasishchev. It must be acknowledged that work on this type of descent apparatus had already been pursued, but not at all for the purposes that we are talking about. The idea of the possible application of this container in rescue operations appeared only in the middle of the 1980s, largely thanks to impending conversion. Two versions of the apparatus were developed--one with uncontrolled parachute descent, and one with controlled parachute descent and an engine for movement in the water. Several containers of the uncontrolled type have been built over the last seven years. They have completed the stage of design testing, and have been tried out in dozens of drops both without people and with people on board. This container is currently ready for series production. It is manufactured of duralumin, and is cylindrical in shape. The weight of one fully equipped is 2,300 kg [kilograms], with a carrying capacity of five people plus 300 kg of cargo (one tonne in the cargo version). The drop altitudes range from 400 to 8,000 meters. The testing was conducted using An-12, Il-76, Tu-95 and 3M aircraft, and had positive results. The parachute system employed on the container is the same as the one on the Soyuz descent craft, and operates according to the configuration of forced deployment of the drogue parachute--actuation of the stabilizing system--deployment of the main system. A reserve parachute is also planned. The rated G-forces should have been 15 when the main canopy opened; in experimental drops they rarely exceeded 13 (10--13). The time for operation is 0.05--0.1 second. The crew of the container is accommodated in Kazbek seats, the type installed in the descent craft of the Soyuz spacecraft. They are somewhat modified in this version, and have inflatable cushioning. The container is entirely airtight with an oxygen reserve on board for five hours, along with communications gear and a source of electric power. The craft is very easy to operate and sits low in the water, making it easy to fish people and various essential objects out of the water, much easier than from a rescue boat. The rescue module has a good stability reserve thanks to that low center of gravity and the presence of special runners. The wave crest washes over the container when performing operations at sea in storms of three or more, rather than swamping it. The container maintains its orientation, thus surpassing the means of sea rescue currently in existence, from cutters (Yersh and Gagara class) to the not-very-widespread ground-effect craft. The design engineering of the rescue capsule allowed for five drops, but testing has shown that its durability is considerably greater. All of the capsules withstood use more than ten times, and one container was destroyed only on the 48th drop. The controllable capsule is still in the development stage, during which a host of difficult problems will have to be solved--automatic controlled descent and landing on a very restricted site in particular. The second version of this item, despite the outward similarity, differs substantially, first and foremost in the parachute system, which can be actuated at once, i.e. without the use of a drogue chute and stabilizing system. The canopy of the main system is controlled either automatically or by commands from an aircraft, the ground or right from the descent craft. There is also a reserve parachute system. There are four Kazbek seats installed on board, but without cushioning, and one heated seat. The weight of the cargo is 300 kg in the cargo-passenger version (1,000 kg without passengers). A 40-horsepower engine started from a generator, even in the air if necessary, is planned for movement in the water. The craft can be in autonomous mode for no less than six hours with continuous operation of the engine and generator. The circle of tasks that can be performed with this object is very broad. It includes first aid to the stricken or the supply of electric power sources, special tools, tents, foodstuffs, etc. in the initial stages of an air-rescue operation with the joint drop of people and special gear. When it is dropped in the cargo version, units ready for operation immediately after landing (compressors, certain types of medical equipment, heaters, firefighting gear, water-pumping modules, special equipment for scuba operations etc.) can be supplied. The role of the new rescue craft is particularly great in the delivery of geological parties and expeditions in remote and difficult-to-access regions, their supply and the performance of repair operations on electric-power transmission lines and trunk gas pipelines, as well as supplying populated areas in the event of natural disasters. The container may also be used as a storage device, as well as an intermediate base during Arctic and Antarctic crossings. It is difficult not to agree that the craft that have been developed at the EMZ imeni V.M. Myasishchev are promising and extremely necessary in today's unsettled times. The work, however, is nonetheless not proceeding as it should. There are problems with everything--the parachute fabric, the materials and constituent items, the testing. One would like to believe that these are temporary difficulties. Interest in obtaining these containers is being displayed abroad as well, where nothing analogous has been created.
