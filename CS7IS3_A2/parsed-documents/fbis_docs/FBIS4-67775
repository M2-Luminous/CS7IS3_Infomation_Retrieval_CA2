In this connection we asked him: Cervinka: You stressed that the Czech Republic does not export arms to Iran. Does this also apply to Syria and Pakistan? Vondra: The Czech Republic has not exported any large volumes of military technology to these countries recently. Spare parts for the previously delivered technology is an exception. In the future, similar deals will be regulated by applicable laws. Each and every deal will be judged separately on the basis of this law. This law does not include a list of off-limits countries. In no case will the Czech Republic export arms to countries on which the UN has imposed an embargo. In the case of other countries, the foreign policy aspects of each and every deal will be considered. Cervinka: How do you view developments regarding the Czech Republic's claims in the Middle East? Vondra: It is extremely difficult to assess such a situation. The Czech Republic, as one of the successor states after Czechoslovakia, inherited claims that had been established in past decades due to the fact that Czechoslovakia, as a Warsaw Pact member, supplied many developing countries with various goods. Economic considerations, essential in foreign trade, were either secondary or totally unimportant in such cases. Many Third World countries still do not perceive past deals as normal business, but as assistance provided to them by the then Soviet bloc to maintain balance in the world, or develop their economy. This does not mean, however, that the Czech Republic will waive its claims. If we are to retain our chance of getting paid for our claims in the future, we have to search for ways that will encourage future cooperation that will be acceptable to both sides. I am convinced that this is the situation in those Middle East countries on which the UN embargo has not been imposed. This cooperation, however, will not continue in the spirit of the strategic intentions of the former Soviet bloc.
