This lot has also befallen the victorious Vladimir Volfovich. Drunk with a comparatively easy victory (neither he nor his Parteigenossen [party comrades] had expected this kind of triumph), the Liberal-Democrat set out on a honeymoon tour of Germany, which lies so close to his heart. Yet another trip of his was organized by Gerhard Frey, the leader of the German People's Union, who is known for his extreme right convictions and a friendship of long duration with Zh. Unlike government delegations, the number of participants in the visit was relatively small--the leader, two bodyguards, and several party colleagues. However, the reception the leader got from like-minded people was not marked by such modesty. As on all his visits, Vladimir Volfovich stayed only in the luxury suites of five-star hotels, with appropriate fare. The enraptured German patriots enthusiastically asked him for his autograph; statements by the Russian fuehrer (meaning leader) about the "Anschluss"--the annexation of Austria and Slovenia to Germany and the arrival of the Aryans on the shores of the Adriatic Sea were very much to their liking. In one city they even carried V.V. on the German flag to the sound of applause. To be sure, it was unknown whether there was a swastika on the flag, but if there was, the Liberal-Democrat shielded it with his body. Newspapers were full of articles about the life of the "new Russian leader." Even materials from party organs such as SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO were being constantly reprinted. Citizens attended, with tremendous pleasure, paid press conferences: The enterprising Zh. charged credulous philistines admission in order improve his financial standing, which had been greatly shaken after electoral clashes. As far as a ban on entering Germany for the Russian National-Socialist, he was not particularly concerned about it. Not long ago V.V. called his headquarters, announced that was doing just fine, and asked how things were going in Moscow. He was right to ask. In the opinion of Sergey Zharikov, editor in chief of SOKOL ZHIRINOVSKOGO, and many other party members, LDP [Liberal-Democratic Party] functionaries had sent the leader on the tour specifically in order to resolve certain issues behind his back: to expand the LDP staff and fill it with their own people. In the words of "incorruptible fighters," a number of the most prominent figures of the party are confirmed communists who very much dislike the fact that the anticommunist Zhirinovskiy wields absolute power. And they badly want to throw their own weight around. This is precisely why human multitudes are now streaming into the LDP. Many businessmen drive right up in foreign-made cars, with their sable-clad wives, to sign up as Liberal-Democrats. The headquarters is beginning to look like the Smolnyy Institution in October [1917]. However, Zhirinovskiy is either unafraid of the fifth column or does not take it seriously, or puts his faith in the magic powers of a red jacket cut from an enchanted Tibetan fabric which he has taken along. After the German tour he went, without going home, to Austria--independent for now--and after that, according to preliminary information, to Switzerland, to the local Liberal-Democrats. Let us hope that he will not come back from Lenin's Switzerland in an impounded railway car.
