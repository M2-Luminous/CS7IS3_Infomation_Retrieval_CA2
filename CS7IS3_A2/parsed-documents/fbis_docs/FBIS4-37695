"Kuwait has made a great deal of progress in its negotiations with India and Pakistan to build large and modern oil refineries in both countries," he said. He reaffirmed that Kuwait rejects the idea that the Iraqi deputy secretary general of OPEC, Ramzi Salman, should assume the position of acting secretary general, and said that "Kuwait is with the decision of the international community on the question of reopening the oil pipeline between Iraq and Turkey." The text of the interview follows: [Taqi-al-Din] You are Kuwait's new petroleum minister; do you want to introduce a new plan for the oil sector? [Al-Mid'aj] The oil sector in Kuwait is constantly developing and renewing itself. There are plans put into motion by my predecessors, and there are new plans whose implementation I will oversee in the near future, as Kuwait has emerged from a terrible invasion and the destruction of its oil institutions. They actually began to rebuild the oil sector after the liberation. One thing we are doing is to adopt a new strategy for our oil sector in terms of production, export, and oil projects outside Kuwait. [Taqi-al-Din] What are the priorities in terms of your oil investments outside Kuwait? [Al-Mid'aj] We have a long history of investment outside Kuwait; it's nothing new. We have many activities in Europe, the United States, East Asia, and the Arab countries. We have refineries in Europe, we are investing in the gasoline distribution sector, and we are active in oil exploration through KUFPEC [Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company]. Also, our Santa Fe operations are ongoing abroad--these are projects that were operating before, and still are. [Taqi-al-Din] Are there any new ones? [Al-Mid'aj] We are now looking at some new areas and will complete our contacts with some of the countries we have actually begun to consult with, such as the countries of the Far East, to implement new oil production projects and get into refining operations. We have now finished one round of negotiations with India to build oil refineries there, and we also have contacts with Pakistan to start up similar operations in the near term. We still have not decided on the capacity of these refineries, but I believe they will be modern and high-capacity. [Taqi-al-Din] What is your current production capacity? [Al-Mid'aj] We have a production capacity of 2.4 million barrels per day [bpd], and we are exporting 2 million. Turning to our refining capacity, in 10 years Kuwait will have restored its refining capacity to what it was before the invasion. Refining capacity in our Kuwaiti refineries will increase by nearly 100,000 bpd. (Refining capacity before the invasion ranged from 800,000-880,000 bpd.) We are now in the final stages of rebuilding the refineries that the Iraqi forces destroyed. [Taqi-al-Din] It appears that the OPEC conference is unable to choose a new secretary general, because Iran is nominating its ambassador to Tokyo to that post and rejects the will of the majority to appoint former Venezuelan minister Alirio Parra. It is said that if nothing can be worked out, the Iraqi deputy secretary general, Ramzi Salman, will become acting secretary general. What do you think? [Al-Mid'aj] It is absolutely unacceptable to us that Deputy Secretary General Ramzi Salman be acting secretary general, because the person who is given the post must be neutral, and because the economic organization must have nothing to do with politics. Our view is that the secretary general must be neutral; he must not engage in politics, nor should he impose the policy of one country, or be closer to one country than another. It is a strictly economic organization. I hope we may arrive at a solution and appoint a new secretary general who is not aligned with any country. [Taqi-al-Din] Are you comfortable with current oil price levels? [Al-Mid'aj] We will be comfortable if the oil market stabilizes and if prices are reasonable, so there will be no upset in the oil market. We do not approve of disruptions in prices. We always seek to stabilize them, with the cooperation of both sides: the producers and the consumers. Prices are now in the process of improving logically and reasonably to the point where producers are almost satisfied, and yet the prices are not a burden to consumers. [Taqi-al-Din] We hear a great deal these days about how the United States has permitted the reopening of an oil pipeline from Iraq and Turkey, in order to help Turkey. What is your position on this? [Al-Mid'aj] Our position is that of the international community: There is an economic danger to Iraq, for well-known reasons. We are with the international community, and if it makes a decision, we will support it. I believe that the international community will not put up with any political game the Iraqis may have in mind, but we are with the international community in any decision it makes on this subject
