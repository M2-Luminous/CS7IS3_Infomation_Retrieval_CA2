One of the important goals of reform should be the abolition of unreasonable economic regulations. The former Hosokawa government adopted an "administrative reform outline," and the key point of it was to abolish the regulations. The Hata administration is responsible for taking this over and implementing it. As a way of implementing it, I hope, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will issue instructions to individual cabinet members on the need for deregulation and will evaluate all of his cabinet members based on how the deregulation program has been achieved. In case regulatory government offices want to leave some regulations as exceptions, they must once again explain reasons for them to the people. Otherwise, the people will not support the minority ruling coalition. In the tax system reform, what must come first is the reengineering (drastic renovation of business operations) of the government sector through deregulation; nonessential expenses in the government sector should be cut down through deregulation and other actions. If reengineering is done successfully, it will become possible to raise the consumption tax only by a small rate. The former administration set forth the concept of the national welfare tax. Assumptions made on the scale of tax rate increase at that time should change if the deregulation and administrative reengineering are going to be implemented. The taxpayers will not be able to understand a hike in the consumption tax, which is based on "rough estimates" and does not take this point into account. In a policy of the coalition adopted before the Social Democratic Party of Japan bolted, it was agreed to "work out a decision on the tax reform--basically increasing the ratio of the indirect tax--by the end of June." But if regulations are to be drastically revised, it will be impossible to reach a decision on the tax system reform, including the consumption tax hike, by the end of June. What the government should do is keep income tax cuts in effect even after 1995, continue deregulating until the economy recovers, and pursue the tax system reform plan, including the consumption tax hike. What is noteworthy in the new cabinet lineup is that Komeito produced posts and telecommunications minister, transport minister, and construction minister and that it thus has become an important component in the government. But these are posts of ministries known for having so many regulations. Will these three ministers be able to push on with deregulation? The public will come to find out the party's true stand on it.
