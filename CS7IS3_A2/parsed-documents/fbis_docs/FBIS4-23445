According to Rene Ngakouto Beyeme, CSNPD spokesman in Bangui, the report is nothing but a mind-poisoning gimmick on the part of the Chadian Government. Allain Georges Ngatoua has the details: [Begin recording] [Ngatoua] The CSNPD spokesman, Rene Ngakouto Beyeme, explained this morning in Bangui that Moise Kete's movement does not have a military strategist named (Makna) in its ranks. Mr. Beyeme told reporters that the report carried by LE PROGRES, the mouthpiece of Idriss Deby's Social Movement for Democracy in Chad, is completely false. [Beyeme] I say, and I repeat, that within the CSNPD we have no military strategist or officer named (Makna). The story about the 250 fighters referred to Ndjamena is absolutely false. Furthermore, we are aware that when Deby visited the south of the country, he set up committees charged with recruiting young men into the Army, with or without their consent, and this is being done at the greatest expense of the parents of these young men. One Doub Alifa, sultan of the erstwhile kingdoms of Bagereye, is the man in charge of these committees. All I can say is that in the political staff [preceding word in English] to which I belong, there are politicians, not military strategists. [end recording]
