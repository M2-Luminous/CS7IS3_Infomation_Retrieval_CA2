Koivisto did not think that he had left unfinished any projects that would have strongly depended on him. The only matter that had intensified at the time of the transfer of power was the negotiations for European Union membership. President Koivisto thought now, before the decisive talks, that they had proceeded a long way and the number of open issues have been reduced. In his opinion, it looks very much as if Finland has the least number of open issues after Sweden. It is possible that a solution will be found. In a farewell interview granted for the Finnish News Agency at Maentyniemi [new presidential residence in Helsinki], Koivisto thought that new President Martti Ahtisaari will handle matters in the traditional matter. The president will devote himself to international issues.
