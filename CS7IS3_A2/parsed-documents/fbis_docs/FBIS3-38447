They said the EC's Executive European Commission might drop its plans to help finance production cuts, or to re-negotiate quotas on cheap steel imports from East Europe, unless the steelmakers agree on voluntary production cuts. The warning came after EC Competitions Commissioner Karel Van Miert acknowledged on Tuesday that the Commission's rescue plan was in trouble because private steelmakers had not volunteered any offers to reduce output. "We could not get the necessary cooperation from governments and from the steel sector itself. Unfortunately, in spite of the well-developed policies we have developed, we cannot deliver the goods," he said. Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann subsequently set a deadline of March 31 for the private steelmakers to make firm reduction commitments. If the deadline were missed, he said, the Commission might abandon its plan to spend several hundred million dollars helping dismissed steelworkers, and to lend one billion dollars towards the costs of restructuring the industry. Bangemann added that import quotas on cheap East European steel imposed last year, aimed particularly at Czech steel, might also be abandoned if the private sector did not cooperate. The Commission wants the EC steel industry to cut production capacity by more than 20 percent -- by 30 million tonnes of raw steel and 20 million tonnes of hot-rolled steel a year. This would mean scrapping at least 60,000 jobs -- a sacrifice which the Commission deems essential medicine for an industry buffetted by over-production, falling demand, plummetting prices and economic recession. Last December, EC governments agreed that the public sector would cut production by 5.5 million tonnes of hot-rolled steel a year, on condition that they would get last-time subsidies totalling about 7.5 billion dollars. The private steelmakers are supposed to provide the rest of the production cuts. So far, they have committed themselves to cuts of no more than five million tonnes. Now the Commission wants them to agree among themselves how to share out the production cuts, with the healthiest among them helping to finance the close-down costs of the least efficient backed by EC aid. But the private steelmakers are upset about the subsidies authorised for their public sector competition in Spain, Germany, Italy and Portugal last December. They have expressed doubts about the promised production cutbacks at these plants, and maintain that the state-owned steel works should in any case be made to bear a larger share of the cutbacks. Bangemann and Van Miert are scheduled to meet European steel executives grouped in the European federation Eurofer on February 15.
