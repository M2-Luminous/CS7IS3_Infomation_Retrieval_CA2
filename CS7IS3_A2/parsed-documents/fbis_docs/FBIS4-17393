Yuriy Kushko, OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent, turned to Tajikistan Prime Minister Abdudzhalil Samadov for comments. [Kushko] How correct is the report that during your meeting with Aleksandr Shokhin in Moscow an agreement was reached on the introduction of "banknotes with national symbols" in Tajikistan? [Samadov] This matter was indeed discussed. Upon agreement with the Russian Government such banknotes will be temporarily introduced in our country. Tajikistan's order for printing them has been placed with the Russian "Goznak" factory. We will receive the first batch in May. [Kushko] Can this money be seen as national currency? [Samadov] No, it cannot. This will be a kind of a coupon ruble to service our domestic trade. [Kushko] You have repeatedly said that the collapse of economic ties and civil war have pushed Tajikistan to the verge of survival. Can it be that the current cash crunch will push the Republic to the verge of death? [Samadov] Presently we are on the brink of social upheavals among certain sectors of the population. At the same time I rule out the recurrence of civil war. Yes, it is hard, but we all have to hold out for another couple of months. [Kushko] According to the terms of Tajikistan's accession to the ruble zone, Russia promised it a credit of 120 billion rubles [R]. Has the agreement been adhered to and is this money sufficient? [Samadov] In all, we received around R70 billion. However, the Republic's requirements in the first quarter alone were R174 billion, and just as much in the second quarter. But we understand that Russia itself is short of money. [Kushko] Does the introduction of the Tajik coupon ruble mean that the idea of merging money systems has been given up? [Samadov] This is a complex and protracted process, but it cannot go on indefinitely. As for the Tajik side, we are ready to walk our part of the way to the end. At the latest talks in Moscow we firmly agreed with the Russian side that our money systems will finally be merged.
