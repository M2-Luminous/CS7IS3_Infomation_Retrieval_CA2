Twenty-seven foreign delegates attended the conference in spite of the ban. They marched into Malcolm Hall, chanting Liberate East Timor from Indonesia. This conference has been a big issue since Malacanang banned the attendance of known East Timor supporters and after a judge issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the conference from opening. The Supreme Court, however, decided in favor of the organizers of the conference. Although APCET Chairman Renato Constantino Jr. was happy about the Supreme Court decision, he is saddened by the continued ban on foreign delegates. [Begin Constantino recording in progress, in English] ...to risk losing it, to keep it. The crisis was caused by the arrogant acts of the Indonesian Government and its provincial directorate in village Malacanang. We have asserted our rights, the Supreme Court has upheld them. But let us not forget that the irrational presidential ban on foreign participants remain.
