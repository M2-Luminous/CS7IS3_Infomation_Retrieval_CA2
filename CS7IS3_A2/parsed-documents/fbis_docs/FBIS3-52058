He thus has first-hand knowledge with which he can compare the Peruvian human rights record at that time with the current situation, and can help unveil lies. For example, he can check the responsibility of organizations like Americas Watch, whose director a short time ago wondered on a Lima radio station -- according to a report sent by Aprodeh [Peruvian Human Rights Association] -- "how much more is necessary to make the Fujimori government substantially change its policies concerning human rights and democracy." However, rather than placing the emphasis on such ostentatious and unacceptable expressions, the important thing now is to ask Ambassador Watson to himself compare the antisubversive policy and the human rights policy in force when he was ambassador to Peru with the current policy in those areas. He should then conclude which of those policies preserves human rights. He should also reflect on whether it is not actually true that human rights are now more respected than they were four, seven, or 10 years ago. It is true for a simple reason, which we will tirelessly repeat: There is a consistent antisubversive strategy that is based precisely on a systematic alliance with people: on respectful treatment, "civic support," and help for their defense organizations; on intelligence work that does not make use of violence; on a system of summary trials which has become more flexible, and has in fact prevented all attempts to take justice "into one's own hands"; and last but not least, on legal pincers made up of strong penalties with a simultaneous legal path toward repentance. If there is anything on which almost all Peruvians agree, it is that this strategy should not be modified, and even less so "substantially" modified, as Americas Watch put it. Contrary to what had happened up until four years ago, people no longer feel terror of the Armed Forces. Now people invite them, help them. No one wants to change this policy. It turned out to be positive and successful precisely because it is based on respect for people's human rights. No one is in a better position than Ambassador Watson himself, who is acquainted with the previous situation, to make this comparison, to verify how far the Peruvian human rights record has advanced over the past three years, and consequently to verify the magnitude of the lies of those who charge that Peru has adopted a systematic human rights violation "pattern." Quite the contrary. There is a tremendous difference with previous times: in the treatment given to people, in the penalties imposed on terrorists, in the treatment of prison inmates, and in participation by the people. Ambassador Watson can help dismantle this gigantic infamy against Peru, this disinformation campaign which, far from recognizing and praising this substantial progress, has ignored -- we do not know whether deliberately -- that the great news in Peru is not the La Cantuta Prison case, because there were dozens of cases like this in the 1980's, but the implementation of the strategy based on support for the people and on respect for their human rights. This is how the Armed Forces fortunately understood things in 1990, and it is what the international community should praise, instead of condemning.
