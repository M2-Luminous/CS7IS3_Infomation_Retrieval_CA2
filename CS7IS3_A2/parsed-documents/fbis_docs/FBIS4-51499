The budget bill for fiscal 1994 will somehow pass the Diet, but it will be difficult to get Diet approval for politically important policies. It is also inevitable that the government's ability to deal with negotiations with foreign nations will drastically decrease, and consequently it will be more difficult for Japan to restore relations with the United States. It can be said the Hata government is short-lived, but the situation wherein Japanese politics becomes effete will last for some time. It is a matter of course that a decrease in the politicians' ability to handle leadership leads to the deterioration of the bureaucrats' ability. The bureaucrats do their utmost when given tasks to carry out, but now they are uncertain about what to do and cannot come up with clear answers. In this situation, wherein the cabinet and the administration loses their credibility, the role of the private sector will become more important. So far, the private sector has relied on the government to take measures protecting certain business areas and assisting the private sector as well as adopting an economic stimulus package. From now on, they can no longer depend on the government; in this sense, the private sector will have to take the initiative in settling economic friction. Some analysts say the bureaucrats oppose deregulation. But there is a voice within the private sector which calls for maintaining current regulations, thus hampering the bureaucrats' efforts to promote deregulation. There are many problems the private sector can settle, including an expansion of imports and the narrowing of the gap between domestic and foreign prices. In a sense, the private sector should lead the government in carrying out policies, otherwise Japan's economy will stall. Japanese politics is becoming ill; the present situation is also troublesome to the United States. If the Japanese Government is stable, the United States can make requests. On the other hand, under the current situation wherein the government is unstable, the U.S. Government will be in doubt over what sort of calls it should make. Even if the Clinton government wants to apply further pressure to Tokyo in order to win the off-year election, Japan would not be able to come up with any measures that could satisfy the United States, and consequently the U.S. dissatisfaction with Japan will increase. Meanwhile, Japan will be increasingly irritated by the U.S. Government. Thus, bilateral relations could worsen even further. If Japan should delay in taking action when certain situations worsen--such as the unpredictable problem of North Korea's suspected nuclear program--the United States may possibly question Japan's attitude, asking: "Is Japan really an ally?" In this way, while Japan will lose its international status, its diplomacy will involve it in a serious situation.
