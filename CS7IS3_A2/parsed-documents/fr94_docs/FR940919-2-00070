FR940919-2-00070 FR940919-2-00044 Public Health Service Notice Regarding Section 602 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 Outpatient Hospital Facilities AGENCY: Public Health Service, HHS. ACTION: Final notice. SUMMARY: Section 602 of Public Law 102&hyph;585, the ``Veterans Health Care Act of 1992'' (the ``Act''), enacted section 340B of the Public Health Service Act (``PHS Act''), ``Limitation on Prices of Drugs Purchased by Covered Entities.'' Section 340B provides that a manufacturer who sells covered outpatient drugs to eligible entities must sign a pharmaceutical pricing agreement (the ``Agreement'') with the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, in which the manufacturer agrees to charge a price for covered outpatient drugs that will not exceed the amount determined under a statutory formula. The purpose of this notice is to inform interested parties of final program guidelines concerning the inclusion of outpatient disproportionate share hospital (DSH) facilities in the PHS drug discount program. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marsha Alvarez, R. Ph., Director, Office of Drug Pricing, Bureau of Primary Health Care, 4350 East West Highway, West Tower, 10th Floor, Bethesda, MD 20814, tel: (301) 594&hyph;4353. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 19, 1994. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: (A) Background Proposed guidelines were announced in the Federal Register at 59 FR 29300 on June 6, 1994. A period of 30 days was established to allow interested parties to submit comments. The Office of Drug Pricing received 8 letters with comments concerning legal authority for developing the proposed guidelines, responsibility for determining eligibility, the inclusion of non-traditional outpatient facilities, the need for a definition of eligible hospital facility, ambiguity in the policies of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) regarding the Medicare cost report, possible exceptions for unique circumstances, a retroactive effective date, and general comments concerning the definition of ``patient'' and a contracted pharmacy service mechanism. The following section presents a summary of all major comments, grouped by subject, and a response to each comment. All comments were considered, and the guideline is adopted as proposed, with minor changes to increase clarity. (B) Comments and Responses Comment: Manufacturers should not be required to provide discounts to outpatient facilities that are included on the Medicare cost reports of eligible DSHs until the PHS Office of Drug Pricing includes the names of the eligible outpatient facilities on the master list of eligible covered entities. Response: When an eligible DSH submits the list of all outpatient facilities (on-site and off-site) included on its Medicare cost report and Medicaid billing status information to the Office of Drug Pricing and the Office adds these facilities to the master list of eligible and participating entities during regular quarterly updates, the facilities will then be able to access PHS discount pricing. This information will be posted on the Electronic Data Retrieval System (EDRS), maintained by the Office of Drug Pricing. To access this information call (301) 594&hyph;4992. Comment: The proposed guidelines have created a new definition of ``DSH'' which appears to be within the realm of legislating as opposed to rulemaking. Response: Section 340B(a)(4) of the PHS Act lists the various groups of entities eligible to receive PHS discount pricing. Section 340B(a)(4)(L) describes a subset of ``hospitals'' as defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act as eligible to participate in the program. Because section 1886 addresses Medicare payment for hospital inpatient services only, the scope of the term ``hospital'' has been limited to the hospital inpatient services. However, section 340B deals exclusively with outpatient drugs. Although Congress clearly intends this narrow definition be used to identify the Medicare disproportionate share hospitals which are eligible for section 340B drug discounts, we do not believe it is reasonable to use this same definition to limit where the section 340B outpatient drugs can be used. Some disproportionate share hospitals offer outpatient services in off-site or satellite outpatient facilities. Further, the movement of nonprofit hospitals in recent years has been to reorganize and offer a variety of services, other than traditional inpatient hospital services, through separate divisions, lines of business, or entities. Therefore, for purposes of section 340B drug discounts, a further interpretation of ``hospital'' is needed.
