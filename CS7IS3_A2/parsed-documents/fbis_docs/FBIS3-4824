"We can guarantee that the agreement we have reached with China about Suzhou, and about projects in Shandong (province), will be honoured. That includes projects like the revitalising of state-owned factories," said Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew in an interview with the Beijing-based correspondent of the German financial and business daily, Handelsblatt. A transcript of the interview, conducted on Feb 19 at the Istana [State Palace] here, was made available to BT [BUSINESS TIMES] yesterday. Safeguarding the interests of foreign companies which ride on the Singapore connection is one of the ways whereby third parties may benefit from the guanxi [personal connections] which Singapore's business community has built up in China. "Singapore will provide the means to a relationship, help in negotiations to reach agreement and to make the agreement work," he said. Singapore has a role to play to help foreign companies move into China, because China needs investors from the whole world, not just from Hong Kong, Taiwan or the overseas Chinese, said Mr Lee. Unfamiliarity with Chinese culture and language, coupled with the lack of legality in China, has made some investors uncomfortable, which is where Singapore companies with guanxi come in. Mr Lee admitted that although Singapore's agreements with China are on paper, they "are never as clear-cut as we would have with Western countries". Only the broad outlines are laid down, while much is unwritten, unspoken and depends on good faith. Mr Lee arrived yesterday in Tianjin, only a one-and-a-half-hour drive from Beijing where he will be signing an agreement tomorrow for the so-called "software transfer" from Singapore to China. The government-to-government agreement will allow Singapore to pass on its experience in running a modern city through the development of a 70 sq km township in Suzhou, which is some 90 km from Shanghai. Mr Lee said one of the changes to the centralised system which today's China has to make, is to unify its tax system. This will address the dichotomy which arises from the fact that while everything is centralised, the provinces collect their own taxes and therefore begin to act independently. China has to change its regulations, and which is more difficult, its mindsets. Mr Lee said the transformation will take over 20 to 30 years, and will involve some dislocation. By then, growth rates would be between six and eight percent, and between 50 percent and 60 percent of Chinese will live in towns. "That's a different China. The majority of the population will be together, with quick and easy access to real time information. They will have to evolve a system to govern this different China," said Mr Lee.
