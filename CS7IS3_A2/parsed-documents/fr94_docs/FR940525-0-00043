(i) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1989, a hospital is required to submit its cost reports in a standardized electronic format. The hospital's electronic program must be capable of producing the HCFA standardized output file in a form that can be read by intermediary's automated system. This electronic file, which must contain the input data required to complete the cost report and the data required to pass specified edits, is forwarded to the fiscal intermediary for processing through its system. (ii) The fiscal intermediary may not alter the cost report once it has been filed by the hospital. If a cost report does not pass all specified edits, the fiscal intermediary rejects the cost report and returns it to the hospital for correction. The hospital's electronic program must be able to disclose that changes have been made to the electronic cost report after the provider has submitted it to the intermediary. (iii) Effective for cost reporting periods ending on or after October 1, 1994, a hospital must submit a hard copy of a settlement summary, a statement of certain worksheet totals found within the electronic file, and a statement signed by its administrator or chief financial officer certifying the accuracy of the electronic file or the manually prepared cost report. The following statement must immediately precede the dated signature of the hospital's administrator or chief financial officer: I hereby certify that I have read the above certification statement and that I have examined the accompanying electronically filed or manually submitted cost report and the Balance Sheet Statement of Revenue and Expenses prepared by XXXX (Provider Name(s) and Number(s)) for the cost reporting period beginning XXXX and ending XXXX and that to the best of my knowledge and belief, this report and statement are true, correct, complete and prepared from the books and records of the provider in accordance with applicable instructions, except as noted. I further certify that I am familiar with the laws and regulations regarding the provision of health care services, and that the services identified in this cost report were provided in compliance with such laws and regulations. (iv) A hospital may request a delay or waiver of the electronic submission requirement in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section if this requirement would cause a financial hardship. The hospital must submit a written request for delay or waiver with necessary supporting documentation to its intermediary at least 120 days prior to the end of its cost reporting period. The intermediary reviews the request and forwards it with a recommendation for approval or denial, to HCFA central office within 30 days of receipt of the request. HCFA central office either approves or denies the request and notifies the intermediary within 60 days of receipt of the request. * * * * * (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 93.773, Medicare_Hospital Insurance; and Program No. 93.774, Medicare_Supplementary Medical Insurance Program) Dated: August 25, 1993.
