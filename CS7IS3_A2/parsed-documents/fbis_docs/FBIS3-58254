The governor, a son of King Fahd, was to hold talks Tuesday with Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, Defence Minister Francois Leotard and Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. Prince Mohammad, sometimes described as the king's "businessman" although he has no government portfolio, was also scheduled to dine with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and meet with French business leader Francois-Xavier Ortoli. The governor's visit, arranged some time ago at the invitation of both Mitterrand and Balladur, follows the latter's weekend visit to Riyadh during which France hoped to clinch major arms deals. Instead, Balladur's visit ended only with the establishment of a committee of experts charged with Franco-Saudi economic dossiers. Saudi Arabia is currently faced with financial problems resulting from falling oil prices and a debt backlog from the Gulf war three years ago. The governor, whose province produces most of Saudi Arabia's oil, was likely to continue discussions with French leaders raised by Balladur at the weekend, French Foreign Ministry sources said.
