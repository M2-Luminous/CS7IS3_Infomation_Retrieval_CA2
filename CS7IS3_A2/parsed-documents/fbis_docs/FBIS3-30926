Silajdzic hoped that this would be the beginning of a new phase, "but no one knows whether or not the Serbs are going to implement it." As is known, General Michael Rose, commander of the UN forces in Bosnia, said that he expects the agreement to be implemented fully as of midday today, Thursday. We asked Haris Silajdzic: Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said yesterday (Wednesday) that Russia is against launching air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. However, it supports making Sarajevo a UN protectorate. He said that Russia could send forces to implement the plan. Haris Silajdzic said: We have not asked for Russian forces to be sent to Sarajevo. [Al-Husayni] They are willing to come. [Silajdzic] We have not requested any. [Al-Husayni] Have you requested French, British, Ukrainian forces? [Silajdzic] And forces from Islamic states. [Al-Husayni] So you reject the dispatch of Russian forces to you. [Silajdzic] I said we have not requested any. [Al-Husayni] The Bosnian parliament proposed Bosnia's partition into four cantons.... [Silajdzic] It was the Croatian, not Bosnian, parliament which proposed Bosnia's partition into 18 cantons. The problem is that people do not follow the news of what is happening. [Al-Husayni] Your representative to the United Nations agreed to Sarajevo's being turned into a demilitarized zone. Do you too agree to that? [Silajdzic] We have not agreed to the demilitarization of Sarajevo, nor have we spoken about this matter. [Al-Husayni] Your representative told British television that your agree. [Silajdzic] A representative is a representative and a government is a government, of course. [Al-Husayni] As a government, do you refuse to turn Sarajevo into a demilitarized zone? [Silajdzic] No one has asked for demilitarization or nondemilitarization. UN Security Council Resolution 836 stipulates the Serbian forces' withdrawal and we are in the process of implementing this resolution. [Al-Husayni] You are now in Geneva for the sake of implementing this resolution. [Silajdzic] We are here for the sake of negotiations. [Al-Husayni] What about the resolution's implementation? [Silajdzic] It should be implemented on the ground. [Al-Husayni] In brief, what peace plan is the Bosnian Government taking to Geneva? [Silajdzic] It is an expanded plan. We are carrying plans, programs, and pages. I am carrying with me 10 kg of pages and papers full of proposals. [Al-Husayni] What is your opinion of NATO's decision to issue an ultimatum to the Serbs before launching air strikes? Do you believe it is serious? [Silajdzic] It is a serious organization, and I expect it to issue nothing but serious things. It is a very big organization, a world organization, the strongest military organization in the world, and its statements are bound to be serious. We take all its decisions seriously. [Al-Husayni] Do you expect an air strike to be launched? [Silajdzic] We expect nothing. We are awaiting the results of the NATO session, then we will see what is going to happen.
