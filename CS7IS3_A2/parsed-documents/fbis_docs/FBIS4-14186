[Hasan] There have been various international moves and initiatives following the Oslo accord between the PLO and Israel. There are reports of a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher--the more important cosponsor of the conference--to the region to promote the talks. To tell you the truth, I know nothing about the visit. Regarding my evaluation of the peace process, I believe that the current circumstances resemble a no peace, no war situation. It looks like a stalemate. We have not changed positions. I ask: What is the use of the talks if they do not produce positive progress on all tracks? The complete opposite is happening on the ground of reality. Let me mention the Hebron massacre and the feelings of sorrow and frustration it has left in the Arab world. Naturally, this barbaric massacre against innocent people is a reflection of the failure of the talks. It in turn pushes the parties to the point of despair. That paves the way for more unjustified acts of violence. Here, I want to return to the basic issue, the issue of mankind and mankind's view of peace and its benefits and gains. We are not ones to thwart the peace process but we are searching for just and comprehensive peace in accordance with UN resolutions. [Khalil] What is your view of the region's future in light of the negotiating process? Israel's ultimate aim is the establishment of a regional bloc or a Middle East regime that will redraw the landscape of the region. I believe, Your Highness, you agree with me that Jordan is a sine qua non for the Middle East market project in its first stage, the so-called triangle, according to a book by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. [Hasan] Yes, Peres says we need economic projects and commercial dealings to protect peace. My response is that peace will not thrive on forced relations between two different economies when the rich side gets richer at the expense of the economy of the poor. I believe Peres' projects need a clear perspective. Our perspective in Jordan is that we should shoulder our Arab responsibility within an Arab framework. Any talk about a Middle East market that will achieve Israel's economic ambitions is premature. We have not achieved peace yet. So on what basis should I ask the Arab citizen to change his feelings, agree to deal with it, and establish economic and trade activity with it? This is a complicated process. Israel must first of all prove its desire to live in peace by giving the land back to its owners. It must cease its inhumane violations and excesses against the inhabitants of the occupied territories. It must refrain from attempting to erase the character of Arab towns and Islamic holy shrines. In fact, we have many reasons to reject this so-called Middle East market. I wish to point out that it is not clear yet what the term Middle East means. So how can we form an economic grouping in a region with no defined features, at least from the geographical point of view? According to our concept, we ought to establish an Arab grouping. We have the bonds of blood, religion, history, and a common future. The agreements and recommendations of the summit conference held under the aegis of the Arab League since 1957 approved the establishment of a Common Arab market. What remains is implementation, which is not being done due to lack of political will. You are aware of the pressure put on the Arab League to end the boycott [of Israel]. However, in its recent 101st session the Arab League reaffirmed its adherence to the boycott decisions as one of the best bargaining cards in the hands of the Arab negotiator. The Arab negotiator will not give up this bargaining chip under any pressure or at any price. [Khalil] In view of what you said about the Arab League and your ambition to revive joint Arab cooperation agreements to face Western-Zionist schemes to redraw the region's map, where do you stand on the secretary general's call for reconciliation? [Hasan] When that initiative saw the light in March last year, I met with Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. There was a notably genuine desire among Arab intellectuals and writers to get over the Gulf ordeal and welcome undertakings to patch up the schism in Arab relations. The people as well are eager to restore the unity of the nation's ranks. When it comes to states, only 13 out of 23 member states have consented to the initiative. Some states had reservations about it due to bilateral problems, although I am convinced that this is more reason for brothers to get together and discuss matters rather than wait. Just as Husayn said in an appeal to the nation's leaders, let us emerge from the dark tunnel. [Khalil] Since we are talking about mending fences, how far have bilateral ties between Egypt and Jordan gone, particularly in view of Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's expected visit to Jordan on 26 April? [Hasan] The visit is in the context of the meetings of the Egyptian-Jordanian joint higher committee. We hope these meetings will contribute to restoring normalcy to bilateral ties between the two fraternal countries. [Khalil] What about ties with the Gulf states? [Hasan] We still believe that patience is our only hope for an opening up or, in other words, for dialogue and for avoiding hazards. [Khalil] My last question is about the democratic experience and the distance you have covered so far. Did the recent acts of violence have an impact on that experience? [Hasan] First of all, violence exists everywhere in the world, primarily in the states that claim to have fully democratic state institutions. Violence does not bother us in effect, it enhances our belief in the need to further consolidate our democratic practices. I admit, however, that our democratic experience is not fully mature.
