Gen. Lev Ihnatenko, chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' armaments staff, told a briefing for journalists on 18 May that, in compliance with accords on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from the territory of Ukraine, it is planned to send 200 nuclear warheads to Russia this year. Thus far, he said, 180 nuclear warheads have already been removed. As for the future destiny of strategic bombers, with 42 heavy bomber aircraft remaining on the territory of Ukraine -- 19 Tu-160's and 23 Tu-95M's -- the lieutenant general stressed that in exchange for the transfer of these aircraft to Russia, Ukraine would like to be able to have other aircraft of the Ukrainian Armed Forces technically maintained and spare parts supplied for various weapons systems. A settlement of this issue by the Russian side is forthcoming. Lev Ihnatenko also noted that although only 25 percent of the research and development institutions's requirements have been met, work on the creation of up-to-date armaments systems, including precision weapons, is continuing.
