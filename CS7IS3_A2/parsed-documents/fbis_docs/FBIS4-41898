In particular, there will now be a separate entry in the budget for the allocation of credit resources to the Association of Peasant (Private) Farms; these credits will represent 15 percent of the total monetary resources allocated for the development of the agroindustrial complex. No less than 15 percent of capital investments going into the social construction programs in the countryside (irrespective of the sources of funding) will be directed toward private farmers. Henceforth one-tenth of all the resources spent on road construction in the oblast will also go to private farmers. It has been decided to halve the level of paid services for testing agricultural produce brought into the city by private farmers.
