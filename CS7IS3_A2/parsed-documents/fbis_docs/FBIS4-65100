Citizens, battered by crisis and disappointed, turn their backs on the incumbent whom they no longer credit with any competency at all in economic matters and bet on the younger challenger--and he not only inherits the office, but also an economic upturn that no one had clearly seen coming prior to the election. Possibly nothing will come of it. Granted, according to the polls, the German citizenry still credits the Social Democrat with greater ability to solve economic and social problems, but since the majority of economic research institutes now expect a definite revival of the economy, the mood could certainly change. The end of the recession confronts the Social Democrats with a political problem: If they point out the risks that still exist, they will be accused of aborting the recovery with their pessimistic talk; if they go over to the optimists' camp, they will be campaigning for Helmut Kohl. The Federal Government, on the other hand, is no longer racking its brains: It is proceeding full steam ahead with optimism. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Minister for Economics Guenter Rexrodt are already cheerfully talking about the recovery. It does not bother them that both the research institutes and their own experts in the ministries are prudently avoiding this notion. Weak economic growth of 1 percent in western Germany--which is what the institutes are expecting--makes up for just one-half of the economic slump that the old federal laender suffered last year, and an upturn that produces new capacity and jobs is not in sight this year. Nonetheless, even Minister of Finance Theo Waigel was trying to spread nothing but sunshine at the spring meeting of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington. The IMF's prognosis--0.9 percent growth in Germany--was supposedly too pessimistic. Waigel's optimism, motivated by the election campaign, certainly did not catch on with the Americans. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen sees only a gradual recovery in the most important industrial countries that, moreover, is still very uncertain in some regions. Bentsen is convinced that more must be done to ensure a long-term recovery. His undersecretary [for international affairs], Larry Summers, is calling upon the Germans as well as the Japanese to do more for the recovery: The economy should be stimulated by interest rate reductions. And the IMF grouses that German banks are not passing declining interest rates on to their customers. Not only abroad, but in this country as well there are admonitions to prudence in evaluating the economic situation. In that vein, Herbert Hax, chairman of the Council of Experts, opines: "Granted, predicting a certain upward trend for the German economy in the last half of the year is justified; how strong it will be, however, is still completely up in the air." Hax reminds that thus far, only foreign orders and popular mood indicators have improved: "Data for the first quarter of 1994 still do not reveal an increase in production--something that no one expected." The coalition parties, however, are not being held back by realism. Count Otto Lambsdorff, Free Democratic Party (FDP) economic policy specialist, is damaging his own credibility with the comment, "the recovery in Germany is picking up tempo." His Christian Democratic Union (CDU) colleague Rainer Haungs is already talking about "the leading role of the German economy." It does not bother the coalition members that they are becoming entangled in their own glaring contradictions: Just a few weeks ago, Germany as a place for business and industry was allegedly threatening to plunge into third-rate status; if economic shortcomings were not piling up, then first-rate structural problems were: the cost crisis, the innovation crisis, and the employment crisis. But that is all old hat now. In its euphoria, the Federal Government runs the risk of talking at cross-purposes with the citizenry, for this much is certain: Workers will be perceptibly worse off this year. If the citizens make judgments based on their wallets, Kohl will continue to be in a difficult position: Because of modest wage settlements and tax increases, disposable income has shrunk a total of 1.5 percent--and total income has even declined by 3 percent. "That is the steepest decline in the history of the Federal Republic," emphasizes Heiner Flassbeck of the German Institute for Economic Research. The six institutes disagree only as to whether private consumption will decline by 0.5 or 1.5 percent as a consequence of this slump. Nor will there be any substantial improvement in the coming year: The institutes expect that private consumption will probably only stabilize in the foreseeable future. To be sure, the research economists are counting on growth of more than 9 percent in incomes from business activity, yet whether that is a cause for celebration on the part of the broad mass of voters may be doubtful indeed, for the rising profits are having no effect on the most serious problem: unemployment. It continues to increase this year and, according to the institutes, a turnaround in the trend will not occur until 1995. On this score, they are more optimistic than the president of the Federal Association of German Industry, Tyll Necker: He is not expecting growth in jobs before 1996 at the earliest; next year the slide will only be halted. What the entrepreneurs, labor unions, and economists have been preaching for months remains true: Unemployment will not go away by itself. After the brutal down-sizing and efficiency cure that industry has been undergoing, production can be increased with a reduced labor force. The Federal Republic, like the European countries as whole, cannot survive in the long run solely on the life support provided by American demand. They themselves must provide for a more stable domestic economic situation. More robust domestic demand as well as markedly fewer jobless will not occur automatically, however, and it would therefore be disastrous if the economic policymakers were to lie back now and celebrate their putative successes. Klaus-Werner Schatz of the Kiel Institute for Global Economy warns: "Our biggest worry is: How can we again achieve a higher rate of employment? To do so, the tax burden must be reduced, but fiscal policy is not yet undertaking the efforts that are necessary for us to achieve a strong upturn with growth in employment." While the institutes are calling for tax reductions, the Federal Government is doing the opposite: The solidarity surtax [to assist in financing the reconstruction of eastern Germany] will once again be increased at the beginning of next year and capital and insurance taxes will be raised. Moreover, there will be another increase in oil taxes or other taxes to finance the reform of the railroad system. Even an increase in the value-added tax cannot be excluded any longer since the Federal Government is negotiating with local governments on granting permission to the latter to share in this revenue source--something that, should it come about, will hardly be feasible without an increased tax rate. Thus, the Federal Government talks about the necessity for the tax burden to be reduced again but does the exact opposite. In so doing, it not only mortgages the national economy, it also does nothing short of forcing the labor unions to adopt a more aggressive wage policy that would threaten the unit labor cost reductions that have just been achieved. In violation of all its promises, the government is staking everything on further tax increases because it is plagued by debt. In spite of constantly increased taxes, the debt burden continues to grow and early next year the 2-trillion-mark level--equating to 60 percent of the GNP--will be surpassed. Driven by the avalanche of debt in fiscal policy matters, the Federal Government's economic policy is currently exhausting itself in a battle over the repeal of the Rebate Act. Nonetheless, the struggle for power is becoming more difficult for Scharping: If Kohl can point to an economic bright spot on the horizon, it would be frivolous to continue to hew to the same line that holds that the chancellor will do himself in. Scharping can no longer restrict himself to the message that he agrees with the Federal Government on many fundamental issues--it is just that his policy would be somewhat better in the area of social welfare. Should he, in fact, have better prescriptions for freeing the German economy from its state of paralysis between recession and recovery, he must explain them now as quickly as possible. Remaining silent and trusting that the Federal Government will make itself an unacceptable choice, is likely to be the surest way to put himself out of the race.
