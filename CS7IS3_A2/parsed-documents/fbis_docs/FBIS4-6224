Enrile To Become Chief of Staff Pushes Modernization Program BK1904072894 Manila MANILA BULLETIN in English 6 Apr 94 pp 1, 8 BK1904072894 Manila MANILA BULLETIN English BFN [Text] Lt. Gen. Arturo T. Enrile, chief of the Philippine Army and incoming chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), vowed yesterday to give top priority to the 10 year modernization program of the AFP which, he said, is expected to have an expanded and more dynamic role in view of the country's fast improving political, social, and economic situation. In an interview at the Philippine Army Headquarters at Fort Bonifacio, Makati, Enrile said that in his tour of duty as the next chief of staff, the military organization will assume more relevant roles in economic development, particularly in the field of infrastructure and environmental preservation. He said that his program "peace offensives" in the Philippine Army is applicable for the entire AFP since it will be the military's contribution to nation building. Enrile, a member of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) Class '62, was named by President Ramos, also commander-in-chief, as the next AFP head replacing Gen. Lisandro C. Abadia who is scheduled to end his three-year term as AFP chief of staff on 12 April. Abadia who is turning 56 next month, is also a member of PMA Class '62. As Army chief, Enrile has vigorously pursued the Chief Executive's campaign to protect the country's remaining forests through the involvement of Army Special Units. The Army chief also revealed plans to redeploy armored, fighting vehicles in forest areas as a deterrent to illegal loggers amidst the decline of communist threat. However, Enrile said that he will give emphasis on the modernization of the AFP since, he claimed, his predecessors had successfully worked for the unification and professionalization of the military institution. "Actually, there is a much lesser work load for me now because of the effectiveness of my predecessors. But still, I am ready to make innovations that would keep the AFP as relevant as it is," he said. Despite giving a list of five candidates for the top AFP post, military sources said Abadia endorsed Enrile to President Ramos because of his professional competence. Enrile said he is not expecting any "sour graping" from any of the four candidates. "All of us are professionals and experts in the military career," he said. Enrile was born in Lucena City, Quezon on 20 June 1940. His parents are Felix D. Enrile of Lucena City and Jovita Tiongson of Nueva Ecija. He is married to Mara Miciano of Metro Manila and is blessed with a 12-year-old daughter Tanya Angela. Many remember Gen. Enrile as the only Army officer who convinced more than 400 rebel soldiers to "return to barracks" after occupying the high-rise buildings in Makati for seven days during the December 1989 failed coup attempt. As superintendent of the PMA, Enrile was also responsible for instituting reforms at the country's premier military academy, particularly the eradication of traditional hazing activities. President Fidel Ramos designated yesterday Maj. Gen. Alfredo Filler as new vice chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in place of Vice Admiral Mariana Dumancas. Filler's appointment followed the designation of Gen. Arturo Enrile as incoming AFP chief of staff, vice Chief of Staff Lisandro Abadia who is retiring on 12 April. Malacanang [presidential office] said Dumancas had earlier requested the president to be allowed to go on terminal leave effective today prior to his compulsory retirement on 30 October 1994. The president approved his request.
