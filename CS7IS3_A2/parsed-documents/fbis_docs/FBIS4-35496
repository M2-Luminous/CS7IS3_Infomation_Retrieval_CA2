Officials of the Defense Research and Development Organization and senior Army and Air Force officials are camping at Chandipur-on-the-Sea in Orissa for the test. According to reliable Defense Ministry sources, these officials in Chandipur are awaiting a green light from the Prime Minister's Office. The test was scheduled for 13 May, but postponed in view of the prime minister's U.S. visit. Later, the authorities fixed 23 May as the date, but this was not officially announced. As the Prithvi tests have not been held yet, speculation was rife that test flights were stopped due to U.S. pressure. Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador-designate to India, Frank Wisner, in a statement on 26 May at the Senate confirmation hearing, indirectly warned India against deploying this missile. Defense Ministry sources say that this round of tests will examine the Prithvi missile from different angles. The tests are expected to be completed by the end of July. After that, Bharat Dynamics will be given the go-ahead to start manufacturing the missile, although Defense Ministry sources are not in a position to state as to when the actual deployment of the missile will take place. During the main tests, scientists of the Defense Research and Development Organization and military experts will study the subsystems of the missile. This will include the command system and warhead capacity. The defense sources say that the tests must begin before the monsoon reaches the east coast in about two weeks. The defense sources, however, are confident that they will complete this round of tests by July. During the first phase of deployment, the Army will deploy the missiles along the international border [with Pakistan] in Rajasthan and Punjab. The Army has already created a special artillery regiment for the purpose. Special bunkers are being constructed to deploy these missiles in the plains where they will be kept in specific controlled temperature conditions. During the second phase of deployment, Prithvi will be deployed in Jammu and Kashmir, but the Defense Ministry sources are not stating when this deployment will commence. It is worth mentioning that Pakistan has already deployed 70-km range Hatf-1 and 120-km range Hatf-2 missiles. It has also deployed 300-km range M-11 missiles which have been acquired from China. India is deploying Prithvi missiles in response to the Pakistani-deployed missiles, but the United States has only indirectly warned India against the deployment of Prithvi missiles. This has led to widespread public interest on the deployment of these missiles. This has become a question of national pride. Almost all opposition parties have demanded that India strengthen its security by deploying these missiles.
