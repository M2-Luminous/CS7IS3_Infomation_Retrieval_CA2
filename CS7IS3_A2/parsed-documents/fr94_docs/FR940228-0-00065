APC was granted a pioneer's preference for its development and demonstration of technologies that facilitate spectrum sharing by PCS facilities and microwave systems at 2 GHz. APC's analysis and testing demonstrated that there exists unused spectrum in the 1850&hyph;1990 MHz band sufficient to allow immediate initiation of PCS services without first having to relocate existing microwave operations. Its study changed the focus of attention from relocating fixed microwave operations before initiating PCS to initially implementing PCS while sharing the spectrum with the existing microwave operations. This study, and the transition plan presented in comments submitted by APC, have elements in common with the transition plan adopted in ET Docket No. 92&hyph;9 to facilitate making 2 GHz spectrum available for emerging technologies, including PCS. Further, APC developed Frequency Agile Sharing Technology (FAST) and demonstrated that it provides a practical means to transition from fixed services to shared fixed and mobile services in this spectrum. 5. As explained by APC, FAST is a frequency planning and management tool used to predict (and avoid) interference both between private operational fixed service (POFS) and PCS systems, and within a PCS system. The FAST system utilizes theoretical interference analyses verified by signal strength measurements to determine frequency assignments to PCS base stations. This function is accomplished by a Channel Utilization Controller (CUC), which monitors and determines the channels each PCS base station may use. The CUC monitors coverage and interference; analyzes and integrates measured data; integrates supporting data bases; and supports data communications links to each PCS base station. For each PCS base station the CUC calculates theoretical interference values and areas for every POFS station in its data base. Both PCS-to-POFS and POFS-to-PCS interference is calculated. The CUC then compiles a list of available channels for each base station. The theoretical interference analysis is recalculated when PCS and/or POFS systems are changed. 6. APC states that FAST technology can be used with any relatively narrow band PCS system channel architecture employing a channel bandwidth of 5 megahertz or less. In particular, APC states that the FAST system can be used in conjunction with code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access, time division duplexed, and frequency division duplexed systems that use various transmit-receive frequency separations. APC asserts that testing of its FAST/CDMA system verified the ability of its technology to complete PCS calls without causing interference to existing microwave operations. 7. Cox was granted a preference for having developed and demonstrated PCS/cable plant interface technology and equipment that interfaces existing cable plant with new PCS wireless applications, resulting in spectrum-efficient applications for PCS. Cox first proposed using cable systems to provide backbone functions for PCS (instead of using the existing telephone or fixed microwave networks), applied to the Commission for a PCS experimental license, and successfully developed and tested equipment. Through experiments, Cox demonstrated cost-effective integration of PCS and cable networks that makes more efficient use of existing cable plant without impairing existing cable services. Cox designed, developed, and tested multi-backhaul configurations and multi-PCS radio systems with hand-off capability, centralized modulation, and distributed antenna configurations. These capabilities were realized through its design and development work, the key to which is its ``cable microcell integrator'' that Cox developed to connect PCS handsets to its embedded cable plant. 8. Using the existing cable plant in PCS network design permits economical and rapid deployment of PCS systems and substitution of existing infrastructure for increasingly scarce spectrum. The efforts of Cox advanced PCS system design by demonstrating the feasibility of integrating cable networks with full-featured PCS systems. Its developments potentially permit offering efficient PCS service in a timely, cost efficient manner with no impairment to existing cable services.
