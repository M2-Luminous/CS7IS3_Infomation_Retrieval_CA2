The Independent Commission for the Examination of the Property of GDR Parties and Mass Organizations has now released 400 million German marks; 60 percent of the money is to benefit economic restructuring and 40 percent is for social and cultural purposes. The Federal Government wanted to provide the funds for current expenses, but the Commission insisted on their exclusive use for investment or promotion of investment. A legal dispute over the money, particularly with the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS], cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the Federal Government is guaranteeing the funds provided to the laender, it was stated.
