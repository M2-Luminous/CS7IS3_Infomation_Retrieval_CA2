I will not permit, for any reason or motive, small groups interested in creating an atmosphere of intimidation through the escalation of actions that violate the law and the de jure state to interrupt the effort initiated by the government and people to set this country on the path which will make it a truly democratic state. 2. It is evident that the government's and people's efforts are achieving consolidation, and the reaction of these small groups is to use terrorism, intimidation, and attacks, among other methods, against state institutions and organizations, and what is even worse, against the news media, thereby violating the sacred right to freedom of expression and the human, individual, and collective right to inform and be informed. These extremist, radical groups, composed of sick and reactionary minds, know they have no valid arguments whatsoever to interrupt a process which, moreover, is irreversible and will lead us to the achievement of a different Guatemala. 3. The Guatemalan people have left behind the obscure pages of their history. We no longer want to pay with human lives as we regrettably did just a few hours ago. It is necessary for us to keep in mind that only a few days ago the government of the Republic and the General Command of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, with the United States as witness, signed an agreement to resume the peace negotiations, thereby demonstrating our political resolve and pledge to achieve peace in 1994. 4. The eminently positive reaction there has been to the upcoming popular consultation will strengthen state organizations. This is not advantageous for certain groups whose position is not precisely institutional, and which have misinformed and confused the population. They have even taken advantage of these terrorist acts to create a negative image of the government and, obviously, to attempt to create confrontations between state organizations. 5. I will not accept or tolerate such games because the Executive Branch, representing the Guatemalan people, is trying to purge Congress and the Supreme Court of Justice. As a president who is aware of his duties, I have chosen the most difficult path: the legal and peaceful path. This is why I want to achieve this goal through a popular consultation instead of creating a situation which the terrorists are trying to make the people believe exists. 6. It is the belief of my government, which has inspired the popular consultation, that it is necessary to build a society which will accept the existence of a variety of ideas and the discussion of opposing points of view or, basically, a society which, within a climate of respect and confidence in the law and institutions, will accept these elements as a necessity in the de jure state we are building. 7. It is for this reason that we are determined to preserve the continuity of this process by adopting the legal and constitutional measures that circumstances may render necessary, and to achieve peace and guarantee public order based on the principle that it is the state's duty to preserve itself. Therefore, the Executive Branch will protect and maintain institutional order, and incidents like these will not alter the people's participation in the public consultation, let alone its results. Thank you very much.
