One year after the military court sentenced 25 Army officers to prison for an alleged coup d'etat attempt, leaders of the 13 November Civic Movement said this was an unconstitutional ruling, therefore it is invalid. General Luis Pastor Vives, president of the organizing committee, called for the release of his comrades in arms, arguing that the government's uncompromising position had priority even though favorable circumstances exist, like the promulgation of the new Constitution. A message from Gen. Salinas Sedo was transmitted during a news conference in which he expressed his disagreement with his sentence although he emphasized he preferred prison to an undignified freedom. Meanwhile, his attorney indicated that Congress should pass an amnesty law for the prisoners.
