It also vigorously and categorically denies reports irresponsibly disseminated by Guatemalan Army spokespersons trying to use this situation to implicate the URNG and create an unfavorable climate at a time when, under a call from the United Nations, preliminary peace talks will be resumed with the Guatemalan Government and Army in Mexico on 6 January. The URNG has been, is, and will be respectful of Mexico's sovereignty. Therefore, our forces have no responsibility in these types of events. [Signed] URNG [Dated] 3 January 1994
