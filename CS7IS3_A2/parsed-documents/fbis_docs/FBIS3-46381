This is truly a breakthrough development in Marxist economics. What new situations has the "Decision on Matters Relating to the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure," which was adopted on this basis by the newly held Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, provided us and what breakthroughs and advances has the Decision made? We asked Liu Guoguang, an noted economist who participated in the drafting of the Decision to talk about his views on the question. He said: The Decision is the concrete, programmatic, and systematic embodiment of the goal of market economy set by the 14th CPC National Congress. This basic framework or general plan, which the Decision sketched, is in itself a breakthrough and progress. The basic framework or general plan has rich contents, of which some are innovative advances. Let us just cite the major ones. They are as follows: Establishing a Modern Enterprise System and Genuinely Energizing the Main Subjects of the Market Reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises has always been the focus of economic structural reform. Enterprises are the main subject of the market, and large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are the lead of the main subjects. If state-owned enterprises are not invigorated, it will be difficult to stimulate the market as a whole. Reviewing past events, Liu Guoguang said: In the past few decades we have introduced various reforms for enterprises, such as delegating power to enterprises, changing from profit delivery to tax payment, and practicing a contract system. Overall, state-owned enterprises have become more energetic than in the initial stage of reform. Nevertheless, the previous reforms have not touched the enterprise system under the planned economic structure. Thus, the problems, such as that no distinction was made between the functions of the government and those of the enterprises, property rights were confused, and everybody ate from the same big pot, have not yet been genuinely resolved. Moreover, the burdens shouldered by enterprises are very heavy and they could not free themselves from running society. Therefore, compared with nonstate-owned enterprises, most state-owned enterprises apparently lack vitality. According to reports from departments concerned, one-third of large and medium- sized state-owned enterprises incurred losses in operation overtly, another one-third of the enterprises suffered losses in operation covertly, and only the remaining one-third of enterprises were money-making. This shows that two-thirds of state-owned enterprises had problems with efficiency. Moreover, among enterprises operating with relatively good efficiency, there were problems, such as that the running ox was whipped, cries of help came from all corners of the country, and expenses were wantonly apportioned for them. As a result, enterprises were exhausted due to heavy burdens. All indications show that to effectively raise economic efficiency and invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we must switch enterprise reform from the policy readjustment with delegation of power and concession in revenue by the central authorities as the main content to the establishment of an enterprise system with the harmonious relations of property rights as the main content and proceed to seek a way of institutionalizing the integration of state-owned enterprises and the market economy. Through years of explorations, a consensus of understanding has been reached, that is, establishing a modern enterprise system. This is the direction of China's reform of large and medium-sized enterprises. Liu Guoguang maintained: Through the reform we must be clear about the relations of property rights. To put it another way, the ownership of enterprises' state-owned assets goes to the state and the enterprise has all the property rights, which is formed by the investment made the investors including the state, as a legal person and becomes an entity of legal person which has civil rights and interests and assumes civil responsibility. On this basis enterprises operate according to law, pay taxes in accordance with state regulations, organize production in line with the laws governing the market, assume full responsibility for profit and loss, and develop in line with the principle of selecting the superior and eliminating the inferior. This will help fully separate the functions of the government and those of the enterprises and help enterprises really become dynamic economic entities able to operate independently, be accountable for themselves, and improve and develop themselves. The formulation of this reform proposition is a very important breakthrough. The problems with enterprises are very complicated. Enterprise reform, in which any single move taken may affect the situation as a whole, should be carried out in a coordinated way. Illustrating with examples, Liu Guoguang said: It is impossible to solve such problems as redundant enterprise personnel, the burden of enterprises running society, and enterprises' past debts by making a single reform. To solve them, supporting reforms in other fields of endeavor are needed. This will help create conditions for the reform of establishing a modern enterprise system. He said: The Decision has taken these factor into account. This shows that in the coming reform, we must be determined to solve enterprises' outstanding past and present problems and effectively create conditions to operate state-owned enterprises as companies. However, to operate them as companies, we must establish a standard company system and a standard modern enterprise system rather than just put up a new nameplate. We must push enterprise reform to this new height. In Fostering a Market System, Placing Stress on Developing the Production Elements Market The prices of most commodities in China have now been liberalized and great advances have been made in the market system. Nevertheless, the Chinese market has been primarily a market for articles of daily use up to date. Most means of productions also have now become commodities, but the dual-track system remains operative in the prices of production means. Particularly, the market for such means of production as funds, capital, labor power, real estate, technology, and information is still in the embryonic stage. The current central decision suggested creating an environment of competition on an equal footing and forming a unified, open, competitive, and orderly big market and placed particular stress on developing the production elements market. Liu Guoguang pointed out: In the days to come, the commodity circulation system calls for further reform. The commodity market should be further developed and improved. This is not a problem. However, what is important is to fully subject production elements to the regulation and disposition by the market laws and put stress on developing the production elements market. The specific development plan has yet to be studied. However, we must notice that there have been important breakthroughs in this regard. For example, the labor market is an important factor of the production elements market. In the past we called it the labor service market or the labor employment market. This is a breakthrough in theory as compared with our understanding of the issue before reform was introduced. However, the terms were not as accurate and scientific as the labor market. Perhaps people may ask: Since laborers are masters of the country, why have they become commodities? As I see it, laborers and labor should be separated. As citizens, laborers are masters of the country, while labor can be fully traded in the market as a means of production. China's labor market is quite underdeveloped. In state-owned enterprises, personnel still cannot move fairly freely and a two-way choice mechanism has not taken shape. Enterprises are supporting large numbers of redundant personnel. Therefore, apparently it does not work to throw them to society lock, stock, and barrel. Generally speaking, it is still very difficult for an employee to seek another employment avenue or a new occupation for further development even if he wishes to. In the vast rural areas, labor mobility has long been developing. It is said that 50 million people have left their native villages and settled down in cities and towns. How should we manage this portion of people? How should we establish a market mechanism based on state centralized distribution, under which labor can move between urban and rural areas in an organized and secured way, so that workers and employing units can choose each other? These remain problems. Liu Guoguang held: Although rural labor is now moving, it is moving blindly. Many problems have not yet been solved satisfactorily, such as that employment is not secured and there is political inequality between the employer and the employed. They must be solved gradually. The Decision set the development, utilization, and rational disposition of labor resources as the starting point of the development of the labor market. It urged the creation of new employment opportunities, providing more jobs to workers in cities and towns, and encouraging and guiding superfluous rural labor to move in an orderly way. This is a new line of thinking effective in solving problems. The Decision Has a New Exposition on Macroregulation and Control and Offers Concrete Propositions to the Various Aspects of Macroregulation and Control The establishment of the socialist market economic structure is inseparable from a sound macroregulation and control system. It is necessary to change the functions of the government under the planned economy. In the market economy, the government manages the economy mainly with economic and legal means and necessary administrative fiats and no longer directly interferes in enterprises' production and operations. While clearly defining these contents, the Decision has offered relatively concrete propositions to the varies aspects of macroregulation and control. This is another important advance . For example, in banking reform the Decision clearly defined that the People's Bank of China should be run as a genuine central bank, whose function is to issue currency, and "take it as the prime goal to stabilize currency, regulate total money supply, and achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure in terms of total quantity." Moreover, it urged to set up policy-oriented banks and turn specialized banks into commercial ones. All these are very important improvements. In the past, these matters were discussed in the theoretical circles but they have now been included in the proposal. Moreover, interest and exchange rates should gradually become market-oriented. It is very important to abolish state prices for exchange rates and let exchange rates float under control. Again for example, in financial and taxation structural reform, the Decision clearly defined that the all-round financial contract system should be replaced by a tax sharing system. This is also an important advance and change. Turning the current local financial contract system into a tax sharing system based on a rational division of administrative power between central and local authorities will help readjust not only the relationship between central and local authorities, but also that between the state and enterprises. The all-round financial contract system has played a positive role in the past. However, as it developed it revealed its limitations. The main manifestation was that there was flexibility on the part of local authorities and enterprises while there was rigidity on the part of the state and central authorities. As a result, the central financial authorities were riddled with difficulties. Under these circumstances, the state was unable to make readjustments in important industries and regulate the gap between different regions. Now the Decision categorized the items of taxation necessary for safeguarding the state's rights and interests and practicing macroregulation and control as central taxes and the items of taxation which have a direct bearing on economic development as taxes shared by central and local authorities while suggesting substantiating local items of taxation so as to increase local tax revenues. This has helped rationally harmonize the relations between central and local authorities. Moreover, unification of tax laws and fairness in tax burdens are all important improvements. As far as the modes of distribution of after-tax profits between the state and the enterprise are concerned, there can be distribution of dividends according to the number of shares held, retention of profits according to the quantity of capital contributed, or occasional retention by enterprises of the profits to be handed over to the state for continued development. This way of doing things has thus more rationally harmonized the relations of interest between enterprises and the state. Moreover, in investment system reform, the Decision urged to gradually establish risk liabilities for corporate investment and bank credits. Different projects may adopt different modes of investment. This is a reform proposition formed on the basis of the ideas which have been deliberated for many years. Liu Guoguang said: The question of the relationship between planning, finance, and banking has in fact not been clearly stated in the past. The current central decision has defined the question. Under the traditional structure, planning has always been primary. There was a figurative formulation on the relationship of the three, stating: Planning orders dishes, finance foots the bill, and banking works out accounts. As structural reform progresses, the relationship has to change. To establish the socialist market economic structure, it is even more necessary to harmonize the relationship of the three in accordance with the laws governing the market economy. With an observation of the market economic developments of various countries, we can be clear that in the macroregulation and control of the market economy, there are two relatively important elements: Financial policy and banking policy. Although some countries also have long-term planning, it does not occupy an important position. From the formulation of the relationship between planning and finance as set by the Decision, we can see that although planning takes total supply and demand into consideration, it gives greater consideration to total supply and stresses making long-term structural readjustments. Although finance and banking also take total supply into consideration, they start mainly with the management of total demand and stress regulating and controlling short-term balances in terms of total quantity. There is a division of labor between financial authorities and banks. Financial authorities are generally in charge of the redistribution of national income, which is done without compensation. Repayments of capital with interest should be made for the use of credits. In the past, when financial authorities incurred deficits, they would make overdrafts from banks, turning financial deficits into credit deficits. In the market economy, this practice does not work any longer. Financial authorities and banks should be clearly separated. The former can borrow money from the latter but should not make overdrafts without compensation. In short, the Decision has a clear formulation of the relationship between planning, finance, and banking, which is a great step forward from the previous practice. When asked about his views on this year's reform situation at the conclusion of the interview, with full confidence Liu Guoguang said: The year 1994 will see the greatest number of reforms introduced and the biggest reform action taken. The Decision has provided a grand blueprint for reforms in the next step in the new year. As I see it, through the hard work of the entire party and the people throughout the country, this grand goal can be completely attained.
