FR941003-2-00058 FR941003-2-00034 B. Eligibility Each organization submitting a grant application under our SBIR Program must qualify as a small business concern. ``Small business concern'' is defined in section II.F. of this notice. In determining whether an applicant is a small business concern, an assessment will be made of several factors, including whether it is organized for profit, whether it is independently owned and operated, and whether it meets the size requirement of 500 or fewer employees. Whether the size requirement is met may depend on whether the applicant organization is affiliated with another organization whose employees, when added to those of the applicant organization, exceed 500. In conducting this assessment, all appropriate factors will be considered, including common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships. Affiliation exists when one concern controls or has the power to control the other, or there is third party control, or an identity of interest between or among parties exists so that affiliation may be found. Control may be affirmative or negative, and it is immaterial whether it is exercised so long as the power to control exists. Indeed, control can arise from a variety of circumstances. One example of a circumstance that could lead to a finding that an organization is controlling, or has the power to control, another organization is the sharing of common office space, employees, or other facilities (for example, laboratory space). Although access to special facilities or equipment in another organization is permitted (as in cases in which the SBIR applicant has entered into a subcontractual agreement with another institution for a specific, limited portion of the research project), research space occupied by an SBIR applicant must be space that is not generally shared with another organization and over which the applicant has exclusive control. When there is an indication of sharing of common employees, a determination will be made on a case- by-case basis of whether the sharing constitutes control or the power to control. Additionally, control or the power to control is generally considered to exist when ``key employees of one concern organize a new concern and serve as its officers, directors, principal stockholders, and/or key employees, and the one concern is furnishing or will furnish the other concern with subcontracting financial or technical assistance, bid or performance bond indemnification, and/or other facilities, whether for a fee or otherwise.'' Affiliation can also arise between or among two or more persons when an identity of interest exists, such as members of the same family or persons with common investments in more than one concern.
