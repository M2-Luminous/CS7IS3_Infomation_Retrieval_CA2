[Ganic] Praise be to God, the Muslim fighters are standing fast against the Serbo-Croatian aggression and the international plot against us. More than 100,000 Muslims are fighting with small-caliber weapons and few large-caliber weapons that they seized from the Serbs and Croats. The international plot continues. The arms embargo continues against us while arms supplies continue to reach the enemies before the eyes and ears of the whole world. It's an embargo imposed on the victim while the aggressor continues to receive arms to complete the plot and uproot Islam from Europe because Islam represents the thorn in Europe's side. Accordingly, the Europeans seek to obstruct the establishment of a European Islamic state in modern history, even if this would mean the annihilation of the entire Muslim people. We have become hostages on our own land, because the UN forces cannot protect us or even protect themselves. The UN forces cannot carry out the task that they have been entrusted with and they also cannot protect the humanitarian relief convoys. Furthermore, it was recently revealed to the world that these forces have harassed Bosnian women. Nevertheless, the Muslims have scored various victories on several fronts. But the Western media have purposely concealed these victories so that the Muslims would feel that the Bosnian cause is dead. [Salim] What are the most significant attacks to which the Muslims have so far been exposed? [Ganic] No doubt the principal objective behind all the attacks is to wipe out Islam regardless of the price. The rape of women and children falls within this context. There is also an attempt to obliterate the Islamic identity by deliberately killing Muslim ulema, burning Islamic books and schools, and destroying more than 800 mosques. Muslim towns and villages have been devastated as a result of the mass annihilation campaign. Nonetheless, we continue to cling to our Islamic ethics when we deal with the Serbian and Croatian prisoners. We have never tortured any prisoner. This was very much appreciated by some prisoners, who converted to Islam in view of its tolerance and its care of human dignity despite their atrocities and annihilation campaign. [Salim] What about the partition plan and the ongoing peace negotiations? [Ganic] The international plot is clear through the share of the land earmarked for the Muslims. We have rejected the share because it is not proportional with the percentage of our population, which is 45 percent. We will only accept a just peace that would safeguard our usurped rights regardless of the sacrifices and losses. I believe that the protracted peace negotiations are a waste of time because the Serbs and Croats continue to ignore the repeated appeals to stop the fighting. The negotiations aim to impose fait accompli because the international negotiators and mediators are wasting time. The proposed partition plan will lead to the displacement of 60 percent of Muslims. [Salim] How have you prepared for the freezing winter under the difficult conditions that the Bosnian Muslim fighters and refugees are going through? [Ganic] Actually, the tragedy is much greater than the resources available, something that has led to the martyrdom of hundreds of elderly people, children, and wounded people because of a shortage of relief supplies and medical aid. The Muslims are torn between the shelling and the freezing winter on the one hand and the shortage of supplies as a result of the repeated Serbian and Croatian attacks on the other hand. So what can we do in these conditions that are too tough for anybody to endure? The time has come for the Islamic countries to coordinate and cooperate among themselves to come to our rescue. All the Islamic states are responsible before God for their shortcomings toward us. Thus, I appeal to Islamic states to employ their financial and human resources as well as their diplomatic relations to put an end to the shedding of Muslim blood in Europe before we are all annihilated. This is because in such a case, Islam would never rise again in Europe and would be lost the way Islamic Spain was lost before. Faced with the current situation, there is nothing we could do other than hold on to God's words: "No soul but God can lay it bare" and "Verily God will defend from ill those who believe." [Salim] What about your visit to Egypt? [Ganic] I came to Egypt because it represents a great source of momentum in defense of our cause, in view of its good relations with the major states that have the power to adopt international resolutions. Egypt has a major role to play as a torchbearer of Islam, the home country of al-Azhar, and the country where every Muslim who suffers from injustice and oppression takes refuge. We hope that in the near future Egypt's good relations with the major states will bear fruit and the conspiracy against the Bosnian Muslims will cease. [Salim] The media has reported divisions among the Muslims of Bosnia. How true is this? [Ganic] These were just some differences in views, but they are over, thank God. All Muslims are now united in the face of aggression, because the deluge will not spare any Muslim. Thus, we are now united, thank God, under a single leadership and there are no divisions as the Western media have reported. These media have exaggerated the matter as if it were an inter-Muslim war. I warn Muslims all over the world that the conspiracy against Bosnia is not the end of the conspiracy against Islam in Europe, but rather the first one that will be followed by others in the future.
