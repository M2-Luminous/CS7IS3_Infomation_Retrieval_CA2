In line with a formal agreement signed Saturday [14 May] night, the Georgian and Abkhazian units are to move 12 km away from the river and a peacekeeping contingent is to take up positions inside the 24-km buffer zone. On Sunday, a member of the Abkhazian delegation and a special emissary of the chairman of the Abkhazian parliament Andrey Djerghenia said Russian troops would most likely serve on the disengagement force. He said the 2,500 to 3,000 strong contingent would be introduced before the end of May. Russian units deployed in Abkhazia would make part of it. On Georgian demand, peacekeepers would patrol the Kodor canyon after the withdrawal from it of Georgian forces, Djerghenia said. According to Djerghenia, the introduction of a peacekeeping contingent into Abkhazia paved a way to the repatriation of refugees, first of all to the Galski District. In Moscow, the Georgian and Abkhazian negotiators agreed to form a joint commission on practical problems in the fields of power production, transport and comunication, environmental protection, etc. The four-member commission would be expected to start work on 1 June in Sochi. The delegations agreed to discuss the status of Abkhazia next month in Geneva.
