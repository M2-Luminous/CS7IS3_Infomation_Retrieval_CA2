FBIS3-30473 "dreeu023__a94031" FBIS-EEU-94-023-A Document Type:Daily Report 3 February 1994 ANNEX Yugoslavia: Kosovo Police Reportedly Arrest Former PDP Secretary AU0102210694 Tirana ATA in English 1123 GMT 1 Feb 94 AU0102210694 Tirana ATA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tirana, February 1 (ATA) -- Well-informed sources in Tetove report that Mithat Emini, former secretary of the Democratic Prosperity Party of Macedonia [PDP], was arrested on January 28. The same sources relate this act of police with the arrest some time ago of nine Albanians, one of whom was in the post of the deputy defence minister. Despite statement by its number one, Lubomir Ferckovski, that the question is closed now, Macedonian police continued with other arrests. Detention of the former senior official of the main party of the Albanians in Macedonia is a warning that other arrests will be made. Another proof to this is also the fact that the date of the trial for the above group of Albanians arrested by the end of 1993 is not yet fixed.
