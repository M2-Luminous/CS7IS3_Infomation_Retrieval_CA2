FBIS4-5777 "dreas072_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-072 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 South Korea DPRK Reportedly Asks U.S. To Resume Contact DPRK Reportedly Asks U.S. To Resume Contact SK1404025394 Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean 14 Apr 94 p 2 SK1404025394 Seoul CHOSON ILBO Korean BFN [Chong Hae-yong reports from Washington] [Text] North Korea was learnt to have recently proposed to the United States that they resume unofficial working-level contacts to discuss means for a breakthrough in the nuclear issue. This comes at a time when the United States has beefed up firm actions against North Korea's unwillingness to accept nuclear inspections, through consecutive contacts with the ROK, China, and Japan. The talks, however, are unlikely to be realized by next week since U.S. Defense Secretary Perry and Robert Gallucci, the special envoy on the North Korean nuclear issue, will be visiting the ROK, China, and Japan. North Korea also does not usually make moves before or after Kim Il-song's birthday on 15 April. A high-level U.S. source on 13 April assessed that North Korea proposed the contact to determine the true intentions of the United States since the United States and the ROK have taken active moves with China, Japan, and Russia aimed at strengthening the international cooperative system following the adoption of the UN Security Council President's statement calling on North Korea to accept inspections. North Korea apparently hopes to resume contacts in order to open a dialogue channel with the United States prior to the next phase of action the UN Security Council may pursue following the early May deadline in the Council President's statement, the source added.
