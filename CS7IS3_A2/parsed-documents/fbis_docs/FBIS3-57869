Alain Juppe is interviewed by Michel Barthelemy: [Begin Juppe recording] Our soldiers on the ground are carrying out a difficult task with admirable courage. The whole question is to define their mission. I think that the leadership of UNPROFOR was right to raise a certain number of questions. The current situation is intolerable. Recently, the European Union gathered all the parties concerned around a table in Brussels. We particularly asked them one question: Do you agree to observe a truce during Christmas? They all said yes, and they all went back on their word. We cannot work for peace with parties to the conflict preparing for war. This is not a reason for one to be discouraged. France should continue its action as it has been doing for several months now. As you remember, the UN secretary general thought an extra 7,500 soldiers are necessary in the safety zones. Only France strengthened its force last July, when it sent more than 1,000 additional troops. Where are the others? Where are the missing 6,500? [end recording]
