The return of the fishermen and their boat, the Taehung-ho No. 27, follows an agreement reached between South Korean and Chinese officials last Friday in the southern port of Shanghai. The fishermen, all of whom appeared healthy despite their long detention, said they left Shanghai for Pusan last Sunday, 16 days after being seized. The Pusan Maritime Police are questioning the fishermen to ascertain the situation at the time of the seizure. Eleven fishermen from the Songkwang-ho No. 2 were whisked away by a Chinese patrol boat around noon on April 29 in waters 220 miles southwest of Mosulpo, Cheju Island, where they were drifting due to engine failure, the fishermen said. The Chinese patrol boat was initially tugging the fishing boat but it cut the tow rope when the Songkwang-ho No. 1 gave chase, they said. About half an hour later the same day, the Taehung-ho No. 27 was seized by another Chinese patrol boat in waters 175 miles southwest of Mosulpo when the fishing boat also suffered engine trouble, they insisted. All 11 fishermen on board were taken away. China had demanded a fine of 100,000 U.S. dollars for violating Chinese waters and illegal fishing. They later lowered the amount to 13,728 dollars, covering the price of fish allegedly illegally caught by the South Korean boats and the fishermen's living expenses during their detention.
