And since robbery and mass theft have become possible with the permission and encouragement of that governmental authority, it itself is becoming criminal, turning corruption into an ordinary, everyday phenomenon. At the same time, the support of international capital is making the Russian government a thoroughly comprador-based, antinational force. The September-October coup d'etat was, in fact, aimed at bringing the form of government into conformity with its new essence. The breakup of the system of soviets has turned representative bodies in the center and at the local level into powerless appendages of executive structures. The drastic limitation of the powers of parliament has been accompanied by the practically complete disappearance from it of the representatives of the bulk of the population--workers, the intelligentsia and peasants. Parliament and local representative bodies are being filled with bureaucrats. The control of elective representatives over the administrative system is being totally curtailed. Connections among the supreme and local representative bodies are being destroyed. In this way an autocratic regime is being formed that relies on an immense--twice as large as three years ago--army of bureaucrats. Even G. Popov admits that the Soviet union has been replaced by none other than a "bureaucratic system in which property, by and large, will be distributed among various groups of bureaucrats (central and local, federal and industrial, official and mafia-based), and the state form of government will become a 'bureaucratic democracy' as a mechanism for reconciling the interests of individual groups of the bureaucratic class." The inordinate strengthening of a presidential administration that is controlled by no one and nothing has, for all practical purposes, destroyed the governing of the country. The president and his apparatus rule over all branches of government without reckoning with parliament, duplicating the efforts of the government per se, and appointing administrators, judges and procurators at their own discretion. What we have is an intensely authoritarian mechanism based on a vertical bureaucratic hierarchy. The Second All-Russian Conference of the Russian Federation Communist Party that was held this April developed a number of measures aimed at democratizing the political sphere and peacefully overcoming the existing confrontation. And I believe that these proposals of ours could be taken as the basis for the Accord in the Name of Russia movement. Their essence lies in the need to overcome the crying imbalance among the branches of government, an imbalance which has already brought the country to the brink of national disaster more than once in the history of the Russian state. Today the executive authority is irresponsible as the result of the almost total lack of any control over it, and the legislative authority is irresponsible as the result of its total lack of rights. It is impossible to enhance and redistribute responsibility without redistributing powers between the branches of government and strengthening their mutual democratic control. To accomplish this, in our view, the following is necessary: --overcoming the existing lack of coordination between the chambers of the Federal Assembly and defining the sphere of their joint, equal jurisdiction, as well as defining relations between the Federal Assembly and the executive branch; --overcoming the dual subordination of the ministries and departments to the head of state and the head of government. Their full operational subordination to the prime minister. The clarification and substantial limitation of the jurisdiction and functions of the president and his administration; --a shift to the principle of the accountability of the government to representative bodies; the legislative determination by the Federal Assembly of the government's structure and staffing; and the submission to it for approval of a government program defining its basic goals and the means and projected dates for attaining them, as well as approval of the government's composition in terms of personnel; the possibility of the government's resignation at the initiative of the Federal Assembly in the event of its deviation from its program; --the exclusion of the agencies that manage state television and radio from the system of the executive branch. The formation of them, based on the principles of parity, by the parliament, the government and the judicial branch, taking into account the opinions of political parties and occupational and public organizations. The ensuring of equal access to the air by representatives of all branches of government, political parties, and occupational and other public organizations; --the restoration of the full vertical hierarchy of representative bodies of authority and extension of the principle of the accountability of executive bodies to representative bodies to all levels of government, and the return of local government bodies to the system of state authority; --the strict delimitation of spheres of jurisdiction between higher and lower levels of state authority, and enhancement of the independence of the latter in exercising their powers; --agreement that the priority in the policy of strengthening Russian statehood is the restoration of the union state on a new, voluntary basis. Denunciation of the Belovezhskaya Agreement insofar as it pertains to the dissolution of the Union Treaty. Of course, in order to attain the goals outlined it is necessary to revive the constitutional process both within the framework of the Federal Assembly and in the operation of the Constitutional Court. In our opinion, the court should consider the question of the correctness of whether the results of the 12 December 1993 referendum on adoption of the new Constitution were correctly and lawfully interpreted. The essence of the proposed changes lies in the fact that they are aimed at attaining a real, as opposed to a merely declared, state of civil peace, by which we mean not universal harmony and not the elimination of every conceivable public conflict, but an aggregate of social conditions and political procedures that have been agreed to among various social forces and in the context of which the conflicts that exist among them are resolved by exclusively peaceful, nonviolent means. The struggle among various tendencies is normal and inevitable, and there will always be winners and losers in it, but it should not result in the destruction oft he state and its economy, the social sphere and spiritual life. It is on this basis that Accord in the Name of Russia should structure its activities. The basic steps in the development of our movement's work to organize the popular masses for the restoration of legality in the country could be as follows: --the establishment at the local level of movement committees, including on them the representatives of all parties and organizations that support Accord in the Name of Russia; --the establishment, on the basis of the movement, of an election bloc capable of winning victory in any elections. The coordination and support of candidates in elections in districts, the formation of authoritative party slates, and work on making the necessary adjustments in election legislation; --the preparation of proposals for creating a government of popular trust. On the basis of election results, such a government could turn from a shadow government into an actual government of popular trust. At the same time, the opposition could begin right away resolutely arguing for the creation of a government of the parliamentary majority that from the very outset would reject the policy of "shock reforms" and subordination of the country to the interests of foreign capital; --in preparing for presidential elections, Accord in the Name of Russia could orient itself toward the creation of a kind of "state council" consisting of the most prestigious leaders. One or two agreed-upon candidates for the office of president could be nominated from among its members. In our view, one of the new president's first acts should be to put through an amendment to the Constitution abolishing the institution of the presidency and restoring genuine democracy in the form of a unified system of soviets of people's deputies.
