The Minister for Panchayat Raj, Mr D.K. Samarasimha Reddy, said had he (Nehru) not laid the foundation for democracy, the country would not have seen such a development in spite of experiencing turbulent times on many an occasion. He said Pandit Nehru, who understood the crux of the Indian polity, thought it fit to further cement the democratic set up. "He was instrumental in giving a right mix of socialism and capitalism to suit the Indian conditions," he observed. Mr Samarasimha Reddy said the former Prime Minister time and again used to remind the people to attain self-reliance while maintaining cordial relationship with America and Russia. For the over all development, Panditji had introduced the Five-Year Plan and gave impetus to industrial and agricultural development. "To sustain a democracy, Panditji has also framed the three-wheel vehicle -- the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. If any one of these wheels fails, democracy is bound to collapse," he added. The Minister described Nehru as a true democrat, a statesman par excellence and a visionary who had ensured the country the present status of a developing nation. "He was also a true secular," he pointed out. All through his life, Nehru opposed import of technology and hence he had laid a strong foundation for scientific and research laboratories. "None could forget Panditji's contribution to the technological capabilities." He said Nehru was the architect of the Non-aligned Movement and the father of the `Panch Shell.' The Reserve Bank of India Director, Mr Ch Hanumantha Rao, said even Russian economists were attracted to Nehru's policies. He said democracy was the only tool for any country's development and cited how Communism collapsed in Russia and elsewhere in Europe. He said the day was not far when even China would get attracted to democracy. Mr Mohit Sen, Chairman, United Communist Party, Dr K. Keshav Rao, Chairman of the Rajiv Technology Mission, Ms Nannapaneni Rajakumari, Chief Whip, and Mr P. Goverdhan Reddy, JNNYC Chairman, also spoke. The Congress MP (Member of Parliament), Mr T. Venkatram Reddy, who was to participate in the seminar, could not attend. In his speech, which was read out in absentia, Mr Reddy said: "Even after three decades had passed since Panditji left us, his impact on every aspect of national life continues to be felt. Such was his contribution during the freedom struggle and as a leader of the nascent free India that he was the unchallenged leader and a darling of the masses." He said though Panditji was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, his sacrifices and self-denial were supreme. Panditji was instrumental in India's modernisation process and introducing a scientific temper in order to eradicate poverty and fighting superstition, orthodoxy and such customs and practices that came in the way of progress and development. He said no historian dared to forget Nehru's contribution as a world leader, as a man of the masses and as a human being without whom India would not have been committed to the ideals of secularism, socialism and planning.
