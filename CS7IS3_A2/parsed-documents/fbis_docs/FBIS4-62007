FBIS4-62007 "drsov092_v_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-092 Daily Report 12 May 1994 Lithuania Slezevicius on EU Membership, Russian Troops Slezevicius on EU Membership, Russian Troops LD1105115794 LD1105115794 BFN [Editorial Report] Vilnius Radio Vilnius Network in Lithuanian at 0700 GMT on 11 May carries a 30-minute live relay from the prime minister's office in Vilnius on the Value Added Tax and problems related to it. Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius made a brief comment at the beginning of the program concerning the latest current political events in the country. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, together with other East and Central European countries, have become associate members of the Western European Union. Speaking about the importance of this, Slezevicius said: "This is a step forward in increasing military and political cooperation between East and West. It is my pleasure to note that Lithuania, together with other Baltic countries, has become an associate member of the union significantly earlier than planned. This indicates that the European Union [EU] is essentially changing its position on the Baltic states; it is changing its stance in the sense of accelerating integration." He also said that when the agreement on free trade with the EU was signed this summer "our aspiration to become an associate member of the EU will become more realistic." Slezevicius did not deny that support from other Western countries was needed for Lithuania to achieve this objective. He said: "We believe that Germany -- it begins a term of Presidency of the EU on 1 July -- will render us assistance as promised by Mr. Kinkel, and, by the way, other countries also support us on this. I believe that we will achieve good progress in this sphere." Speaking about the recent statement made by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev concerning a possible increase of the Russian military contingent on the territory of the Republic of Estonia -- allegedly for the protection of the rights of the local ethnic Russians -- the prime minister said that this "causes concern" and "could only be seen as exerting pressure on the sovereign state of Estonia." The task of the Lithuanian Government, according to the prime minister, is "to express solidarity with Estonia and protest acts of this kind."
