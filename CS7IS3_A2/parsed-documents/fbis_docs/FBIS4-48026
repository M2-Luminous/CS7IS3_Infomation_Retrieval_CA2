Hundreds of people made their way to work in the sprawling commercial metropolis, while journalists told AFP that the protest call was also ignored in the federal capital Abuja and the second business city, Kano in the north. Not many commercial vehicles were seen in Lagos early Monday, but this may have been due to a persistent fuel shortage and rain early in the morning, observers said. The CD, an umbrella grouping for some 40 pro-democracy and human rights organisations, last week called on workers across Nigeria to stay at home Monday in its first protest against the latest military regime, which it described as "illegitimate". But the Campaign failed to win the support of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), which urged workers not to follow the CD call, warning that it would not be able to defend any of them if they abstained from work. "It does not make any sense to embark on any strike action now," an NLC official told AFP on Monday. "The call looks senseless and ill-timed as there seems to be no justification for it." The Lagos State government, in a special early morning radio announcement urged workers to go to their jobs and described the CD's call as "unpatriotic and irrational." The call for protest was seen as a test of support for the CD, which last Tuesday issued a statement blaming the Abacha regime for the "catastrophic" state of Nigeria. The country, though a major oil producer, was then gripped by drastic fuel shortages, which led the military government to call in representatives of oil companies to discuss measures to remedy the situation.
