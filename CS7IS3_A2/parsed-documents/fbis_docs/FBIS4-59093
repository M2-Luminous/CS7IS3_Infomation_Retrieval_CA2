I would just like to reassure the brother citizens that the basic foodstuffs are available. Ships are arriving at the ports with all kinds of foodstuffs including rice, sugar, flour, wheat, milk, and other things. These are being distributed all over the republic. As for our corporation, its branches are fully open to our citizens so that they may obtain their needs easily and at official prices. If there are difficulties in receiving any commodity in areas where there are no branches of the corporation, the latter loads trucks and sells these materials directly from the trucks. Let the people be reassured. The corporation's branches contain all the basic commodities. The corporation is at the service of all and during all circumstances. [Al-'Azari] Thank you, brother 'Abdallah. Would you like to offer any advice in this regard? [Al-Hadrami] I just want to reassure the citizens and tell them that the country is in good shape and Yemen is proceeding from one victory to another. The available foodstuffs, whether in the stores or on the road to the stores or arriving at ports are sufficient. There are no shortages or disorders in supplies. The greedy merchants will be made to account for their actions. The Supply and Trade Ministry has already warned them. Citizens should cooperate with the state in this regard and must report all those who tamper with the prices and those who exploit the situation and hoard foodstuffs. [Al-'Ayzari] This means there is no shortage of any basic foodstuff? [Al-Hadrami] No, everything is available. The strategic reserves are there and the ships are arriving, and the branches are full. Everything is available.
