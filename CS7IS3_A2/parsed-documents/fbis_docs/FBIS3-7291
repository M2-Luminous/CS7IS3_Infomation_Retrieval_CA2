Japan did away with its special treatment of Indochinese refugees on March 4 in line with an international agreement on the screening system. Vietnamese boat people arriving in Japan in the future will receive the same treatment as any other arrival. Of the 13,768 boat people who landed since May 1975, when Vietnamese refugees first arrived, 3,416 are Vietnamese who opted for permanent settlement, officials said. The ministry said that in the same period 3,498 Chinese nationals posing as Vietnamese refugees also arrived in Japan, although their numbers have fallen off in recent years. Other Vietnamese have gone to third countries to settle and those posing as refugees have been forcibly repatriated. A June 1989 international conference on Indochinese refugees adopted the set of special screening measures to determine whether they qualified for refugee status. But with subsequent changes in Vietnam, a conference in February elected to revise the measures, and Japan's cabinet gave its approval to abandon them as of March 4.
