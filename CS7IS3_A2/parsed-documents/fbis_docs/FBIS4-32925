FBIS4-32925 "drlat104_r_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-104 Daily Report 26 May 1994 Peru OAS Report on Ex-President Garcia Protested OAS Report on Ex-President Garcia Protested PY2705140394 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1955 GMT 26 May 94 PY2705140394 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 26 May (EFE) -- The Peruvian Government has expressed "its surprise and concern" to the OAS over the publication of a secret Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC) report on former President Alan Garcia's case. Reports from Washington state that in the report the IAHRC reportedly rules against the Peruvian Government in the case Alan Garcia raised against the Alberto Fujimori administration for "illegal harassment and trial." In an official communique issued today in Lima, the Peruvian Foreign Ministry states that both Peru and the IAHRC "are barred from divulging or disclosing the IAHRC's preliminary report in compliance with pertinent regulations." The communique adds that the Peruvian Government deplores the disclosure of this report because "it undermines the confidentiality" which, according to the Human Rights Convention of the Americas, must prevail in the preliminary stage. The Foreign Ministry also expresses "its surprise and concern" over the incident, which it believes may affect "a just analysis of pending issues to be assessed by the IAHRC." The Foreign Ministry communique asserts that the IAHRC has issued a preliminary report and that this organization "does not issue rulings or pass sentences at this or at any other level." It adds that what was disclosed concerning the case involving the former Peruvian president "does not interfere in the investigations or in the judicial proceedings" to which Alan Garcia must respond in Peru. Garcia has several trials pending in Peru for the alleged illegal possession of guns and misappropriation of funds while in public office. Reports from Washington state that the IAHRC has established that the "the Peruvian Government is responsible for violating the right to personal safety and freedom of Alan Garcia Perez and his wife, and the right to personal protection conferred upon his children by the Human Rights Convention of the Americas." Garcia also sued the Peruvian Government before the IAHRC for a raid on his private residence that the military conducted on 5 April 1992. On this date, President Alberto Fujimori perpetrated a coup d'etat as a result of which he closed Congress, dismantled the judiciary, and assumed complete power with the support of the military.
