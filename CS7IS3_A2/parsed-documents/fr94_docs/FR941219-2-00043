FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Janet L. Andersen, Acting Director, Biopesticides and Pollution Prevention Division (7501W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460 Office location and telephone number: Rm. CS51B6, Westfield Building North Tower, 2800 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202 (703)308&hyph;8712 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 20, 1994, EPA received an application to amend an EUP from Ciba-Geigy Corporation, Seed Division (Ciba Seeds), P.O. Box 12257, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709&hyph;2257. The EUP application is assigned EPA File Symbol 66736&hyph;EUP&hyph;1. In the Federal Register of November 2, 1994 (59 FR 54904), EPA announced issuance of an extension for this EUP. The approved EUP extension allows the use of 197.1 grams of the Bacillus thuringiensis d -endotoxin (produced by a bacterially derived CryIA(b) gene in corn plants) in seeds planted on 190 acres of corn to evaluate the control of the European corn borer and other lepidopteran pests. The program is currently authorized only in the States of California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wisconsin and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The experimental use permit extension is effective for plantings from April 12, 1994 to March 31, 1995, and associated activities such as collection of field data and harvesting and processing of seed after last planting. Corn grown under this permit is not permitted to enter commerce. Ciba Seeds has applied to amend the EUP by diverting plantings of up to 45 acres of transgenic Bt corn from previously authorized plantings in Hawaii and Illinois to Texas. Thus, the additional test sites will not increase the total acreage authorized under the current EUP. Upon review of the Ciba Seeds application, any comments received in response to this notice and any other relevant information, the U.S. EPA will set conditions under which the experiments will be conducted. Any issuance of an EUP amendment approval will be announced in the Federal Register . Dated: December 9, 1994.
