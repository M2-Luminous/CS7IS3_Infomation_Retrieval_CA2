He is a full member of the International and Russian engineering academies and a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In the first days of January 1993 and, accordingly, in the final days of the presidency of George Bush, the Russian-American START II treaty on a reduction in strategic offensive arms was signed in Moscow. Many observers were astonished at that time at the incomprehensible haste in the signing and, most importantly, at the necessity for inviting to Moscow a president who had just two weeks of his term to go. Boris Yeltsin was probably in urgent need of international confirmation of his status following the first major (and extremely unsuccessful for the president) clash with parliament (Congress of People's Deputies) in December 1992. There arose, naturally, quite widespread suspicions that START II was an insufficiently weighed, opportunist document that by the year 2003 would have placed Russia in a position of strategic inequality. But if START II was signed in a hurry, it had been prepared quite thoroughly, and not only by specialists of Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs but also of the General Staff, what is more. "START II is a result of the joint efforts of two ministries--Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense. Never before have the two departments worked so closely and in such a friendly working atmosphere," Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Army General Staff, maintains. The group of experts from the Ministry of Defense was headed by General Nikolayev, incidentally, who is now commander in chief of border forces and who was at that time first deputy chief of the General Staff. The former Supreme Soviet greeted the treaty warily and after several hearings postponed ratification to the fall of 1993 in order never to return to it. Altogether, the treaty could not have been considered in earnest, for that matter, until the fate of the former Soviet strategic arms in Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine had been decided and until these countries had ratified the START I treaty and subscribed to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Now all the preliminary conditions have been more or less fulfilled, and the time has come for the ratification of START II by the new Federal Assembly. The ratification or nonratification will determine for many years to come Russia's defense policy and the structure of its strategic nuclear force. But, in any event, the old strategic weapons systems added to our armory in the 1970's and 1980's will have to be eliminated since their service life is coming to an end. As a result, in the current Strategic Missile Forces system armory there is only one system of ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles--the Topol--that simultaneously corresponds to the terms of START II and is sufficiently modern to be able to survive (with a certain modernization) until the year 2015. In the next year or two the Russian military and political leadership will have to choose: either stick with the Topol system, as the basis of the future ground-based Strategic Missile Forces, or immediately begin the development of another prospective intercontinental missile.... "According to open press data, six catastrophes accompanied by the sinking of the boats, explosions, and fires, the result of which were the loss of nuclear munitions and missiles and also the loss of life of personnel, have occurred in the course of the operation of several dozen nuclear submarines. But no one today is raising the question of abandoning the use of strategic nuclear weapons on nuclear submarines." START II Compared with the START I treaty, the START II treaty alters the structure of the strategic nuclear force thanks to the elimination in the Strategic Missile Forces of missiles with multiple reentry vehicles. It is necessary in fulfilling START II conditions to have dismantled 675-780 launchers (3,775-3,880 warheads) by the years 2000-2003 and during this time to have created in exchange a grouping of 800-900 single-warhead missiles. With regard to the country's actual economic situation, it will have been possible, most likely, to deploy only 600-700 ground-based ICBM's, that is, in practice we will not have assimilated the quota of 3,500 warheads for the strategic nuclear force. It would be desirable, therefore, to adjust a number of the provisions of START II prior to its ratification: the "automatic" termination of the treaty in the event of a violation of the provisions of the 1972 ABM Treaty and stricter control of the possibility of the return to the grouping of the warheads removed in accordance with the treaty from the missiles and bombers. In addition, it would be desirable to extend the timeframe of the reduction in the Strategic Missile Forces to the year 2005, which would make it possible to make fuller use of the service life of the ICBM's to be destroyed, compensating for the insufficient funding of strategic nuclear force development programs. This adjustment ensues directly from Russia's economic difficulties, but it does not alter the cardinal provisions of the program for the development of the Strategic Missile Forces, merely shifts the time scale for its realization. Prospect--Single-Warhead Missiles The treaty between the USSR and the United States limiting strategic offensive arms (SALT II), which Leonid Brezhnev and Jimmy Carter signed in 1979, determined an overall permissible number of delivery systems and also the number of ICBM's with multiple reentry vehicles (820). As a result, it was advantageous to have in the grouping the maximum permissible number of ICBM's with multiple reentry vehicles. START I limited to a considerably greater extent the number of weapons compared with the number of delivery systems, which determined the prospective nature of an increase in the single-warhead part of the grouping. Although according to the terms of START I it was possible to preserve some part of the ICBM's with multiple reentry vehicles, including 154 heavy missiles, the overall limitation on the number of warheads compelled increased survivability and an aspiration to the single-warhead grouping. After all, the destruction by one weapon of an ICBM with 10 warheads pays, and the destruction of a single-warhead missile with one weapon is only equivalent exchange. Thus the switch to single-warhead ICBM's was the arterial direction for the development of the Strategic Missile Forces grouping adopted in 1991 together with START I, and the terms of START II merely accelerated the timeframe of this switch. Liquid Fuel The Strategic Missile Forces grouping had as of 1 January 1993 six classes of ICBM's, including four classes using a liquid fuel that is highly toxic and dangerous in operation--"heptyl" (asymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine--P.F.)--and two classes using compound [smesevoy] solid fuel that is nontoxic and considerably safer in operation, including the Topol single-warhead mobile missiles. The solid fuel is charged under plant conditions, repositories, fuel tanks, and fuel supply lines in the line units are not needed, and fuel vapor discharges are excluded. Solid fuel may be used for the ICBM's in both the fixed- and mobile-basing versions, which affords opportunities for standardization, whereas it is dangerous to use liquid fuel in mobile missiles. We would mention also that our solid fuel is in a number of its specifications superior to the fuel used in the United States' ICBM's, and in terms of the energetics of the missiles as a whole, the solid-fuel systems are only very negligibly inferior to their liquid-fuel counterparts. Thus all program developers have unanimously concluded that the prospective Strategic Missile Forces grouping should have solid-fuel ICBM's. ICBM Basing Modes The "Fundamental Provisions of the Russian Federation Military Doctrine" define as the purpose of policy in the sphere of nuclear weapons: removal of the danger of nuclear war by way of deterring the unleashing of aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies. They also define the mission of the strategic nuclear force: maintaining the composition and status of the strategic nuclear force at a level providing for the assured infliction of the desired damage on an aggressor under any conditions. These doctrinal provisions compel the consideration as the main scenario of the use of the strategic nuclear force and the Strategic Missile Forces the infliction on an aggressor of unacceptable damage in a retaliatory strike, that is, after the enemy's ICBM and SLBM warheads have delivered a strike against the territory of Russia. In the struggle between launcher protection facilities and the accuracy of warhead delivery to target that has gone on for several decades, victory for the coming decade goes to the accuracy of the missile guidance systems. A MX missile warhead delivered to a launch silo with the current degree of protection (of the order of 100 kg per square centimeter) would destroy it with 0.998 probability, and warheads of the Minuteman-3M ICBM and the Trident-2 SLBM, with 0.921 probability. Two warheads of the Trident-2 SLBM would destroy a launch silo with 0.994 probability. A further increase in launch silo protection requiring big outlays for construction would easily be countered by the use of guided warheads capable with a probability of close to 1 of destroying launch silos with a protection an order of magnitude greater than is customary at the present time. The data presented in respect to launch silo survivability raise no doubts since the well-known algebraic dependence incorporating three parameters: protection of the launch silo and the power and accuracy of the warhead to be delivered to it, are used for the calculation. The development of offensive arms has in the past 20 years forced the missile engineers of the USSR (Russia) and the United States to earnestly seek basing versions with an indeterminate location of the ICBM and its launcher. Mobile ground and railroad launchers have been developed, whose survival, even with the prospective means of space reconnaissance (radar, infrared, optical), in a retaliatory strike is six to seven times higher than the survivability of a modern launch silo with a strike against it of one warhead from a Trident-2 missile. The United States completed the development of ground and railroad ICBM sites, but abandoned their deployment under the conditions strategic arms reduction since it has a potential for a retaliatory strike, thanks to the modernization of submarines and their fitting with Trident-2 missiles, two to three times greater than Russia. In the USSR mobile sites were deployed at the end of the 1980's, which considerably enhanced the efficiency of the strategic nuclear force in the delivery of a retaliatory strike. In the course of preparation of START I the main efforts of the American side were geared to various prohibitions and limitations of the Strategic Missile Forces' mobile grouping: a ban on the use of several shelters (launchers) for one ICBM, a ban on the Strategic Missile Forces' whole mobile grouping, a ban on the use of railroad sites, limitation of the strength of the mobile grouping, limitation of the mobile ICBM patrolling areas, notification of changes of position, and so forth. It should be noted that, for the most part, our delegation succeeded in preserving an acceptable strength of the mobile grouping and conditions whereby it remains sufficiently effective. Today approximately one-third of the ICBM's in the Russian Strategic Missile Forces are mobile, including 72 launchers with Topol missiles that are currently being withdrawn from Belarus. It is contemplated that in the future the Strategic Missile Forces will have 60-70 percent mobile ICBM's and 30-40 percent fixed launch silos. The contribution of the mobile sites to the efficiency of a retaliatory strike of the Strategic Missile Forces here will constitute 80-85 percent, and to the efficiency of the strategic nuclear force, 60-70 percent. Vulnerability of Mobile Sites in a Conventional War During operations in position areas of sabotage groups or in the event of a breach of the front of our forces in the course of a conventional war where combat operations are conducted in the disposition of Strategic Missile Forces' units and combined units, mobile sites are more vulnerable than fixed sites. The efficiency of the operations of aviation against mobile and silo launchers with guided aerial bombs or cruise missiles with conventional shells is approximately identical. One single unit of ammunition would with a high degree of probability destroy a protected launch silo thanks to greater hitting accuracy, and it would be easier to destroy a less protected mobile launcher, but harder to find it among several combat launch positions or on traffic routes. It should be noted, however, that the views of the military-political leadership on the possibility of an aggressor's premeditated destruction with impunity of strategic nuclear weapons in the course of a conventional war are now changing. The "Fundamental Provisions of the Military Doctrine" note that massive strikes against the strategic nuclear force by conventional weapons could bring about a retaliatory nuclear strike. I would like to see this provision strengthened: A premeditated attack with the use of conventional weapons on the strategic nuclear force means the guaranteed start of a nuclear war. It is essential to enshrine this provision politically since only the United States and NATO have the possibility of inflicting a "nonnuclear" strike against the Russian strategic nuclear force, whereas the destruction of the nuclear weapons of the United States by conventional arms is highly problematical. Thus possible losses of mobile and fixed ICBM's in a conventional war are not a characteristic of the arms but, rather, the degree of tolerance of the leadership of the country observing the annihilation of strategic weapons reduced to a reasonable minimum. The danger of the destruction in a conventional war of mobile ICBM's and the possible consequences are not in the least bit different from the danger of the destruction of nuclear power stations, chemical plants, nuclear submarine bases, airfields with strategic bombers, and other similar facilities. Safety of Operation of Mobile Sites in Peacetime It is obvious that the operation of mobile sites connected with a change of position on prepared routes is potentially more complex and dangerous than ICBM's in launch silos. It is important that these potential threats not become reality. A particular feature of the mode of the operational use of mobile launchers that is frequently not understood by the critics of this basing version is the fact that the missiles in a permanent state of readiness 96 percent of the time are in battle position, that is, in protected installations where they are dependably guarded by personnel using special facilities for detecting and destroying intruders. The routes for changing the launcher position have engineering support realized in advance, the march is usually undertaken at night, when traffic intensity is low, the launcher is provided with cover in the front and at the rear by special vehicles, the drivers of the launchers are highly skilled specialists who constantly undergo training in simulators and at automotive test grounds, and the driver's work is monitored by the launcher commander and a set of technical facilities. The enumerated measures have made it possible to markedly increase safety on the march compared with the practical operation of the first SS-20 intermediate-range mobile sites. There were in the process of operation of several hundred SS-20 launchers an average of eight to 10 accidents, breakages, and instances of damage a year, but none of them signified even the preconditions of an incidence of radioactive contamination. As a result of the great deal of organizing work that was performed in the Strategic Missile Forces, the introduction of new designs, and an improvement in the selection and assignment of launcher driver personnel, the accident rate has declined sharply and the probability of an incident is not more than 0.00001 a year. This means that with the operation of 500 launchers there is a 5 percent probability of an accident at one of them over the course of 10 years. In terms of industrial grading, conditions of occupational activity with such an accident probability are considered safe. I would like to compare the safety of nuclear weapons in different components of the strategic nuclear force. According to open press data, six catastrophes accompanied by the sinking of the boats, explosions, and fires, the result of which were the loss of nuclear munitions and missiles and also the loss of life of personnel, occurred in the course of the operation of several dozen nuclear submarines in the USSR. But today no one is raising the question of the abandonment of the use of strategic nuclear weapons on nuclear submarines. On the contrary, this component of the strategic nuclear force is in terms of the proportion of nuclear weapons being augmented. The public is also well aware of the accident rate of our aircraft. Thus the potential danger of the operation of mobile sites in peacetime is compensated in practice by technical and organizational measures and represents less of a threat to the public and the territories than other components of the strategic nuclear force. Economy of the Strategic Missile Forces' Grouping With Mobile Sites Outlays on the creation, introduction to the grouping, and operation over the warranty period of sites with fixed or mobile basing modes per missile, on the whole, are close for prospective fixed and mobile launchers. It should be noted, however, that the bulk of the outlays, for which funding per the "capital construction" item is the most complicated, is composed for the launch silo of expenditure on the reequipping or the construction of a new silo, and for the mobile launcher, on the development of a road network used by more than just the military. For example, the introduction of SS-24 railroad sites made it possible to replace the track, reinforce the bed, install automated equipment and means of communication, and build sidings, which improved the traffic capacity of a pronounced portion of our railroads. The development of a network of roads in the areas where the mobile ground-based sites are located is, naturally, also supported by the local administration. Whereas the public money "dug" into the earth in the construction of a launch silo is not returned even following the dismantling of the launcher and its hand-over to the local authorities. What Happens if the Program To Create Mobile Sites Is Halted The fixed and mobile sites in operation will have exhausted their service life by the years 2000-2003. The abandonment of one program without the fulfillment of any other would signify, therefore, the slow extinction of the most efficient and least costly component of the strategic nuclear force. Without the Strategic Missile Forces sea and aviation components could not perform their set assignments of deterring an aggressor. Critics of the program for developing the Strategic Missile Forces grouping based on single-warhead solid-fuel ICBM's with two basing modes should in saying "a" also be saying "b," that is, proposing some reasonable alternative. Possible Alternative Versions If we do not ratify START II and develop the strategic nuclear force and the Strategic Missile Forces under the conditions of START I, preserving the current mobile grouping strength, it will be necessary to develop a new missile with multiple reentry vehicles to replace the SS-18 heavy missile and also an SS-24-class light missile for the railroad site. Nor will it be possible to abandon the modernization of the single-warhead missile here since this part of the grouping will by the years 2000-2003 also need to replace the missiles and launchers. For the Strategic Missile Forces such a program would be at least 30-50 percent more costly, and the grouping's efficiency in a retaliatory strike also would still be determined mainly by the mobile sites. If START II is ratified (preferably with the proposed adjustments), it will be possible to speak only of the ratio of silo- and mobile-basing single-warhead missiles. But even today more than one-third of the launchers in the grouping are mobile. Since the mobile ground sites are several times more efficient than the silo sites, with an approximately identical cost, it would be expedient to have in the grouping the maximum quantity of them determined by the terms of the START I and START II treaties, with regard, of course, to the actual possibilities of industry, given its limited funding. Thus the ratification or nonratification of START II will not alter the arterial direction of the development of the Strategic Missile Forces--the transition from missiles with multiple reentry vehicles to single-warhead missiles--since this is determined by the START I treaty that is already in effect (an appreciable limitation on the number of warheads compared with the number of missiles). The START II treaty merely shortens the timeframe of the transition to a single-warhead grouping and, the author believes, is in need of adjustment in this respect prior to ratification with regard to the country's economic situation. It is also obvious that it would be expedient to create the single-warhead grouping on the basis of one standardized Topol-class (SS-25) missile with two types of basing if only because approximately one-third of the ICBM's are of mobile ground basing and have the corresponding infrastructure of the position areas and an evolved system of operation.
