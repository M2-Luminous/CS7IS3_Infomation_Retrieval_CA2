FR940720-0-00101 FR940720-0-00007 (ii) in or on a piece of equipment that is intended to be propelled while performing its function (such as lawnmowers and string trimmers); or (iii) that, by itself or in or on a piece of equipment, is portable or transportable, meaning designed to be and capable of being carried or moved from one location to another. Indicia of transportability include, but are not limited to, wheels, skids, carrying handles, dolly, trailer, or platform. (2) An internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if: (i) the engine is used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition, or is subject to standards promulgated under section 202 of the Act; or (ii) the engine is regulated by a federal New Source Performance Standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act; or (iii) the engine otherwise included in (1)(iii) remains or will remain at a location for more than 12 consecutive months or a shorter period of time for an engine located at a seasonal source. A location is any single site at a building, structure, facility, or installation. Any engine (or engines) that replaces an engine at a location and that is intended to perform the same or similar function as the engine replaced will be included in calculating the consecutive time period. An engine located at a seasonal source is an engine that remains at a seasonal source during the full annual operating period of the seasonal source. A seasonal source is a stationary source that remains in a single location on a permanent basis (i.e., at least two years) and that operates at that single location approximately three ( or more) each year. This paragraph does not apply to an engine after the engine is removed from the location. For purposes of consistency with section 213, and the reasons set forth in the 37 kilowatt and above regulation, 4 EPA has decided to adopt and apply this definition to today's section 209(e) rulemaking. 4 EPA incorporates by reference the 37 kilowatt and above nonroad regulation at 59 FR 31306, June 17, 1994. The California Air Resources Board's (CARB) utility engine regulation (the California Utility Rule) affects only engines smaller than 25 horsepower. EPA believes that equipment that uses such small engines is intended to be mobile. For example, equipment that uses engines smaller than 25 horsepower includes hand-held and portable equipment, which EPA believes are clearly nonroad, mobile sources. C. Definition of ``New'' as Used in ``New Nonroad Engine,'' and ``New Nonroad Vehicle'' In the NPRM, EPA defined ``new nonroad engine'' and ``new nonroad vehicle'' to mean a nonroad engine or a nonroad vehicle the equitable or legal title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser. Ultimate purchaser was proposed to be defined as the first person who in good faith purchases such a new nonroad vehicle or nonroad engine for purposes other than resale. Additionally, with respect to imported nonroad engines, EPA proposed to define ``new'' nonroad engine to be a nonroad engine manufactured after the effective date of a regulation issued under section 213 which would be applicable to such engine had it been manufactured for importation into the United States. These definitions also applied to ``new locomotives'' and ``new engines used in locomotives.'' Comments on EPA's proposed definition of ``new'' were several. First, CARB, the San Diego Air Pollution Control Board (SDAPCB), and the Manufacturers of Emissions Controls Association (MECA) supported EPA's definition. CARB asked that EPA clarify which regulatory activities states may perform; for example, whether states may require in-use testing and impose add-on or retrofit requirements. On the other hand, many commenters, including U.S. Representative Terry Bruce, the Equipment Manufacturers Institute (EMI), the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA), and the Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association (PPEMA), opposed EPA's proposed definition and proposed that ``new'' should mean manufactured after either the effective date of the Clean Air Act Amendments, November 15, 1990, or after federal regulations take effect. These commenters believe that Congress intended an ``absolute'' preemption. That is, the nonroad engines and vehicles in the preempted categories manufactured after November 15, 1990 would never be subject to any kind of state emission regulation. EMA commented that if EPA does not accept the latter definition, it should expand its proposed definition so that engines remain ``new'' until they have exceeded their useful life.
