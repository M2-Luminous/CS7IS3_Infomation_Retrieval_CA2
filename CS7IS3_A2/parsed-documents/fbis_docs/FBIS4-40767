I believe the time has come to say so openly, not only because I see that the seeds shed by the old weeds in the past are still growing, but above all because I see a danger of other evil weeds being planted, more or less on purpose, on all sides, in line with a logic of alienness, or antithesis, for which there should no longer be any justification. The annual G-7 summit will be held in Naples in a few weeks' time. I see that, after much shilly-shallying, it has been decided to hold an economic G-7 and a political G-8. In other words, the Big Seven will discuss economic trends in the world community among themselves, then they will move on, bringing Russia in, to look at the political situation. Let me say straight away that, from some points of view, this is a step forward, as it means involving Russia in the analysis of and reaction to overall international problems. It thus means reducing the chances of mutual incomprehension, misunderstanding, and suspicion. However, from other points of view this attitude reveals an antiquated mindset. Indeed, my first objection concerns the legitimacy of separating politics and economics. To all intents and purposes, the Seven are telling Russia that they are the ones who wield real power, and that they are only granting it a consultative role as regards the consequences of the options that they, and only they, are entitled to select. Does all this reflect actual reality? Only very partially. Russia is undoubtedly a country in difficulty, its currency is not convertible on the world market, it is deeply in debt, and its repayment capacity is limited. But its real weight in world affairs is certainly not less than that of Italy, or France, or Canada. So there are other, unconfessed, unspoken, but obvious reasons for keeping it out: There is a refusal to extend the membership of the club that lays down the rules of the game. The West's objection that Russia is still a country that lacks stability, is susceptible to political and institutional upsets, and is therefore not entirely reliable is a weak excuse: Difficult though the situation may be, it would be inconceivable for Russia to "change camp." Keeping it out of the club increases its difficulties, from the psychological point of view as well, as it heightens its feeling of isolation and reinforces the obstacles to full integration. The truth of the matter is that the idea that the world has to be governed by the paramount interests of one side, the strongest, still survives. This is a very shortsighted brand of "realism." However, membership of the club must not be the ultimate goal, the mere achievement of which is to be regarded as an end in itself. The G-7, even if it becomes the G-8, cannot -- and will not -- be the seat of government of a stable new world. It can only be, for a certain time, a transitional arrangement born of the needs of the moment, of the lack, or inadequacy, of fairer, more functional international structures. There will be problems if it ends up by taking on a permanent role that does not rightfully belong to it. Otherwise, sooner or later, the question will be raised in many quarters whether it is right for the world to be governed by a club whose members' only qualification is their economic and military strength. Take the painful experience of the crisis in Yugoslavia. Strong as they are, the Great of the world have proved unable to prevent it, indeed they have ended up by encouraging it, precisely because there were no instruments for preventing it. This is what needs doing: creating them in as short a time as possible. Placing this issue on the Naples agenda would be a sign of awareness and responsibility. Take the debate surrounding the Partnership for Peace as well. The West is inviting Russia simply to join. Russia is replying that it is willing to accept, but that it asks for a special status, to be granted to it on the grounds of its role as a major power. This is another example of the subservience of current Russian policy and of shortsightedness on the part of the West. Instead of prioritizing the creation of European structures, creating a security council for the CSCE, its own peacekeeping force, etc., and subsequently looking into the possibility of using NATO structures in this context, the factors are being inverted and NATO, which was created for the purposes of the Cold War, is being extended, quite apart from everything else. Is this merely an error? I fear something more serious, a prolongation of the old logic of supremacy that the West is continuing to impose. The 50th anniversary celebrations for the opening of the second front give pause for bitter thought and concern. They have been presented in an unacceptable, unilateral manner, as if victory came about thanks to the decisive contribution of a single side of the coalition. This is not only a distortion of historical truth and an attempt to diminish the Soviet Union's crucial role in defeating Nazism. It is a symptom of a resurgence of ideology. The fact that the opening of the second front was seriously delayed and that, as a result, the USSR was left alone to fight on the "first front" has been willfully forgotten and glossed over. This cost the population millions of victims, and it would have been right to commemorate them on this occasion. For the sake of argument, I could retort that Russia would have been glad to celebrate the anniversary a year ago, because it would have meant that the Normandy landing had taken place not in 1944, but in 1943, when the USSR was entrenched in Stalingrad, when it was on the verge of catastrophe, when the troops were given the fateful order, number 227: "Not a single step back." It is not my intention to underestimate the military and political significance of the Normandy landing. It reflected the spirit of the coalition, it was essential. But the outcome of the war had been decided by then, largely thanks to Soviet efforts. President Clinton has mentioned the fact that the world "would have been a different place" without the Normandy landing, almost as if to say that the USSR was against it, as it was aiming to conquer Europe. This is worrying, as it contradicts the most elementary historical truth, the very interpretations of the then leaders, Roosevelt and Churchill included. But it also a sign of something worse: the desire to ignore common goals, the joint efforts to put an end to the Cold War and to build a new Europe and a new world order without suspicion and barriers. The current Russian leadership has chosen to turn a blind eye, taking everything in its stride on the grounds that "it has always been that way." It is true, that was how it was. But anniversaries were celebrated differently then. We were not invited and we knew why: We belonged to different, opposing blocs. But not being invited today takes on another, unpleasant meaning, because we are partners now. I would say more: Present-day Germany and Italy should have attended as well, as that victory now represents a value common to all democracies. It will be advisable to reflect on why this did not happen. It could mean that there are still those who have barriers and curtains in mind, and are ready to rebuild them.
