"The USTR report is just one step of the procedures under the super 301," Fujii told a regular press conference after a morning cabinet meeting. "Super 301" is a retaliatory provision of a U.S. Trade Law recently reinstated by the Clinton administration. The report "does not mean a unilateral action against Japan," he said. In its report for 1994, the USTR listed trade barriers in 39 nations and designated 49 sectors in seven fields for Japan. Asked about Japan's market-opening measures launched Tuesday in hope of resuming the stalled "framework" trade talks with the United States, Fujii quoted U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor as saying that "the U.S. is not discouraged, and the door is open." Fujii said, "we must actively take the measures decided voluntarily in the package." Turning to domestic issues, Fujii called for swift enactment of the fiscal 1994 provisional budget that failed to become law Thursday, the last day before the fiscal year started Friday. The government submitted the stopgap budget worth some 11 trillion yen to the Diet on Tuesday. The measure is intended to bridge a delay in approval by the Diet of the full budget for fiscal 1994. The provisional budget passed the House of Representatives, but deliberations hit a snag in the House of Councillors on Thursday in furious debate over Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa's alleged stock dealings and loans.
