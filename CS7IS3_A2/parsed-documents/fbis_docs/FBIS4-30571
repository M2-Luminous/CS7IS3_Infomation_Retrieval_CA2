FBIS4-30571 "dreas124_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-124 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 South Korea Reports on 28 Jun North-South Contact Continue Reports on 28 Jun North-South Contact Continue Highlights From Contact Reported SK2806095694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0917 GMT 28 Jun 94 SK2806095694 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Panmunjom, June 28 (YONHAP) -- A burst of camera flashes greeted the North Korean delegation to Tuesday's inter-Korean summit preliminary contact on the Southern side of the truce village. Chief delegate Kim Yong-sun and his team of An Pyong-su and Paek Nam-chun arrived at Peace House [Tongilgak] from the Northern side three minutes before the meeting hour in sedans provided by Seoul. South Korea's chief delegate, Deputy Premier Yi Hong-ku, wearing a tight smile, came down the stairs from the second floor waiting room to welcome the North Korean team. "Just call me Kim Yong-sun," the North Korean team leader said, raising a round of laughter. "Then just call me Yi Hong-ku," the Southern delegate replied. Kim and Yi waved at reporters and cameramen before ascending to the conference room on the second floor. -- Both sides opened the conference with boasts about who had built the better road to Panmunjom, apparently intended to demonstrate who is more fit to host the summit. "It was only a two-hour drive from Pyongyang to here, and the scenery was just fabulous with clean homes and ripe crops," Kim Yong-sun said. "I thought it would be nice if you could travel the same road." Yi Hong-ku, not about to lose out, said it had taken him only one hour to travel from his office to the truce village. "The highway was recently widened to eight lanes," he explained. "I thought it would be nice if the highway was connected with the Northern side." -- North Korean reporters and delegation assistants arrived earlier, crossing the demarcation line on foot. About 25 reporters came, more than double the usual 10 seen at past contacts, reflecting the degree of interest in the outcome. They avoided a flurry of questions from their South Korean counterparts, advising patience in response to queries about Pyongyang's proposal on the date and site of the summit. One question touched a raw nerve: "Nonsense," one North Korean snapped when asked if Kim Yong-sun was related to President Kim Il-song. Rumor has it that the chief North Korean delegate, an influential figure within the inner circle of power, is related by blood to the "great leader." -- North Korea's free trade zones came up when Yi Hong-ku mentioned the subject. "I received many phone calls telling me to find out about the free trade zones in Najin and Sonbong," he told North Korea's Kim. Kim said he, too, had received many calls asking about the zones but withheld any new disclosures, simply saying "Let's just wait for the results." --Tuesday's conference continued in three different forms as the two sides tried various ways to reach an agreement. Seoul's delegates asked for a 10-minute break at 11:30 AM when the morning session appeared to be a fruitless exercise. The meeting was then convened between only the chief delegates before breaking up again at 1 PM. They were in virtual agreement on holding the first summit in Pyongyang on July 25, but North Korean officials objected to Seoul's condition that the summit be arranged through exchange visits between the two sides to guarantee reciprocity. The North Koreans instead made a new demand during the morning session, asking that a clause be inserted in the agreement that neither side could take any provocative actions that might cancel the summit talks. They parted for lunch with a promise to meet again afterwards. An Pyong-su returned by himself around 2:30 PM and met separately with Yun Ye-chun to go over the minutes of the morning session. -- Security officials were unusually strict toward reporters, blocking the staircase to the conference room and placing security agents on site. One official explained the extreme caution was needed to prevent repetition of past incidents where press coverage placed too much emphasis on differences of opinion between the two sides and influenced the inter-Korean talks in a negative way. Nevertheless, the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) had presidential instructions and permission to provide thorough coverage of the conference. President Kim Yong-sam is said to have specially requested the state-invested TV network to cover the conference live [for broadcast on closed-circuit television] so that he could watch it from his office. -- The Panmunjom preparatory contact was telecast live to the top leaders of South and North Korea who, based on their viewing of it, handed down instructions to their negotiators at Panmunjom from time to time. In an advance agreement, a 20-member KBS Television crew covered the conference in its entirety for beaming to both sides. Conference scenes caught by television cameras were sent to Tongilgak in the Northern sector of Panmunjom by an optical cable connecting the two areas of the joint security area via a relay van outside the peace house. At Tongilgak, the television picture of the South's NTSC scanning method was converted to the North's PAL method before being beamed directly to Kim Il-song's Palace in Pyongyang. Instructions from the two presidents were promptly conveyed over telephone to respective liaison officials at Panmunjom, which were handed to the chief negotiators in notes. An official who was present at the conference said white pieces of paper were relayed to North Korea's chief delegate Kim Yong-sun at several minutes' interval around 11 AM when the two sides did not back down from their respective ideas. Shortly after the delivery of the memos, Kim Yong-sun backed down and tentatively agreed to the South's idea of holding a summit on July 25, the official said.
