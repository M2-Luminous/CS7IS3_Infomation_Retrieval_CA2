The four-member delegation, led by Chairman of the Slovak Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee Ivan Laluha, also met first deputy chairman of the Duma, Mikhail Mityukov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of the Federation (upper house) Valerian Viktorov and members of parliament and parliamentary committees. No meeting was scheduled with the radical nationalist Liberal Democratic Party led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Discussion centered on the Partnership for Peace Programme and cooperation with NATO, Laluha said at a press conference. The Russian parliamentarians emphasized that Moscow's position on the question in no way constituted a threat to the security of the countries of Central Europe, he said. The view prevalent in the Duma is that integration into European structures is exclusively an internal political matter of the Central European states themselves, he said. The delegation also extended an invitation to visit Slovakia. Laluha declared the visit a success. He stressed the delegation had comprised members of both the government and the opposition because the foreign policy aim of full integration into Western economic and security structures found consensus in Slovakia. The delegation received assurances that the Russian-Slovak treaty signed by presidents Boris Yeltsin and Michal Kovac last August would be debated by the Duma as a matter of priority. The delay in ratification was not due to any misunderstandings but the need to work out some essential procedures, he said.
