Here is our special correspondent Dragoljub Stankic reporting from Knin: [Begin recording] [Stankic] Differences were expressed yesterday by the refusal of the opposition, the Serbian Democratic Party of Krajina and the Serbian Radicals, to accept that the government's ordinances have legal force, something that immediately brought the Krajina judicial system to a complete state of paralysis. The vote of no-confidence in Information Minister Milena Tanjga -- without deviating from the legal period of time from the no-confidence motion to the [word indistinct] -- came to a head during the morning session when deputes of the coalition opposed the government's report on the recent term, presented by Prime Minister Djordje Bjegovic. The solution does not lie in reproaches; the point is to make the [word indistinct] under these conditions, said Bjegovic, attempting to somehow calm things down in the Assembly. However, if one adds here that the joint coalition was from the very beginning opposed to the new prime minister-designate, Borisav Mikelic, as well to most other issues, it is then clear that things could be solved only with the resignation of the entire cabinet. We asked Prime Minister Djordje Bjegovic to briefly comment on his resignation for Belgrade Radio. [Bjegovic] Well, I think that in this situation it was necessary to cut short the debate. I do not think that false accusations are ever useful and particularly not to the republic of Serbian Krajina and its people, who are suffering for the fourth year already. It is good that we had parliamentary elections and a multiparty system, but some rules of human behavior must exist. I think that there has been smearing and spitting on the government both in the case of the former parliament and this one, although I think that it is the only body in republic of Serbian Krajina that has functioned, more or less. It was my human duty to come before the parliament as a deputy and I think I performed my duty to the extent that it was possible to do so. My entire cabinet made an effort to do its duty. Working under difficult conditions, I think that we nevertheless maintained a certain minimum of system and organization. I was particularly concerned with the question of how to solve the organizational situation. I must say with pleasure that (?this one step) was overcome and now we have all [word indistinct], all state institutions. I expect the new parliament to do the same, as these committees should take care of the law, the legal procedure, and by no means encroach on executive power. If this is understood, then a division of duties will be accomplished. What should definitely be accepted in the end is the communal system plan, that is to say, a law on territorial organization in which [words indistinct]. In this way, we will have a real infrastructure and I am certain we will be successful. On the basis of everything I have heard today, I can say that there are many clever people here, but it is certain that this party [word indistinct] is above them and that it is almost dictating to them. I would not like to dictate to anybody to do what is smart, he should decide for himself. I think that it is most important to also create a financial model, that is, economic prosperity for the republic of Serbian Krajina. I am sure that there is room for us in a joint Serbian state and I am sure that we shall [words indistinct). [Stankic] We should also say that after Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, and the new Assembly were elected, the Krajina government became a regular offender. The parliamentary majority treated the government as a political opponent, and attacks abounded regardless of the evidence. The attacks on government projects, against Milena Tanjga, and Borislav Mikelic are in fact the coalition's attack against President Milan Martic. The government's (?resignation) is nothing but a ruse by the parliamentary majority, because according to the Constitution, the government can now function unhindered until a new cabinet is elected.
