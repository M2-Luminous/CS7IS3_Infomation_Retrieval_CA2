Shaposhnikov by Andrey Uglanov; place and date not given: "Partnership for NATO?"] [Text] This man was the last defense minister of the USSR, the sole commander in chief of the CIS Joint Armed Forces, and secretary of the Security Council of Russia. Today Marshal of Aviation Ye. Shaposhnikov is the representative of the president of the Russian Federation at the Rosvooruzheniye State Company--an organization selling Russian weapons overseas. Perhaps this appointment signifies the twilight of his military career. But, in the opinion of a number of political scientists, a pretty good political future might await him, given a certain confluence of circumstances and his own desire. [Uglanov] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, your opinion of the Armed Forces of Russia. What awaits them? We know that the situation in the Army is very difficult. [Shaposhnikov] Next year it will, evidently, be even worse. Three groups of factors are affecting the Army at this time. The first is the lack of funding. We are today increasing the funding of its upkeep thanks to a reduction in defense contracting. But there will be nowhere to get the money from next year. The second--destructive processes in the Army continue. The reason for them, all else aside, is the loss of an ideological reference point in the form of an enemy image and the absence of effective institutions of educational work. The third factor is the appearance of regional influence on the Army. The leaders of certain regions are flirting with the Army, laying claim to the role of its saviors. If these three factors come together in one point at one and the same time, there will be an explosion which could signify the Army's uncontrollability. [Uglanov] A very dim prospect. [Shaposhnikov] Lest this happen, it is essential to do three things, that is, create the conditions for a radical reform of the Army. The first concerns the strategic missile forces. It is essential to upgrade their combat readiness, manning level, and hardware provision as the basis of the Armed Forces. As long as we have them, no one will touch us. The second is the strengthening and upgrading of the border forces. And the third is the observance of legality and law and order and the organization of an all-out offensive against crime in all its manifestations. Having thus protected ourselves against possible aggression from outside and having secured order within the state, it will be possible embarking on the building of a new army, taking the path of both reforms and reductions. [Uglanov] But, aside from the Army, there are tens of millions of people employed in the military-industrial complex. This is a delayed-action bomb. An explosion is expected from day to day. A strike of the military-industrial complex is, apparently, scheduled for 9 June. [Shaposhnikov] Studying military-technical cooperation with foreign countries, I discovered serious problems. More than just our opportunities to export arms and military equipment will depend on their resolution. I am talking about our capacity for supplying the Russian Army with modern arms and, consequently, for successfully defending ourselves in case of need. This depends on the state of the military-industrial complex. The label of "red conservatives" has, I regret to say, been pinned on the leaders of defense industry. In reality, this is the most patriotic, law-abiding part of our society. Their sole shortcoming is a blind faith in state structures that have proven powerless to do anything for them. Whence the talk about the formation of their own political party, a merger with the commercial banks, and so forth. It is for this reason, I believe, that Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin has, for all that, concerned himself with this problem. [Uglanov] But we have always earned terrific money from arms sales. Why not allocate it for the development of the defense industry? [Shaposhnikov] Strictly speaking, in Soviet times we were never involved in the sale of arms. They were supplied according to the principle: "You respect me? You support my socialism? Here you are, then." Tens of billions of dollars were lost, and their return is greatly in doubt. The USSR leaders wanted to gratify the world by their inordinate kindness. We were regarded as fools. [Uglanov] But we were paid for the weapons, all the same.... [Shaposhnikov] We received in exchange cheap, often sour, wine, tomatoes, some pieces of this and that, and so on and so forth. The year of 1985, for example, was the high point in military-technical export cooperation. On the basis of such principles of the arms "trade" we concluded agreements totaling $16 billion and received in actual terms on the order of $2 billion. But where these billions went, no one knows. Into the "granary of the motherland," evidently. Today the plants and regions themselves are going to the president and the government: "We are dying--allow us to move onto the market." Many were allowed. And when they went overseas, people locally were astonished by our insanity. Some 12-15 individuals and organizations would move after one and the same deal, one and the same contract. They were competing with one another, thereby knocking down their prices. The president decided to close off all these loopholes and to retain one channel for the sale of weapons--the Rosvooruzheniye. Although the role of manufacturer should not be belittled, this should be done in the channel of state laws and interests. [Uglanov] You hold the cards here. You are a person who knows weapons and you are, furthermore, a pilot. Is it mainly aviation equipment that is being sold? [Shaposhnikov] You are right. If we take 100 percent as being the total, aviation accounts for 60-70 percent. [Uglanov] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, you had your finger on the nuclear trigger. The operational situation throughout the world was reported to you daily. You must see some common development of events from the viewpoint of the "warmup" of conflicts throughout the world. How may they be extinguished, how may the armed forces of blocs and individual states be used? Do you have any thoughts in this connection? Is it right that Russia is being pulled into NATO's Partnership for Peace program? [Shaposhnikov] After World War II, mankind behaved like a handful of street toughs. But we have reached a point where there is no more Warsaw Pact and no more Soviet Union, but nor is there at the same time clearly expressed opposition. And military power has lost its precise, clear reference point in the enemy image. This is understood by the leaders of NATO also, and they have for several years now been in the mode of search and explanations of their existence. Organizing the Partnership for Peace is one such find. Will Russia gain or lose from the Partnership? Let us consider three scenarios. The first is the signing of the treaty without reservations. In this case NATO's influence would extend to the Pacific, to the borders of China, which does not accept the Partnership as yet. This could signify a conflict with our southeastern neighbor, which neither we nor China need. The second scenario is a refusal to sign. Russia would then be putting itself under conditions of isolation from the Western world. NATO's borders would become closer to our borders. Consequently, a new confrontation, a cold war, of which the world has grown tired, is possible on this basis. The third scenario is that of us seeking some special role for ourselves in NATO or in the Partnership. I believe that this is unworthy of a great Russia. Consequently, Russia should propose to the world community something else worthy of its authority and shared by the world community. The time has now come, in my view, for thought to be given the concept of states' nonbloc existence. Mankind does not need military blocs but rather the perfection of the structures and mechanisms that would secure both peace and prosperity on earth. We have such mechanisms and structures: the United Nations, the CSCE, the CIS, the Arab League, the Association of States of the Pacific Region, the Organization of African Unity, and others. In my view, one organization--the United Nations--should be a world organization and deal with general matters to ensure peace and stability. It is necessary to this end to perfect the military structure of the United Nations so that it makes forecasts and analyses and offers the UN Security Council some versions of a resolution of this problem or the other. And all the other regional organizations (CSCE, CIS, and others) would be components and structural subdivisions of the United Nations with their missions at the United Nations and with UN missions in them. They would tackle regional tasks. In place of NATO, a CSCE peacekeeping contingent with a change of name and, naturally, function would emerge. It would be involved in both peacekeeping and in rendering assistance at the time of a variety of natural disasters, accidents, and catastrophes and in the delivery of humanitarian aid. I have been telling the top-ranking NATO people for two years now: "Following the disappearance of the Warsaw Pact, you are without a job, and this is why you are rushing into Yugoslavia or some other venture. The time has come to transform your bloc into a peacekeeping organization. But not on a world level, rather under the auspices of the CSCE." I have put this idea to the leadership of Russia also. As yet, silence.... But unjustly so. In my view, our politicians should not let slip their opportunity.
