ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adds a new standard for electrical and electronic systems installed in transport category airplanes. It is the result of increasing concern for the vulnerability of these systems to the indirect effects of lightning, and is intended to enhance safety by providing specific lightning protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems that perform essential or critical functions. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gene Vandermolen, FAA, Flight Test & Systems Branch, ANM&hyph;111, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2135. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This amendment is based on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) No. 89&hyph;15, which was published in the Federal Register on May 30, 1989 (54 FR 23164). As discussed in the notice, concern for the vulnerability of airplane electronic systems to the effects of lightning has increased substantially over the past few years. The use of solid-state components in the design of electronic control systems in airplanes has made such systems potentially susceptible to transient effects of induced electrical current and voltage caused by a direct lightning strike to the airplane. These induced transient currents and voltages can degrade electronic system performance by damaging components or upsetting system functions. Component damage means a permanently altered electrical characteristic that can include dielectric breakdowns and effects from heat in semiconductor junctions, resistors, and component interconnections. Function upset refers to an impairment of system operation, either permanent or momentary (e.g., a change of digital or analog state), that includes logic changes in computer and processing systems, electronic engine and flight controls, and power generating and distribution systems. Another factor that has contributed to this increased concern is the reduced electromagnetic shielding afforded airplane electronic systems by advanced technology airframe materials. Some of these materials have no electrical conductivity and lightning strikes often puncture them, resulting in extensive damage and allowing lightning to attach to vulnerable electronic systems or components located within the airframe. Other materials, such as graphite-reinforced composites, have some electrical conductivity. Voltages induced by lightning current that flows in airframe components made of these composite materials are much higher than those in aluminum materials because the electrical resistance of composites is higher; therefore, such composites provide much less protection to the circuits and electronic systems in the airplane. There are two sections in 14 CFR part 25 that specifically pertain to lightning protection: one for the airframe in general (§25.581), and the other for the fuel system (§25.954). There are no regulations dealing specifically with lightning protection of electrical and electronic systems. The advent of advanced electronic systems in airplane designs submitted for FAA approval requires that additional consideration be given to protecting these systems from the effects of lighting strikes. Although §25.581(a) (structures subpart) requires that an airplane be protected against catastrophic effects of lighting, and §25.1309(a) states that required systems must operate properly in all environmental conditions, it has been determined that the existing lightning protection requirements are not adequate for advanced electronic systems. In recent type certification programs involving advanced electronic systems, such as those used in the Airbus A320, Boeing 747&hyph;400, and Douglas MD&hyph;11 airplanes, the FAA has adopted special conditions to provide an adequate level of safety. Since trends indicate that future airplane designs will incorporate similar systems, the FAA has determined that a change in the design standards of part 25 is necessary. Discussion of Comments The following discussion summarizes the comments received from the public, industry, foreign authorities, and manufacturers in response to Notice 89&hyph;15. Several commenters request clarification as to what constitutes critical and essential functions. The terms ``critical'' and ``essential'' originated when attempts were made to classify failure conditions in accordance with §25.1309. This regulation requires that systems be designed so that the occurrence of any failure condition that would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane is extremely improbable. The function affected by such a failure condition is deemed ``critical.'' Additionally, §25.1309 requires that systems be designed so that the occurrence of any other failure condition that would reduce the capability of the airplane or the ability of the crew to cope with adverse operating conditions is improbable. The function affected by such a failure condition is deemed ``essential.'' The combination of systems or system redundancy required to meet these reliability requirements is determined by conducting a preliminary hazard analysis or criticality assessment. Examples of systems that perform critical functions are full authority electronic engine controls, electronic primary flight controls, primary flight displays, and electronic stability augmentation. Examples of systems that perform essential functions are communications systems, navigation systems, and flight management systems.
