FR941007-2-00063 FR941007-2-00037 3. Petitioners' motion is dated the date comments were due. They stated that they had already received two lengthy pleadings and expected a substantial number of additional comments. 4 In fact, over 1,400 pages of comments and associated pleadings were filed on the California petition. By the time copies of the pleadings have been obtained, California states that it will have only six or seven business days in which to review and analyze the record, finalize its comments, and respond to a party's motion addressing confidentiality issues raised by the petition. Petitioners state that the issues involved are complex and that the proceeding concerns fundamental state interests. They claim that no party will be prejudiced, and the FCC's ability to meet the one-year statutory deadline not detrimentally affected, by the requested extension. They believe that the FCC will be well served by a complete record and careful analysis on the part of California. Petitioners allege that they have shown good cause for the requested extension. 5 4 Motion at 4. 5 Motion at 3&hyph;4. 4. Although it does not object to ``some appropriately brief'' extension, Air Touch Communications argues that the 45-day extension requested by California is excessive and needlessly delays resolution of this proceeding. It states that rate regulation costs California consumers $250 million per year, contrary to California's claim that no party will be prejudiced. It states that the pleading cycle in this proceeding was crafted to balance the rights of all parties, especially the public's right to be relieved of needless regulation. 6 6 Comments of AirTouch Communications on the CPUC's Emergency Motion at 1&hyph;2 (dated Sept. 23, 1994). AirTouch Communications adds that California, by virtue of a 1994 investigation into the wireless industry, is well-prepared to respond to the comments in a timely fashion. Id. at 2. 5. We agree with California that some measure of relief is required. The record in this proceeding is voluminous, and the issues, including the state of competition and reasonableness of cellular rates in the state, are intricate. Moreover, California field revisions to its petition on September 13, 1994, which, at our request, included previously redacted information subsequently determined to be a matter of public record. 7 Interested parties may wish to comment on any new material. For these reasons, we conclude that an extension of time would serve the public interest. On the other hand, the Commission is faced with stringent statutory deadlines in a complex and massive proceeding. Granting an extension as long as California requests could impair the Commission's ability to comply with the statutory deadlines. For these reasons, we find that good cause has been shown for a extension of 15 days. This doubles the reply period permitted to a total of 30 days. We also put all parties on notice that those who wish to address the revised portions of California's petition should do so in these replies. 7 Ex Parte Letter from Ellen S. Levine, Principal Counsel, California Public Utilities Commission, to Hon. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary, FCC (dated Sept. 13, 1994). 6. Pursuant to Section 1.46 of the Commission's Rules, 8 we GRANT IN PART AND DENY IN PART the Emergency Motion of the People of the State of California for a 45 day Extension of Time to File Reply Comments TO THE EXTENT INDICATED HEREIN, and HEREBY EXTEND the time for filing reply comments UNTIL October 19, 1994. Interest parties ARE PERMITTED to include any comments on the revised petition filed by California on September 13, 1994 in their reply comments. 8 47 CFR 1.46. Ralph A. Haller, Chief, Private Radio Bureau. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24829 Filed 10&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M
