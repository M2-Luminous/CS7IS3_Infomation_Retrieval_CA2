The moduli are bound for energy plants in China to be used in boilers [ketel] in which electricity is produced. Mannesman has been working on this order for seven months. The moduli, with a total weight of 2,000 tonnes, were loaded on four pontoons which will transport the moduli from the Ghent-Terneuzen canal to Vlissingen [Netherlands]. There the parts will be loaded onto a ship which will sail to Hong Kong. Finally, ships will transport the freight to the cities of Shunde and Fushan [placenames as published] in Guangdong Province.
