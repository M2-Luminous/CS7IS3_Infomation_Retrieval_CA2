FR940303-2-00143 FR940303-2-00076 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;33672; File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;14] Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Depository Trust Company; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to a Clarification of Rule 5 February 23, 1994. On December 20, 1993, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;14) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 relating to a clarification of DTC Rule 5. On December 29, 1993, notice of the proposed rule change was published in the Federal Register to solicit comments from interested persons. 2 No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33365 (December 21, 1993), 58 FR 68971. I. Description The purpose of the proposed rule change is to clarify the meaning of DTC Rule 5. On December 13, 1993, the Commission issued an order approving a proposed rule change by DTC relating to the eligibility of Rule 144A securities at DTC. 3 In the Rule 144A Order, among other things, was the statement that Rule 5, Section 1 of DTC's Rule requires DTC to determine whether ``in light of the Federal securities laws, particularly the provisions of Rules 144, 144A, and 145, the securities, when deposited with DTC, may be lawfully transferred by book-entry.'' 4 DTC filed this proposed rule change in order to clarify that DTC Rule 5 does not require DTC to determine whether securities deposited at DTC may be transferred lawfully pursuant to Federal securities laws. 5 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33327 (December 13, 1993), 58 FR 67878 (hereinafter Rule 144A Order). 4 Id. n. 22 and accompanying text. 5 In the near future, DTC plans to adopt and file with the Commission as a proposed rule change revisions to Rule 5 that will clarify further the meaning of the Rule. II. Discussion The Commission believes that DTC's proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act and, specifically, with sections 17A(b) (3) (A) and (F). 6 Those sections require that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to protect investors and the public interest. 6 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b) (3) (A) & (F). Notwithstanding the language in footnote 22 of the Rule 144A Order, the Commission believes that DTC's interpretation of Rule 5 ( i.e., that Rule 5 does not require DTC to determine whether securities, when deposited at DTC, may be transferred lawfully by book-entry in light of Federal securities laws) is a plausible interpretation. Prior to making specific issues of Rule 144A securities eligible for DTC's book-entry delivery and other depository services, DTC, as part of its procedures, requires issuers and transfer agents to make certain representations. These representations, together with DTC's periodic review to evaluate their effectiveness, serve to indicate that specific issues of Rule 144A securities are eligible for DTC services pursuant to the Rule 144A Order. The Commission is satisfied that DTC's interpretation of Rule 5, along with its procedures for the acceptance of Rule 144A securities, is consistent with DTC's obligations to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to protect investors and the public interest. III. Conclusion It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;14) be, and hereby is, approved. For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 7 7 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1990). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
