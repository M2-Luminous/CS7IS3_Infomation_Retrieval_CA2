This is more than the average of 1.75 percent the political parties took into account when drawing up their election platforms. The CPB has not yet made any calculations for 1996 and subsequent years. If economic growth is actually 2.5 percent, that would mean a windfall for the government finances of around 10 billion guilders. As a result of the high economic growth, the number of jobs will start rising again -- by 23,000 in 1995 -- following two years of reductions. Some of these will be part-time jobs, which means that next year an extra 54,000 people will be back at work. Wim Kok, who heads the electoral lists for the PvdA [Labor Party] confirmed yesterday evening during a speech in Leeuwarden that things are going somewhat better with the economy. For 1995, he is counting on economic growth of "more than 2 percent." According to Kok, higher economic growth gives those people entitled to benefits the prospect of receiving higher benefits, because if there is satisfactory growth there is no reason to freeze their benefits. The PvdA leader thought it foolish of the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] to call for an advance freeze of the old-age pension over the next four years. "There is no reason for such a rigorous step," said Kok. He has the feeling that, "economically speaking, the worst is over." At the Central Planning Office and the Ministry of the Economy and Finances there were warnings of "exaggerated optimism." The CPB's figures for 1995 are still early. They were sent to various ministries for comments. Experience shows that they can often subsequently undergo radical changes. The fact that the calculations this year were released so early is linked to the structural windfall of 18 billion guilders which the Finance Ministry reported yesterday in the so-called February Memo. As economic growth rises, the need for radical savings is not so great and the room for reducing taxes increases. The report on the anticipated figures comes too late for the five political parties, which had the CPB check their election programs. When making the calculations, the CPB starts out from an average annual economic growth of 1.75 percent. The CPB hopes to have completed the calculations by next Monday. With annual economic growth of 2.5 percent, the maintenance of purchasing power for people at all income levels is back in sight -- taking account of miscellaneous claims which already rested on it (growth of the working population, incidental wage increases, reduction in the budget deficit, and the improvement of companies' profitability). Planned adjustments to the national budget and the social security system can, in this case, be scrapped or reduced drastically. The PvdA, which, according to the latest version of the election platform has plans for saving 8.8 billion guilders, will even have money left over with average economic growth of 2.5 percent. The debate in the Social and Economic Council (SER) on reducing the difference between gross wage costs and net wages (the wedge) by 15 billion guilders is now being looked at in a different light because of this burst of fair weather. Namely, these 15 billion guilders, as well as the 2.5 billion guilders which the SER wants to earmark exclusively for intensifying the structural reinforcement of government spending must be saved by cuts in the national budget and social security (employers' view) or higher energy taxes (employees' view).
