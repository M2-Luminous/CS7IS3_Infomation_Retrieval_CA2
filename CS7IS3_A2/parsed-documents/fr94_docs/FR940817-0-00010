FR940817-0-00010 FR940817-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF STATE Bureau of Political-Military Affairs 22 CFR Part 126 [Public Notice 2050] Amendment to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations AGENCY: Department of State. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of State is amending the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120&hyph;130) (ITAR) to reflect that it is no long the policy of the United states to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense articles and defense services, destined for or originating in South Africa. The regulations are also amended to add Rwanda to the list of states for which such a policy of denial is in effect. A new provision is added to indicate that whenever the United Nations Security Council imposes an arms embargo, all transactions which involve defense articles and services and which are prohibited by the embargo are prohibited under the ITAR. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dean A. Rogers, Office of Export Control Policy, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State (202&hyph;647&hyph;4231). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of State is amending ยง126.1(a) and striking ยง126.1(c) of the ITAR to reflect that it is no longer the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense articles and services, destined for or originating in South Africa. With respect to South Africa, all requests for licenses or other approvals involving items covered by the U.S. Munitions List (22 CFR part 121) will now be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. This policy change was announced in a notice published at 59 FR 31667 on June 20, 1994. The arms export embargo on South Africa was imposed by the U.N. Security Council in Resolution 418 of November 4, 1977. An arms import embargo was called for by Security Council Resolution 558 of December 13, 1984. The Security Council terminated both embargoes in U.N. Security Council Resolution 919 of May 25, 1994. The Council's actions follow the first all-race multiparty election and the establishment of a democratic South African Government inaugurated on May 10, 1994. Section 126.1(a) is also amended to add Rwanda to the list of countries with respect to which the United States maintains an arms embargo. It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense articles and services, destined for or originating in Rwanda. This policy was announced in a notice published at 59 FR 28583 on June 2, 1994. This policy and amendment implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 918 of May 17, 1994, which requires all states to prevent the sale or supply to Rwanda of arms and related material, and Executive Order 12918 of May 26, 1994. Licenses and approvals subject to the South Africa and Rwanda policies include manufacturing licenses, technical assistance agreements, technical data, and commercial military exports and reexports of any kind involving these countries under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act. A new section 126.1(c) is added to indicate that whenever the United Nations Security Council mandates an arms embargo, all transactions which are prohibited by the embargo and which involve U.S. persons anywhere, or any person in the United States, and defense articles and services of a type enumerated on the United States Munitions List (22 CFR part 121), irrespective of origin, are prohibited under the ITAR for the duration of the embargo, unless the Department of State publishes a notice in the Federal Register specifying different measures. This would include, but is not limited to, transactions involving trade by U.S. persons who are located inside or outside of the United States in defense articles and services of U.S. or foreign origin which are located on U.S. territory or elsewhere. This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United States. It is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866 but has been reviewed internally by the Department to ensure consistency with the purposes thereof. It is also excluded from the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 553 and 554. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, and under the authority of section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) and Executive Order 11958, as amended 22 CFR Subchapter M is amended as follows: PART 126_GENERAL POLICIES AND PROVISIONS 1.

L. 90&hyph;629, 90 Stat. 744 (22 U.S.C. 2752, 2778, 2780, 2791, and 2797); E.O. 11958, 41 FR 4311; E.O. 11322, 32 FR 119; 22 U.S.C. 2658; 22 U.S.C. 287c; E.O. 12918, 59 FR 28205. 2. Section 126.1 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (c), as follows: ยง126.1 Prohibited exports and sales to certain countries. (a) General.
