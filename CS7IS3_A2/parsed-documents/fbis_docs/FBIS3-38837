He warned that the political will to take action must be combined with sound military judgment. There are widespread fears that air strikes could simply persuade the Serbs to attack British and other UN troops on the ground and destroy the humanitarian aid effort. Fearing the "indirect consequences" of military action, Mr Rifkind underlined the urgent need for the humanitarian operation, which is saving thousands of lives, to continue. And he warmly praised the robust, hard-nosed approach by the new United Nations commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, which was proving very effective. Mr Major has called an urgent Cabinet committee meeting for tomorrow afternoon with Mr Rifkind, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and other senior ministers to discuss the Bosnia crisis, following the shelling of the Sarajevo marketplace which killed 68 people and injured 200. But Mr Rifkind sidestepped questions about the French proposal that the Serbs should be told to pull back artillery batteries out of range of Sarajevo or face the threat of air strikes. Speaking aboard the frigate HMS Coventry off the Croatian coast after a two-day visit to ground forces in Bosnia, Mr Rifkind acknowledged air strikes could have advantages. "If it was to lead to the shortening of the war or an improvement for the people of Sarajevo it cannot be ruled out," he said. "But because it could have serious implications for the humanitarian operation and UN troops it is not an issue that can be resolved easily." And he stressed that airpower alone had never brought any conflict in history to an end -- not even the Gulf War. He said: "You have to combine political will with sound military judgment or you are going to do no good whatsoever for the people of Bosnia." He said he had received a clear message from the British troops in Bosnia that the aid is getting through to the needy and that they are anxious for the operation to continue. Sir Michael's tough interpretation of the UN mandate was helping to remove the frustration and delay UN forces have had to suffer with small numbers of people halting aid convoys. "It is very encouraging to see the impact this is having," said Mr Rifkind. "This illustrates that the mandate does enable those in charge to do even more than has been done in the past." This was the clearest indication yet that Britain will decide to keep its troops in Bosnia when a final decision is made next month.
