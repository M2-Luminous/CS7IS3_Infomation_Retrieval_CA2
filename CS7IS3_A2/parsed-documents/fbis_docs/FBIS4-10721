Rio de Janeiro--After 10 days of a viral infection that kept him in bed with a temperature of 40 degrees just before Carnival, and then another 10 days in Brasilia to help complete the economic stabilization plan, the president of the National Economic Development Bank, Persio Arida, was finally able to get back to work last week. One of the authors of the Cruzado Plan along with economist Andre Lara Resende--the "Larida" duo--he is now back on the scene with a package of measures aimed primarily at a free market economy without the persistent state intervention that occurred eight years ago under the Cruzado Plan. Although he agrees that the current plan is conceptually very close to the plan published under the Sarney administration, "the principle involved is that prices and wages must be left unregulated, and that point is absolutely fundamental to understanding the logic behind the program," Arida says in this interview with O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO. [Caldas] Economist Affonso Celso Pastore says that this plan has resurrected the original version of the Cruzado Plan as proposed in an article by you and Andre Lara Resende in 1984. [Arida] The plan is conceptually very close to the article we published in 1984 as far as its basic outline is concerned. But its similarity with the Cruzado Plan as that plan was actually implemented is minimal. This plan has no price freezes, schedules, or price controls. The basic idea is that prices and wages must be left unregulated, and that point is absolutely fundamental to understanding the logic behind the program. Brazil is still living with the concept underlying the Cruzado Plan, and it is surprising that later programs were attempts to repeat that experiment successfully. This program is abandoning that underlying concept. We are announcing in advance every step that we take, our policy is one of absolute consistency, and with the exception of the wage issue, what we have done now is exactly what we announced last December. [Caldas] But it was announced in December that the prices of public services would immediately be converted into URV's [units of real value], and that did not happen. [Arida] There are differences in detail--in the pace--but as far as the basic concept is concerned, what we are doing now is exactly what we announced in December. We are implementing a program without surprises on the principle that Brazil is a market economy. [Caldas] Does the plan contain an alternative for relieving the hardships suffered by the needy? [Arida] We are going to rethink the government's structure of social expenditures. We are studying conceptually interesting proposals for the introduction of a guaranteed minimum income program, one such proposal being the one drawn up by Senator Eduardo Suplicy. The idea is to improve living conditions for the poor population by using budget resources shifted from other items so as not to throw the budget out of balance. That idea is being discussed, and since its implementation requires only an administrative decision by the executive branch, it will not be long in coming. [Caldas] You talk about the importance of leaving prices and wages unregulated. Why were rules for wages adopted? [Arida] That aspect has frequently been misunderstood. If we left wage negotiations entirely unregulated, it is possible that some wages would be below average while others would be above, depending on the category and especially the region involved. Forced conversion to the average actually functions economically as a protective mechanism. It does not result in any losses at all, and it protects the poorest sectors of the working class. Moreover, forced conversion has legal justification derived from the rules for the nominal irreducible wage level guaranteed by the Constitution. This differentiates wages from all other prices. And it was what led us to adopt conversion to the average. [Caldas] There are proposals in Congress to amend Provisional Measure 434 in the direction of a wage trigger. Would the administration go along with that? [Arida] The concept underlying the Cruzado Plan is surprisingly alive in society. Proposals for wage triggers and for price increases expressed in URV's are being revived without a clear understanding of what the URV is, the reason being that everyone is always raising prices. It makes no sense to agree to a wage trigger. The correct economic response in cases of price speculation is to let the market operate. [Caldas] The oligopolies are not accustomed to obeying the rules of the marketplace. [Arida] There are exceptions; there are specific cases that cannot be ignored. But as a philosophy, the concept must be that of the marketplace--that is what makes sense for this program. The provisional measure does not prevent the existence of indexing clauses. It requires only that they run for one year. [Caldas] Will the increases negotiated between unions and employers be unregulated? [Arida] Of course. The principles of free negotiation will be respected. But there is a big difference between a wage increase based on free negotiation, increased demand, or increased productivity and one based on automatic application of the indexing clause. There is nothing to object to in the first case, since it involves natural phenomena in a market economy. The second case is based on a predetermined situation that we must avoid. As for the question of whether losses will or will not occur when the real is introduced, I would point out that the entire matter of rules for issuing the real and providing backing for it has not come up yet. That is an important point to be brought up further down the road. [Caldas] Could you tell us anything about it? [Arida] I prefer not to. But the point I would like to make is, once again, that we do not want to repeat previous experiences in which, even though the unit of currency was changed, there was no substantial change either in the institutional framework or in the conditions for issuing the new currency. I am using generic expressions--institutional framework, rules of issue, and backing for the currency--to emphasize that we are talking about a different monetary system associated with the new currency. That contrasts with the previous plans, in which the monetary system remained unchanged. [Caldas] Is there really a two-month deadline for adopting the real? [Arida] Look, so far we have not done anything based on the electoral timetable. We said that we would not begin the second phase until the first was completed, and that was how it turned out. The third phase will actually depend on our assessment that the economic conditions are most appropriate for beginning the third phase. There is no pressure--no timetable. [Caldas] What do you mean by "appropriate conditions"? Would that be when inflation in terms of the URV stands at zero? [Arida] This matter of the URV is being misunderstood. Since the URV is based on a basket of currencies, we will have a mixture of three indices. There will be URV inflation when one such index is higher than the average for the three. But since the average is equidistant by definition, URV inflation in one index means that there must be URV deflation in another just by the nature of things. So the question of so-called URV inflation is not a concern. As regards the proper economic conditions for introducing the real, we need to assess the process of forming a new social pact, changes in the tax situation, and the issue of constitutional revision--the basic features of the way the economy is developing. [Caldas] But aren't you afraid that the speculation of the past few days will cause URV inflation? [Arida] I understand the problem. But I would remind you that there is always discipline in demand. Why is it that Brazilian automobiles do not cost $100,000? The reason is not that auto manufacturers would not like to charge $100,000. The reason is that no one would buy their product. A real price increase when the economy is competitive--with unrestricted imports and so on--is subject to built-in restraint. Certain speculative bubbles are disciplined by demand itself. As for the decision to introduce the real, that decision will be made at the proper time without reference to the electoral timetable. So far we have not done anything subject to the electoral timetable. They said we were going to implement the plan in January so that it would be successful in April. Now the date has been changed to 1 May because that is Workers Day. There are no electoral considerations in this program. It follows its own logic. [Caldas] There are certain cases in which the free market does not function in Brazil. The schools have converted their monthly fees to URV's without consulting the parents of the pupils. The parents must either pay what the school wants or remove their children. [Arida] There are specific examples of abuses in which government arbitration is useful. I am not saying that that is one example. Neither am I being radical or naive. I am stating the basic philosophy behind the program, which is based on a free market--on freedom for the economic agents to agree on new pacts. This program has an educational side. It involves confidence in the democratic process, prior announcements, and discussion and confidence in the support of society, in Congress, and in the market mechanisms. [Caldas] In what areas could constitutional revision help the plan? [Arida] The timing we were contemplating had constitutional revision occurring sooner. The stabilization of a country does not take place in one day, and it will not occur even on the day when the real replaces the URV. It is a lengthy process from the standpoint of time. In that process, structural reforms of the economy are absolutely vital in order to ensure stabilization. That is where the importance of constitutional revision increases, because revision can open up opportunities for the economy to modernize itself and for the government to define its role and specific functions. It is essential to reform the welfare and health systems, redefine the issue of legal monopolies, and simplify and restructure the tax system. Those are structural reforms which, when you get down to it, constitute the real foundation of stabilization. Much more so than the emergency tax issue, the URV, or the real. [Caldas] All indications are that the assembly on revision is going to eliminate the monopoly on telecommunications but that the petroleum monopoly will remain. [Arida] Defending the monopolies is completely wrong. Telecommunications are a dramatic example. From the shareholding standpoint, the privatization of telecommunications has already occurred. The government now owns 17.5 percent of Telebras, and the rest is entirely in private hands. From the standpoint of a good privatization program, the way in which Telebras shares were sold over the course of time was tolerable. They were sold at ridiculously low prices without consulting the Treasury, which held the controlling interest, at all. The only question today is the legal obstacle, since ownership is already private. The important thing to emphasize is that the whole world provides examples of the advantages of competition in the telecommunications industry. There is no room for doubt on that score. [Caldas] Some economists have been saying that the government itself will encourage inflation in real cruzeiros in order to force prices up, provoke a recession, and allow the new currency to take off with a safety cushion. Is that so? [Arida] The program is going to be managed. We have no intention of deliberately provoking an acceleration of inflation. It has never been considered. That is Machiavellian madness. [Caldas] The expression "economic-financial equilibrium" as found in Article 7 of the provisional measure is being interpreted to mean the intention to establish a price schedule in the move toward the real. In what cases would that be used? [Arida] There cannot be a price schedule. As regards the expression you mentioned, there is some concern over the specific matter of old residential rents, which are covered by a specific law and certain rules regarding increases every six months. We will have to think about what to do in that specific case, which is regulated by law and must be treated differently than other cases. That is the only thing.
