FR940720-0-00029 FR940720-0-00001 The amount or range of the FY 1994 base annual fees for all materials licensees is summarized as follows: Materials Licenses Base Annual Fee Ranges 1Category of license 1Annual fees Part 70_High enriched fuel $3.2 million. Part 70_Low enriched fuel $1.4 million. Part 40_UF 6 conversion $1.1 million. Part 40_Uranium recovery $36,200 to $74,500. Part 30_Byproduct material $970 to $30,9001. Part 71_Transportation of radioactive material $900 to $64,700. Part 72_Independent storage of spent nuclear fuel $363,500. 1Excludes the annual fee for a few military ``master'' materials licenses of broad-scope issued to Government agencies, which is $430,500. Paragraph (e) is amended to establish the additional charge to be added to the base annual fees shown in paragraph (d) of this final rule. The Commission is continuing the approach used in FY 1993 so as to assess the budgeted low-level waste (LLW) costs to two broad categories of licensees (large LLW generators and small LLW generators) based on historical disposal data. This surcharge continues to be shown, for convenience, with the applicable categories in paragraph (d). Although these NRC LLW disposal regulatory activities are not directly attributable to regulation of NRC materials licensees, the costs nevertheless must be recovered in order to comply with the requirements of OBRA&hyph;90. For FY 1994, the additional charge recovers approximately 18 percent of the NRC budgeted costs of $8.1 million relating to LLW disposal generic activities from small generators, which are comprised of materials licensees that dispose of LLW. The percentage distribution reflects the deletion of LLW disposed by Agreement State licensees. The FY 1994 budgeted costs related to the additional charge for LLW and the amount of the charge are calculated as follows: ␣ 1Category of costs 1FY 1994 budgeted costs ($ in millions) 1. Activities not attributable to an existing NRC licensee or class of licensee, i.e., LLW disposal generic activities $8.1 Of the $8.1 million in budgeted costs shown above for LLW activities, 82 percent of the amount ($6.7 million) are allocated to the 120 large waste generators (reactors and fuel facilities) included in 10 CFR Part 171. This results in an additional charge of $55,600 per facility. Thus, the LLW charge will be $55,600 per HEU, LEU, UF 6 facility, and each of the other 3 fuel facilities. The remaining $1.4 million is allocated to the material licensees in categories that generate low level waste (965 licensees) as follows: $1,500 per materials license except for those in Category 17. Those licensees that generate a significant amount of low level waste for purposes of the calculation of the $1,500 surcharge are in fee Categories 1.B, 1.D, 2.C, 3.A, 3.B, 3.C, 3.L, 3.M, 3.N, 4.A, 4.B, 4.C, 5.B, 6.A, and 7.B. The surcharge for licenses in fee Category 17, which also generate and/or dispose of low level waste, is $22,800. Of the $6.3 million not recovered from small entities, $1.0 million is allocated to fuel facilities and other materials licensees. This results in a surcharge of $170 per category for each fuel facility and materials licensee that is not eligible for the small entity fee. On the basis of this calculation, a fuel facility (a high enriched fuel fabrication licensee, for example) pays a base annual fee of $3,176,000 and an additional charge of $55,770 for LLW activities and small entity costs. A medical center with a broad-scope program pays a base annual fee of $30,900 and an additional charge of $1,670, for a total FY 1994 annual fee of $32,570. Section 171.17␣Proration 10 CFR 171.17 is amended to add a proration provision for materials licenses and to revise the provision for reactors. The annual fee for materials licenses would be prorated based on applications filed after October 1 of the fiscal year either to terminate a license or obtain a POL. Those materials licensees who file applications between October 1 and March 31 of the fiscal year to terminate the license or obtain a POL will be assessed one-half the annual fee stated in §171.16(d) for the affected fee category(ies). Those materials licensees who file applications on or after April 1 of the fiscal year to terminate a license or obtain a POL will be assessed the full annual fee for that fiscal year. Those licensees who file for termination or a POL must also permanently cease operations of those licensed activities during the periods mentioned for the fee to be reduced. Similarly, materials licensees who were issued new licenses during the fiscal year will be charged a prorated annual fee based on the date of issuance of the new license. New materials licenses issued during the period October 1 through March 31 will be assessed one-half of the annual fee stated in §171.16(d) for the applicable fee categories for that fiscal year. New licenses issued on or after April 1 of the fiscal year will not be assessed the annual fee for that fiscal year. The proration provision in §171.17 applicable to reactors is amended to provide that for licensees who have requested a license amendment to withdraw operating authority permanently during the FY the annual fee will be prorated based on the number of days during the FY the operating license was in effect before the possession-only license was issued or the license was terminated.
