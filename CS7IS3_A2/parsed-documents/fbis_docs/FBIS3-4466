With the approval of the Central Military Commission, a forum on grass-roots political work in the entire armed forces opened in Beijing. Comrades in charge of political work in major military units of the entire armed forces and armed police units as well as representatives from relevant departments gathered together bearing along their research achievements. To properly implement the new "Program on Strengthening Grass-roots Units in the Armed Forces," they studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building. Guided by Chairman Jiang's five-point instructions of "being politically qualified, acquiring perfect military skills, having a fine style, abiding by strict discipline, and ensuring adequate maintenance and supplies," they analyzed the situation, exchanged experiences, discussed problems, and offered many good opinions and measures. The participants said that the topics discussed at the forum were of major significance; the forum was held in a timely manner; it was a mobilization and arrangement for the entire armed forces to implement the "program"; they were more firmly oriented, had reached unanimity of understanding, acquired a clear idea of the key points, and cleared up their train of thought. In Implementing the "Program," There Is a Need To Hold Firm to the Five-Point Instructions--The Soul and Nucleus of the "Program" Using Chairman Jiang's "five-point instructions" to standardize and guide the work of strengthening grass-roots units is the soul and nucleus of the "program" and is also a prominent characteristic of the "program." The participants had complete unanimity of understanding on this point. They said: The "five-point instructions" give full expression to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building in the new period, reflect the demand of the new situation and tasks for army building, conforms with objective laws governing the work of strengthening grass-roots units, and includes the main component of this work. Therefore, the higher authorities and the lower levels in the entire armed forces should solidly establish the concept of using these "five-point instructions" to standardize and guide the work of strengthening grass-roots units, so that it will take deep root in our minds. In formulating plans, assigning tasks, summing up experience, and making performance appraisals, we should carry out and give expression to the "five-point instructions." This is the key to implementing the "program." Many participants said: The "five-point instructions" constitute an inter-related organic entity forming the basic factor of the armed forces' combat effectiveness; they must be comprehended as a whole and carried out in an overall manner. Leading institutions should take the overall situation into account and proceed with their work according to the "five-point instructions," instead of improperly stressing their work. Facts have proved that if leading institutions "concentrate on one thing only," the lower levels will follow suit; if leading institutions act recklessly, the lower levels will get into a muddle. Some participants said vividly that if you want to keep the fire burning, you must poke it from time to time, but not in a disorderly manner; if everyone pokes it as they like, the fire will be put out. This is the same with implementing the "program." Only when the "five-point instructions" are followed, party committees take charge of the overall work, and leading institutions and departments coordinate with each other, provide scientific guidance, and form a combined force, will companies be able to carry out self-improvement vigorously. On how to comprehensively strengthen grass-roots units according to the "five-point instructions," the participants suggested properly handling these three relations: First are relations between immediate and long-term interests. In all tasks, there is a need to make persistent efforts and prevent eagerness for quick success and instant benefit. Second are relations between breaking through key points and making overall improvement. Namely, attention should be paid to weak links in grass-roots units, one or two key points should be resolved during a certain period, and at the same time overall improvement should be taken into account, to promote coordinated development between various tasks and prevent "concentrating on one thing only." Third are relations between fulfilling priority jobs and performing routine work; in routine work, attention should be paid to cultivating the ability of military units to fulfill priority jobs and prevent stressing one point to the neglect of others. The participants also pointed out that the "five-point instructions" not only serve as guidance for strengthening grass-roots units in the new situation, but have also set very high demands on them. To meet the requirements of "being politically qualified, acquiring perfect military skills, having a fine style, abiding by strict discipline, and ensuring adequate maintenance and supplies," a great deal of meticulous work and prolonged efforts are necessary. We should acquire a new attitude and style, should always aim at this objective, and should not remain content with just being able to prevent incidents. To Implement the "Program," It Is Necessary to Strengthen Party Branches A company's party branch is its core in exercising unified leadership and maintaining unity. Strengthening party branches is not only an important component of the "program," but also an important guarantee for promoting the fulfillment of other jobs and serves as a key link in strengthening grass-roots units. Before attending the forum, many participants conducted special surveys on the strengthening of grass-roots party branches. They discovered that in the last few years, with the efforts of leaders at various levels, grass-roots party branches had made new progress in strengthening themselves, party members quality improved, grass-roots party organizations became more perfect, and their meetings on criticism and self-criticism were ensured. But there are still many problems. Prominent ones include the quality of some party members being low and some party branches being unable to properly fulfill their role. For this reason, it is necessary to put into effect the 14th CPC National Congress instruction of "exercising strict management over the party," to make great efforts to "improve its quality and fulfill its role," and to do a good job in implementing the "program." The participants made the following analysis: The low quality of party member results from many factors, but the main factors are that there is no guarantee for education and no effective enforcement of management. Sometimes, political education is conducted in substitution for party member education, during which education aimed at the actual mental states of party members is lacking. In some units, education is separate from party members organizational activities, management, and supervision, therefore education lacks principles and militant spirit. In the participants' opinion, to improve the quality of party members, there is a need to conduct education and exercise strict management simultaneously. In conducting education, the most important point is to arm the minds of party members with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to fundamentally improve their political consciousness as well as their determination and awareness in maintaining unanimity with the party Central Committee and exercising the party's basic line. In the meantime, in light of party members' special needs, intra-party education should be carried out with specific purposes in mind. The party study course system must be upheld for frequent education on the party's nature, aims, and tasks, as well as party members' criteria, rights, and duties, so that they will seriously learn from Lei Feng, Su Ning, Xu Honggang, and other fine party members, and constantly improve their party spirit. This year, in accordance with requirements of the General Political Department, education will focus on strengthening faith in communism, upholding the party's basic line, and wholeheartedly serving the people. In exercising management, there is a need to persist in the party's regular activity system so that party members can take part in such activities, party organizations can boldly exercise management, and party members are willing to accept such management. How should the role of a party branch as a combat bastion be brought into play? Participants' opinions on this can be summed up in three points: First, attention should be paid to party branch secretaries and deputy secretaries. In implementing the "program," stress should be laid on party branches and prominence given to party branch secretaries and deputy secretaries so that they will improve their sense of responsibility for their jobs. In handling the relation between "being able to do something" and "wishing to do something," it is necessary to resolve the problem of "wishing to do something." If someone has a strong sense of responsibility for his work, he will learn how to do it and can finally do it well. Some participants, in light of the specific experience of their units, proposed bringing about three transformations, namely transformation from assigning adequate numbers of cadres to assigning good-quality and highly-capable cadres; transformation from fragmentary to systematic training in terms of training methods; and transformation from organizational perfection to ideological stability in terms of strengthening armed forces units. Second, the mood of observing principles must be strengthened. Great efforts must be made to remove difficulties in conducting criticism, to increase the ideological contents and principles of intraparty activities. We must be bold in dealing with wrong ideas and unhealthy tendencies, instead of tolerating them, and we must not allow fellow-villagers' relations, favoritism, or personal interests to replace normal intraparty relations. Appraising party members is a good method to strengthen intra-party supervision. This should be upheld as a system and the appraisal content and method should be constantly improved. Third, help should be provided for the less advanced. It is important to promote the advanced, but the less advanced should not be neglected. Less advanced party branches should be given assistance and guidance. If this proceeds in a planned way and step by step, we will be able to effectively overcome our weak links and raise the entire level of grass-roots party organizations. In Implementing the "Program," the Ability of Cadres to Train Soldiers Should Be Improved At the forum, some participants analyzed the causes of offenses and incidents in their units and pointed out that following the change in the social environment and soldiers' backgrounds, many new problems have cropped up in how to train soldiers. But a host of facts have proved that whether or not an armed forces unit can train soldiers well generally depends on the officers and not on the soldiers. There are many factors causing offenses and incidents, but most of them are related to the ineffective education and improper methods of cadres. This suggests that improving the ability of grass-roots cadres to train soldiers is a subject to be urgently studied and resolved in strengthening grass-roots units. How should soldiers be trained well in this new situation? The participants pointed out that the most important point is to inherit and carry forward the Army's fine tradition in training soldiers. Despite the change in the era, the Army's experience in training soldiers has not changed, and this experience portrays the Army's fundamental characteristics. Regarding "separation from soldiers" of some grass-roots cadres, some participants said that to improve their ability to train soldiers, their basic attitude toward soldiers should be changed and they should be made to understand soldiers' feelings and love them. Cherishing deep feelings is in itself a coherent force. Present-day young people have strong concepts about making their own decisions and democracy; they should be understood and respected instead of being abused or given corporal punishment. Only when you have close feelings for soldiers, will they regard you as their brother, tell you about their feelings, and listen to what you say. Some participants cited an example of cadres unfairness in treating soldiers, to prove that cadres must establish an image of uprightness in improving their ability to train soldiers. If cadres are not honest or upright, soldiers will resent it. Particularly on the questions of joining the party, learning technology, studying for degrees, switching to professional noncommissioned officers, promotion to higher levels, and other issues involving soldiers' interests, cadres must treat soldiers equally without any discrimination and must not practice favoritism. How should strict management be combined with patient persuasion? This is also a question to be resolved in improving the ability of cadres to train soldiers. Some participants said that another noteworthy point is that whenever soldiers have shortcomings, faults, or errors, they are punished instead of being given patient persuasion. This is an irresponsible attitude and is quite harmful. Strict management over soldiers is necessary, but there must be a limit. We should be reasonably and logically strict; we should follow rules and regulations and must not formulate local policies which are different from these rules and regulations. Our strictness should also produce results, uniformity should be achieved between motive and result, and patient and meticulous persuasion is a must. The participants said that leading institutions undertake a heavy responsibility for improving the ability of grass-roots cadres to train soldiers. Some armed forces units have provided all kinds of training courses to help cadres master the basic method of training soldiers; some leaders frequently go to the grass roots to lecture on traditions in training soldiers; and some have purposely put pressure on grass-roots cadres so they can gain experience through practice. All these are worth propagating. Some participants also said that in helping grass-roots cadres improve their ability to train soldiers, it is also necessary to assist them in studying new situations and resolving new problems. As of 1 March, the entire armed forces began to introduce a five-and-a-half-day work week system. On the one hand, soldiers' rest time must be guaranteed and must not be willfully used for other purposes; on the other, management must be strengthened, and during their rest time, soldiers can be organized to study scientific and cultural knowledge and carry out healthy and useful recreational activities. In Implementing the "Program," Leading Institutions Must Cultivate the Idea of Serving the Grass Roots The "program" has not only clarified the criteria and tasks for strengthening the grass roots, but has also set explicit demands on how leading institutions should make a success of grass-roots work. In a sense, leading institutions have heavier responsibilities. Reviewing the practice of improving the grass roots, participants pointed out that in the last few years, leading institutions at all levels had done a great deal and made achievements in improving the grass roots; but they should not relax their efforts. Busily engaging in courtesy activities with people at the higher level, some leaders cannot concentrate their efforts on improving the grass roots; others lack unremitting efforts and are unwilling to do prolonged and solid basic work; still others have set low requirements, concentrate their efforts on their work only when problems crop up, and relax their efforts when the situation turns for the better. All these suggest that these comrades do not have an adequate understanding of the importance of the basic position of the grass roots or the prolonged nature and arduousness of improving the grass roots and laying a foundation. Improving the grass roots is a process of gradual and continuous development. It takes prolonged and unremitting efforts to improve the grass roots and lay a foundation. We frequently speak of "unshakeable barracks with changeable soldiers." A company's personnel, tasks, and environment keep changing; old problems may have been resolved, but new contradictions will arise; some jobs are fulfilled today, but on other occasions some jobs are left unfinished. Now there are many new situations and new problems to study and many difficulties and weak points to resolve. There is a need to keep improving the grass roots all the year round and to consolidate the foundation all the year round. The participants had this same feeling: In the final analysis, leading institutions should serve the grass roots. With service in mind, they will work out measures and methods and go into action. Some comrades said: "When you do something heart and soul, you can think out all kinds of methods." In serving the grass roots, one should not pay lip service only, the important thing is action. There have already been explicit regulations and requirements on reducing checking, assessments, and appraisals; on strictly controlling the number of meetings and high-level courtesy activities; on sorting out all kinds of registration books and statistical reports; on prohibiting the higher level from asking companies for written material; on leaving some room for work assignments; on prohibiting the retention of funds, equipment, books, and magazines to be delivered to the grass roots; on ensuring annual vacations for grass-roots cadres; and on prohibiting leading institutions from borrowing grass-roots officials and soldiers to help with their work. Now the most important thing is to put these into effect. As long as we really keep the grass roots and our soldiers in mind, we can think out more methods and do more for the grass roots. Many participants said that brigade- and regimental-level institutions are the forefront headquarters and are the leaders and organizers in improving the grass roots. Divisional-level leaders and institutions must step up their efforts to strengthen brigades and regiments and bring into play the role of brigade and regimental party committees as well as their institutions. They should take this as an important link in implementing the "program" and improving the grass roots. Years of experience suggest that for brigades and regiments to display their role as the "forefront headquarters," they must do a good job in these two aspects of work: The first is to be good at carrying out integration. Some brigades and regiments like either to cram the grass roots with the higher authorities' instructions or return the instructions to the higher authorities after circulating them from one institution to another. This is an important reason why job fulfillment is not ensured and confusion occurs at the grass roots. We frequently say that there are several thousand threads above, but there is only one needle below. Brigades and regiments should be good at acting as go- betweens. Brigades and regiments must have uniformity between their responsibility to higher authorities and their responsibility for lower levels. They must be good at creatively working out methods to implement the instructions and requirements of higher authorities in light of their specific conditions. The second is to exercise face-to-face leadership, so that brigades and regiments can obtain information from the forefront, carry out inspection and supervision over the forefront, resolve problems in the forefront, and provide service and supplies to the forefront.
