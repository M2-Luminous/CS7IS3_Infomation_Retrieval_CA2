FR941028-2-00004 FR941028-2-00003 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Forest Service DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Bureau of Land Management [AZ&hyph;020&hyph;05&hyph;7122&hyph;00&hyph;5499&hyph;24&hyph;1A] Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) AGENCIES: Bureau of Land Management, Phoenix District, United States Department of the Interior, and Forest Service, Tonto National Forest, United States Department of Agriculture. ACTION: Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS; Cyprus Miami Mining Corporation, Claypool, AZ; Proposed Leach Facilities Expansion Project. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Phoenix District Office, and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Tonto National Forest, are preparing a joint Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for proposed expansion of mine facilities of Cyprus Miami Mining Corporation (CMMC). The mine is located near the Towns of Globe and Miami, in Gila County, Arizona. CMMC has submitted a proposed Operating Plan (to be processed by BLM as a Mining Plan of Operations (MPO) and by USFS as a Plan of Operations (POO). The plan proposes to expand the facilities at the existing mine and has been filed with the BLM and the USFS, as required under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and Title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976. The BLM and USFS have responsibility for analysis, review, and approval of the mining plan. Preparation of the EIS will follow the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Code of Federal Regulations, title 40, subpart 1500. The new MPO/POO proposes construction of three new leach facility areas referred to as: (1) The Oxhide leach facility, (2) the BL leach facility, and (3) the GMC leach facility, together with the required ancillary facilities. The leach facility areas will be used for the purpose of placement and subsequent leaching of copper-bearing ore mined from reserves located entirely on lands owned by CMMC. The leach facilities will be constructed partially on federal lands managed by the USFS and the BLM, and partially on lands solely owned by CMMC (see acreages in ``Supplementary Information Section'' below). Ore placed on the leach pads will be treated with sulfuric acid leach solution. Copper bearing leach solutions captured from leach pads will be processed into high quality cathode copper in existing solvent extraction and electrowinning plants. In addition, an overburden deposition area (called Barney Overburden Site, or Barney OB) is planned. The overburden deposition area will be constructed to accommodate uneconomic material removed from the active mining operation. With the proposed expansion it is anticipated that the Oxhide, BL and GMC leach facilities and Barney OB will operate for the life of the mining operations, which is estimated to be 16 to 20 years. DATES: The public is invited to participate in the NEPA process beginning with scoping and the identification of issues in November, 1994. Public Scoping Meetings to identify issues will be held as follows: Wednesday, November 16, 1994_7:00&hyph;9:00 pm Miami Arizona High School Cafeteria, Highway 60 & Ragus Road, Claypool, AZ 85532. Thursday, November 17, 1994_7:00&hyph;9:00 pm Mesa Community & Conference Center, 201 Center St., Pomeroy Room, Mesa, AZ 85211.
