Moreover, the Sudanese Government has appointed officials to administer the region, moved some military units closer to the border, and set up a center headed by a number of senior officers from the Military Operations Department. Diplomatic sources have noted that the Sudanese measures conflict with the agreement that the two foreign ministers reached on the sidelines of the Arab League meeting last month. That agreement stipulates that neither side shall take any measures that might jeopardize the negotiations on resolving the crisis over Hala'ib. The new Sudanese moves have surprised the Egyptian Government, especially since the Sudanese Government has expressed its readiness to accept the Egyptian documents on the dispute. The Sudanese Government had previously rejected these documents, claiming they were forged British documents. Sudan's flexibility toward Hala'ib came after Egypt expressed its opposition to any attempt for secession in southern Sudan. In a telephone conversation with [Sudanese President] 'Umar al-Bashir, President Mubarak said Egypt would do its utmost to prevent the south from seceding from the north. Meanwhile, Syria is continuing to mediate between Cairo and Khartoum. It is trying to increase the meetings between Egyptian and Sudanese officials and to bridge the differences in their views.
