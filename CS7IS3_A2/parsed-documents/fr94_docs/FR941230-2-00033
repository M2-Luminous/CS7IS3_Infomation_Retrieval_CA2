ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing an order under section 306(a)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 335a(a)(2)) permanently debarring Mr. Abu Quamruzzaman, 178&hyph;10 Wexford Ter., Jamaica, NY 11432, from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Quamruzzaman was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct relating to the development or approval, including the process for development or approval, of a drug product; and relating to the regulation of a drug product under the act. Mr. Quamruzzaman has notified FDA that he acquiesces to debarment and, therefore, has waived his opportunity for a hearing concerning this action. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 18, 1993. ADDRESSES: Application for termination of debarment to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, 12420 Parklawn Dr., rm. 1&hyph;23, Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tamar S. Nordenberg, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD&hyph;366), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;2041. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Mr. Abu Quamruzzaman, a former Vice President of Quality Affairs of Biopharmaceutics, Inc. (Biopharmaceutics), pled guilty and was sentenced on October 14, 1993, for making a false statement in a matter within the jurisdiction of a Federal agency, a Federal felony offense under 18 U.S.C. 1001. The basis for this conviction was Mr. Quamruzzaman's material false statements made in an abbreviated antibiotic drug application, prepared by him for submission to FDA, for Biopharmaceutics' product Clindamycin Hydrochloride 150-milligram capsules. The material falsehoods included misrepresentations (1) about the batches from which samples were submitted for human bioequivalency testing and stability testing and (2) about in-process tests that were not conducted during the manufacturing process as required, but rather were conducted later using product samples stored in bulk. Mr. Abu Quamruzzaman is subject to debarment based on a finding, under section 306(a) of the act, that he was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct relating to the development, approval, and regulation of a drug product. In a letter dated November 18, 1993, Mr. Quamruzzaman notified FDA of his acquiescence to debarment, as provided for in section 306(c)(2)(B) of the act. While a person subject to debarment is entitled to an opportunity for an agency hearing on disputed issues of material fact under section 306(i) of the act, Mr. Quamruzzaman, by acquiescing to debarment, waived his right to an opportunity for a hearing and any contentions concerning his debarment. II. Findings and Order Therefore, the Interim Deputy Commissioner for Operations, under section 306(a) of the act, and under authority delegated to her (21 CFR 5.20), finds that Mr. Abu Quamruzzaman has been convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct relating to the development or approval, including the process for development or approval, of a drug product (21 U.S.C. 335a(a)(2)(A)); and relating to the regulation of a drug product (21 U.S.C. 335a(a)(2)(B)). As a result of the foregoing findings and based on his notification of acquiescence, Mr. Abu Quamruzzaman is permanently debarred from providing services in any capacity to a person with an approved or pending drug product application under section 505, 507, 512, or 802 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355, 357, 360b, or 382), or under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), effective November 18, 1993, the date of notification of acquiescence (21 U.S.C. 335a(c)(1)(B) and (c)(2)(A)(ii) and 21 U.S.C. 321(ee)). Any person with an approved or pending drug product application who knowingly uses the services of Mr. Quamruzzaman, in any capacity, during his period of debarment, will be subject to civil money penalties. If Mr. Quamruzzaman, during his period of debarment, provides services in any capacity to a person with an approved or pending drug product application, he will be subject to civil money penalties. In addition, FDA will not accept or review any abbreviated new drug applications submitted by or with the assistance of Mr. Quamruzzaman during his period of debarment. Any application by Mr. Quamruzzaman for termination of debarment under section 306(d)(4) of the act should be identified with Docket No. 93N&hyph;0462 and sent to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). All such submissions are to be filed in four copies. The public availability of information in these submissions is governed by 21 CFR 10.20(j). Publicly available submissions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Dated: December 20, 1994. Linda A. Suydam, Interim Deputy Commissioner for Operations. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;32140 Filed 12&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
