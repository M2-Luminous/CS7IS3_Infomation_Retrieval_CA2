This was followed by VMDK [Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians--DZVM in Serbo-Croatian] Vice Chairman Karoly Dudas reminiscing about the 1991 meeting of Hungarian head of government Antall and Yugoslav head of government Markovic in Szabadka [Subotica]. Dudas pointed out the great loss Antall's death meant to the Hungarian people, and expressed hope that in the person of head of government-designate Peter Boross, slated to take Antall's place, the Hungarian people would have someone equally supportive of the VMDK endeavors. Thereafter Dr. Csaba Sepsey, the chairman of the VMDK Szabadka organization, reported on the contents of a letter by Andras Agoston to the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] dispatched a few hours after Antall's death. This was followed by a debate over election preparations. On Saturday, the VMDK Board also analyzed the related activities that have taken place thus far. Since the VMDK election campaign concentrates on visiting the various areas, the first visits by people from the Szabadka organization were paid to Hungarian-inhabited villages in the Banat region last week (including Kisorosz, Toba, Torda, Magyarcsernye [Nova Crnja], and Debelyacsan). They were received with great enthusiasm. On this occasion, too, Dr. Csaba Sepsey did not fail to criticize MAGYAR SZO, asserting that its mast head should state "The daily newspaper of the Democratic Reform Party" instead of saying that it is the daily newspaper reflecting the democratic public opinion. He said this because voters belonging to the VMDK--Hungarian readers--were unable to learn from the newspaper about the 20-25 [as published] VMDK grand meeting last week, but instead could read much more about presentations made by the Vojvodina Democratic Coalition. "Parties supportive of Great Serb nationalism agree in one respect: Hungarians must be divided. For this reason they nominate Hungarians to winning slots on their slates," Dr. Csaba Sepsey said. Karoly Dudas claimed that the real opponent of the VMDK in the elections is not going to be Milosevic's Socialist Party, but parties and coalitions which profess to be democratic, and which "boast about being Hungarian." At this meeting, too, Dr. Tibor Varady was the subject of repeated criticism; in last year's elections he headed the VDRP's [Democratic Reform Party of Vojvodina] slate.
