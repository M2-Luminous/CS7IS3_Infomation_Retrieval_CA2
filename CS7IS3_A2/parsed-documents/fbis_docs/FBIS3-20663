This new high-tech product, the subject of competitive research and commercialization in the U.S., Japan, Germany, and other advanced nations, has several advantages over Ni/Cd batteries, including higher capacity, avoidance of Cd pollution, and larger-current charging and discharging. The 863AA Ni/MH battery developed by the authors has the following key performance indicators: nominal capacity exceeds 1000 mAh, 5-A discharge-to-0.8-V average capacity exceeds 950mAh (95 percent of rated capacity), low-temperature (-18ï¿½C) 0.2-A discharge-to-1.0-V average capacity is 835 mAh (83 percent of rated capacity), seven-day self-discharge is 15 percent, 28-day self-discharge is 29 percent, and lifetime is over 500 cycles (based on 1.75-h 400-mA charge, 1.25-h 400-mA discharge test). These parameters meet international standards, and low-temperature performance is state of the art. The authors have completed batch trial-production, and have constructed an intermediate-testing base with a single-shift annual output of 500,000 units [for details, see JPRS-CEN-93-006, 23 Jun 93, p 23]. The one figure, not reproduced, is a graph of voltage drops over time for five different charge levels ranging from 200 mA to 5000 mA. There are no tables. References 1.
