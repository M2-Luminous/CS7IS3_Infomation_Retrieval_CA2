He said that there are clear stipulations in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law for the Hong Kong SAR, namely, candidates for the principal officials of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR shall be submitted to the central government for appointment upon normination by the SAR chief executive. Therefore it is clear that the right to nominate and appoint the principal officials of the Hong Kong SAR Government rests with the SAR chief executive and the central government, respectively, rather than a case in which the candidates for the principal officials will be nominated by the British side and then submitted for consultation with the Chinese side, he said. He reaffirmed that the Chinese side will act in strict accordance with the provisions stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. "The Chinese side sincerely hopes that the civil cervants working in the various departments of the Hong Kong Government will rest assured and perform their duties, and will continue to render service for the Hong Kong SAR Government and for the Hong Kong people after 1997," the spokesman said.
