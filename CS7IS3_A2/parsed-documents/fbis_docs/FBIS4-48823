Replying to debate in the Senate on his opening address to parliament, he said: "We are now coming together, complementing one another in a stimulating environment. When I think about the future of our country, I do so with the realisation...all South Africans, black and white, are now united in the enlightening job of building a new country." Mr Mandela said leaders would have to counter many attacks and criticism, some of which was justified. However, "we must concentrate on nation-building, stress those issues which unite us". He said that when listening to debate in parliament, he had been left with no doubt that the country had started a new era. "We have reached the stage where we look at each other as fellow South Africans." There had been fights in the past, but it had to be buried and past wounds healed. The majority of Africans coloureds and Indians had not had the same education opportunities as whites. "You (whites) now have knowledge skills and expertise. We cannot build this country without that knowledge, skills and expertise. We want you to take leadership in the new South Africa. "Your future is secure, you can no longer...fear democracy."
