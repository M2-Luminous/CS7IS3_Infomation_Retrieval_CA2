Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition strategist and co-leader of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), a key coalition party, made the announcement at a news conference following morning talks among leaders of the ruling coalition parties. "Coalition parties have reached the conclusion that they should scrap both plans to introduce the new tax and implement a tax cut as they could not reconcile their differences over the plans," Ozawa said. Ozawa is widely regarded as the behind-the-scenes architect of the tax package which Hosokawa unveiled at an early Thursday news conference. The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] rapped the coalition government for revoking both plans to introduce the new tax and to implement a tax cut. LDP secretary general Yoshiro Mori said, "they used an irresponsible strategy and the cabinet should take much of the blame." Hosokawa's package calls for a 6 trillion yen reduction in income tax and for replacing the current 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax." The Finance Ministry had planned to cover the tax cut with revenue earned from the proposed new tax, the officials said. The Social Democratic Party, the largest among the seven ruling parties, renewed its threat to withdraw the party's six cabinet ministers from the Hosokawa administration if the coalition came up again with a plan to increase taxes. Emerging from the talks with the coalition partners, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo said, "although the coalition representatives discussed various aspects of the matter, we could not reach any agreement." "We therefore concluded that the tax cut and increase plan will be taken back to the drawing board so we can spend more time for discussion of the matter," he said. Following the announcement of the scrapping of the tax plan, Hosokawa pleaded with coalition partners to resume discussion on the issue of tax reform, officials said. Hiroyuki Sonoda, a senior legislator of Sakigake (Harbinger), one of the seven ruling parties, quoted Hosokawa as saying, "I want coalition parties to revive discussions" over the tax plan. Officials said the coalition leaders had to make the decision in order to alleviate intracoalition discord over the new 7 percent "National Welfare Tax," as the SDP threatened to quit the coalition in protest at the new tax proposal. The Finance Ministry's original plan called for issuing deficit-financing bonds to fund the tax cut and then redeeming the bonds and interest with revenue from the new tax to be imposed in three years' time. However, a well-placed government source suggested that the Hosokawa administration will have to quickly engineer concrete tax cut measures to achieve the 15 trillion yen comprehensive pump-priming package which Hosokawa will cite at a February 11 summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington. The Clinton administration has been urging Japan to take drastic economic stimulus measures to pull the slumbering Japanese economy out of recession, revive consumer spending and thereby pare back Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States. The Japanese Government was reportedly compiling the 15 trillion yen economic stimulus package featuring the 6 trillion yen tax cut measure as well as increased public works spending in the face of a veiled U.S. threat to invoke its super 301 retaliatory trade provision. Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama, reacting to the news of the decision to revoke the new tax plan, suggested to reporters the Hosokawa administration has not yet given up the hope of compiling the comprehensive pump-primer package before Hosokawa's departure for the United States on February 10. Hatoyama said, "We still have Friday and Saturday" to hammer out an intracoalition accord to compile a revenue-securing measure that would enable the government to compile the package. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters, "we are trying to secure an agreement to set up an inter-party consultative panel on tax measures, while the issue of how to raise revenue to finance a tax cut should be taken back to the drawing board." "If we continued to spurn the coalition's tax proposal, it could lead the coalition to collapse. We have to make a policy choice by considering where the SDP could offer certain concessions without splitting the coalition," Murayama said. He did not elaborate on the possible compromise deal. Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, leader of another coalition partner, the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters he believes the coalition should reform its method of producing and proposing a new policy measure. "My Welfare Ministry is in charge of welfare affairs. It is strange for the National Welfare Tax proposal to have surfaced without any advance consultations with the ministry" Ouchi said. The SDP has blasted the new tax plan as a ploy to force the nation to accept a de facto doubling of the current 3 percent consumption tax rate by merely renaming it as a "welfare tax." The SDP has argued that the coalition should insert into the new tax legislation wording that would ensure all the fresh revenue from the new tax be used solely for welfare purposes. But the Finance Ministry has resisted the SDP demand, saying that such a provision would tie the hands of the government in funneling the revenue to fund various policy measures. The SDP, which has insisted on the abolition of the consumption tax, boosted its parliamentary strength in a 1989 House of Councillors election shortly after then Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita enraged voters with the consumption tax he introduced.
