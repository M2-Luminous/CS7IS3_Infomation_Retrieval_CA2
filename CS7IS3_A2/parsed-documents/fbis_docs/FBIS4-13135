FBIS4-13135 "drnes074_m_94008" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 JORDAN Officials Reject Israeli Criticism Over Hamas Officials Reject Israeli Criticism Over Hamas JN1604075694 Amman JORDAN TIMES in English 16 Apr 94 p 1, 5 JN1604075694 Amman JORDAN TIMES English BFN [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] [Text] Amman--Jordanian officials on Friday [15 April] dismissed as "political propaganda" Israeli accusations that Jordan was helping the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), which has claimed responsibility for two suicide bomb attacks that killed 12 Israelis during the last 10 days and threatened to launch similar attacks in the future. "According to our information, the attacks carried out by Hamas inside Israeli were conceived, planned and executed in the occupied territories," a senior government official said. "Thus the accusation that Jordan is helping Hamas is unsubstantiated hasty and does not contribute positively to the peace process," the official told the JORDAN TIMES. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Thursday accused Jordan of helping Hamas although he did not say how Jordan was extending that help. "Israel cannot tolerate the situation of Amman being a paradise for the activities of the Hamas," Mr. Rabin said at a hastily called late-night news conference in Tel Aviv. "I see the need, I and the foreign minister together, to come and say to the Jordan government: This situation is intolerable." Another Jordanian official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, dismissed the Israeli accusations as politically motivated. "It is ridiculous to say that Jordan is helping Hamas in carrying out these attacks just because a Jordanian citizen comes out and says my group did it," the official said "what they (the Israelis) are trying to do is to look for scapegoats outside the occupied territories to blame them for their own frustration." "Instead of doing that" the official continued, "Israel needs to look closer to home to see that acts of Palestinian violence are in direct response to acts of violence by Israelis against Palestinians. Violence can only breed violence, as the Israelis well know." Jordanian officials generally believed that Muhammad Nazzal, the Hamas representative in Amman, who made the statements claiming responsibility for the attacks against Israelis in 'Afula and Khudayrah "is not himself responsible for the attacks and was only addressing journalists as a politician, which is not against the law." There was no official response from the Cabinet whose spokesman said it was still deliberating the accusation and preparing a response. But some officials privately expressed concern that such statements as those made by Mr. Nazzal in Amman were not compatible with the Kingdom's policy on the Middle East peace process and could put the country into a difficult position at a time when it is calling for linking the lifting of the siege on al-'Aqabah with its role in the process. They said that the Hamas statements from Amman played into the hands of the Americans and Israel who wanted to pressure the Kingdom further after His Majesty King Husayn tied the Kingdom's role in the peace process with lifting the siege against al-'Aqabah. "It is clear," a prominent Jordanian politician told the JORDAN TIMES, "that the U.S. and Israel want to tie the Hamas statements with Jordan's conditions on the peace process and the al-'Aqabah blockade." "They were unhappy with the King's conditions regarding al-'Aqabah and this is how they found a counter issue to pressure the Kingdom," the politician said. A senior official, who agreed with the politician, also said that Jordan also sees the anger expressed by the Israeli prime minister as another indication of attempts to undermine Jordan's role in the peace process. Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who joined Mr. Rabin in his press conference Thursday, said he was especially angry that Mr. Nazzal had said that the two attacks were among five that Hamas would carry out to avenge the Hebron Mosque massacre of dozens of Palestinian worshipers. "I don't know one incident in foreign affairs in which a state which says it is aspiring to peace would allow in light of day the head or representative of a murderous organisation to say: `We committed two incidents of murder and we intend to carry out three more incidents like this, in the light of day,' on the television screen," Mr. Peres said. Jordanian officials also believe that this is another link in the general antagonism many countries in the Arab region and the U.S. feel towards Jordan's democracy and inability of many of these countries to believe that Jordan cannot impose limits on the political statements of politicians like Mr. Nazzal, or force newspapers to take one side over the other. "Since the Gulf war, the U.S. and Gulf states did not believe us when we said we could not control the media hailing Saddam Husayn or criticising Gulf states," a well-placed official said. "Now when we tell them that we legally cannot take any action against Hamas issuing statements from here, they are also not going to believe us," the official added. "Hamas represents an extremist point of view which echoes statements made by the extremists on the Israeli side calling for the extermination of all Palestinians," one official said adding, "I do not see how Israel in a democratic context can expect us to muffle the extremist voices on our side while letting free the extremist voices on their side." Hamas representatives were not available for comment over this controversy, but one of them would only say that his group did not want to "make Jordan's position any more difficult than it already is." However, prominent Islamist and Islamic Action Front (IAF) Deputy Hammam Sa'id said that Hamas in Jordan had better leave claims of responsibility to come from inside the occupied territories. "All Hamas activities originate from inside the occupied territories and there is nothing coming from outside except political and media statements...decisions for Hamas are not taken from outside of the occupied territories in terms of military action," he said. Mr. Sa'id, implicitly criticising Mr. Nazzal, said that "the approach should be of a different kind. People inside the occupied territories should be left to express themselves by themselves as they offer sacrifices and take their own decisions."
