What do you expect from them? ['Arafat] First of all, I regret to say that the armed settler who carried out this horrible massacre was supported and shielded by Israeli Army units. We can prove our claims and I spoke quite frankly about this to Rabin when he telephoned me. First, we expect the Security Council to take specific measures to guarantee the safety of our people in the Occupied Territories. This has happened before: The massacre of Rishon-le-Zion [as published] or at the Esplanade of Mosques (in Jerusalem). Over the last five days we have also witnessed another massacre, throughout the occupied territories, from Bethlehem to Gaza, including Nablus and Jenin, leaving 21 dead and 240 wounded. In Hebron, the total dead is 65 plus 265 injured. This killing cannot have been the work of one individual. The army is fully implicated in this conspiracy. Perhaps not all the army, but at least the Hebron units. How could an armed settler have accompanied a military patrol under curfew and then attacked a mosque? We therefore need international protection. That is why we called for a meeting of the Security Council and the disarming of the settlers. [LE SOIR] What kind of protection are you expecting from the United Nations? ['Arafat] It appears we are facing the same kind of problem as in Algeria, before independence. These settlers, supported by elements within the army, are a new Secret Army Organization [OAS]. We must therefore restore confidence to our people who have lost all faith in the peace process. The events in Hebron have had an impact throughout the region. Restoring Confidence To Our People [LE SOIR] In exactly what way is the Israeli Army responsible? ['Arafat] This mosque has been surrounded by the army since the occupation of the West Bank in 1967. The Israelis have confiscated part of the site which they have converted into a synagogue. They control all the entrances, all the approaches. I am entitled to ask how this gang of 10 or 12 men, well armed, entered this mosque during dawn prayers, during the month of Ramadan, and in the presence of Israeli soldiers. How? Some of our people were gunned down outside the mosque, while trying to flee, by soldiers on guard duty. I spoke with our people for half an hour at the Hebron Ahli hospital to find out what had happened. I was able to speak to a worshipper who accompanied one of the wounded. During our telephone conversation one person cried: Abu 'Ammar, they are attacking us. I heard the shots myself. I described this incident in detail to Mr. Rabin when he contacted me to offer his condolences. [LE SOIR] What did he say? ['Arafat] He said it was just a lone gunman. I replied that this was not true and I gave him all the information. He said he would investigate, but that I was making a mountain out of a molehill. [LE SOIR] Do you believe the Israeli Government is implicated in the mosque attack? ['Arafat] No, I only accuse certain units within the Israeli Army. But the government must assume its responsibilities. Who supplied these settlers with arms? How is it they have been able to participate in joint army patrols? The forces of occupation bear full responsibility. [LE SOIR] What form should this international protection take? Observers? ['Arafat] No, we favor, as does France, the dispatch of a multinational force, as the Israelis do not want the United Nations. [LE SOIR] Would this force consist of soldiers or civilians? ['Arafat] Civilians? To do what? They cannot oppose armed men. In Angola they are not civilians, and nor are they civilians in Yugoslavia, Cambodia or southern Lebanon. Why should the Palestinians be treated differently? [LE SOIR] Do you think you will get satisfaction from the UN Security Council? ['Arafat] We will do everything in our power to ensure the protection of our people. Those who delay the adoption of these measures or who oppose them will bear the responsibility. [LE SOIR] You have dispatched emissaries to many different destinations. ['Arafat] Nabil Sha'th has gone to Cairo, Abu Lutf (real name Faruq Qaddumi) has gone to Damascus and Amman. I was in Algeria on Monday. We have sent other emissaries to Morocco. I telephoned King Fahd on Monday evening. We are remaining in constant contact with all the Arab countries. I have called for an emergency meeting of the Jerusalem committee under the aegis of King Hassan II of Morocco, of the presidential office of the Islamic Conference Organization, and of the movement of the nonaligned countries, the committee of nine is meeting today at the United Nations. I have also just met with a special envoy from Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the Greek foreign minister representing the European Union. We Need Time [LE SOIR] Would a Security Council resolution protecting the population allow the peace talks to resume? ['Arafat] I have also mentioned the disarming of Israeli settlers. By the terms of the accord we concluded, internal security will be guaranteed by us or, in those places where it is present, by the Israeli Army. There will be no other authority. Today, we are in the presence of a third force: The settlers. Who could accept that! And I tell you that all the Arabs support us. The Lebanese, the Syrians, and the Jordanians have also suspended the negotiations. [LE SOIR] Has the Hebron massacre changed the nature of the peace process? ['Arafat] It has totally changed the climate, but not the basis of this process. We were on the verge of peace. But instead of that we have witnessed a massacre. And the Israeli Army, rather than trying to restore calm, has aggravated the situation by claiming another 21 victims. [LE SOIR] Do you have any other specific demands regarding this settlers? ['Arafat] Rabin himself has spoken of this fanatical group, Kakh. Do you know that it has its own settlement? Are these men going to be allowed to train, with their weapons, in this settlement and commit their crimes? It was not me, but Rabin who was the first to speak of these political settlements run by these organizations. [LE SOIR] So you want them to be dismantled? ['Arafat] In one way or another, yes. These settlements, these fanatical groups, these settlers are time bombs waiting to go off. We are not asking for the moon. But we neither want to kill peace nor be killed by it. [LE SOIR] You have accepted Bill Clinton's invitation to continue negotiations in Washington. At least in principle. Has he offered you guarantees? ['Arafat] First of all, we appreciate this initiative. We applaud the speed of the American response. But we need time. Especially given the present anger in the occupied territories. The peace process has lost its credibility. We need concrete actions in order to reassure our people that they can obtain something different from the negotiations than massacres and more oppression. [LE SOIR] In present circumstances, can the framework of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement be upheld? ['Arafat] Since we signed this accord, the Israelis have never stopped their intrigues and procrastination. This text was due to be implemented on 13 December. That is more than 80 days ago. And still no result. Rabin assured me that there would be no more than a 10-day delay. Who is to blame? The prime minister repeats that there is no sacred date. On the subject of an international presence, the Israelis reply that there is no sacred demand. One day they will tell us that there is no sacred accord. And now there has been this massacre. A horrible massacre in a sacred place, in the middle of Ramadan. Can you imagine the impact that it can have on Muslims? The Ball Is in the Israeli Court [LE SOIR] Will the timetable be respected? ['Arafat] (angrily) You must ask them that question. We have spent months discussing the security of the settlers! And now we discover that it is the settlers who are the criminals. They are protecting criminals! [LE SOIR] Have you also asked for security measures for the Palestinians? ['Arafat] (silence) Yes. They were even bargaining on the number of police. Should it be 5,000 or 6,000 ... It is becoming clear today that it is our people who need protection. Not the armed settlers. Some Israeli ministers have also called for the dismantling of the Kirjath-Arba [as published] settlement. I am not the only one. [LE SOIR] Has your opinion of Rabin changed following the Hebron massacre? ['Arafat] I will wait to see what he actually does before I answer that question. I am a pragmatic man. It is not personal feelings which concern me, but the facts. Our people are appealing to us today. How can we guarantee their security? [LE SOIR] If Bill Clinton personally invites you to Washington, will you accept? ['Arafat] Nobody can refuse President Clinton. If he invites me, I will pay him a visit. But I am not going to pose for the cameras again. The Americans give the Israelis everything they want. Since we signed the agreement, they have provided money, the best computers, planes, loan guarantees. They have opened doors for them in Africa, in Asia, everywhere. When we ask for what is owing to us, the United States tells us to be patient and to wait until a final agreement is signed. The Greek Government is the only one to have offered us anything. [LE SOIR] So what do you hope to get from the United States? ['Arafat] I repeat, let us wait and see. The peace process is vital for everybody, not just for us. [LE SOIR] In September, you proposed a courageous peace. Can this wish still come true? ['Arafat] The ball is in the Israeli court. Do the Israelis have a de Gaulle, or even a de Klerk? De Gaulle wiped out the OAS. It takes two to tango.
