FBIS4-2977 "drchi073_w_94012" FBIS-CHI-94-073 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Local NPC Deputies Request Text of Xi Yang Verdict Local NPC Deputies Request Text of Xi Yang Verdict HK1304102494 Hong Kong HONGKONG STANDARD in English 13 Apr 94 p 4 HK1304102494 Hong Kong HONGKONG STANDARD English BFN [By M.Y. Sung] [Text] Twenty local deputies to China's National People's Congress (NPC) have signed a letter requesting the full text of the verdict against jailed Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang. They decided to press ahead with the request despite China's decision earlier this week to issue a statement on the offences allegedly committed by the Ming Pao reporter. Eight deputies did not sign the letter. Xi, a Chinese national living in Hong Kong, was arrested in Beijing late last year on charges of espionage and stealing state banking secrets. He was tried in a closed court and sentenced to 12 years in prison. In the past two days, local deputy Peter Wong has collected 20 signatures from the 28 NPC local deputies for a letter to NPC chairman Qiao Shi requesting a full text of the verdict against Xi. Among those who did not sign were Xinhua News Agency director Zhou Nan and his assistant Lee Wui-ting. Surveyor Kan Fook-yee also refused to sign because, he said, it insinuated China had mishandled the case. Educator Wong Kwong-hon refused to sign the letter because he did not want to be involved in the controversy over the case. "I believe the verdict is reasonable under the Chinese judiciary system," he said.
