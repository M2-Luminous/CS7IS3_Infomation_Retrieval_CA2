What was his scheme? [Iijima] The object of his strategy is to provoke further splitting of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Ozawa knows very well what "politics by numbers" is, because he grew up as a member of the LDP's most powerful faction headed by Kakuei Tanaka. This is why he is most concerned about the LDP's strength, which is still above 200 seats in the 511-member Lower House. This is also why he played the Watanabe card during the search for a new prime minister [Ozawa tried to split up the LDP by offering the premiership to LDP faction leader and former deputy prime minister Michio Watanabe]. Ozawa wanted to preserve his party leader, Tsutomu Hata, as a future choice for prime minister, because a "behind-the-scenes strongman" really gives full play to his ability only when the prime minister is selected from another political group. Unfortunately, Ozawa was forced to play the Hata card. Now that he has used up this precious move, he cannot let the new administration be short-lived. He thought that the policy accord reached by the coalition parties was not enough to support the Hata administration. He keenly felt it was necessary to unite coalition members into a parliamentary group. This is why he schemed for the formation of a parliamentary group, called Kaishin [Reformation]. However, he made a big miscalculation: The Kaishin project brought about the Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] pullout from the ruling coalition. Ozawa expected the departure of some SDPJ members who have been reluctant to participate in the ruling coalition, but he thought there would be no more than 10 defectors. [Fukuoka] Ozawa's strategy is aimed at taking control of the Diet through the influence of Shinseito, which holds only one-eighth of the seats in the powerful Lower House, by forming a chain of majority. First, Ozawa wanted to make Shinseito the largest party in the ruling coalition. Then, he wanted to unite Shinseito with other parties, such as the Japan New Party [JNP] and Komeito, to hold 160-180 seats in the Lower House. At the same time, he wanted to split up the LDP so that his newly formed party could become the largest single party in the Diet. By playing the Watanabe card, Ozawa tried to kill two birds with one stone. Playing the Watanabe card was intended to trigger further splitting of the LDP, while keeping the Hata card for later use. Ozawa also wanted to alienate SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama [who is a member of the party's left wing] from the Democrats [a study group consisting of rightist members of the SDPJ]. However, his calculation went wrong. He could neither dismantle the LDP nor preserve the Hata card. Moreover, the SDPJ bolted from the coalition. Ozawa did not anticipate how SDPJ lawmakers would feel when they abruptly learned about the formation of Kaishin. Thanks to his rationalistic idea, 99 percent of his plan was successful. However, he made a mistake at the last moment because of his impetuousness. This brought about his own ruin. [Kobayashi] Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] Chairman Keigo Ouchi decided to join other coalition parties in forming the new parliamentary group, although he had once placed greater emphasis on cooperation with the SDPJ and New Party Sakigake. Why did he change his mind? [Iijima] Ouchi felt more and more isolated within the ruling coalition since Sakigake decided to support the Hata administration from outside of the cabinet. He quickly came round to the idea of creating a parliamentary group, Kaishin, because he did not want to join hands with the SDPJ without Sakigake's presence. Ouchi and DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa met with Ozawa on 23 April to wrap up their discussions about Kaishin's formation. [Kobayashi] May I ask you a simple question? Why does not Ozawa become prime minister, since he is believed to be the most influential politician? [Iijima] It is not correct to say that he would not make himself prime minister. I should rather say that he cannot become prime minister, because a strong leader provokes strong antipathy. Moreover, Ozawa has not yet managed to remove all apprehensions regarding his health condition [several years ago he was hospitalized because of heart problems]. Ozawa believes that quality can change quantity. At the same time, he thinks that the converse is also true. This is why he seeks too much after quantity. However, quantity and quality are also contradictory to each other, because what we gain in quantity we may lose in quality. Ozawa is shy and sensitive by nature. He does not like to do something striking before others. He came to acquire the undemocratic way of jumping to a conclusion by ignoring the process, because he received his political education from powerful LDP leaders. Although he fears the LDP's strength in terms of the number of seats in the Diet, he looks down on each LDP member. [Fukuoka] I strongly feel his enthusiasm in defying postwar taboos. Ozawa served late Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, and former Deputy Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru. All during this time he saw that the LDP has always managed to steer clear of such questions as the rice issue and the interpretation of the Constitution's war-renouncing article. He saw Japanese politics being left to the mercy of the bureaucrats. This is why he has a preeminent fighting spirit. He built his own logic by listening to others, particularly to bureaucrats. His concept of an "ordinary nation" is an example. Communism has Marx as its matrix. In the same way, Ozawa's ideology has its own matrix. Ozawa denies everything outside his framework. For example, Ozawa looks the other way when reporters ask him about a subject that is unfamiliar to him. As he was close to former LDP power broker Shin Kanemaru, he knows the pleasure of being a behind-the-scenes strongman. However, at this moment, being a behind-the-scenes strongman should be a pain rather than a delight, because the political scenario turned out to be the worst. The Lifeline of the LDP and SDPJ [Kobayashi] Ozawa maneuvered behind the scenes to support LDP faction leader Watanabe in his bid for prime minister. What frustrated his plot? [Iijima] The major cause of his failure was that Yasuhiro Nakasone, Noboru Takeshita, and Kiichi Miyazawa have presented a united front against him. Ozawa thinks that the end justifies the means. He set forth an unreasonable argument that Watanabe would be automatically considered a pro-reform leader if he left the LDP to join the ruling coalition. Such an argument was inadmissible to the three ex-prime ministers. Miyazawa made every effort to prevent his faction members from deserting, without concealing his grudge against Ozawa, who had maneuvered behind the scenes to pass a no-confidence motion against Miyazawa's government. Nakasone dissuaded rank-and-file members of the Watanabe faction [which is the former Nakasone faction] from leaving the party, by relieving them of their anxiety. Nakasone apparently said that he would help them win re-election. [Fukuoka] The LDP itself has no strategy. However, the three ex-prime ministers, who have managed to make Ozawa play the Hata card, are now examining the possibility of paving the way for a dissolution of the Lower House. The day his government comes to an impasse, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will be forced to dissolve the Lower House instead of having his cabinet resign, because the ruling coalition has no more alternatives for prime minister. The three ex-prime ministers are probably aiming at killing the political reform legislation by driving the Hata administration into a corner and by forcing the prime minister to dissolve the Lower House. [Kobayashi] Why did the SDPJ bolt from the coalition? [Iijima] The proverb says, "A baited cat can grow as fierce as a lion." This applies exactly to the SDPJ. During the discussions for building a policy platform for the new government, the SDPJ could not but make vital concessions to preserve the coalition's unity. The SDPJ also came very close to being forced to admit Watanabe into the coalition. The SDPJ was really humiliated. As a reaction, it opted out of the coalition. It made the decision in one stroke, after it was deprived of chairmanship of the meeting by coalition representatives, and after it realized that it might receive fewer cabinet posts and fewer parliamentary vice-ministerial posts under the new government. [Kobayashi] Sakigake had planned to form a grand alliance with the LDP and SDPJ under the banner of "Protection of the Peace Constitution." Was the plan really realizable? Will this scheme come to the fore again in the near future? [Fukuoka] If Sakigake wants to form an alliance, it has to prove that it will sacrifice its own interests for the public good and that it will treat its coalition partners with due respect. Otherwise, the alliance is not possible. With the SDPJ's departure from the ruling coalition, the formation of a liberal alliance between Sakigake and the SDPJ is now possible. Many SDPJ lawmakers have received a considerable number of phone calls from their supporters, who favor the formation of a new government free from Ozawa's influence. Meanwhile, Sakigake's move to form an alliance for protection of the Peace Constitution with some LDP members has not vanished. [Iijima] I think Sakigake's plan to form an LDP-SDPJ grand alliance was superficial. Unlike Ozawa, Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura has a too optimistic way of thinking. To begin with, Takemura thought that if he could persuade former Justice Minister Masaharu Gotoda [a well-known LDP reformist] into becoming the leader of the alliance for protecting the Peace Constitution, many other LDP members would follow suit. I just cannot understand how he can view things as being so simple and so easy. [Fukuoka] Morishige Goto, chairman of the 1-million-strong All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union, is eager to have Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi as a new leader. Goto hails from Hokkaido, while the Workers' Union belongs to the Japan Trade Union Confederation or Rengo, the umbrella labor union group that supports both the SDPJ and DSP. Yokomichi might become the leader of the liberal forces advocated by Sakigake. However, on the other hand, Rengo is still in contact with Ozawa. Rengo is now caught in its own schemes. Another Political Crisis May Arise in June [Kobayashi] What is the Hata administration's character? [Iijima] It is a government controlled by Shinseito. It is clear that the Hata administration differs from the Hosokawa administration in character. As a behind-the-scenes strongman, Ozawa of today is too much in the forefront. There are also too many shaky factors. In terms of policy, Ozawa has a tendency to advocate categorical cooperation with the United States. However, Prime Minister Hata has slightly different ideas. [Fukuoka] As foreign minister, Hata was a politician following in the footsteps of the bureaucrats. However, concerning Japan's wartime responsibility, Hata's view is rather close to that of Hosokawa's. Hata values cooperation with the United States, but he also has his own point of view regarding Asia. There is a great possibility that friction might arise between Hata and Ozawa. Will Hata be able to make decisions as a top leader if such occasions arise? That is the question. [Kobayashi] Prime Minister Hata was obliged to form a minority government. Many people think that it will be short-lived. [Fukuoka] The situation is that a no-confidence motion against him can pass the Diet at any time. The LDP will probably maneuver to pass the motion at an early stage so that the next general election will take place under the old electoral system of multiseat constituencies. Another change in government might happen after the end of June. [Iijima] The Hata administration might end as a government, the sole mission of which is to pass the long-stalled fiscal 1994 budget bills. Within the LDP, there is now a widespread view that the Lower House will be dissolved in July and that the next general election will be held under the old multiseat electoral system. The LDP foresees that the ruling coalition will be forced to scrap its tax reform plan, which is expected to be presented by the end of June, because it will certainly be opposed by the SDPJ. This would give the LDP an opportunity to present a motion of no- confidence. [Fukuoka] After the enactment of the fiscal 1994 budget, the implementation of tax reforms will become a crucial issue. I also think that people will start crying for an early election focusing on the tax issue. There might be a general election under the old multiseat system, in the character of a quasi-plebiscite on the tax issue. The view regarding the next political crisis is based on these factors. If the next general election is held under the multiseat electoral system, most of the 50 LDP candidates who ended up as runner-ups in the last election are expected to make comebacks. All of them might not remain with the LDP, but it is probable that the LDP will get about 25 more seats in the Lower House. Ozawa is aware of that, but the problem is that he does not have any good moves to make. The day the Hata administration comes to an impasse, it will hardly be possible for Ozawa to tide over the crisis by having the cabinet resign as a makeshift measure. The only way left is to split up the LDP somehow or other so that the framework of the coalition can be changed. If it is not possible, dissolving the Lower House for a general election is unavoidable. However, since the LDP does not have any workable strategy, the question is whether the Hata administration will be able to avoid a deadlock until summer or not. [Iijima] I doubt if Ozawa really thinks highly of Hata and if he really wants to make the Hata administration a full-fledged government. Probably, Hajime Funada [Ozawa's close aide] is Ozawa's real choice for future prime minister. It seems to me that Ozawa is trying to preserve his influential power until Funada gets trained to be an executor of national reformation. What Will Political Realignment Bring? [Kobayashi] What will be the pivot in the next phase of political realignment? [Fukuoka] As Sakigake has been saying, there was a methodological problem. At least, it is certain that Ozawa's top- down approach to decisionmaking, his way of making a tool of Watanabe, and his quantity-oriented approach, are undemocratic. Policy goals will no longer be the pivot in the next phase of political realignment. The new pivot will be such factors as the method or the sense of values. [Iijima] People will care more about political ideology. Freedom is contradictory to equality in some respects. Protection and regulation are aimed at equalizing some one with another one. Ozawa wants impartiality and equality. Impartiality indicates equal opportunity. Here, the principle of competition comes into play. We should be aware that competition might bring about unequal results. The idea that opposes equal opportunity is equal results. As for foreign policy, there is the U.S.-oriented diplomacy against the diplomacy focusing on China and other Asian countries. A two-party system will probably take shape after two or three elections are held under the new single-seat electoral system. [Fukuoka] Shinseito's and Komeito's constituencies are basically different. So I do not understand why the LDP does not devise a stratagem to divide the Shinseito-Komeito bloc. Tax reform will be the next pivot. If the Government wants to introduce the principle of free competition, it will have to lighten the middle class's tax burden. If indirect taxes are increased, this will automatically cast a heavier burden upon people in the lower income brackets. [Iijima] If the LDP remains as it is, it will dwindle away into nothing. There is no powerful leader capable of supervising some 200 LDP members of the Lower House. Since the party has so many members with so many different ideas, I think the LDP would better effect divorce by agreement to form two different parties. If the party bears a different name, people will regard it as a new party, even if the personnel are the same. For instance, Shinseito was formed by those who defected from the LDP faction once controlled by Shin Kanemaru. In the last general election, Shinseito's polling score increased about 20 percent compared with the previous election. [Fukuoka] So you propose a fake divorce? [Iijima] Whether or not the LDP will be able to cope with Ozawa's strategy will depend on if the LDP effects divorce by agreement, or if it breaks up after falling into Ozawa's snare. The LDP can split into two political groups on its own initiative. The first group would associate itself with the SDPJ, and the second group would try to form an alliance with the first group and the SDPJ. Some LDP members are already moving into this direction following the departure of the SDPJ from the ruling coalition.
