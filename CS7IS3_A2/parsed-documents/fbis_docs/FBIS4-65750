The statement, in the form of a letter of protest to the UNHCR chief, Sadako Ogata, demands an "immediate and public retraction" of the reports, made two days ago by a UNHCR official in Geneva. The letter was signed by Jacques Bihozagara, deputy prime minister of the Rwandan transition government, formed by an agreement in Tanzania but which never took office because of the outbreak of warfare between the Tutsi and the Hutu tribes. "Not even our most severe critics," the FPR claims, "have doubted the (our) commitment to the security and dignity of all civilians in Rwanda." Bihozagara also called the UN agency's allegations "irresponsible and incomprehensible."
