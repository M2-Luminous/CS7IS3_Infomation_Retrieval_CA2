The constant flow of illegally obtained money through the international banking and financial systems is fundamental for criminal organizations as a means of obtaining funds necessary in financing their operations and in providing new capital for their expansion. Therefore, the interruption of the flow of money to criminal organizations is of utmost importance in weakening and eventually eradicating them. The illegal and criminal nature of money laundering is the main reason why the Republic of Panama, its government, and its people should decidedly combat money laundering. In addition, an analysis of the methods through which criminal organizations gradually take over a nation's economy shows that this struggle is an urgent necessity in safeguarding the future of our nation. This is the danger that looms over Panama and how it could occur: 1. Infiltration in legitimate companies. Criminals and drug traffickers, in particular, manage their businesses as large corporations. The only difference between these illegal operations and legitimate ones is that the illegal operations have an enormous competitive advantage: They do not obey any law. This advantage, in addition to their international contacts and vast financial and coercive power, allows them to acquire legitimate companies which are then used to conceal illegal operations. In this way, they gradually infiltrate every sector of the economy. 2. Concentration of economic power. The gradual subjection of legitimate companies in key sectors of the economy, along with the great amount of illegally earned capital that can be used to expand illicit operations, creates a concentration of economic power that subsequently can spill into other investments and economic sectors. Eventually, these might infiltrate political and government circles, and this would have serious implications for the nation's future security and its political and moral stability. 3. Money laundering as an ill-fated function in the economy. The final stage of money laundering is reached when illegally earned capital replaces domestic and foreign investment in funding economic expansion. At the same time, this surreptitiously harms the very foundations of the banking sector, the stock exchange, and the financial system. The risk of this happening is especially high in an economy such as Panama's--one that lacks resources and, in turn, is eager for investments. Corporations, Money, the Banking System, and the Free Zone: Given its geographic location and the configuration and extension of its territory, Panama has historically been a center of trade and transit. Although growth can be obtained in other areas, it is unlikely that Panama will turn into an agricultural, mining, or manufacturing power. Our greatest development potential in the immediate future seems to be in the sustained growth of maritime and tourism services while maintaining a healthy monetary infrastructure in banking and international trade. As a result, services have been identified as our best natural means of encouraging the nation's economic growth. Our service economy is based on our geographic location and the Panama Canal. In addition to this, Panama features four areas that are essential for today's service economy but, at the same time, are also threatened in various ways: --the Law on Corporations, which was approved in 1927; --the monetary system, which dates back to 1904; --the banking system, which was created in 1970; --and the Colon Free Zone, which was organized in 1946. The threats facing these four areas of our service economy stem from two sources: --from some sectors of the international community aimed at limiting their effectiveness and ending their existence; --attempts by criminal organizations to use these areas to benefit their illegal activities. It is obvious that Panama did not create these institutions to have them used for criminal activities. This is why Panama has the obligation to improve, control more efficiently, and finally defend these institutions to enable them to continue being useful for honest businessmen in an economy that is fundamentally service-based and whose structure will not change dramatically for a long time. Evaluation of Achievements: Drug traffickers and other criminal organizations use incredibly advanced techniques and employ professionals with broad knowledge of banking and financial affairs, with access to the latest technologies of electronic banking and instant communications to conduct operations beyond national borders. Therefore, international cooperation is imperative to prepare and coordinate measures that will make possible an effective struggle against money laundering. As part of these efforts, the 1989 Economic Summit created the Financial Action Task Force, better known by its English acronym FATF, formed originally by 26 countries that are sites of financial centers. Panama subsequently joined it as a member of the Caribbean subgroup. In May 1990, the FATF adopted 40 recommendations on measures to counter money laundering, based on the 1988 Vienna Convention. Fulfillment or adoption of these 40 recommendations currently constitutes the best means to evaluate progress in these struggles, and, in fact, in April 1991 the member countries agreed that their comparative progress in this regard will be evaluated by experts from the group. In Panama's case, an objective evaluation reviewing these recommendations and other facts would reveal the following: 1. Panama ratified the Vienna Convention in December 1993 and is in the process of implementing those articles that are not included in Panamanian legislation. (Recommendation No. 1). 2. Panama's banking confidentiality laws do not involve absolute secrecy as it is made to appear to locals and foreigners. Panamanian laws unquestionably permit authorities access to confidential information through the proper judicial institutions in the presence of suspicious criminal activity. (Recommendation No. 2). 3. Panama accepts international assistance and coordination against criminal activities, as can be confirmed by the recent mutual legal assistance treaties negotiated with the United Kingdom, Colombia, Canada, and Central America and the initial negotiations with Mexico. In July 1991, Panama ratified a similar treaty with the United States, which has yet to ratify it. (Recommendation No. 3). 4. Through Law No. 23 of 1986, Panama defined as a crime the improper use of banking transactions. In addition to the criminal liability that this crime entails, Law No. 23 also establishes the civil liability of the individual or his employer. In addition to the transactions made in Panama, this definition also includes those originating in Panama and perfected abroad, with knowledge, through an individual or intervening person. Lastly, Law No. 23 and its reforms will permit the seizure and confiscation of assets or instruments related to the criminal action. (Recommendations Nos. 4 and 5). 5. There is no official agency with sufficient authority and responsibility to define, coordinate, and implement actions against money laundering. The vacuum caused by the absence of such an agency cannot currently be filled by the National Banking Commission because of legal, technical, and budgetary limitations. This constitutes one of the most serious limitations Panama has in the struggle against laundering. (Recommendations Nos. 9-11). 6. Cabinet Decree No. 41 of February 1990 establishes as an obligation the identification of the client and registration of transactions in cash and negotiable instruments. This decree is the source of authority that permitted the National Banking Commission to issue Resolutions Nos. 5-90 and 1-91 regulating the banks' obligation to know their clients and maintain a registry of transactions in cash and negotiable payment instruments. Unfortunately, the National Banking Commission does not have the resources to create an automatized database to adequately handle this information. (Recommendations Nos. 12-14). 7. Decree No. 41 and the relevant resolutions do not explicitly address the problem of complex or uncommon transactions or the topic of patterns or trends of infrequent or unusual transactions. Decree No. 41 also does not address the banks' responsibility to investigate these types of transactions to establish their origin or purpose. (Recommendation No. 15). 8. Regarding dubious transactions, the Penal Code stipulates that banks and their employees are required to tell the relevant authorities about them under penalty of harboring criminal activities. However, there is no legal precedent in Panamanian courts that protects the institution or its employees from civil or criminal responsibility for violating banking secrecy laws in these cases. In addition, in terms of suspicious activities, no law requires that banks terminate their relation with the client. Finally, no legal precept requires banks to implement procedures including controls, screening procedures, policies, and training and internal audit programs against money laundering. This lack of clear guidelines on the policies banks should adopt to prevent domestic or international money laundering curtails the confidence with which banks can act regarding compliance with their legal obligations against money laundering (Recommendation Nos. 16-22). 9. Panama has implemented additional measures to avert money laundering, including the cash transactions declaration and the internal promotion of alternative forms of payment such as checks, credit cards, direct deposits of salaries, and other transactions that replace the use of cash. However, although Decree 41 requires that transactions larger than $10,000 must be registered, it does not include electronic international transfers, nor does it require the creation of a national data bank operating under a separate government agency that guarantees its proper use (Recommendation Nos. 23-25). 10. Panama has not sufficiently strengthened the role of the National Banking Commission as a coordinating organization to prevent and investigate money laundering since the National Banking Commission does not extend its controls to other institutions that manage considerable amounts of money such as casinos, money-changing offices, and transfer agencies. The National Banking Commission lacks the resources and the authority to introduce, in all banks, adequate programs to prevent money laundering or measures to detect any suspicious behavior by clients. The National Banking Commission does have and does exercise the authority to prevent criminal parties from owning a majority of stocks in banking institutions (Recommendation Nos. 26-29). 11. As for the strengthening of international cooperation efforts against money laundering, Panama has showed willingness to participate at both the bilateral and multilateral levels within its current legal parameters and financial limitations. The exchange of general information by relevant authorities, except areas related to dubious transactions, cooperation between judicial and legal authorities, and mutual assistance in investigations through the corresponding legal and diplomatic means, should improve as bilateral agreements come into force (Recommendation Nos. 30-40). As part of an objective evaluation, actions by the Panama Banking Association that reinforce or complement achievements by the national government should not be downplayed. A brief list of these actions reveals that this Banking Association adopted in 1984, through an interbanking agreement, the Code of Conduct on Banking Operations, which was reformed in 1985 and 1986; joined in 1989 the Declaration of Principles of the International Bank for Clearing House Activities in Basel, Switzerland; prepared in 1992 and updated in 1993 a guideline for banks to prevent the improper use of their services; conducted in 1992 and 1993 training and information seminars on preventing money laundering jointly with authorities of the Treasury Department, Justice Department, DEA, Financial Crime Enforcement Network, and U.S. Postal Service; conducted jointly with the National Banking Commission in 1992 and 1993 a study to establish, as was done, consistence between the information on cashflows and the remittances of excess cash to the U.S. Federal Reserve; adopted in March 1993 Interbanking Agreement No. 28, which determines the order of endorsements on checks and facilitates audits thereof; adopted in June 1993 Interbanking Agreement No. 29, which regulates the acceptance of alternate documents for negotiable payment and the criteria to send and receive remittances of bank transfers. Recommendations Additional measures that the Panamanian public sector as well as the private sector should take to combat money laundering must result from Panamanian analysis--an analysis that must take place within the domestic arena, while maintaining cooperation with other nations. This analysis should focus on what is needed to help us wage an efficient struggle against money laundering. This analysis should also result from our philosophical conviction that this struggle is ethical, moral, and economically prudent for Panama. In terms of its internal policies, the Panama Banking Association proposes: 1. to bring up to date its Code of Conduct on Banking Operations; 2. to improve, wherever possible, the "Guide for Banks To Prevent the Misuse of Services" [Guia a los Bancos Para Prevenir el Uso Indebido de Sus Servicios]; 3. to defend our customers' rights to confidentiality in legitimate business transactions, as provided for under our legislation; 4. and to combat the abuse of confidentially by organizations or individuals devoted to criminal activity. The Panama Banking Association recommends to Panama's executive, legislative, and judicial powers: 1. The creation of a working group with a mandate to design a national policy against money laundering; this working group should comprise representatives of the Attorney General's Office, the National Banking Commission, and the Legislative Assembly's Drug Commission. 2. The endowing of the National Banking Commission with the technical, legal, and budgetary resources to carry out the integration, execution, and coordination of a national policy to prevent money laundering. 3. The prompt issuance of legal documents to implement the guidelines of the Vienna Convention and the FATF with regard to the banks obligation to: 3.1. register all international and local transactions in a logbook subject to revision by the Banking Commission; 3.2. rigorously investigate the origin and destination of intricate and unusual transactions; 3.3. report to the authorities suspicious transactions, safeguarding civil obligations concerning confidentiality; 3.4. implement in banks procedures and policies to prevent money laundering, training programs that impart to employees a thorough knowledge of internal auditing procedures, and programs to guarantee the fulfillment of these procedures; this duty would fall under the auspices of a high-ranking officer specifically designated to carry out these tasks; 3.5. register stock market transactions or securities deals that are unusual or suspicious in nature, subjecting them to revision by the Banking Commission. 4. The inclusion within the authority of the Banking Commission additional powers to prevent money laundering; the power to review the flow of funds from casinos, exchange houses, and money transfer agencies; and the power to enforce the obligation of these institutions to report such cashflows to the National Banking Commission. 5. The creation, as soon as possible, of an official data bank under the Banking Commission's control and administration to secure, compare, and analyze the information outlined in Cabinet Decree 41 of 13 February 1990 and Cabinet Decree 10 of 9 March 1994. This includes any other information--to be furnished upon request--regarding cash transactions, negotiable documents, securities, or transfers made through electronic or magnetic media. 6. An agreement on the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty [MLAT] to strengthen and broaden Panama's participation in the struggle against money laundering and the speedy ratification of the MLAT by the relevant institutions. 7. The adoption of a doctrine or a group of principles that oppose money laundering and emphasize systematic, continuous, and dynamic preventative action instead of focusing on how best to deal with crimes already committed. In addition, such a doctrine should protect our irreplaceable service economy and Panama's good name and image. Conclusion In conclusion, the Banking Association wants to acknowledge that in Panama, as well as in many other friendly nations, the problem of money laundering is a reality. In addition, it wants to signal that the problem of money laundering is constantly changing and remains extremely dynamic in terms of criminal creativity and resources available to criminals who constantly modify and invent new money laundering techniques, thereby making current preventive actions ineffective. The struggle against money laundering requires constant surveillance, quick action, and close international coordination and cooperation to remain in step with the criminals and to avoid losing the battle. Above all else, the struggle requires knowledge, commitment, and the willingness of the state and all national sectors to achieve final victory.
