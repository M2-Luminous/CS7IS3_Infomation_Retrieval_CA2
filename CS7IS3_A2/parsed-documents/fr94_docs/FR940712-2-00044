FR940712-2-00044 FR940712-2-00037 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM [Docket No. R&hyph;0841] 10 Percent Revenue Limit on Bank-Ineligible Activities of Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies Engaged in Underwriting and Dealing in Securities AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Request for comments. SUMMARY: In 1987 and 1989 the Board authorized bank holding companies to establish separate nonbank subsidiaries (``section 20 subsidiaries'') to underwrite and deal in securities that a bank may not underwrite and deal in directly (``ineligible securities''). In order to ensure compliance with section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377), the Board required that the amount of revenue a section 20 subsidiary derives from ineligible securities underwriting and dealing activities may not exceed 10 percent of the total revenue of the subsidiary. Section 20 prohibits a member bank of the Federal Reserve System from being affiliated with a company that is ``engaged principally'' in underwriting and dealing in securities. In January 1993, after notice and the opportunity for public comment, the Board authorized section 20 subsidiaries to use an alternative indexed method to compute compliance with the 10 percent revenue limitation to account for unusual changes in the level and structure of interest rates since 1989, when the 10 percent limit was adopted. When the Board adopted the indexed revenue test, the Board deferred adoption of another alternative test for the 10 percent limit that would be based on assets, rather than revenue. Inasmuch as the Board has had increased experience in reviewing and monitoring the operations and activities of the section 20 subsidiaries, and in order to allow these subsidiaries additional flexibility in the conduct of their securities operations, the Board now proposes to modify its orders approving the establishment of the section 20 subsidiaries to allow such subsidiaries the option of using an alternative measure to the revenue-based tests for assessing compliance with the 10 percent limit. The Board requests comment on whether asset values, sales volume data, or both measures should be used as a new alternative to the revenue test. DATES: Comments must be received by August 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments, which should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0841, may be mailed to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20551, to the attention of Mr. William Wiles, Secretary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 1. Background A. Ten Percent Limit on Ineligible Securities Activities of Section 20 Subsidiaries Beginning with orders issued in 1987, the Board has authorized bank holding companies to establish nonbank subsidiaries (``section 20 subsidiaries'') to underwrite and deal in securities that a bank may not underwrite and deal in directly (``ineligible securities''). 1 In order to assure compliance with section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act, the Board limited the amount of ineligible securities that these section 20 subsidiaries could underwrite and deal in. Section 20 provides that a member bank may not be affiliated with a company that is ``engaged principally'' in underwriting and dealing in securities. 2 In particular, the Board determined that a bank affiliate would not be ``engaged principally'' in ineligible securities activities for purposes of section 20 if those activities were not substantial relative to the other activities of the subsidiary. The Board ruled that ineligible securities activities are not a substantial part of a subsidiary's business if the gross revenue derived from those activities does not exceed 10 percent of the total gross revenues of the subsidiary, when revenue is averaged over a rolling 8-quarter period. Subject to this limitation, the Board has approved the establishment of over 30 section 20 subsidiaries, several of which are authorized to underwrite and deal in debt and equity securities generally. 1 E.g., Citicorp, 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 473 (1987), aff'd, Securities Industry Association v. Board of Governors, 839 F.2d 47 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1059 (1988). 2 12 U.S.C. 377. The Board and the courts have ruled that section 20 does not prohibit a member bank from being affiliated with a company that is engaged principally in underwriting and dealing in securities that banks may underwrite and deal in directly (``eligible securities''). See Citicorp, supra.
