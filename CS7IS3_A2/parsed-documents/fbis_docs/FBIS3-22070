Giving details of this Indian conspiracy to defame Pakistan, the minister called upon the international community to use its influence to check India from indulging in such shameful activities. There can be no difference of opinion on the question of India's hostility toward Pakistan. It has not accepted Pakistan from the very beginning, and that is why it never misses any opportunity to malign Pakistan on any issue. In the past too, a large quantity of chemical used in heroin processing was seized from the Samjhauta Express train, but the parties involved in this trade later tried to cover it up as a chemical openly sold in the Akbari market. Now that it has been fully proved that India is smuggling chemicals into Pakistani territory, including its tribal areas, not only through the Samjhauta Express but also through its agents, the government should take stringent measures to check this smuggling. It should also take video of such seizures and show it to the international community with documentary proof thereof, so the world can see the black side of the Indian character and realize to what extent India can go to fulfill its unholy ambitions and abominable designs.
