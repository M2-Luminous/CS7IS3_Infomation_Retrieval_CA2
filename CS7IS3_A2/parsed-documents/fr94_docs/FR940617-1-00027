FR940617-1-00027 FR940617-1-00010 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 48 CFR Part 215 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Overhead Should-Cost Reviews AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD). Q02 ACTION: Proposed rule with request for public comments. SUMMARY: The Department of Defense is proposing changes to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to provide criteria for when DoD activities should consider performing should-cost reviews. DATES: Comments on the proposed DFARS rule should be submitted in writing to the address shown below on or before August 16, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to Defense Acquisition Regulations Directorate, Attn: IMD 3D139, PDUSD(A&T), 3062 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;3062. Telefax number (703) 604&hyph;5971. Please cite DFARS Case 92&hyph;D010 in all correspondence related to this issue. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mrs. Alyce Sullivan, (703) 604&hyph;5929. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background This proposed rule originated based on a recommendation in the General Accounting Office (GAO) report dated October 30, 1991, entitled ``Economy and Efficiency Audits Can Help Reduce Overhead Costs,'' which recommends that regulations be revised to provide guidance for the use of overhead should-cost reviews. The proposed rule modifies DFARS 215.810 to supplement the FAR rule published for public comment on April 6, 1994 (59 FR 16388). It provides specific criteria for when DoD activities should consider performing should-cost reviews. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. , because contracts awarded to small entities normally are not subject to program or overhead should-cost reviews. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS sections will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 94&hyph;610 in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed rule does not impose any additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 215 Government procurement. Claudia L. Naugle, Deputy Director, Defense Acquisition Regulations Council. Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR part 215 be amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for 48 CFR part 215 continues to read as follows: Authority: 41 U.S.C. 421 and 48 CFR part 1.

Section 215.810&hyph;2 is added to read as follows: 215.810&hyph;2 Program should-cost review. (b) DoD contracting activities should consider performing a program should-cost review before award of a definitive major systems contract exceeding $100 million.
