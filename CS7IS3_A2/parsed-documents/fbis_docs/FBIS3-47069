The head of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia suggested parts of Macedonia and Croatia as sites for Japan's possible participation. Akashi made the request during a meeting with an 11-member fact-finding mission which arrived in the Croatian capital of Zagreb from Japan earlier in the day, officials said. He did not specify if he sought military or civilian peacekeepers. The Japanese team did not give an immediate response, the officials said. Akashi told the delegation that the situation is relatively stable in parts of Macedonia and Croatia. He noted that some Asian states like Nepal and Malaysia are joining the U.N. Protection Force in former Yugoslavia. In an interview with Fuji TV of Tokyo, delegation head Shunji Yanai said Akashi did not ask Japan to send peacekeepers to the Balkan region. Yanai, speaking by telephone from Zagreb, said Akashi merely told the team that he hopes Japan will positively engage in a personnel contribution. Yanai told Fuji's news report 2001 program that Akashi did not specify if the contribution meant dispatch of peacekeepers or sending medical or communication teams. The Japanese delegation left Tokyo on Friday and arrived in Zagreb on Saturday via Amsterdam and Vienna. Members are there to study possible roles for Japan in the U.N. operation. They will stay in former Yugoslavia through January 16, visiting Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and the new Yugoslavia. The mission returns home January 16. Yanai, head of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, played a key role in realizing Japan's legislation in June 1992 on cooperation in U.N. peacekeeping missions. He was then director general of the ministry's Treaties Bureau which supervises treaties and laws under its jurisdiction. Under the U.N. Peace Cooperation Law, Japan sent two 600-member engineering teams in rotation from the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to join U.N. operations in Cambodia between the fall of 1992 and the fall of 1993. A smaller SDF transportation support team is helping a U.S. peacekeeping mission in Mozambique.
