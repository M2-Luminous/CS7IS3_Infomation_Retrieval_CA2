The first half gives the basic principles of criminal legislation; this is its philosophy. The second part enumerates the criminally punishable acts and the punishments corresponding to them. We shall now discuss the "General Part" of the craft Criminal Code--it was developed by the Ministry of Justice and the president's State Legal Administration. Will discussion in parliament get around to this draft? It is hard to say. The Criminal Code in general is having a hard time. The 1960-model code, which is still in effect, is obsolete. A draft appeared in 1991--it was published in the journal ZAKON. It was never even discussed. And here is a new draft. Doctors of Jurisprudence S.G. Kelina and I.M. Galperin helped in the expert assessment of the draft Criminal Code. What Is Crime? Criminal law must first of all answer this "simple" question. How is it to be distinguished from the host of human actions which, although they may be of a negative nature, do not warrant jail and certainly not "the noose"? The Criminal Code now in effect: "A crime shall be deemed to be a socially dangerous act (action or inaction) specified by criminal law which threatens the social structure of the USSR, its political and economic systems, socialist property, the individual, and political, labor, property, and other rights and freedoms of citizens...." It is interesting to compare this with the draft of the 1913 Criminal Code, which was not adopted either. "A crime shall be an action or inaction specified by the present code that is dangerous to the socialist state of workers and peasants or the socialist law and order established in it." Protection of the individual is not mentioned at all--only the "state of workers and peasants" is protected. And what does the present draft have to say about crime? "A crime shall be deemed to be an act prohibited by criminal law under the threat of punishment. Socially dangerous shall be deemed to be an act that causes or creates the possibility of causing harm to objects protected by criminal law." In the first three definitions of crime there are the "society" and the "state," which inevitably politicizes the point of departure of all criminal legislation. But do the society and state have to protect themselves. Undoubtedly. But then is it possible to avoid "politics"? It seems to me that this was done in the draft of the 1991 Criminal Code which never reached the point of discussion. It seems that the authors of the draft managed to enclose the definition of a crime within a purely legal framework and yet it is fairly exhaustive. So is it worthwhile to give a very great deal of thought to such a "simple" thing as the definition of a crime; to weigh everything on the most precise scales so that in the list of specific acts and punishments there will be no loophole for arbitrariness. "Theoretical" imprecision in practice leads to derailing the proceedings of the State Committee of the Russian Federation on the Administration of State Property and justification of political violence. The Roman principle "nullum crimen sine lege" (there is no crime unless it is indicated in the law) proclaimed by the compiler of the draft of the Criminal Code must be upheld to the end in all its purity... The Death Penalty for the Firm Criminal liability of legal entities is something new and unusually for our law. That is, not living people but organizations may be sentenced to criminal punishment. It seemed to me that this breaks away from the general principles of criminal law. CHAPTER 16. CRIMINAL LIABILITY OF LEGAL ENTITIES Article 106. Grounds for criminal liability. (1) A legal entity shall be subject criminal liability for acts specified by criminal law if: a) the legal entity is guilty of failing to fulfill or fulfilling improperly a direct prescription of the law, which establishes the obligation or prohibition to conduct certain activity; b) a legal entity is guilty of conducting activity that does not correspond to its constituent documents or declared objectives; c) an act that caused harm or created the threat of causing harm to an individual, the society, or the state was committed in the interests of the given legal entity or was allowed, sanctioned, approved, or used by an organ or individual performing the functions of management of the legal entity. 2. The criminal liability of a legal entity shall not preclude the liability of the individual for his commission of a crime. Article 107. Types of punishment. (1) As basic punishments it is possible to impose fines, prohibit engaging in a particular kind of activity, or liquidate the legal entity. (2) As additional punishment it is possible to prohibit a particular activity or confiscate property. "Is the innovation of criminal liability of a legal entity not flouting the very foundations of criminal law? An individual and not the organization is responsible for the act. Only the Nuremberg Tribunal accused an organization of a crime. Is that not so?" "No," says the person with whom I was talking, "the legal systems of many countries stipulate the liability of legal entities: England, America, France. And we have an extreme need for this. Take ecological crimes--it is not enough for only the officials to be responsible. Or legal violations regarding taxes. And all the 'Panama affairs' with checks, auctions, and deposits. Or the mass media: Certain newspapers are directly calling for violence and war. The measures specified by civil legislation are clearly inadequate." "But will individuals who are guilty of crimes not hide behind legal entities? Remember our recent sanctions? The enterprises easily paid the fines and continued to destroy nature." "But the liability of the legal entity does not remove the blame from the individual. Unfortunately, the parties mainly to blame have always escaped responsibility. The guilt of the collective subject established by a court, the sentence of this court--the sentence that declares the organization's actions to be criminal--in the present chaos will help to single out legal business, even if it is with an element of risk, from criminal business into which entire firms are sometimes drawn." Criminal liability of legal entities will certainly evoke disputes. Still, the basic postulate of criminal law--the actually liable person is responsible--does not fit completely into the innovation. I personally am bothered by one thing: Will it not turn out that the sentence for the organization will save the organizers from a sentence. Justified Risk The draft Criminal Code, it seems to me, proposes a very important and typical market norm which will give a person the "right to a justified risk." Article 45. Justified risk. (1) It shall not be a crime to cause harm to legally protected interests when there is an objectively justified risk for achieving a socially useful goal. (2) The risk shall deemed justified if the goal that has been set cannot be achieved by actions that do not involve risk and the individual who has taken the risk has taken the necessary measures to prevent harm to legally protected interests. (3) Risk shall not be deemed justified if it was known to involve the threat of an ecological catastrophe or social disaster. That would be a legal form for the recent command-administrative times! Do not count "commanders of production, as they were called at the time, who would take literally a fatal risk to do something useful for the people in spite of stupid prohibitions. At that time there was only one principle: Do the absurd, but according to Marx; push unmarketable products but fulfill the plan; throw seeds onto frozen ground but do not disobey the raykom [rayon committee]. Some brave souls departed from the absurd and spent the rest of their days in jail. Yes, much has receded into the past. Nonetheless enterprisingness, innovation, the achievement of a legitimate advantage have always involved risk. There is no business at all without risk. But is it right, for example, for the board of a joint-stock company to risk the stockholders' money for their own sake? Is a risky operation allowable if the patient has agreed to it but it is not envisioned by medical canons? Life is always presenting us with situations that do not appear in the textbooks. And our law has not tried to regulate them. Is an Order the Law? What should a soldier do if he has received an order that is more or less clear? And what should a bookkeeper do if his direct superior orders him to distort the reports. And who will go to court if the subordinate has carried out a legal order? Article 46. Execution of an order (1) It shall not be considered a crime if harm is caused to legally protected interests by an individual who is acting to execute an order that is mandatory for him or any other instruction given according to the established procedure and in compliance with the proper form. (2) Causing harm to legally protected interests as a result of the execution of an illegal order or other instruction shall not entail liability if the individual was unaware of its illegal character. In this case the liability for the act committed in execution of an illegal order or instruction shall be born by the individual who issued this order or instruction. (3) Execution of an order or other instruction that is known to be illegal shall entail criminal liability but there can be mitigating circumstances. (4) Failure to execute an illegal or criminal order or other instruction shall not involve criminal liability. Article 8 of the Regulations of the Nuremberg Tribunal: "The fact that the accused was acting on instructions from the government or an order from his superior shall not relieve him or responsibility." Our popular semi-proverb "the order of the superior is the law for the subordinate" harbors a very deep contradiction. During war time the absolute nature of the order for the subordinate was formulated clearly in the Regulations: It was to be carried out without questioning whether it was criminal or not. Do it! All responsibility lay with the individual who gave the order. The draft Criminal Code proposes a different norm: It shall be a crime to execute a criminal order. But how is the subordinate to determine which order is legitimate and which is criminal? Can the call from the country's vice president to storm the city facilities be regarded as an order? What were the tank drivers who were given orders to open fire on the parliament supposed to do? There is no doubt that such a norm of law places each follower of orders in the face of a serious problem of choice. How is the "switchman" supposed to recognize the legality or illegality of an order? The legal experts with whom I was speaking answered: The "switchman," of course, is always the fall guy; but he does control switches; he is capable of diverting the train; but ultimately he is a "homo sapiens" and not an automaton for which the leaders do the thinking. Obviously, in these norms the law corresponds very closely to morality and a sense of justice plays a decisive role in the selection of possibilities of behavior. So it would be possible to exclaim after the poet: "Where there is no morality, what good are useless laws?" But still the attempt on the part of the authors of the draft Criminal Code to legally regulate precisely these complicated, nonstandard, extraordinary situations seems useful. Confiscation When you read the draft Criminal Code offered for discussion you get the impression that in many respects it has held to a position somewhere between the old and the new. I think this is especially clearly seen in the inclusion of confiscation of property as a separate punishment (Article 55). The people with whom I was speaking commented somewhat enigmatically: "That is an old question." Article 55. Confiscation of property (1) Confiscation of property shall be forced removal of property to state ownership of all or part of the property owned by the accused. (2) Confiscation of property shall be prescribed for crimes that are grave, especially grave, and exceptionally grave committed with a selfish purpose and may be imposed only in cases stipulated by criminal law. (3) Property needed by the accused or his dependents shall not be subject to confiscation... Yes, perhaps it is old, like Chernomor's. In Rus for ages the property of guilty parties and falsely guilty parties "has been confiscated by the state," especially if there was something to confiscate. At the beginning of the last century Aleksandr I declared confiscation to be a separate punishment. Soviet rule, having made pillage the norm of life, soon promoted it to a norm of law as well. Since that time confiscation has been in all the codes as an independent punishment. The crime may not have been related in any way to the criminal enrichment--still, according to the sentence, everything was taken except what was needed to survive. Yes, what has been criminally gained, if this is proven in court, must be taken away; there is no question about that. But this must be clearly documented. It is not enough to make mention of a crime "committed with a selfish end." It is necessary to indicate unequivocally what is subject to confiscation and when. The draft Criminal Code contains much that is new, and a good deal has been clarified. The norms of the "General Part" of the draft code lay the foundations for sanctions against organized crime, they strengthen punishments for repeat offenses (cumulative punishments), they introduce life imprisonment, and the clarify the liability of repeat offenders. The draft takes a large step from the "socialist" criminal law now in force to a legal Criminal Code. but here is the question: Will the parliament adopt the new Criminal Code? In 1991 the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation developed a draft Criminal Code which corresponded to market relations. It was not even discussed. Now the draft with which we have familiarized the readers has been submitted. But the parliament is busy patching up the old, socialist code. And the question arises of its own accord: Are they not expecting times like 1939? If so, I have the draft Criminal Code from that time in front of me. Perhaps it should be proposed to the parliament.
