For purposes of monitoring the fishery halibut bycatch mortality allowances specified in Table 6, the Regional Director will use observed halibut bycatch rates and reported and observed groundfish catch to project when a fishery's halibut bycatch mortality allowance is reached. The Regional Director monitors the fishery bycatch mortality allowances using assumed mortality rates that are based on the best information available, including that contained in the final annual SAFE report. Assumed halibut mortality rates for halibut bycatch in 1994 are listed in Table 7. These rates are similar to those used in 1993 and reflect mandatory careful release measures implemented during 1993 for the hook-and-line gear fisheries (58 FR 28799, May 17, 1993). The derivation of mortality rates assumed for the trawl fishery is discussed in the preamble to the final rule implementing halibut bycatch mortality limits (58 FR 14524, March 18, 1993). Assumed rates for the hook-and-line gear fishery are explained in the rule implementing careful release procedures. Analysis of 1992 and 1993 observer data suggest that mortality rates for the hook-and-line gear fishery generally continue to reflect 1993 assumed rates. The assumed mortality rates listed in Table 7 reflect recommendations by the Council after review of the International Pacific Halibut Commission and SSC recommendations. NMFS concurs with the Council's recommendations as the best available information for 1994.
