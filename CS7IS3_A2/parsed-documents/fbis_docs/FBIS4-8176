FBIS4-8176 "dreeu070_i_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Army Says Air Strikes Not Deterring Serbs Army Says Air Strikes Not Deterring Serbs AU1104211794 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian 1700 GMT 11 Apr 94 AU1104211794 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Press Center has announced that all information points to the fact that Generals Perisic [chief of the General Staff of the FRY Army] and Mladic are directly commanding the Serbian aggressor's offensive on Gorazde. The immediate commander of the ground forces is Colonel Grubac, who has received orders to unconditionally continue (?attacks) and capture Gorazde. It is up to him to decide on the means of achieving this. The Chetnik warlords' intentions toward Gorazde have not been deterred by yesterday's NATO air strikes. The losses inflicted by the NATO air strikes on Chetnik positions are not significant for Perisic, Mladic, and Grubac, although the targets that were hit are obviously important to the Chetniks and there is reliable information that they suffered losses on their side. [Words indistinct] will not say a word about this, just like they did not admit that it was their planes that were shot down over Novi Travnik at the beginning of March this year. Information [words indistinct] must not be given out. Karadzic and Mladic have imposed an embargo on everything that is happening around Gorazde. Colonel Grubac, who has orders to capture Gorazde, did not take the NATO planes' attack as a threat. On the contrary. This is yet another in a series of motives to continue carrying out his orders. General Momcilo Perisic is chief of the General Staff of the Army of the so-called Yugoslavia, and although he and Mladic are the same generation as far as their education in military schools is concerned, when it comes to operations around Gorazde, Perisic is avoiding Mladic. He is often in contact with Colonel Grubac, who directly briefs him on all events. Perisic's obsession is the forcing of the Drina River, which is why he has sent pontoons of the so-called Army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to this area. It is not excluded that in case of repeated NATO air strikes, the Chetnik forces will attempt to down them. The Chetnik persistence best shows whether and how many more planes again need to attack the aggressor's phalanx around Gorazde, states the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army Press Center.
