This decision was adopted at the prime minister's meeting with a large group of editors of national and regional newspapers on Tuesday afternoon, Valentin Sergeyev, chief of the press office of the Russian Government, told ITAR-TASS. It was also agreed at the meeting that the distribution of state subsidies will be made by a public council formed of heads of central and local media at the Russian committee on the press. During the meeting there was a thorough discussion of the situation and problems of the central and regional press, the need for financial support for most publications, particularly in the economically weak regions, Sergeyev said. The fundamental provisions of the draft Russian law on state protection for the media were also discussed. Chernomyrdin described to chief editors in detail the economic situation in the country and the government's cardinal measures for economic stabilisation. Commenting on the results of the meeting, Sergeyev said he believes that during the conversation chief editors received the maximum of information they need in their daily work and for grasping the actual situation in the country. This enabled them to revise the viewpoint about the alleged lack of understanding in the government for problems of the press. "I believe editors got convinced that the goverment regards the press not only as the `fourth power' but also as branch number one, the situation in which should always be given close attention", Sergeyev said.
