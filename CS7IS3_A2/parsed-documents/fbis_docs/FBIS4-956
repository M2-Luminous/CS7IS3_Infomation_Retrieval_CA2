The membership of the new party, whose name was not disclosed, is drawn from the MPD, the ruling party since January 1991 when the first free parliamentary elections were held in Cape Verde to end 17 years of one-party rule. Dissension within the MPD led by Prime Minister Carlos Veiga was first noted in late 1993 when the Cape Verdian ambassador to Portugal was retained in office in spite of accusations of diverting government funds to personal use. Monteiro, Fonseca, and Health Minister Rui Figuiredo resigned over the issue thus forcing a cabinet reshuffle on 4 March. The prime minister was reelected MPD chairman on 21 February which brought about the resignation of several senior officers including Mr. Monteiro, the party's former second in command. The MPD has 56 seats in the National Assembly as against 22 for the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde the former single ruling party.
