At the Ministry of Interior he is discreetly preparing a bill aimed at organizing primaries for the presidential election. In light of the difficulties the Union for French Democracy (UDF) and the Rally for the Republic (RPR) are experiencing to reach an agreement for a single list for the European Parliament election, he is more than ever convinced of the primaries' usefulness. More than five years after launching the idea of deciding between the different presidential candidates in his camp, this time Pasqua decided to resort to extraordinary measures to achieve it. Since he heads the Ministry of Interior and commands its resources, Pasqua is henceforth sure of attaining his objective. "When I have an idea, I don't give up, and this one above all," he notes. Pasqua wants to be the man that allowed the Right to win the 1995 presidential elections. The only key to success is sending a sole candidate to the first round. He remembers the 1988 failure only too well. He also knows that in one year, the majority candidates may be even more numerous than in 1988. Moreover, it is the best way to pronounce himself officially neither for Jacques Chirac nor for Edouard Balladur, but for the winner. Supported by the prime minister, Pasqua has entrusted many Ministry directors with the task of preparing the bill for the primaries. The directorate of political affairs, the electoral bureau and his adviser, William Abitbol, have almost refused to have anything to do with it, but the project will stay on the back burner until the cantonal elections so as not to sow discord within the majority at election time, given that the UDF and Giscard now reject this procedure, for which they nonetheless opted in 1990. The former president of the Republic believes it no longer conforms to the spirit of the constitution. As for Chirac, after having insistently demanded it for many years, he has been strangely silent on the issue since Balladur has been prime minister and enjoys a high poll rating. For his part, Raymond Barre remains firm in his position. He still terms this project a "veritable cretin-deceiver." The minister of interior and his advisers believe in the success of their plan and ironically note that "of course, the UDF may not take it too well." Pasqua is taking every possible precaution. He has asked numerous legal experts to use their knowledge to avoid constitutional problems. The charter that the UDF and the RPR jointly prepared in 1991 envisioned that only militants would vote in the primaries. Next, a grand electorate college was envisioned in case of early presidential elections similar to those in which de Gaulle was elected in 1958. However, in the Pasqua project, all voters, either from the Right or from the Left, would be invited to cast a ballot, even if Balladur still favors a grand electoral college. Question: wouldn't leftist voters choose the worse rightist candidate? "This is an argument for intellectuals," the Ministry of Interior explains. So that the constitutional council is not affected, the 1991 charter on the primaries was not adhered to on another point. It would make this pre-first round "compulsory" for their two political parties. In the bill concocted at the Ministry of Interior, the system of primaries could be applied to all parties wishing to use it. This is an fundamental difference, because compulsion would need a constitutional reform. The project thus envisions that, on one or many Sundays, all mayoralties, including socialist and communist ones, open their doors to voters to choose their candidate for the presidential election. As in any other election, municipalies would be responsible for organizing the election. The Ministry's competent services have calculated that the project would cost 70 million francs. Who will pay? Two hypotheses were quickly discarded: the first would have the state, and hence taxpayers, bear the burden; the second would levy a tax on the municipalities. So, political parties would pay. The more there would be, the lower the bill for everyone! However, municipalities would still advance the sums needed for organizing. They would then be reimbursed by the state, which would reimburse itself by not contributing to political parties the monies owed within the context of the law on financing political parties. The project has its limitations: it cannot prohibit unlucky candidates from running in the presidential elections. The project would immediately be rejected by the Constitutional Council. It would thus be a matter of a "gentleman's agreement," explains an Interior Ministry official. Only a leading candidate would present himself in the first round. One issue is still pending: should the leading candidate have an absolute or a relative majority? Electoral experts and jurists have not yet decided. However, they should do so soon, to allow the project to be submitted to Parliament as early as the spring session, making it possible to organize the primaries in January 1995. Before that, the project "aimed at organizing the primaries" should be submitted to the State Council, then to the Council of Ministers. At the Ministry, everyone is expecting a general outcry. According to Abitbol, "we certainly shall have no legal difficulties, but we ought to expect political reservations." First of all, from the PS [Socialist Part], which is "tired of voting for texts that suit the affairs of the UDF and the RPR," and knows that if the project came to fruition, the party would surely lose the presidential elections. Guy Carcassonne, a constitutional expert and a Rocard adviser, admits that while the project is not anticonstitutional, it is revolting and "crazy." Secondly, from the UDF: while constitutional expert Didier Maus sees no legal problems in the project as conceived, he does not favor it. UDF officials prefer to think that this law will never see the light of day. Giscard followers note they would not vote for such a project. However, numerous Republican Party and Social Democratic Center party officials believe that this is the only way to avoid a new Giscard-Chirac confrontation and relinquish the place to Balladur. While Pasqua's entourage is working on the text to make it impeccable, it states its readiness to discuss it with the UDF, on condition that it be only on a problem of commas!
