FR941216-1-00127 FR941216-1-00012 §184.122 Perchlorates. Perchlorates form slightly less sensitive mixtures than do chlorates and should be substituted whenever possible. Advantages of using perchlorates include this reduced sensitivity to impact and friction, the nonformation of a free acid when moisture is present, and greater safety in the event of accidental contact with the weak acids that form the principal part of many gums used in binding pyrotechnic mixtures. (a) Ammonium perchlorate alone does not easily explode. It is stable at ordinary temperatures, but decomposes at a maintained temperature of 302 ○F (150 ○C). It has the same degree of sensitivity to impact as picric acid. It becomes a high explosive when mixed with flammable materials and metal powders. (b) Containers for perchlorates and chlorates in storage include lined wooden boxes, kegs, barrels, and iron drums. All damaged and broken containers shall be removed from the storehouse and spilled material swept up and destroyed promptly. (c) Fires involving perchlorates alone may be fought with water. §184.123 Peroxides. (a) General. Solid peroxides decompose easily in the presence of moisture and shall therefore be stored in a cool, dry place. They pose a severe fire hazard, particularly when incorporated with combustible materials. Sodium peroxide shall be protected from contact with water, which renders it explosive. Hydrogen peroxide of approximately 30 percent strength is unstable, liberates oxygen, and resembles the solid peroxides. (b) High-strength hydrogen peroxide. (1) High-strength hydrogen peroxide (90 percent or greater) is shipped in specially designed containers with vents and stored only in containers vented to the atmosphere, constructed so that foreign material shall not enter the containers. It shall be stored in a cool, shaded location used only for that purpose. Containers of hydrogen peroxide shall never exceed 15 or 20 above ambient temperatures. Larger increases in temperature may indicate a decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide. Operators shall report any undue heating of hydrogen peroxide drums to the person in charge, and the area shall be evacuated immediately. A water spray system, installed in every hydrogen peroxide storage location, shall be turned on immediately upon observation of overheated storage drums. If hydrogen peroxide is to be stored for long periods, high-purity aluminum containers shall be used. (2) All tanks, tubes, and fittings shall be thoroughly cleaned. The recommended procedure involves immersing parts in a pickling solution of 0.5 percent sodium hydroxide at room temperature for 1 hour, washing with clear water, drying, immersing in a 5 percent solution of CP sulfuric acid at room temperature for 1 hour; washing, drying, and leaving in a 25 to 30 percent solution of hydrogen peroxide for at least 24 hours, then draining off the solution. The part is then ready for use. (3) Hydrogen peroxide burns and discolors skin. All persons handling this material should wear face shields, rubber gloves, and rubber trousers on the outside of rubber boots. Running water shall be available in the storage area; any part of the skin touched by hydrogen peroxide shall be immediately washed with water. Spillages of hydrogen peroxide shall be immediately washed away with water. (4) Only the following materials should be used in equipment coming in contact with high strength hydrogen peroxide: ``Pyrex'' glass, high-purity aluminum, pure tin, ``Keroseal'' or equivalent. Stainless steel types 304, 309, 310, 316, 321, and 347 are suitable for periods of 2 months or less. (c) Fires. Fires involving peroxides, except sodium peroxide, may be fought with water. Sodium peroxide fires shall be smothered with sand, ashes, dirt, or rock dust. §184.124 Nitrates. (a) General. Many nitrates are not flammable in themselves, and are usually stored in wooden boxes, kegs, or barrels. Ammonium nitrate, however, is shipped in special waterproof bags or metal containers. Barium nitrate is sometimes stored in iron drums. Regardless of the type of container, it shall be moisture-proof. Nitrates shall be stored in a dry place, since they cake in the presence of moisture. (b) Ammonium nitrate. (1) Ammonium nitrate in confinement can detonate with the violence of a high explosive, but this would require a relatively heavy initiator. Under the effect of heating alone, ammonium nitrate shall decompose. Contamination with chlorides, sulfur, nitrobodies, charcoal, metallic nitrates, metal powders, petroleum derivatives, and oxidizable carbonaceous materials sensitizes ammonium nitrate, accelerates its decomposition, and increases the violence of the reaction. Zinc or lead contamination lowers the decomposition temperature to 200 ○F. Galvanized metals and lead solder shall not, therefore, be used in the vicinity of ammonium nitrate operations. The burning of ammonium nitrate and combustible material such as wood or paper containers, produces a gas mixture that under proper conditions of pressure may detonate with sufficient force to initiate the detonation of ammonium nitrate. Fires involving ammonium nitrate shall be vented to the greatest practicable extent because air acts as a diluent for the hazardous gases, minimizing the probability of explosion. (2) In high pan (evaporating) operations, deluge systems should be provided over the pans for use in case of fire. Temperatures used to heat the liquor may not exceed 317 ○F (saturated steam at 100 psi). High pan operations shall be located at class 1.1 distances from adjacent structures other than the graining building. The graining building, however, shall be protected from the high pans by a barricade. The class 1.1 distances specified above may be based on the maximum quantity of ammonium nitrate contained in any one high pan. (3) Fires involving nitrate should be fought with large quantities of water, never with steam. Solid hose streams enable the fire to be fought from a greater distance but introduce the hazard of steam explosion, particularly if the nitrate is molten; therefore, the hose streams shall be directed from behind a protective barrier. Under some circumstances, when the fire is in the incipient stage and accessible, water fog may be used to an advantage but it shall have no smothering action since the burning material provides its own oxygen. (4) Storage of ammonium nitrate in explosives storage magazines is preferred. When stored in an area where there is a possibility that explosives may be projected into the nitrates, the requirements for class 1.1 explosives are applicable. When stored in an area with fire hazards only and separated by more than intraline distances from areas containing ammunition, ammonium nitrate may be stored in accordance with the requirements governing the storage of a class 1.3 solid propellant. (i) Buildings, other than earth-covered magazines, used for the storage of ammonium nitrate, shall be of a type easily vented if fire occurs, in order that the gases produced during combustion and considered potential sources of explosion to the commodity are dissipated. The floors of such buildings shall be of a type to prevent hazardous impregnation by the nitrate. (ii) Stacking within storage buildings other than earth-covered magazines should anticipate stacks no larger than the 12 by 12 feet plan dimension, and not higher than 7 feet. Aisles not less than 3 feet wide shall be maintained around each stack and between the sides of the building. The use of wood dunnage should be restricted to reduce the quantity of combustible materials present. (iii) Broken packages or containers shall be removed from the building and the spilled material swept up and destroyed promptly. §184.125 Powdered metals: aluminum, magnesium, and aluminum alloys. (a) Since a rise in the temperature of metal powders can result from contact with water and ignition may ensue, precautions shall be taken to prevent water from contacting the material. All buildings where powdered metals are stored or processed shall be vented adequately at the highest point of the room or building to prevent the accumulation of evolved hydrogen gas that results from the reaction between powdered metals and moisture, except when stored in watertight containers. (b) Exposed material that may be at a low temperature should be brought to or near the room temperature under conditions of low relative humidity before being placed in the operating room. (c) Heating equipment shall be installed in service magazines, when required, to bring the closed containers and contents to a temperature approximately that of the operating building. (d) Efforts should be made to maintain relative humidity between 50 and 55 percent in locations where metal powders are exposed, so as to avoid the hazard of static electricity while preventing condensation. (e) Operators should be cautioned to wear sweatbands on their foreheads and take other precautions to prevent perspiration from falling onto powdered metals. (f) Care should be exercised in locating pipes, to prevent condensation on cold pipes forming droplets of water and falling upon hazardous material. Leaking water pipes can cause ignition. (g) Powdered metals in metal containers with tight covers may be stored in general warehouses, provided that they are remote from oxidizing agents. The storage place shall be dry.
