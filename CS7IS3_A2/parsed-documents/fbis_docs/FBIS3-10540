Therefore, Central American and Caribbean exports will be at a disadvantage, particularly with regard to textiles and apparel. Second, as a result of NAFTA, greater investment will be channeled to Mexico, particularly with regard to the establishment of U.S. assembly plants and textile industries. These will prefer to set up shop in Mexico, not only because labor is cheap, but also because of the proximity of the U.S. market and the advantages NAFTA offers to the investors of the three signatory nations, Canada, the United States, and Mexico. According to an analysis of NAFTA's impact in Central America, drawn up by Kathleen Horkan that in turn was distributed by the U.S. Embassy's Information and Cultural Service, in the sugar sector, for example, Central America could lose its competitiveness in the medium term as it will have to compete with Mexico on the U.S. market. Another problem pointed out in the analysis is that Central American sugar exports could face greater restrictions on the Mexican market due to Mexico's promise to protect the levels of sugar exported from the United States. The textile and apparel sectors that represent one-fourth of the region's exports to the United States will also be adversely affected. Horkan points out that NAFTA will reduce the tariffs in the textile sector for Mexico; thereby threatening Caribbean and Central American competition in exports. "Another problem is that Central America could lose the opportunity of foreign investment in this sector as Mexico will attract greater investment as a result of NAFTA," the analyst states. Likewise, the Inter-American Institute of Cooperation for Agriculture [IICA] recently published a study on the effects of NAFTA on Central American agricultural exports to the United States. The study concludes that in three specific cases -- cucumbers, pineapples, and melons-cantaloupes -- there is risk in the short term that the Central American exports will be replaced by Mexican exports as a result of NAFTA. Nevertheless, the IICA study indicates that 82 percent of the Central American agricultural exports to the United States in 1991 correspond to products for which Mexico currently does not pay import tariffs to the United States. Therefore, more than four-fifths of Central American exports will continue to compete under the same conditions with Mexican products, even after NAFTA's implementation. The Federation of Private Enterprises of Central America and Panama, an organization that represent the business interests in the region, supports NAFTA. Nevertheless, it believes that "it will produce major detours of investments and trade: investments that would have come to the region, now however these will go to Mexico..." The regional institution indicates in an analysis that the Caribbean Basin nations would lose because Mexico would have the opportunity to export the same products free of import tariffs.
