The Serbs in Bosnia were forced to wage this war, not for a road, but for a state. Vladimir Nikolic reports: [Begin recording] [Nikolic] According to Kostunica, the international encirclement is living a life of its own regardless of what is happening in Bosnia. There has never been more negotiations about peace and less actual peace. The international community is not in even in a position to decide on the makeup of a body that would discuss the situation in Bosnia, let alone about the issue of peace. [Kostunica] The Muslims attacked Brcko. There were human casualties. The international community and its most powerful protagonists are not responding to this, probably because the Serbian reports about casualties are correct, while the Muslim reports about the casualties so far have, as a matter of rule, never been accurate, but exaggerated. [Nikolic] At this moment, Brcko could be a means for getting a more favorable division of the territory to the advantage of the Muslim-Croatian federation, however, it can also be a goal per se, that is, to break the Serbian territory in half and fan the war, Kostunica believes. President of the Peoples' Party of Montenegro Novak Kilibarda appeared as a guest at the news conference. In the name of this party, he put forward an opinion that if the corridor near Brcko is interrupted by force, Yugoslavia must become involved in the war, or must at least openly say so. Saying that there is no alternative, Vojislav Kostunica concurred with this opinion. Regarding the affair with the Dafiment Bank, the position of the Democratic Party of Serbia is that SRPSKA REC has published a fabrication. The statements of the Serbian Renewal Movement were branded as an expression of the lack of political culture. Kostunica said that he will privately press charges against SRPSKA REC. [end recording]
