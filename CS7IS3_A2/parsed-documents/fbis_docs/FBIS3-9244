However, he told journalists that two banks of virus strains which were used in research and for protection and defense purposes were destroyed at his order. He said in February he had been informed about the existence of a bank of virus strains used in research in the Central Military Hospital in Prague-Stresovice. The same applies to a similar bank in the Immunology and Microbiology Institute of the Military Medical Academy in Techonin, east Bohemia, of which he was informed in March. These banks of virus strains were destroyed as there was no further need in them, Baudys said, adding that the bank in the Stresovice hospital was destroyed on February 25, and the bank in Techonin at the beginning of March. Baudys said a commission of experts from the Defense and Health Ministries had been set up to study the matter. The experts took necessary safety measures and destroyed the strains. He said these substances were stored in minimum amounts for medical purposes as they were used in research and therefore served the defense purposes. They did not have the nature of biological weapons and their storage did not contradict the Geneva Convention through which the Czech Republic had pledged not to develop, produce or store biological weapons. Baudys said he wanted to calm down the Czech public. He was thus reacting to press reports on Thursday and today according to which dangerous strains of bacteria and viruses have been developed in the Military Medical Academy in Techonin to be used for the production of biological weapons. The daily CESKY DENIK wrote that these substances were stored at several places in the Czech Republic. "These reports can "incite people's fantasy," [quotation marks as received] Baudys said. Specialists present at the press conference confirmed that the virus strains designated for diagnostics were safely stored in liquid nitrogen and their liquidation was also safe. They said a bank of virus strains was created in the Techonin institute in 1970-1980 and was used for research, primarily for the production of sera. "Banal" strains, for example, viruses causing influenza made up 80 percent of the strains stored in the bank, while only 20 percent were "especially dangerous and exotic" strains, director of the Military Academy Vladimir Radovnicky said. He said there was also a bank of diagnostic sera in the institute and this will be preserved. Ales Macela, pro-rector for research in the Military Medical Academy, said the institute in Techonin was opened in 1972. He said he had been working there since 1975 and there had never been conditions there for the production of a larger amount of microbes necessary to produce biological weapons. He said the institute was dealing with immunological research and, among other things, with testing preparations. Tissues and animals were used for this purposes. The institute is not "particularly secret" and is accessible to foreign experts as well, Macela said, adding that Swedish specialists visited the institute last year.
