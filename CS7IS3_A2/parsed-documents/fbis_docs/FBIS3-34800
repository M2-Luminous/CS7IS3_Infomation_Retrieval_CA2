Two days after the attack some Western news agencies began talking about a horrible scenario in Sudan similar to the Lebanese civil war and the conflict between the militias in Somalia. If we examine the sequence of events over the past three months, from the mutual expulsion of ambassadors by Khartoum and London, to the U.S. media campaigns focusing on the violation of human rights in the south, to the Washington conference to which the opposition factions were invited with the implicit blessing of the State Department, we would realize that something is being hatched for Sudan and its people. True, there are differences of opinion between some Sudanese political groups and the present Sudanese regime, especially over the absence of democracy of the Western parliamentary type based on direct free elections, but, noticeably, most of the regimes on which the opposition depends are also lacking in democracy and freedom of expression. It is perhaps worth noting that the regimes which support some Sudanese groups in their legitimate struggle for democracy are the very same regimes which had plotted against the Sudanese democratic experiment which flourished after the downfall of President Ja'far Numayri's regime in an unprecedented popular uprising. The danger currently threatening Sudan necessitates that both government and opposition face it jointly in one trench because its aim is to tear the country apart and plunge it into devastating wars that would blow away all the positive achievements such as food self-sufficiency, freezing of foreign debts, and elimination of many aspects of corruption. For all to be able to stand in the same trench, there should be dialogue and frankness based on loyalty to the homeland and its territorial integrity, not on the basis of revenge and suspect foreign links. The fact that the United States has been hostile to Sudan and has added its name to the terrorist list is in itself proof that there is something positive in Sudan, something not to the liking of certain Western circles known for not always harboring good intentions toward the Arabs and Muslims. Why is the United States antagonistic to Sudan when there are no common borders, interests, trade exchange, or oil transactions between the two? What really disturbs some Western quarters about Sudan is that in Sudan there is a desire for real independence, self-sufficiency, a complete Islamic program, and equality, and an eagerness to open the country to Arab and Islamic investments and to apply the Islamic Shari'ah. The American rule is subservience of the regimes to the will of the White House and the states in its orbit. The exception is promotion of an Arab Islamic identity outside the framework of U.S. hegemony. When corruption was the only certainty in Sudan and when Western intelligence services were acting freely there under different names such as relief and human rights organizations, Sudan was at the top of the list of states satisfactory to both West and East, but when it tried to steer a different course the picture changed completely. Is it not worth noting that Eritrea, which had received every possible aid and support from Sudan's Islamic regime, is now complaining about its fundamentalism and denying all the aid the Sudanese people extended to the Eritrean people until they achieved independence? Is it not worth noting that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was the one who refuted the current U.S. Administration's allegations about terrorism in Sudan, while some of the latter's own people are volunteering to confirm these charges? It is difficult to claim that everything the Sudanese regime does is sound and positive. There are, without doubt, some reservations, particulary about the lack of democracy, but when the plot goes so far as trying to undermine security, drown the country in civil wars, and strengthen the secessionists and supply them with the means to sustain the war of attrition in the country, then many of the reservations should be set aside, at least temporarily. Sudan's unity, national independence, and dignity as a sovereign state must take priority over all other considerations.
