FBIS4-4685 "dreas065__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-065-A Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Bureaucrats Interviewed on Roles, Policymaking Bureaucrats Interviewed on Roles, Policymaking Vice Ministers Polled OW0204150294 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0204150294 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Excerpts] It has been said that the political and administration system has become obsolete. With such a view in mind, ASAHI SHIMBUN interviewed in late March administrative vice ministers of ministries and agencies, who are top-ranking career bureaucrats. In the interview, they were asked what they make of the criticism of bureaucrats. Asked how bureaucrats and the bureaucratic system should change, eight vice ministers--about 40 percent of the total vice ministers responding--admitted that there is "a harmful influence caused by bureaucratic sectionalism," and they said it is necessary to correct such a system. Meanwhile, most of them made the counterargument that it is not reasonable to criticize bureaucrats for playing a central role in decisionmaking in policy matters, and most denied that there is collusion between bureaucrats and politicians or business circles. [passage omitted on remarks by Education Ministry and Management and Coordination Agency vice ministers who hint that there are interministry struggles to protect the interests of their own ministries] In suggesting how to get rid of the harmful effects of bureaucratic sectionalism, Shigeo Mochizuki, administrative vice minister for construction, said that "we want to promote personnel exchanges between ministries." Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito said that "the current administration system has to be corrected under the leadership of the government." When asked to comment on the criticism that bureaucrats take the initiative in deciding on policies, 15 out of a total of 21 interviewees made a counterargument by saying that "such criticism is not reasonable." Five vice ministers declined to give a clear-cut answer on this. Futoshi Shirai, vice minister of posts and telecommunications, said that "it is natural for the administrative sector to speak up about policy matters within their jurisdiction." Many of those who made a counterargument expressed a similar view. Vice Foreign Minister Saito said that "it is partly unavoidable for bureaucrats to have a greater say" because the coalition government has so little experience in governing. At the same time, however, he said: "It is natural for the public to have doubts about bureaucrats' role, and it may be true that bureaucrats are playing a leading role in decision-making in policy matters. Bureaucrats must heed the principle of not making the final decision." When asked what they think of the criticism of Japanese bureaucrats leveled by the United States in the course of the recent Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito said: "It is regrettable to be the target of criticism. We will give careful attention to criticism in a humble way, and we hope to remove the misunderstanding, if there is any." Hideaki Kumano, vice minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said that the criticism "was amplified" beyond bearable limits, thus expressing his dissatisfaction with the U.S. criticism. As for the issue of the alleged deep collusion between bureaucrats on the one hand and politicians and business circles on the other, most of them, while denying their collusion with political and business circles, said that "it is necessary to exchange opinions with politicians and business leaders, and this is not collusion" (said Vice Transportation Minister Michihiko Matsuo). When asked what they think of former bureaucrats' finding employment with companies formerly under their jurisdiction, many answered in the affirmative in view of finding a new job. Some indirectly admitted the fact that former bureaucrats find employment in this way, saying "I cannot say that no former bureaucrats find employment with companies which are related to ministries or agencies for which they worked, but...." (according to Shigekazu Mori, vice minister of home affairs).
