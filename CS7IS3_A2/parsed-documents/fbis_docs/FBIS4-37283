Talking to IRNA in Peshawar Saturday Saeed said that convening of any seminar and participation in it would be "useless" and the sole way out of the current crisis is Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani's stepping down from power. He called on Iran, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to end the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan by forcing Rabbani to abide by Islamabad agreement and quit power. Based on the agreement, signed by Afghan Mojahedin groups here on March 8, 1993 in presence of representatives of Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, Rabbani should abandon the presidential post by June 28 or would be compelled to do so by the said countries. Esmail Khan along with governors of 15 other Afghan provinces had launched efforts from early last week to find a solution to put an end to the differences between Afghan Mojahedin groups. He had in his proposal called on Afghan belligerent parties to participate in a conference in Herat to explore a peace formula.
