FR941227-1-00014 FR941227-1-00004 Discussion The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that it received a report that the autothrottle system on a Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplane disengaged suddenly while the airplane was on approach for landing. The thrust levers could not be moved, and the ailerons were blocked in the ``NEUTRAL'' position. After recycling the flight control lock (FCL) system to the ``UNLOCKED'' and ``LATCHED'' position, the thrust levers and ailerons were free to move again. The thrust levers are linked to the FCL system to prevent takeoff revolutions per minute (RPM) from being selected if the FCL system is locked. Investigation revealed that a takeoff configuration warning for the FCL system may not be generated, despite the fact that the FCL handle is not in the ``UNLOCKED'' and ``LATCHED'' position. On some aircraft, the operating forces then may be insufficient to drive the handle back into the ``UNLOCKED'' and ``LATCHED'' position, and the flight control surface could lock unexpectedly during flight. This condition, if not corrected, could result in inadvertent engagement of the FCL and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;27&hyph;051, Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994, which describes procedures for replacement of the FCL handle and switch with a modified unit. Accomplishment of this installation will ensure that a takeoff configuration warning for the FCL system is generated if the handle is not latched in the ``UNLOCKED'' position. The RLD classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Netherlands airworthiness directive BLA No. 93&hyph;088 (A), dated July 12, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the Netherlands. This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require replacement of the FCL handle and switch with a modified unit. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. The FAA estimates that 75 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $1,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $88,500, or $1,180 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:
