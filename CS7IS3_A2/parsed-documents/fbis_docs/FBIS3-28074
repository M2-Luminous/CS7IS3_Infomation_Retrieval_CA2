We shouldn't approach inter-Korean relations including the North Korean nuclear issue in confrontational ways or regard them as a zero-sum game. We have to look at Russia and China from a comprehensive viewpoint." These are some of the points made by Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on Tuesday when he presided over a conference of heads of overseas South Korean missions. The remarks by Han, a former political science professor and internationally noted columnist, have attracted keen interest as he attempted to sum up problems with South Korea's diplomacy and raised points for the diplomats to reflect on. Han, who took over the diplomatic command post with the inauguration of President Kim Yong-sam's administration in February last year, was seen by many as issuing a warning that the nation's diplomats must cast aside their mannerisms and make a fresh start. He said a lack of long-term vision, planning and extemporaneousness, as well as rigidity and wild talking are aspects that characterized past South Korean diplomacy. After casting aside these characteristics, Han suggested the nation's envoys should pursue practical, predictable, forward-looking, self-confident and substantial diplomacy. Above all, Han counselled his diplomats to stop pursuing confrontational diplomacy with North Korea. If there is one phrase that sums up South Korean diplomacy other than "new diplomacy," he said, it has to be "practical diplomacy." Han noted that some are now saying it is the Chinese president's turn to visit South Korea since former president No Tae-u visited China in 1992. But under the "new diplomacy," Han said, President Kim will visit China in March, without being bound by protocol and formality. This, he explained, is practical diplomacy. The foreign minister then suggested "a diplomacy that can anticipate the future," and "a flexible diplomacy" as desirable directions after practical diplomacy. Rather than panicking when an event unexpectedly takes place, Han urged the diplomats to carry out their work with mid- and long-term prospects in mind so that the outcome can be anticipated. Han said there appears to be widespread misunderstanding of the term "internationalization," which is becoming so popular these days. The belief that internationalization is needed only to strengthen the country's economic competitiveness is not only one-dimensional but also extremely myopic, he said. In addition to short-term and practical purposes, the term internationalization must be understood to mean Koreans' efforts to establish a definite position in the world and pursue spiritual and material well-being, Han said. On North Korea and the unification problem, Han said, "we have to realize that if North Korea managed to gain some benefit from its negotiations on the nuclear issue, it would also be a plus for us." "We have to adopt this kind of idea as a premise for our inter-Korean and unification diplomacy," he said. The overriding consideration in South Korea's efforts to help resolve the North Korean nuclear issue has to be prevention of the worst possible scenario, Han said, adding that South Korea must adopt "a firm, yet flexible" attitude. Han mentioned globalism, diversification, multi-dimensionalism, regional cooperation and future-orientation as the five fundamentals for the nation's "new diplomacy." "All these problems will become our problems in the near future," Han said. "That is why we have to take a comprehensive attitude toward them all."
