A young man of the Pierre Bezukhov type emerged from the car. In an unbuttoned, loose-hanging coat. "They are with me," he told the guard, and the turnstile turned three times, letting us into one of the most secret institutes. We walked past a winter garden, where mock-up space craft were scattered amidst the palm trees, past doors with combination locks and the nameplates of scientists known throughout the world. But the topic we were going to write about was not space research. Under this cosmic roof--uncrowded--lives Ispolin. It is time to introduce its creator--Oleg Albertovich Samoylov. Life Itself Turned Us Toward Production and High Technology [Samoylov] I was born in 1964 in Sverdlovsk--nowadays called Yekaterinburg. I was a young child when my parents took me to the then closed city of Krasnoyarsk-45, where enriched uranium was produced. My father worked there. Several years later we moved to Naberezhnyye Chelny. So I spent my youth at the KamAZ [Kama Auto Works]. I did my army service in Mongolia and returned to the plant. I worked in the Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League] committee, trade union committee, and studied at the Imeni Plekhanova Institute of National Economy, specializing in finance and credit. When perestroyka began, I worked for a while in a cooperative producing construction materials, and in 1989 I opened my own company--Intercom. A spare parts supplier. At approximately the same time my current partners and colleagues Vladimir Rybakov and Aleksey Potapkin started their own business in Moscow. Their company, P&R (Potapkin and Rybakov), sold spare parts for trucks. We combined our efforts and capital; the result was the Avtokomplekt company. I and four other guys who worked with me in Naberezhnyye Chelny became Muscovites. [Question] Just like that? Only recently one could only get transferred to Moscow, as they used to say, in keeping with a decision of directive organs. This required lots of paperwork. [Samoylov] "Different times--different songs..." In the fall of 1991 one could already buy both an apartment and a residence permit, which is what we did. We opened a number of other enterprises in addition to Avtokomplekt, and gradually arrived at the idea of a holding company. In the summer of last year Ispolin was registered as a Russian industrial-financial concern. [Question] It appears that the word "Russian" in the company name is not accidental. [Samoylov] Of course. We are patriotically-minded people. There is a German Bank, French Bank. Why should there not be a Russian Concern? Today Ispolin has 22 companies under its umbrella and 37 representations in Russia, the CIS, and foreign countries. [Question] Oleg Albertovich, do you count yourself among what is called the new Russians? [Samoylov] First of all, simply Russians. As to new, actually we are the second wave. The first wave are those who started with some foundation. Someone transferred a state enterprise in his name in time, or buildings, or received free credit. We, on the other hand, started from scratch, with bare enthusiasm and enterprise. It took time to get on our feet. We worked in very difficult conditions, risking everything. And only now are we beginning to get ahead. I am convinced that the future belongs to the second wave. They are people who came in too late to grab profitable and sweet positions in trade and the financial sphere. But on the other hand, this is good. Life itself turned us toward production and high technology. Some people are just beginning to contemplate it, while we are already working with it. [Question] Where did you start in production? [Samoylov] We worked with the Yakutalmaz Association, supplying them--and continue to supply them--with spare parts, and working with them in a broad range of areas. In turn, we were asked to evaluate a number of designs. Among them was a very promising one--a special additive that replaces lubricant oil. [Question] RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA reported on this invention. [Samoylov] Yes, I read it. They are continuing the experiments in Yakutia. The results are generally good, but there are still a number of unresolved problems. Gradually we established contacts with a number of institutes; they got to know us; serious proposals started coming in. You are well aware that in many technologies we are ahead of the West. But the authors of this development work--scientific research institutes and design bureaus--subsist in poverty; they do not have enough money to pay for heating and communications, let alone salaries. Ispolin AO [joint-stock company] experts carefully evaluate proposed designs. Some of them have already gone through production testing and been put into commercial production. I will mention, for instance, laser grinding of ball-bearings, air conditioners that operate without freon--practically all African countries have placed orders for them. In Tarusa we backed the production of synthetic emeralds and rubies that are used primarily in microelectronics. [Question] What if after this interview is published you get flooded with proposals from RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA readers? [Samoylov] They will be most welcome. [Question] What type of development work are you interested in? [Samoylov] A rather broad spectrum. But it has to be innovative, breakthrough technology. The air conditioners I mentioned are far superior to any foreign analogues. They are built by a domestically developed technology that was used in the defense industry. These air conditioners also will be installed on KamAZ trucks intended for tropical countries. We put a system of filters in it, and you can fill them with any water, even from a puddle. [Question] The second part of this question. As a rule, after such materials are published, the editors are contacted by directors of enterprises that have unused capacities, most often undergoing conversion. Are you interested in such contacts? [Samoylov] Without question! Why build a new plant if the capacity already exists, as well as skilled cadres. Just take it and set up production. Here is another design that was brought to me: an automatic nail-making machine. You put wire into it, punch in the program, and that is all! There are good heads in the country, but it hurts when foreigners buy up our talents for peanuts. They give you two or three trips a year and some pocket money. For our people this is crazy money, but the result is that developments and technologies stay abroad for nothing. I Took Gaydar's Resignation in Stride. I Liked Ryzhkov's Program More, For All the Criticism Heaped on It [Question] You invest money in production, applications of high technology. But many of your colleagues still see only trading and middleman activities as the source of quick and reliable income. [Samoylov] To the best of my knowledge they are afraid to invest money in long-term projects because of political instability. Nevertheless, I think that production should now be the foundation of Russian business. Politicians come and go, but industry remains. I hope that those in the Kremlin and the government will understand this and stop strangling producers with taxes. I have to confess that I took Gaydar's resignation in stride. I see his strong points. But as a person involved in concrete entrepreneurial activities, I believe that for a head of government it is not enough to know theory, thorough as that knowledge may be. [Question] This is the opinion of an entrepreneur. What is dear to you as a citizen and a person? [Samoylov] I have already partially answered this question. I am against the kind of society that is ascending on our country, that we are trying to copy from the United States. It is a society oriented toward money, profit; an extremely cruel world. I am for the spirituality that has always existed in Russia. I am a patriotically-minded person, although there are attempts now to slander and distort this notion. Let the jeers against patriotism remain on the conscience of people without kith or kin. Look at how America worships its flag, how an Englishman, German, or Frenchman loves his country. Why are Russians being deprived of this right? There is no shame in being a son of the fatherland, which is the literal translation of the word "patriot" from French. On the contrary, one should be proud of it. No, I do not accept everything new. I disagree with many things that are being done now. My credo is that we have to work hard. Very hard. So that Russia may prosper and ourselves along with it. Because prosperity of the state is tied directly with our prosperity. I am not a cosmopolitan. I do not reject everything of the past just because it is declared old. Conscience does not grow old. Neither does truth, loyalty, and duty. I cannot agree with those who dismiss the entire history of my country, even the post-October one. Does it mean we have to start on a blank page again? Does it mean I have to also dismiss the life of my father, Albert Vasilyevich? But I saw for myself how hard he worked, earned three higher degrees. Everything that is best in me is from him. Now the country has jumped into another extreme. I, on the other hand, am for forward motion. And in general I am an adherent of the plan Nikolay Ivanovich Ryzhkov was fighting to implement. I am a supporter of his programs, his actions, although they have been discredited to a large extent. Ryzhkov's program is much closer to my liking than Gaydar's program. Because the entire world has arrived at a regulated market instead of the bazaar we are being saddled with. A country must choose its priorities during difficult times. On the other hand, one day we want to replace the roof over Luzhniki, the next day we begin to build an underground city under Manezh Square. As if there are no other concerns left, as if everything has been put right in Moscow, everybody lives well--there is enough housing for everyone, for instance. What is the foundation of a society? The economy. Science. Culture, education, art. In the economy we are getting an alternating cold-and-hot water shower. Science and culture have been neglected altogether. One gets the impression that the next step is to leave the country without culture. A young actor gets paid 20,000 rubles [R]; how he survives is a mystery! The greatest actors are paid R80,000. This is simply cruel. Russian Benefactors Are a Thread From the Past to the Future [Question] But what can you do? [Samoylov] Entrepreneurs can do a lot. Have you heard about icon painting on birch bark? I would not be surprised if you have not--this ancient type of art has all but disappeared thanks to the many years of "loving care" extended to the church and master icon painters. Until recently only three icons on birch bark have been known to exist, all of them in private collections. Now there are about 15 such icons in Russia: the secrets of the old masters have been found and are being revitalized, and the Ispolin Concern is financing this work. Or take Khokhloma wood-painting. It is familiar to practically every citizen of Russia, but how many people know that entry into the free market did not work well for Khokhloma craftsmen? Learning of the problems this craft was experiencing, we decided to help the artists and organized our own studio. The result: a collection created in this studio has been invited to a Sotheby auction in England. [Question] Well, since it has got to the point of Sotheby, this means that you will come out a winner, too. [Samoylov] Excuse me, but I have not finished. Fortunately, not everything in this world is measured by the "profit or loss" formula. I, for instance, care a lot about the theater. This truly is an inalienable part of my life. I could not possibly live in any other country--if for no other reason than because, in my opinion, Russia is the only country where the theater as the highest achievement of human civilization is not yet dead. Of course, in this there is no notion of "profit or loss"--if I can help, I do. We finance the "Modern" theater, and have established awards for young actors. In the past I dreamt of becoming a theatrical director. Friends sometimes joke: All right, since you did not get to be a theatrical director, you became a concern president--same thing, your directorial talent still comes through. Speaking seriously, I am indeed tied to the theater in an official way now: I have been elected vice president of the Moscow Charitable Actors Fund, where I came with my program "Young Benefactors for Young Actors." [Question] There is a book "Russian Benefactors" on your desk. Is this the example you are trying to emulate? [Samoylov] If you wish. There is a man I would like to emulate spiritually--Savva Morozov. Unfortunately, little is known about him in Russia, mainly at the level of school textbooks. He was a great man. Many people know that he built the Moscow Art Theater, that he helped actors. But practically nobody knows that he helped science, established scholarships in St. Petersburg University. That he applied the latest inventions in the theater and was himself an inventor. Only Very Rich People Can Afford Two Days Off a Week [Samoylov] I understand that to come close to the image of this man, one has to work very hard. [Question] Very hard--how hard is that? Today is Saturday, but your colleagues are at work. [Samoylov] Good observation--for us Saturday is a regular work day. Once a director of a South Korean firm--our partner--remarked with certain sarcasm that Russians must be very rich people if they can afford two days off a week. We had to explain to him that workers in our concern, for instance, make do with only one day off. Generally speaking, we work as much as is needed. The state has shrugged off science and culture. All right, but at least allow entrepreneurs to take over. Provide incentives, as in the United States. They have zillions of different foundations. If you use some of your money for charitable activities, the same amount is exempt from taxation. If a farmer invests more than 40 percent of his income in new technologies, he is exempt from taxes altogether. This is a policy. We, on the other hand... I understand, they are fighting for those cozy jobs and have no time to think of other things. So they measure everyone with the same yardstick and issue a regulation. It does not matter what you do--trade or production. Because there are too many nonprofessionals in the upper echelons. Maybe they knew how to do something before, in the rallies, but in the new situation they cannot find their bearings. The situation will change when new people rise to the top--those who are 30 to 40 today. [Question] The second wave? [Samoylov] Yes. The richest people are those who are in trade, but they were not the ones who built America. America was built by Ford, Chrysler, General Motors... We are not yet as strong as the first wave, those who have made millions, billions of dollars. But to the extent of our ability we are helping to rebuild Russia. [Question] What do you value in life? [Samoylov] Books. I like reading the classics most. My favorite writers are Dreiser and Dostoyevskiy. Whenever I have free time, I read. I do not spend time at health resorts, do not travel to the Canary Islands for recreation, and do not take vacations in general. I do not have a dacha or a foreign-made car. Of course, we are not poor, but neither are we super-rich. [Question] What things do you not accept? [Samoylov] Meanness and betrayal. [Question] Have you had encounters with them? [Samoylov] Both in life and in business. Generally, I am a gentle, kind man, even sentimental. I have been cheated many times, and many times had to start from scratch. [Question] What are you counting on? [Samoylov] The common sense of the people. [Question] We wish you success.
