As a reason for such a decision, the Mozambican head of state said that the Mozambique National Resistance's [Renamo] troop demobilization process had not been balanced. He also noted the need for making technical corrections to the figures and lists that Renamo has been supplying to the UN Operations in Mozambique Technical Unit. NOTICIAS reports that President Joaquim Chissano made that announcement after visiting the troop assembly area in Ulongwe, the capital of Tete Province's Angonia District. NOTICIAS also reports that the Mozambican head of state warned the soldiers of the need for them to remain in the area for a while longer. He explained that it is an area that continues to deserve special attention. NOTICIAS says President Chissano was indirectly referring to the fact that Renamo soldiers continue to be powerfully armed and terrorizing the civilian population in many parts of Tete Province. The president of the Republic traveled 260 km on the road between the city of Tete, the provincial capital, and Angonia District. He passed many areas where Renamo continues to prevent the Mozambican Government from implementing the National Reconstruction Program and other political organizations from doing their political work. NOTICIAS also reports today that a South African citizen was distributing photographs of Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama in one of the areas visited by the Mozambican head on his way to Angonia District. That South African citizen had not been allowed to come into the country from Malawi, but was subsequently seen in Mozambican territory.
