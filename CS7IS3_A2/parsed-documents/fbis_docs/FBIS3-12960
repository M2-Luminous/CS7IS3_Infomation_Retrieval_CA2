A statement issued by the "Iraqi National Accord" Organization said that the masses in Baghdad, al-Basrah, al-'Amarah, and al-Nasiriyah staged a furious "uprising" [intifadah] last Thursday. The statement, issued in Salah-al-Din in northern Iraq, said that the "uprising" began in the areas of al-Thawrah, al-Hurriyah, and al-Shu'lah and then extended to al-Taji, al-Dulu'iyah, Samarra', al-Dujayl, and al-Dawr. The masses managed to control the Baghdad-al-Mawsil road. The statement, a copy of which was received by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in London, added that some areas in the governorates of al-Basrah, al-Nasiriyah, and al-'Amarah later joined the "uprising" and that the protesters were in control of several areas between Baghdad and Samarra' and fought fierce battles against the Tammuz Division which consists of emergency forces and Republican Guards -- the forces deployed by the government in Baghdad since last Wednesday. Another statement issued by the Organization of "the Mujahidin of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq" said that the Baghdad government "has completed preparations for a new attack on the marshes areas in the governorates of al-Basrah and Maysan." The statement added that these preparations followed heavy artillery bombardment of various areas, using napalm and incendiary bombs to destroy the plantations which acted as barriers. It also said that last Wednesday a large armored force joined the commando units of the 14th Division in some areas in Maysan. Government forces had set fire to some areas in al-Hayadir in al-Basrah Governorate on 27 February, and the 1st and 2d battalions of the 47th Brigade moved toward al-Saddah-712 in al-Hayadir area on 3 March. Fires were seen raging in the sugarcane fields adjacent to the main road.
