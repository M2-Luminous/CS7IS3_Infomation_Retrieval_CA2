[CEA Inc.] will seek a listing on the U.S. stock market, hoping to raise nearly 1 billion dollars. This move has attracted much attention. Today, this reporter interviewed CEA Inc. Vice President Xiao Liyuan, who is in charge of the reform oriented to the joint-stock system. He spoke about listing preparations and the company's profile. An Appraisal of Property and Funds Has Been Completed Xiao Liyuan said: China Eastern Airlines [CEA] is a core enterprise of CEA Inc., the latter being one of the 55 large enterprise groups approved by the State Council. At the moment, a reform is going on toward a joint-stock system, focusing on the company's air transport services, and preparations are being made to seek an overseas listing. The company has completed its internal appraisal of property and funds and has contacted intermediary organizations abroad, one of which will be designated before the end of this month, and the asset appraisal required for the listing can be carried out immediately. Xiao Liyuan said that the preparations for the listing can be expected to complete within six months. Total Assets of 11.5 Billion Yuan Xiao Liyuan said: CEA now has 69 passenger and cargo aircraft of world standard and the models include MD-11, MD-11F, A300-600R, A310-300, MD-82, and FK-100, most of which are on charter. It has opened over 100 air routes connecting such countries as the United States, Japan, Bahrain, Belgium, Spain, the ROK, Thailand, and Singapore; the Hong Kong region; and over 50 cities within China. The total assets of the company amount to 11.5 billion yuan. In 1993, the company had over 7,000 employees. At the moment, the CEA's Shanghai line has nearly 400 pilots, mostly graduates of the Civil Aviation Flying School with subsequent training abroad. Each year, they go to Europe or the United States for retraining in flight simulators to keep up their professionalism. The total transportation turnover is 850 million tonne-km; 5.5 million passengers have been handled; the cargo and postal volume amounts to 140,000 tonne; the average annual utilization ratio of the seating capacity is over 70 percent; the income from mainline operations is 3.467 billion yuan; foreign exchange earnings are $374.88 million; and all its economic indexes measure up to the tradewide advanced levels within China. In the first half of last year, CEA Inc. came first on the Civil Aviation Administration of China's profit chart for all aviation companies in the country. Focusing on Developing International Business Speaking on the distribution of air routes, Xiao Liyuan said that before the European and American routes were opened, the CEA focused on short-distance international and regional routes. But now, the company has completed its conversion into an international aviation company. In 1993, the income from international flights accounted for 65 percent of the company's total turnover, the corresponding figure in 1992 being 60 percent. In the future, CEA will continue to expand its operations on international routes and strive to be an enterprise with a relatively high degree of competitiveness among international airlines and measures up to world advanced levels. Xiao Liyuan said: Despite the fact that international aviation is in recession and the demand on China's domestic air market remains brisk, CEA is continuing to expand its international operations. Some other airlines in the world have found this hard to understand. Xiao Liyuan explained that first, the international routes that CEA covers are profitable and are in the ascendant. Second, as China's opening up to the outside world is continually expanding, the growth in international exchanges is bound to increase business volume. Moreover, Shanghai's strategic goal beyond this century is to become an international financial, trade, and economic center, which also requires a matching international aviation company and CEA is duty bound to contribute to it. In the meantime, CEA's measures on its domestic routes will focus on redistributing its transportation capacity, concentrating on the profitable ones rather than reducing the scope. Facing the highly competitive international air transport market, Xiao Liyuan believes that the most competitive asset CEA has is its low operation cost. This is especially true with the cost of employees, which is merely one-tenth of that of some foreign airlines. The major cost outlays are for fuel and aircraft maintenance. Xiao Liyuan said that because the average service age of the CEA's fleet is under seven years, heavy repairs are not yet necessary. CEA is now able to carry out overhauls on the MD82 independently. To improve the company's aircraft maintenance capabilities, it is planning to build a new hangar, which will be the biggest in the Far East, and gradually enable itself to conduct independent D [in Roman script]-tests on all large aircraft. Combining Exchange Rates Has No Major Impact Xiao Liyuan said: The funds CEA Inc. wants to raise by listing its shares on the U.S. stock market will mainly be used to: Buy new passenger jumbo jets suited to intercontinental flight; repay the interest for aircraft chartering and other liabilities; improve the company's aircraft servicing capabilities; and update its servicing equipment. Xiao Liyuan said: Two A300's will be delivered in 1994 and two more will be purchased in 1995. Besides, there is also a tentative plan to buy a certain number of A340's. Xiao believed that because the CEA has been successful in earning foreign exchange and adjusted the fares after the exchange rates were combined, the reform of the exchange rate system has not had much impact on it. However, he also said that the ongoing tax reform has set the income tax rate for all enterprises at a flat 3 percent, though the CEA's income tax rate used to be 18 percent. The company is still trying to keep the old rate.
