So I would like all Commonwealth states to look to the future with optimism. Why? Because the people who belong to the former Soviet Union have experienced many hardships. I should very much like 1994 to be, for all the peoples, a year of insight, the year of the realization that only unity, only the preservation of the friendship that did nevertheless, exist in the former Soviet Union between the peoples, and [the preservation] of the wisdom that has always existed in our peoples -- that is what will lead to prosperity. Be that as it may, life moves on. Whatever happens, we are doing everything to improve people's lives in the future. So I urge wisdom, prudence, calm, respect by every person for the person next to him, respect by people for one another, and respect by states for one another. Today ultimata have to be removed from the vocabulary. Today one must speak with the language of understanding, the language of cooperation, and the language of mutually beneficial trade. I wish everyone happiness and health. I hope that in every family there is prosperity, and that 1994 brings every family at least some small joy.
