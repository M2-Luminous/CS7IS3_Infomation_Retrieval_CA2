Yet immediately after Russian Special Representative V. Churkin's return to Moscow, Washington and the UN mediators achieved certain results at the Bosnian Serbs' headquarters in Pale. R. Karadzic agreed to put heavy weapons around Sarajevo under the control of international observers, and to release detained servicemen from the peacekeeping contingent. Western news agencies are delightedly informing the world that "the agreements in Pale were achieved as a result of efforts by the international community, first and foremost the United States." Have we not left the Bosnian "operating table" too soon? True, you have to recognize that the Serbian "patient" has behaved in a fairly violent manner. Just last week the Bosnian Serbs agreed to deal only with Russia and made generous promises to V. Churkin and A. Kozyrev that they would calm down in Gorazde, but.... As local observers report, information on their actions is very contradictory and their behavior very unpredictable. Whom will Moscow believe now, which side will it take? Hopefully, only our own. You could spend a long time pondering why the Serbs set us up and who benefited from all this and why. At the moment one thing is clear -- by getting out of the Balkans Russia will definitely lose. The Kremlin understands this. B. Yeltsin has proposed calling a summit meeting on the situation in former Yugoslavia. One more thing. It would be naive to believe the claims that our diplomats have weak nerves. Even at a personal level. We should not forget that V. Churkin himself received a wonderful education as a young interpreter participating in negotiations on global international problems. It was our star diplomats who conducted these negotiations, people who avoid slamming doors and have the patience to seek compromises and take adjournments at the right time in order to finally achieve concrete results. Adjournments which, perhaps, it behooves a great country to make in its relations with impatient or inessential partners.
