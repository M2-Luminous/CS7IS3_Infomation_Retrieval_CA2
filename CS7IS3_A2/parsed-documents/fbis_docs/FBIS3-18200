Sinn Fein cannot complain that the declaration has not been clarified. It has been explained time and time again by political leaders in Ireland and Britain. Today, in the Irish News, British Prime Minister John Major makes an impassioned plea to Sinn Fein to accept the declaration as the basis for a settlement of the problems facing this country. It is one of the most significant contributions to the debate since the declaration was unveiled in London in December. Mr Major is not alone in hoping the Sinn Fein ard fhets [as published] will take a permanent and courageous step towards democracy. The declaration has gained the support of the overwhelming majority of people in Ireland and in Britain; and it is seen as the basis for peace with honour in other countries sympathetic to the Irish cause. The thrust of the party's policies over the past decade makes the final step to full democracy inevitable, its leaders realise that; now its members must accept that their party can only play a full and vital role in Ireland when their policy direction reaches its logical conclusion. One of the most important paragraphs in Mr Major's article is addressed directly to Sinn Fein. He says: "Sinn Fein claims not to understand the place of the declaration in the `peace process'. There is nothing obscure about this... The declaration is not a peace plan, it certainly isn't a solution on its own. It is simply the view of the two governments about the principles involved in a process leading to an agreed outcome. Those central principles are democracy, and an absence of coercion -- in other words consent, no outside interference and an end to violence." The message to Sinn Fein is clear. No agreed outcome has been pre-ordained by either government; and, if it rejects violence, it will be able to play a full and unfettered part in the debate which leads to that agreed outcome. Today's article by Mr Major is couched in the language of friendship and reconciliation. And he does not shy away from some of the key concerns of the Sinn Fein leadership. He is blunt on the issue of what he means by exploratory talks. In his January 8 interview with the IRISH NEWS Mr Adams asked for clarification on what the exploratory talks would involve. He asked if it meant more than just a discussion with Sinn Fein about how the IRA could hand over its weapons. Mr Major says clearly today that these talks would be meaningful. "We would be ready within three months of an end to violence to begin an exploratory dialogue with Sinn Fein. Its aims would be to discuss how Sinn Fein would become involved in the three-stranded political talks, how they could be brought fully into normal political life in Northern Ireland, and what the consequences of ending violence would be... I believe this amounts to a substantial exploratory agenda. Those exploratory discussions would themselves be part of the process of bringing Sinn Fein back into normal political life, in developing a normal political dialogue between the government and other parties, on matters like education, housing, health care, crime and fair employment." That is a clear and positive statement which should encourage Sinn Fein to become involved, Mr Major is not just offering talks on a narrow agenda. Mr Major has also been unambiguous about the meaning of self-determination, as he sees it. He re-emphasises his government's position that it has no "selfish, strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland", and he goes on to say: "we would have no wish to frustrate the democratically expressed wishes of the people." The primary policy objective of the British government, he says, is "to see peace, stability and reconciliation established by agreement among all the people who inhabit the island." Britain wants to encourage agreement -- agreement which would include an input from Sinn Fein if it enters the democratic process fully. And he pledges to introduce any legislation necessary to give effect to that agreement which "the people who live in Ireland may themselves freely so determine without external impediment." No Sinn Fein president could disagree with his comment "it is not the government's job to tell the Irish people what they should think or to dictate to them where their future should lie." Rightly, Mr Major has said that the political talks -- on the three-strand basis which protects Irish interests -- must continue. The opportunity for Sinn Fein must continue. The opportunity for Sinn Fein to become involved is there. And he takes up the theme of partnership both within Ireland and between the British and the Irish. This aspect is critical if we are to copper-fasten any agreement with economic regeneration; and is particularly important in the context of the two nations' membership of the European Union. Calling for an end to violence, Mr Major spells out the consequences: "we shall in time be able to manage without British soldiers in support of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] and without emergency legislation"; greater protection of civil rights; new institutions "reflecting the common interests in the island"; and closer partnership. He does not try to limit or dictate the scope of agreement. "Whatever may be the shape of final agreement in the talks, it will not be imposed on anyone. It will be the people who will have decided." His acknowledgement that "dreadful deeds have been done by all" is generous, as is his regret. His plea that "our generation must look to the future" is one which should be the motivating force for all those capable of advancing the cause of peace in Ireland.
