The march, which was staged along the camp's main roads, was led by 'Isam al-Qadi, member of the National Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and secretary general of the Organization of the Vanguards of the Popular Liberation War-al-Sa'iqah Forces; members of the Regional Command of the Palestinian Organization of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party; the secretary of Fatah-the Uprising; and the secretary generals of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Palestinian Revolutionary Communist Party, the Islamic Jihad Movement, the Palestine Liberation Movement, and the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front. The march was also led by the secretaries and members of the branches of al-Yarmuk, Palestine, and the Palestinian Liberation Front of the Ba'th Party; the representative of the Hamas Movement; the representative of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine; and representatives of the National Progressives Front parties in Syria. Palestinian flags, slogans condemning the ugly crime perpetrated by the Zionist settlers in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, and black banners were raised in the march. The marchers set Israeli flags on fire, cheered on the popular intifadah in the occupied territories, and called for revenge for the blood of the righteous martyrs. Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Movement, addressed the gathering in the main square of the al-Yarmuk Camp on behalf of the national Palestinian alliance forces in Syria. He reviewed the massacres perpetrated by Israel against our Palestinian people in Dayr Yasin, Qibya, Kafr Qasim, Nahhalin, 'Ayun Kara, al-Aqsa, and the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. He said: We will neither surrender nor bargain. The banners of our struggle will remain high, and the sacred blood that was shed on the holy day in the holy place from the bodies of hundreds of the sons of brave Hebron and throughout the homeland will water the trees of the intifadah, freedom, and victory. Dr. al-Shaqaqi said: This crime is a continuation of the liquidation plot embodied in the Gaza-Jericho accord and the subsequent accords that are aimed to disarm our people so that they will remain defenseless in front of the Israeli Army and settlers. Concluding his speech, Dr. al-Shaqaqi stressed the need for achieving effective national unity to confront Israeli challenges.
