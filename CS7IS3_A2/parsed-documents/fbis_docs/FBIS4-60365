The foreign minister made these remarks in an conversation with our Washington correspondent Arye Golan at the outset of his U.S. visit. [Begin recording] [Golan] Mr. Foreign Minister, what is your comment on the latest disclosure of the tape in which 'Arafat says in Johannesburg that the agreement is temporary, that it is like the agreement between Muhammad and the Quiraish tribe? [Peres] First of all, I am not certain that 'Arafat and Muhammad resemble one another. They have a different explanation, you know. I am not their attorney. I asked 'Arafat about this, and he explained that the Quiraish tribe was the one that violated the agreement, in retaliation to which Muhammad violated the agreement with Quiraish. That was his explanation. I have no doubt, however, that he was drawn into a harmful speech. [Golan] Is he still a partner for peace negotiations, after all we have heard about his remarks in Johannesburg, including the latest disclosure? [Peres] Look, negotiations are waged by nations, not persons -- by the Palestinians and us. He heads the Palestinians for better and for worse. [Golan] Do you still believe him? [Peres] I believe in peace. [Golan] Are you saying that what he told you in Oslo is sufficient, that he does not have to sign any new commitments? [Peres] No, I am not a notary who writes affidavits. It is not my job. [Golan] What is going to happen now? What will happen to the government if this man continues making such pronouncements? [Peres] Again, I do not want to be anyone's advocate, but we should differentiate between people's pronouncements and their deeds. In this century, he was the first Palestinian leader who decided to engage in negotiations on the basis of compromise. This is the other side of the story. What good was it that the mufti, who headed the Palestinians for 43 years, kept saying no, no, no? What good was it that for 20-odd years the same 'Arafat kept saying no and dealt in terrorism? [Golan] Now he is saying yes and no alternately. [Peres] No, he is doing yes and saying no. I do not want to generalize, but we should remember his deeds, not just his declarations. [Golan] Don't you feel he is pulling wool over our eyes, as they say? [Peres] First of all, no one can pull wool over our eyes, because we are not fools. We have the strength to defend ourselves. We are not sapping our strength or impairing our security one iota. We are making peace because we are strong, not because we are weak. This is not peace made by weaklings, this is not peace made by a pathetic nation. I feel we are a strong, well-organized country which enjoys enormous international support, a country which has grown. Militarily, we have most of what we need. Therefore, the elements of anxiety, fear, or weakness are not at stake here. [Golan] Are you for pursuing the peace process with him, for granting them self-rule according to the plan? [Peres] I repeat: Not with him, with the Palestinian people. And if a Palestinian authority is established, we will have a much broader body to deal with. Today, however, he is the spokesman and the leader of the Palestinians, and we must remember this for better and for worse. The transition period is difficult. They have a police, they do not have a police; they have money, they do not have money. But the transition period, too, should be viewed in the right light. It is the transition period. [Golan] Thank you very much, Mr. Foreign Minister. [end recording]
