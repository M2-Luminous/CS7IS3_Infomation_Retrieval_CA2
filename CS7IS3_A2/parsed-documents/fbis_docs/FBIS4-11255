This is the first time such a meeting has been held in Brazil. Issues ranging from economy to nuclear disarmament will be discussed. Brazil was chosen to host the fourth ministerial meeting between European and Latin American countries because the Latin American Parliament, Parlatino, is headquartered here. Army policemen supported by military policemen are handling security because the Federal Police are on strike. The 25 foreign ministers, all of them interested in finding common solutions to comparable problems being faced by their countries, are meeting at the Parlatino building. The main topics to be discussed during this meeting -- which will end tomorrow -- are democracy, disarmament, non-proliferation of atomic weapons and, naturally, economic growth. Minister Celso Amorim has said that the Common Market of the South, Mercosur -- which is as yet only partially operational -- has already succeeded in quadrupling trade among South American countries. Amorim thinks this fact proves that through understanding and mutual assistance, sustained and continuous development can be achieved in any country. [Begin Amorim recording] Mercosur is an integration model that seeks to follow the example of the EU. We have a great deal to learn from them. This is an important issue that will be discussed here.
