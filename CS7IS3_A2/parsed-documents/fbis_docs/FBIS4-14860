New Lubyanka Boss Gives KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA His First Interview"] [Text] [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Sergey Vadimovich, whenever the special services were mentioned in the past, people would first recall the spies which our agents had caught. Now the concept of "economic security" has entered the vocabulary. To what extent is this area a priority for the Foreign Counterintelligence Service [FCS]? [Stepashin] Well, first, we have been catching spies and we will continue to do so -- we are tasked with that function by the statute on our service published 30 March in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. Incidentally, I wrote to Sergey Aleksandrovich Filatov, the leader of the Presidential Administration, asking him to remove the "for official use" classification from the document and have it published in the press. People should know what we do. We tackled economic security issues in the past as well, but this applied more to security measures at defense enterprises, nuclear power stations, and other strategic installations. All that remains, but, at the same time, new areas have emerged. In general, many departments should safeguard economic security, as should the "producers" themselves -- the banks, say. We are looking at our participation in this from the standpoint of combating corruption in financial, lending, and banking structures, other state and commercial organizations, and various investment funds. Moreover, we are helping the Central Bank of Russia to carry out credit and other operations, and major enterprises to conclude contracts with foreign firms. Economic security issues account for two of the FCS' five basic directorates. To be blunt, it is quite an important force. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Doesn't it strike you that the threat to our economy today comes not so much from abroad as from inside the country -- a proposition which was raised quite recently? [Stepashin] Indeed, in the past the economic security issue was interpreted one-sidedly -- that is, it was linked solely to external factors. I am thinking of the restrictive policy of the industrially developed states and the IMF, which placed bans on lending to the USSR, on the supply of goods and advanced technology, and so forth. Domestic factors helping to undermine the economy were not profoundly studied or were often simply hushed up. But their destructive effect on all spheres of the national economy has been far greater in scale and longer-term. Society has suffered immense damage, for instance, from the denial on ideological grounds of the existence of a corruption problem in the top echelons of party and state power, or of the presence in the country of a ramified black market system. Today the impact of internal "time bombs" undermining the economy has not only not been halted but is actually growing stronger. Just take the problem of economic ties. In my view, this is now the main destabilizing factor. Needless to say, the main role in preventing these threats is played by the top organs of state power -- the government and its structures -- since they are the people who shape economic policy and define the mechanism for its implementation. As for FCS subunits, we see our task -- along with those already mentioned -- as being to ensure that top state administrative organs have accurate and timely information on negative trends in basic sectors and spheres of the national economy and on emergencies, and to provide forecasts of the possible consequences. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Does this mean that the FCS is now mainly just a forecasting and analysis body? [Stepashin] No, of course not. Counterintelligence operatives are above all men of action. And if the discussion of our work to safeguard Russia's economic security were to continue, I could mention a lot of specific cases. Because of space constraints in your newspaper I will quote just a few of the most typical. In the course of the joint "Trawl" operation with organs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD], the Customs, and the Prosecutor's Office, our territorial subunits managed to uncover around 270 criminal structures specializing in the illegal export of strategic raw materials and licensed products. In total over the past year we have put a stop to more than 1,200 such illegal acts, giving rise to almost 300 criminal cases. The illegal export from the Russian Federation of more than 636,000 tonnes of oil and oil products, 100,000-odd tonnes of metals -- including 44,000 tonnes of nonferrous and rare-earth metals -- as well as timber, lumber, and other products worth around 150 billion rubles [R] in total has been prevented. Federal security organs conducted the "Barrier" operation at 16 airports around the country and put a stop to the illegal export from Russia by air of more than 400 kg of electronic components containing gold, around 30 kg of gold and silver bars, as well as 237 cutting tools with diamonds of up to two carats worth R58 million. As a result of the measures taken on the basis of information supplied by FCS organs more than 400 major disasters and the preconditions for them were successfully prevented in 1993 -- including 54 at nuclear power generating installations. Incidentally, a great many examples could be quoted of Russian slackness, waste, and blatant stealing from the country. And work in this area is terra incognita for our counterintelligence agents. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Does this mean that we are harming ourselves and that the West is just helping us? [Stepashin] Things are not that simple. Foreign firms, exploiting the situation in our country, are striving to expand scientific and technical links with Russia to their own advantage. They are trying to organize an intensive outflow of Russian scientific ideas, high technology, and advanced arms and military equipment systems. In the United States, France, Germany, Brazil, Israel, China, and South Korea these actions are supported at state level. We know that the range of theoretical and practical scientific results in Russia that are of interest to foreigners extends to space and aviation equipment, biotechnology, new materials, nuclear physics, laser equipment, metallurgy, and high-tech and defense sectors of industry. Information reaching the Russian FCS on this problem shows that in the very near future our country could lose its leading position in the development of basic and applied research, be deprived of many scientific schools and highly qualified cadres, and suffer considerable and essentially irreparable material damage. Calculations done by specialists from the Russian Federation Ministry of Science and Technology Policy using UN methods show that the country loses around $300,000 for every specialist that goes abroad. Russia could suffer potential damage of around $20 billion annually through emigration. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Sergey Vadimovich, could you describe the work of the Western special services to safeguard their countries' economic security? [Stepashin] The United States devotes a great deal of attention to strengthening the activity of counterintelligence organs in preserving and strengthening America's leading position militarily and economically. In the Americans' opinion, the strategic threats to U.S. interests persist under present-day conditions. In this connection intelligence community experts are pointing out that Russia and the other CIS countries are still the priority targets for the special services. Moreover, insofar as we are aware, the intelligence community is fully tasked with the function of economic counterespionage -- and the special services are being told to be "more aggressive" when conducting counterintelligence operations. According to the available information, the special services of the East European countries are also becoming an important tool in implementing their leaderships' "eastern" policy. Their priority effort is concentrated on infiltrating leading structures in the CIS states in order to obtain not only economic but military and political information. We know that special organs from the East European states are in close contact with the NATO special services, which give them financial, material, and technical support. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] According to calculations by specialists, several tens of billions of dollars are taken out of Russia every year. Can't this outflow of foreign exchange be sealed off? [Stepashin] Of course it can -- but not only and not so much with the help of the special services. In this area we have to work in conjunction with the tax service, the tax police, the MVD, and the Customs. We plan to set up several such joint groupings under the auspices of the Prosecutor's Office. But this is not enough. Our administrative law and code of criminal procedure have long become obsolete, and we are working under the conditions of the former political and economic system. We have plenty of material, but we cannot act on it. The facts we have to hand are not being used for investigations -- much less for instituting criminal proceedings and court cases. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What about simply legalizing activity that is currently deemed criminal? Maybe then our "dealers" would not send their dollars abroad? [Stepashin] Far too much has been legalized as it is! And money is going abroad because of the unstable political situation. Many people are scared to invest their capital here -- they fear for their future. Moreover, some of the radical opposition is gripped with the idea of the expropriation of the expropriators, and the experience of 1917 is not such ancient history for them. Consequently, it is only when we have a normal political atmosphere that we can talk about stopping the flight of capital. Needless to say, I do not choose people who are indifferent to the interests of our country and its people. These people have always been with us, are with us, and always will be -- and if they commit crimes they need to be combated, using special service methods if necessary. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] We talk so much about corruption! You get the feeling that we are on top of it, when the opposite is true.... [Stepashin] This phenomenon has been brought about primarily by the current position in the economy and by the lack of legislation on the civil service. We are discussing corruption, but from the standpoint of the criminal code the subject of our complaints essentially does not exist. We do not have any clear-cut framework to guide civil servants*at all levels -- up to and including government members -- about what they are forbidden to do and what they are responsible for. That is why people are lobbying for the most fantastic agreements. Exploiting their important position, certain officials are making approaches to foreign firms, selling them our enterprises' products at considerably reduced prices, and taking bribes in return. The most interesting point is that most corrupt people do not think of themselves as such -- they claim to be just entrepreneurs. We are currently investigating the "Neftalmazinvest" Foundation. High-ranking officials from the State Committee for the Management of State Property are involved in this major affair. There is a very alarming situation with oil. It is currently monopolized by several structures. This strategic raw material is going abroad without any controls. Ukraine has not paid Russia for oil received throughout all of last year and the year before, and it is still receiving oil. Who took how many bribes for that? Why are products with different octane ratings flowing through the same pipeline? In other words, corruption now affects many of the most important spheres -- privatization, the credit and financial sphere, banking, investment and foreign economic activity.... According to available information, the degree to which the economy has been affected by this "bacillus" is quite considerable and is continuing to increase rapidly. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Sergey Vadimovich, be frank -- do you believe your work will be successful (I am thinking of the fight against corruption)? [Stepashin] If everything depended on us alone.... Today you can often hear voices claiming that the FCS should be disbanded -- with one directorate being given to the Finance Ministry, another to the Justice Ministry, and so forth. You get the impression that people either don't know what the Finance and Justice Ministries do, or they are deliberately raising the question of scrapping the FCS. This talk is coming up now that we have started active work, particularly in opposing foreign stations. We now have very serious approaches to a number of economic structures and have once again gone on the attack. Certain newspapers specialize directly in this. There are no prizes for guessing that there are people who find counterintelligence a big problem when it gets "too close" to them and their machinations. And this is not just a question of the foreign "agents of influence" to whom we often refer. Some of our pseudocampaigners for democracy and justice are also attacking the special services. And these actions are deliberate and by no means the fruit of a sick fantasy run riot in the spring. I would like to recall the words of Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin during our recent meeting -- Russia, the state, and the president need a strong special service that can work effectively in all areas. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] But won't the FCS, in actively dealing with economic security, leave other "sections of the front" exposed? [Stepashin] No, that is ruled out. Everyone does his own job. For instance, this year we have already arrested British and German spies, and we caught them "clean" -- in other words, red-handed. The other day we also caught red-handed three staffers from the North Korean Embassy attempting to buy state-of-the-art technology, as well as a BND (FRG intelligence) agent trying to recruit a Russian officer in the Western Group of Forces. Of course, such results raise the morale of counterintelligence officers and enhance their sense of their own worth. Military counterintelligence has become more active. We are recording many recruitment approaches from the German special services to the contingent of Russian troops being withdrawn from Germany. Means have also now been taken to improve the work of our information and analysis subunits. In the last two weeks alone we have sent the president 25 analytical materials on a wide range of security problems -- including "hot" spots, foreign special services' aspirations, and economic issues.... [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Can the reorganization of the special service responsible for the state's security now be said to be complete? [Stepashin] I think so. The fundamental reform has been completed, but we will be constantly improving our structure. [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is the renewed profile of the Lubyanka now? [Stepashin] We have gotten rid of certain militia functions -- put it that way -- which are alien to the special service. We have also lost the Border Guards and our investigative subunits. We have somewhat reduced our central apparatus -- particularly our administrative apparatus -- and changed our organizational and staffing structure. The FCS has become more compact. I should note that these reorganizations did not begin solely as a result of the president's edict -- they were a call of the times. Back in September 1993 we independently started reforming the Security Ministry. The Russian president then received the first note from the Security Ministry Collegium, in which we proposed a number of new approaches. These were subsequently implemented in the 5 January 1994 presidential edict setting up the Russian Federation FCS. We have completely recertificated our staff -- from operatives to the deputy director of the FCS. But we have not carried out any kind of "purge" -- much less one for political motives. Certain workers were dismissed for being professionally unsuited to the job, while some have left for reasons of age and other reasons. I think that what we are left with are the best -- at least from the standpoint of understanding the need to conscientiously serve the fatherland.
