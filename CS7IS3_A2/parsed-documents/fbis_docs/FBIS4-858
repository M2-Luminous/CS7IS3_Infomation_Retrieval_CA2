Today, our colleague Emmanuel Ngendanzi asked the governor of Ngozi, Mr. Joseph Ntakirutimana, who informed him of the situation there. [Begin Ntakirutimana recording] We have welcomed Burundians who fled on many occasions. The first groups came through [word indistinct] commune, [word indistinct]. They numbered about 6,000. We sent them to the Kirundo governor. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Army headquarters which sent us 12 lorries in addition to the UNHCR vehicles which assisted us to transport them to the place. Today, they transported the last 1,000 people to Kirundo. Now there are returnees from Mwumba Commune. Yesterday they numbered some 5,966 people. We also welcome fleeing Rwandans.

[Words indistinct] government employees. There are also Burundian returnees from other communes. For example the returnees from Kiremba Commune did not go to a refugee camp such as in Busiga. They number about 1,000 people who went straight to their homes. In Marangara Commune, about 3,000 people also returned to their homes from Rwanda.
