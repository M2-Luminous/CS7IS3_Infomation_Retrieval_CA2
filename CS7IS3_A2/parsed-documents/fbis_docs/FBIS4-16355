We asked Captain First Rank Valeriy Volodin, chairman of the Black Sea Fleet Officers' Assembly, to comment on what happened. "Servicemen of the Bolgrad Airborne Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces participated in the seizure of the division of mothballed Black Sea Fleet ships in Odessa during the night of 9-10 April. The Ukrainian servicemen were put on alert status and delivered in seven Ural trucks to the Potemkin Steps in Odessa. They infiltrated the unit's territory through the windows of the checkpoint. The attackers arrested 31 people. The commander of Odessa Military District came to the division, read out to the personnel the Ukrainian defense minister's directive disbanding the unit, and put an ultimatum to the servicemen: take an oath of loyalty to Ukraine. Those who refused, so it followed from the directive, would be instructed to leave for military units on the territory of CIS states. Only four officers and 12 warrant officers among the personnel of the 318th Division agreed to this. In all, approximately 200 servicemen in the unit must come to a decision on service." Right after the incident a Russian delegation headed by Yuriy Dubinin, ambassador for special assignments, flew to Kiev. It held talks with Borys Tarasyuk, Ukrainian deputy minister of foreign affairs. It also met with Leonid Kravchuk. The results of the talks were not made public. A meeting of officers of the fleet's chief base and of the garrison's military units was held in Sevastopol yesterday. It adopted a resolution in which the Black Sea Fleet sailors demand an end to provocations by nationalist Ukrainian forces. Bewilderment was expressed at the lack of a reaction to what happened from the presidents of Russia and Ukraine. The officers voiced a total lack of trust in the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and demanded that tough measures be taken, even including criminal proceedings against the officials who organized the provocation.
