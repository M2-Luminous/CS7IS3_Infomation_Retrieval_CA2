We believe that when well-conducted, they are a good--and necessary--tool for measuring public opinion trends and preferences with respect to a given candidate, product, issue, or current event. However, what has been happening with the latest surveys of voting intentions in terms of presidential candidates could undermine the indispensable credibility that pollsters must have in order to perform their task with all due responsibility. Last week, we Colombians learned of two opinion polls concerning the presidential race, polls conducted by the same firm (although one of them had been subcontracted) that yielded very different results. In the poll ordered by precandidate Andres Pastrana, Pastrana led, while the other one, contracted by this daily newspaper, showed Ernesto Samper in the lead. A few days later, the polling experts said that while the results were apparently contradictory, they actually reflected similar trends and that, with respect to most of the figures obtained, the disparity could be explained by the margin of error. Whatever the case, the campaigns of presidential candidates very frequently include polls in which the person ordering them generally fares very well. Inversely, when such polls are not favorable to them, there is an attempt to conceal them, an attitude that could be considered legitimate from a propaganda viewpoint, but one that is not very honest to a public assaulted and confused by this war of disinformation. It is important to dispel any doubt about what some of our fellow citizens generally think of the polls: that they are manipulated in favor of those ordering them. That is why we applaud the decision of the National Election Council (CNE) to require the various polling companies, domestic or foreign, to register with it and abide by certain minimum rules before the media may divulge their work on the political preferences of potential voters. The CNE also prohibits the publication of polls conducted directly by the media without complying with such requirements as total disclosure of the poll, the sources of funding, type and scope of sampling, estimated margin of error, and other factors. We are sure that the CNE's decision to intervene in these matters results from the necessary transparency that polls and surveys must have, particularly when they concern such delicate issues as stating which presidential candidate has the greatest chance of winning that office. We hope that the technical commission that is to be appointed to oversee compliance with the provisions contained in the CNE's resolution will not become a shelter from the citizens' right to be well-informed and that it will begin, as we once tried to do, to filter the questionnaires and content of the polls. As we approach the final stretch of the presidential campaign, it is important to set clear rules of play that must be followed by the different polling firms in order to prevent public opinion from being disoriented by the election preferences of the Colombian people. Polls are unquestionably beginning to be a fundamental part of our political culture, but we must take great care to prevent them--rather than ideas and proposals--from becoming the center of the debate that will occur this year. It is a debate that will enable us to select the man best prepared to govern our country's destiny rather than simply the man found to be most attractive, as if it were merely a beauty contest rather than an election for the highest office in the land.
