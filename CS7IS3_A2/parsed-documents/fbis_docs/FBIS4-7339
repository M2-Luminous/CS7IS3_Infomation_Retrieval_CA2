Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who were soldiers of the Korean People's Army during the Korean war served more than 30 years in prison, after taken prisoners, for the mere reason that they refused to recant their belief. And An Hak-sop is now serving in prison for more than 40 years since he was arrested, charged with being "a spy of North Korea". The Burundi-Korea Friendship Association and the Burundian Group for the Study of the Chuche Idea in a joint protest letter to the South Korean authorities April 19 said the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan and the release of An Hak-sop accord with the humanitarian spirit and the UN principles on human rights and democracy. The Mozambican committee for friendship with the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement April 13 said Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan were living a life worse than death in South Korea without any protection, though they are sick. It strongly urged an immediate return of the old men who want to meet with their dear relatives and friends at home even at this late hour of their life. The South Korean authorities must know clearly that if they refused to return the old men, they would face curses and a stern judgement by the Korean people and the world people, warned the statement.
