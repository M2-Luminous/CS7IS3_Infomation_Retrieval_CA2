TISHRIN says: When Israel goes too far in its insistence on separate deals, it proves that it does not want peace. Neither does it want the region to enjoy stability and tranquility. Israel's proposals of separate deals and settlements have become an indivisible part of its true objective of evading a just and comprehensive peace. It is simply a part of its maneuverings and deception to circumvent the Madrid conference's bases and its objective and true formula. TISHRIN adds: The escalation of confrontations in the occupied Arab territories is a natural result of the Israeli policy based on peddling separate deals. Its weapons in this is the Oslo agreement. After signing this agreement on 13 September 1993, Israel was able to drag the Palestinian side into making further concessions and into relinquishing Palestinian rights. Israel used this agreement as a pretext to continue its terroristic and oppressive measures, and to perpetrate massacres against the sons of our people in the occupied Arab territories. TISHRIN holds Israel responsible for the escalation of acts of violence in the occupied Arab territories. It says: This violence began in a form of terrorism, oppression, repression, and killing at the hands of the Israelis and their brutal and fascist practices against the Palestinian people. These practices have become even more rancorous since the signing of the Oslo agreement. They continued in a form of sporadic massacres, the biggest of which were the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the Jabaliya massacre. TISHRIN adds: All developments indicate that the occupation troops, the settlers, and the Israeli terrorist organizations threaten to perpetrate new massacres in other places in the occupied Arab territories similar to the Hebron massacre. TISHRIN notes that by all standards, Israel's terrorism is the source of tension and disturbances in the occupied territories and the region. Had Israel been really and truly serious about the stability of the situation, it would have responded to the requirements of the just and comprehensive peace, first and foremost showing readiness to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories, recognizing the Madrid formula, and implementing it in letter and spirit, especially since it is based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace. Concluding, TISHRIN says: The comprehensiveness of the solution, a return to the Madrid bases, the end of the Israeli occupation, and the renounciation of separate deals will contribute to achieving a true and just peace. In an article under the headline "Peace and Occupation Cannot Go Together," the newspaper AL-THAWRAH also writes on the situation in the occupied Arab territories. It stresses that the Israeli occupation troops exploited the comprehensive military cordon around the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to launch an arrest campaign that has affected some 500 Palestinians on the pretext that they do not have Israeli work permits. AL-THAWRAH says: It is no secret to anyone that the clamor the Israelis have been creating since the resistance operation in 'Afula, including the imposition of a comprehensive military cordon around the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, is fabricated and aimed at diverting interest from the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which was perpetrated by the Zionist settlers through support from the Israeli occupation forces. This clamor has also come in the wake of the crime Israel has committed by blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church near Beirut, and later the crime which was perpetrated by the occupation soldiers themselves at the Jabaliya camp a week ago. AL-THAWRAH says: The Israelis will be making another grave mistake if they think or imagine--after all that has happened and is happening with acts of resistance and confrontations carried out by the Arabs against the Israeli occupation forces and settlers in the occupied Arab territories--that they can go ahead with the peace process in the Middle East and push it toward its specified objective of establishing a just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestine question while they insist on the continued presence of the occupation troops and settlers in the occupied Arab territories. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: The international community, particularly the Middle East peace cosponsors, especially the United States, which assumes the responsibility of a full partner and an honest broker in the bilateral talks, must tell Israel loudly and clearly that the just and comprehensive solution to the region's crisis for which the Arabs, particularly Syria, are calling for, must guarantee the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces, the departure of the Zionist settlers from all the occupied Arab territories, and the restoration of the Palestinian people's natural rights. Only this solution can bring security and stability to the entire region.
