Swomley gave his impressions of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at a press conference held in Pyongyang. During his visit, he said, he came to know that the Korean people revere and follow the great President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Mr. Kim Chong-il and that Korea has made a very rapid development after the war. He said he witnessed the Korean People's Army helping the farmers in rice transplanting and participating in [word indistinct] construction, not preparations for a war. This was totally different from the propaganda he has heard in the United States, he noted. Korea, he noted, is maintaining independence, attaining self-sufficiency in food and the Korean people are firmly determined, industrious and joyful people. He said the Americans should know that the United States and South Korea built the concrete wall in the area south of the Military Demarcation Line which is not to be compared with the Berlin Wall. He noted that the United States' shipment of armaments into South Korea well shows that it is seeking a war, not talks with the DPRK. Pointing out that the United States most wantonly violating the implementation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is spreading the rumour of "nuclear suspicion" and putting pressure on Korea, while closing its eyes to the nuclear programs and production of Israel, South Korea and other countries, he described this as unreasonable. Saying the aim sought by the United States is to isolate Korea, he called for struggling against it. He contended that the third world countries should make the United States start nuclear disarmament and respond to negotiations to dismantle its nuclear weapons together with other nuclear states. He stressed the DPRK-U.S. negotiation is the only solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.
