On 14 June, crude oil spurt from Bohai Offshore Well Number One, China's first offshore-oil exploration well. The State Council sent a special cable of congratulations. Ten years elapsed. On the eve of China's reform and opening up, offshore oil still only came from one simple offshore well whose annual output was no more than 100,000 tonnes. "The spring wind has come overnight and pear trees blossom everywhere." In 1980, China signed contracts with Japanese and French oil companies on cooperation in the offshore oil industry. Since then, China has opened the doors to the outside world on cooperation in the offshore oil industry. From Bohai Bay to Beibu Bay, China's extensive waters have entered a new period of attracting foreign capital and advanced equipment and technology from around the world and of large-scale prospecting and exploitation. Another 10 years elapsed. As of the end of last year, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation had signed 74 contracts and agreements with 55 oil companies from 13 countries and attracted foreign capital totalling $3.8 billion. The story of Offshore Well Number One has been integrated with roaring machines in the offshore oil cities. At present, 10 offshore oil and gas fields have been erected and 10 others are being erected. In fact, hardly anywhere in the world are so many offshore oil and gas fields exploited on such an extensive a scale. Last year, China's offshore oil output already reached 4.6 million tonnes. Percussion drills, the most primitive of drills, plus the steel frame resting on two 500-tonne salvage floats, the most primitive of drilling vessels, were a primitive form used in China's offshore oil industry for many years. Today, the equipment and technology of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation are so impressive that none of the oil companies around the world dare to look down on them. From prospecting to exploitation to production, various pieces of equipment are complete and match one another, and there are 90 big and small vessels, most of which reach the world's advanced levels, including a 200,000-odd-tonne floating production and storage vessel. Technologically, China has developed from sending a few technical personnel abroad as employees of foreign companies to completely relying on its itself to design, establish, and manage offshore oil and gas fields. China's offshore oil industry has stood lofty amidst reform and opening up. Before reform and opening up, a work force of 30,000 could produce no more than 100,000 tonnes of crude oil a year. Today, a work force of 30,000 can produce 46 times as much. "In 1997 when our annual output of crude oil reaches 12 million tonnes and our natural gas 4 billion cubic meters, our work force will not exceed 30,000." Looking ahead, Wang Yanman, general manager of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, said with full confidence: "We are stepping into the ranks of the world's advanced oil companies."
