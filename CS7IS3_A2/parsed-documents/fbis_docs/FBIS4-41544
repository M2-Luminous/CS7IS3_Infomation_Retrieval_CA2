A New Approach to the Constitution Has Begun"] [Text] There is no disputing the fact that the new Russian Constitution, adopted 12 December last year, is far from perfect. But, while the Fundamental Law has been in force, so many attempts -- either malicious or out of ignorance -- have already been made on it that there is nothing left for us but to put our trust in its defense by the Constitutional Court, which has virtually been inoperative in Russia for more than six months now. If you recall, the Constitutional Court's activity was suspended by the president's celebrated Edict No. 1400, and its activity was frozen, while the Constitutional Court itself was mentioned only occasionally in connection either with a hunger strike by one of the judges, or with a fire in its building's turret, or with the possible departure of Valeriy Zorkin in order to enter politics. Nevertheless, during this time work was already under way on a new law on the Constitutional Court. The draft law was sent to the State Duma, and a conciliation commission was set up together with the committee under the leadership of V. Isakov. After several amendments were made, the draft law was adopted on its first reading, after which it was sent back for additional work. Amendments from the Federation Council were expected before 15 June. The next reading of the law was scheduled for today, and the draft law was duplicated. Suddenly a 15-page package of amendments -- 52 in all -- arrived 22 June from the Committee for Legislation and Judicial and Legal Reform. Some of them are of a purely formal nature, and some are simply unexpected, such as, for example, the exclusion of constitutional control from the Constitutional Court's functions. Until recently the Constitutional Court comprised 13 judges. According to the new draft law, it remained to choose six more (10 candidacies were submitted to the president over a month ago, but Yeltsin has not yet made a decision in this regard). But the amendments submitted by the Federation Council provide for the reelection of all the Constitutional Court judges (elected for life!) -- which will still further delay both the adoption of the law on the Constitutional Court and the start of its work. The amendments submitted by the Federation Council include proposals for the court chairman to be appointed by the Federation Council itself, not by the already elected composition. There are grounds for fearing that there will very soon arise a further serious cause for discussion by the Constitutional Court. Which does not exist in Russia.
