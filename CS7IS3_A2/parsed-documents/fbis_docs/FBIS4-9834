The URNG said this "abominable incident" undermines the human rights agreement signed with the government. According to a URNG communique published in Mexico City, the magistrate's assassination "bluntly reveals the opposition that exists within government sectors, particularly within the Army, to the Global Agreement on Human Rights," which was signed in Mexico City on 29 March. Gonzalez Dubon died in the early hours of 2 April as a result of an attack in downtown Guatemala City by several unidentified men who shot him while he was driving home. Police have called the attack an "apparent robbery attempt," but several prominent members of the political and legal professions pointed to death squads as possible culprits. In its communique, the URNG said the assassination of the Constitutional Court president "is aimed at limiting the role of the people, which had been opened by the aforementioned agreement in the area of human rights." The communique added: "It is important for the government of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and the Guatemalan Army to completely fulfill without delay the promises made to the Guatemalan people and the United Nations as the only way to uproot repression, assassination, and barbaric acts from our fatherland." The URNG also demanded that the security corps and the Guatemalan Army be purged "of the assassins opposed to peace and human rights" and deemed that "thorough measures, not just publicity and cosmetic measures," are needed. Meanwhile, the guerrillas also called on the United Nations, the mediator in the peace talks between the government and the URNG, to send a preparatory mission for the verification of human rights to Guatemala "without delay" as established in the agreements signed in Mexico City.
