Over the past fortnight, the Centrel system maintained normal frequency levels after considerable fluctuation caused by unplanned Ukrainian imports since November, officials of the centre said. The fluctuations caused slowdowns and overstrain with electric appliances, and Centrel countries -- the Czech republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the eastern part of Germany -- threatened Ukraine with separating it from the grid if it failed to return the energy drawn until Friday. Ukraine was forced to import more energy than it had planned due to severe fuel shortages there. Hungary supplied a quarter of the extra energy drawn.
