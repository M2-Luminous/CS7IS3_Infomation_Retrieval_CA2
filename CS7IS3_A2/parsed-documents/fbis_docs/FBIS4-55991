Minister Granic said this on 17 May, in the introductory speech at the session of the Foreign Policy Parliament Committee, at which he spoke about the present foreign political position of Croatia. Croatian ambassadors to the UN, the European Union, the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and Belgium, Germany, Turkey, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Slovenia also participated in the Committee activities. The main topics of the 15th Committee session, chaired by Dr. Zarko Domljan, were the international position of Croatia, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina after the Washington and Vienna agreements, and relations with the neighboring countries and international superpowers. "Croatia has never been in a better international position than it is now," said Dr. Granic, adding that the procedure for accepting Croatia in the Council of Europe has been restarted, and that there have been announcements that economic arrangements with international financial institutions will be made. Everybody present agreed that the main reasons for the improvement of the position of Croatia were the agreements between Croats and Bosniaks in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which, as Dr. Mario Nobilo, Croatian ambassador to the UN in New York, said, Croatia must strictly observe. He, like the other participants, said that Croatia is still in a very difficult position, and that the Bosniak- Croat federation is also a chance for Croatia to get closer to Europe. Nobilo also emphasized the importance of the "clear and aggressive appearance" Croatia made before the international forces with the aim of changing the UNPROFOR mandate, and to channel the money spent on the "static preservation of the situation" in the UNPA's to financing the return of the refugees and the restoration of the country.
