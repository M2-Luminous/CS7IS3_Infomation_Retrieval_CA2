This came in a statement by Ahmad 'Abdallah Salih, deputy secretary of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. A responsible source at the General People's Congress [GPC] -- a northern official -- responded to these accusations by saying that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih rejected, during the Salalah meeting, a southern proposal implying divisionist trends, calling for returning all northern and southern military units to their pre-unity positions. The same source noted that the Yemeni Presidential Council will not be able to hold its scheduled meeting tomorrow because the second man in the YSP refuses to come to Sanaa to participate in the meeting. It is noteworthy that the Yemeni Presidential Council is a collective presidential body including five members -- three from the North and two from the South. The two members from the South are 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his deputy Salim Salih Muhammad.
