For tourism to be successful, it has to be managed by an economist. Those who hold this opinion are justified, especially since Dr. al-Biltaji has assumed responsibility of the Ministry of Tourism after one of the most successful ministers of Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's cabinet, namely Minister Fu'ad Sultan who was able to realize for Egypt a revenue of $2.5 billion from tourism in 1992. Minister Sultan encouraged the private sector to invest in tourism, thus giving it a great boost. He was also the first man to call for specialization in the tourism sector. Sultan is a well-known banker who is acknowledged for his capability. What many do not know is that the new minister of tourism has a doctorate in economics and another in political science. With his experience in information, Dr. al-Biltaji has mastered the art of dealing with domestic and foreign media people as a result of long years of work (17 years) that have tied him to these people. Such a man is needed now, especially since Egyptian tourism is experiencing a deep crisis that has reduced tourism revenues from $2.5 billion to $2.1 billion. This crisis has resulted from the terrorist acts that have been perpetrated in Egypt. The Western media has played a major role in exaggerating these acts. As a consequence, tourism firms have excluded Egypt from their program for this year. However, there is an $42-million plan to make up for these losses, according to Dr. al-Biltaji. Following is the text of the interview: [Shalash] Since you assumed responsibility of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism, you have been declaring that this ministry seeks to turn tourism into the locomotive pulling Egypt's development and that you will enhance tourism, which has been in a crisis as a result of two consecutive blows: the Kuwait liberation war and the terrorist acts of the fall and winter of 1992--acts which persist to this day. So, how do you envision accomplishing these goals, and how will tourism become the development locomotive in a country with a population of 60 million people? [al-Biltaji] When I said that tourism is the locomotive that pulls development in Egypt, I was fully aware of what I was saying. I still say the same thing and I work for its implementation. I mean by this that tourism isn't just a railroad car in the development train but the locomotive that pulls the entire train, without replacing any of its cars. The foreign currency revenue basket is supplied by three elements, namely: the Suez Canal, remittances from expatriate workers, and tourism. Tourism possesses characteristics that make it eligible to outdistance and surpass other small elements of foreign revenue, because tourism is an immediately exportable product. Consequently, the element of time is, in this case, immediately embodied economically and financially. In other words, I can export tourism immediately, because the product is ready. This is the first thing. Second, tourism, remittances from expatriate Egyptians, Suez Canal revenues, and oil revenues constitute altogether the four elements of which the big-four assembly consists. The difference is that tourism is not depletable, has no ceiling, and isn't susceptible to labor market fluctuations. Third, tourism is a labor-intensive industry, meaning that one tourist creates work opportunities for 1.7 citizens. There is also the so-called tourism multiplier. This multiplier is a very large group of industries and crafts that develop and grow the more active tourism becomes. Tourism isn't just hotels, restaurants, airplane tickets, and buses, but also an integrated number of industries: moquette, rugs, chinaware, bed covers, tables, spare parts, soap, and detergents. This means laborers, carpenters, boatmen, smelters, plumbers, machinists, drivers, cooks, and employees. [Shalash] What are the true losses that have emanated from the crisis Egyptian tourism is experiencing? [al-Biltaji] Last year, 1993, we lost $1.5 billion. In 1992, revenues were $2.5 billion. Perhaps the serious nature of the terrorist acts and their reverberations in the Western media have intensified the crisis of Egyptian tourism and resulted in a big drop in the demand for Egyptian tourist sites. This crisis has motivated some tour organizers and international tourist firms to exclude Egypt from their marketing programs. If demand continues to be low, Egypt will continue to be excluded from international marketing programs (group tours), and this would harbor serious harbingers of future demand, and even of future investment in the Egyptian tourism sector. Subsequently, the other sectors tied to the tourism sector, such as vocational, industrial, commercial, and banking activities, will also be affected. [Shalash] What is your plan to boost tourism in the coming phase under the canopy of attacks that continue to be committed against tourists in Upper Egypt? [al-Biltaji] Terrorist acts against tourists are few if compared with other countries where similar incidents occur. To date, only three tourists have been hurt. I blame the Western media, but not all of them, for the way they describe the incidents. I have actually met with foreign reporters in Egypt and explained to them the dimensions of what has happened. There is a demand on the international media to make the scoop and to be the front runner in reporting developments. If information isn't supplied to the media, they will gather it from any source that may misinterpret the information and may misdirect it. Every media person has an urgent need for information, and one can either provide him with the information or he will gather it any way he can. The plan to boost tourism that we have drafted for 1994 is based on increasing demand and on promoting the investment and development opportunities in our tourist areas. The plan also offers projects in these area to likely investors all over the world, meaning that it promotes the demand side and exerts efforts for the supply side in the tourism equation. The plan devotes concerted attention to boosting demand in six major international markets that export tourists to Egypt, namely the United States, Germany, Italy, France, and Japan [no sixth market mentioned]. [Shalash] What is this plan's total budget? [al-Biltaji] It is estimated at $42 million. [Shalash] How will this sum be secured? [al-Biltaji] From the state's public treasury, the Tourism Fund, and the private tourism sector. The government has actually agreed to supply the full sum, and implementation of the plan has already started. By the end of 1994, the plan seeks to achieve the peak revenue of 1992, i.e., $2.1 billion instead of the $1.3 billion achieved in 1993. [Shalash] What will be the focus of activity in the targeted markets? [al-Biltaji] To amend Egypt's image; to put terrorist acts within their correct context and dimensions; to appeal to the consumer directly through television and through specialized and unspecialized major press and news agencies; to strengthen the bond with conventional channels of distribution, such as tour organizers, travel agents, incentive-offering houses, conference organizers, and airline associations and companies; to enhance the standard of materials used to boost sales; to implement a program to market the Egyptian tourist product; to utilize the system of tourist convoys; to participate in international conferences; to draft a well-studied program to invite leaders in the field of tourism; and to establish a mechanism for periodic followup. [Shalash] Where does Arab tourism fall on the Egyptian tourism-boosting map? Has Arab tourism been affected by the latest terrorist acts, and has the Arab media performed the same role performed by some Western media? [al-Biltaji] The Arab market has its special characteristic and it is an important market in exporting tourists to Egypt. The plan takes into account the need to exert concerted efforts in this market, using the proper instruments, such as tourist convoys and host programs. The plan also takes into account intensified contacts with official and professional circles and increased reliance on the satellite television channel and on Egyptian radio and press. At the same time, the plan disregards some high-cost promotion instruments, such as television commercials, press advertisements, and tourism-promotion offices. This is why we have decided to shut down the Egyptian Tourism Office in Kuwait. Arab tourism to Egypt represents 40 percent of the international tourist traffic coming into our country. The effect on Arab tourism has been slight when compared to the drop in other markets. The Egyptian minister asserted that the importance of Arab tourism to Egypt surpasses economic and social considerations. Tourism is a main element that bolsters solidarity and understanding, and "we urge Egyptian citizens to go for tourism in the Arab countries, because an Arab tourist in Egypt and an Egyptian tourist in the Arab world is a citizen primarily. An Arab tourist in Egypt is a first-class citizen and a tourist who comes to his history and his environment and who deals with a society that favors and welcomes him. As for the Arab media, they have been committed to the truth since the start of the terrorist acts, except for a few. I meet with Arab reporters in Cairo, and I have been tied to them by good relations, since I was head of the Information Authority throughout recent years. [Shalash] You have signed an agreement with Israel and Turkey to establish the East Mediterranean Tourism Organization. But there are fears that Israel will deal a blow to Egyptian tourism in particular. Fears abound these days among ordinary Egyptians that Israel has had a role in the latest developments [terrorist acts], especially since the success of ASTA [American Society of Travel Agents] 1992 and Egypt's excellent rise on the world's tourism map have disturbed many of the region's tourist countries? [al-Biltaji] There is absolutely no fear of cooperation with Israel in this regard, because Egypt's tourism resources are unrivaled. Egypt possesses one-third of the world's antiquities, and it possesses natural elements, such as sun, air, shores, and hospitable people, that are rarely found in another country. [Shalash] What is tourism's position in the political leadership's mind? [al-Biltaji] President Mubarak devotes great attention to tourism, and he goes personally to tourist sites in Luxor and the Red Sea to encourage greatly tourism investors visiting Egypt. [Shalash] Tourism development activity in new tourist sites was at the peak of success prior to 1993. Has investment and development activity declined by the same degree as tourist numbers and tourism revenues? [al-Biltaji] Investment activity hasn't been affected by the latest developments. The government has issued a number of laws and regulations that ensure that the wheel of development keeps on turning and that encourage the private sector to participate effectively in this area. Incentives include free foreign exchange transactions and unrestricted remittance of profits to the outside world; the right of non-Egyptians to fully own investment projects; tax exemptions for profits emanating from tourist project expansions; and exemption from the proportionate revenue tax, from registration, documentation, and announcement fees for all contracts connected with the project. The incentives also include the levying of a uniform customs fee amounting to 5 percent of the value of goods and equipment imported for a project. Moreover, the incentives make it impermissible to seize or confiscate the assets of investment firms and give these firms the right to re-export their full capital. The above incentives come on top of other facilities, such as sale and lease to investors at token prices, the investor's freedom to determine the price of his services and his profits without intervention by the government, and the easy and prompt acquisition of approvals and permits for tourist projects. [Shalash] The Ministry of Aviation has been separated from the Ministry of Tourism in the latest Cabinet. The Civil Aviation Authority has been placed under the control of the Ministry of Transport; Cairo Airport and Air Egypt have been placed under Cabinet control. Moreover, tourist companies and hotels have, under the canopy of the new specialization laws, been placed under the control of the public business sector. Will this result in lack of coordination between these sectors, even though they all serve the same thing, namely tourism, or is there coordination among you? [al-Biltaji] Coordination is extant and ongoing. We all cooperate for what is in the interest of Egypt and its prosperity. When a problem develops, we do actually form a joint aviation-tourism committee to examine it. [Shalash] Give me an example. [al-Biltaji] There is the "chartered" flights problem that developed recently when the Civil Aviation Authority refused to permit tourist-carrying "chartered" flights to land in al-Ghardaqah on the grounds that laws don't empower it to permit such landings. I intervened immediately and the flights were permitted to land because the interest of tourism comes first. The committee we formed of the Ministry of Tourism, the Aviation Authority, and Air Egypt drafted rules to regulate "chartered" flight activity in a way that ensures the national company's right, i.e., Air Egypt's right, and the rights of the Egyptian and foreign private sector companies. I believe in the policy of open skies. [Shalash] It seems from this interview that you are more optimistic than you should. [al-Biltaji] Yes, I am optimistic. Egyptian tourism activity will regain its normal rates soon.
