FR940825-0-00004 FR940825-0-00001 Increase in Governmentwide Maximum Uniform Allowance An agency commented that it believed OPM was obligated to establish annual inflationary rates for the Governmentwide maximum uniform allowance rate based on the provisions of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA). Under section 5902 of title 5, United States Code, as revised by FEPCA, OPM ``may, from time to time, by regulation adjust the maximum amount for the cost of uniforms and the maximum allowance for uniforms under section 5901.'' The agency suggested that the method for such an adjustment should be included in the final rule. While it is possible for OPM to establish a regulatory formula to implement section 5902, OPM believes such an approach is not required by law and that an adjustment to the maximum uniform allowance is not necessary at this time because the maximum uniform allowance was adjusted recently by statute (FEPCA). In addition, even a regulatory method for adjustment in the Governmentwide maximum uniform allowance rate would not obviate the need for a higher initial maximum uniform allowance when the required uniform involves a high initial outlay of funds. Therefore, OPM has not revised the regulations in this regard. Eligibility for a Uniform Allowance An employee believed that certain officer technicians should receive appropriate remuneration under the uniform allowance program in section 5902 of title 5, United States Code, because they are required to wear their military uniform while performing their Federal civilian jobs. This comment applies to the administration of the uniform allowance program within an agency and not the construction of the regulations themselves. Therefore, OPM believes these regulations are not an appropriate place to address the employee's question and agency policies related to this matter. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they apply only to Federal agencies and employees.
