FR940324-0-00048 FR940324-0-00020 In its petition, TFI objects that it is not clear what purpose is served by requiring owners or operators to conduct sampling or measurement of radium-226 in phosphogypsum distributed for use in research and development, because there is no quantitative limit on the amount of radium-226 which phosphogypsum distributed for this use may contain. Because there is no limit on the amount of radium permitted in phosphogypsum distributed for research and development use, EPA assumed in its analysis of potential risks associated with such use that the phosphogypsum would contain high levels of radium. EPA believes that in most instances analysis of the radium-226 content in phosphogypsum distributed for use in research and development will be necessary as part of the research activity. However, EPA has concluded that requiring certification documents accompanying phosphogypsum distributed for use in research and development to include quantitative analyses of radium content is not necessary to monitor compliance. Accordingly, EPA has decided that this objection by TFI is also of central relevance to the outcome of this provision. In view of the multiple objections by TFI which are of central relevance to the outcome of 40 CFR 61.205, the provision of the revised Subpart R governing distribution of phosphogypsum for use in research and development, EPA has decided to partially grant the TFI petition by convening a proceeding to reconsider 40 CFR 61.205. To implement this decision, EPA is preparing and will publish shortly a notice of reconsideration specifying the specific subjects on which further comment will be requested and the range of options to be considered. In its petition, TFI objects that the formula set forth in 40 CFR 61.207(d), which is used to establish the number of samples necessary to determine a representative average radium-226 concentration, is ambiguous, because it does not specify the amount of allowable error. EPA agrees with this objection. The failure to include an allowable error component in the formula was an inadvertent omission. EPA believes that it would not be necessary to convene a reconsideration proceeding for the sole purpose of correcting this inadvertent omission, but has decided to include 40 CFR 61.207(d) among the provisions to be reconsidered. To assist affected facilities in complying with the existing rule while the reconsideration proceeding is pending, EPA will provide specific guidance in the notice of reconsideration concerning selection of an appropriate error component. IV. Decision to Partially Deny Petition EPA has carefully reviewed all of the remaining objections set forth in the TFI petition for reconsideration. Based on that review, EPA has concluded that none of the remaining technical objections by TFI to the EPA analysis of the potential risks of phosphogypsum use are of central relevance to the outcome of the 1992 rule. In addition, EPA has determined that some of the remaining policy objections by TFI could have been raised during the public comment period, and that none of the remaining policy objections is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule. Based on its review of the remaining objections in the TFI petition for reconsideration, EPA is denying the TFI petition with respect to all provisions in the rule not specifically included in the decision to grant reconsideration set forth above. The Agency's response to each of the remaining TFI objections is summarized below. A. Technical Objections Objection: The radon emanation coefficient of 0.3 for phosphogypsum is too high. Field observations (HP91) and the PATHRAE model (EPA87) suggest the radon emanation coefficient for phosphogypsum in soil should be 0.2. The coefficient used is 50 percent larger than suggested by empirical data, but no explanation is given for why the higher value was selected.
