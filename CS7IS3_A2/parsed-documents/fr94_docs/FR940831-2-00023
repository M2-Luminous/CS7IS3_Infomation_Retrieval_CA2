FR940831-2-00023 FR940831-2-00017 Financial Assistance Award: Open Hands AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Intent. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE) announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B) to the Open Hands, under Grant Number DE-FG01&hyph;94CE16095 to initiate a demonstration project for new technology for innovative exterior insulation on houses. The Department of Energy has determined that a noncompetitive award is being conducted by the applicant using their own resources or those donated or provided by third parties, however, DOE support of that activity would enhance the public benefits to be derived and DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such activity. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(i)(D) that the application submitted by the Open Hands is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and that the proposed project represents a unique technology which has a possibility of DOE promoting implementation of components of the National Energy Policy Act Sections 142 to develop and adopt new weatherization technologies through coordinated effort of Federal State and Local organizations. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $25,000 over a one year period. Data obtained from the grantee will enhance the public benefit to be derived from the project by increasing the amount of data being collected on the proof of concept demonstration for the potential new technology for innovative installing exterior insulation system. The Department of Energy has determined it to be in the public interest to award a noncompetitive grant to the Open Hands (Non-Profit Organization) because the proposed project has been initiated by the applicant using his own resources. The grantee will provide the labor, materials and equipment to test the feasibility of the demonstrated proof of concept for technology for installing exterior insultation for houses as directed. The proposed project is authorized under the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6851 et seq., PL 94&hyph;375, and 10 CFR 440 and will allow the DOE to evaluate other types of Weatherization in the future as this is proved.
