He also hinted that the government may agree with producers and trade unions on a temporary price and wage freeze. "The tough financial policy will not be eased to any degree. Let nobody count on that", Chernomyrdin told reporters before leaving for Omsk on Monday. "No radical turns are planned" in the course of reforms, the prime minister said and added that the government would adhere to the programme of transformations which was adopted last August and approved by the president. "Nobody has changed the programme of reforms which was adopted last August 6 and approved by the president. No changes were introduced to it when (Yegor) Gaydar came to the government in September 1993. He accepted it and agreed with it", Chernomyrdin said. He also said that he does not plan to fully abandon monetarist approaches to reforms. "But time has come to use also non-monetarist methods in solving our economic problems", according to the prime minister. The latter include, in particular, agreements between the government, trade unions and producers on fixing prices and on "establishing for a certain period of fixed wages", according to the prime minister. "There are many other ways capable of improving the situation", he added, but did not elaborate. The prime minister denied press reports about his contradictions with the president and said he had no disagreements with Boris Yeltsin either on the course of reforms or on the personnel policy in the government. "I always agree the main, basic directions of the work of the government with the president. He has to know them and will know them", Chernomyrdin said. He objected to attempts to discredit the new Russian Government even before it began to work and added that the main part of the government had been preserved. He also denied allegations that he faced opposition in the government during 1993. "I am not a schoolboy. I would not tolerate it. If they mean Gaydar and Fedorov, I believe they had no problems working with Chernomyrdin", the prime minister said.
