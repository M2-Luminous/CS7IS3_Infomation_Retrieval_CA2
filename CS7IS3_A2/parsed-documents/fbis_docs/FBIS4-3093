The plan is being started to improve the quality of construction in China, said a ministry official at the weekend. And the licensing scheme has been tested successfully in Northeast China's Liaoning Province. It is expected to be introduced nationwide soon, said the official. The first examination for architects, an indispensable part of the licensing scheme, is planned for later this year, he added. The trial in Liaoning has been done in line with international practice and includes the appraisal of an applicant's academic qualifications, professional training and achievements. Only licensed architects are allowed to bid for contracts, the official said. The move had come after years of chaos in the profession. Unqualified people were able to practise and architects' rights and responsibilities had long remained vague. Designs used to be done by State-owned institutes instead of architects. This lack of organization has crippled many architects' creativity and enthusiasm. And moves to improve standards have so far been very slow, said the official. The new system, he said, aims to bring standards sufficiently high that they will be recognized in other countries and regions. Several countries, including the United States, have yet to acknowledge Chinese architectural qualifications. At the same time, the ministry is to expand its building-control system to all projects in China. Supervisors will make sure projects' quality, progress and finances tally strictly with the contracts, the same official said. Under the old planned economy there were frequent lows between owners and contractors over poor construction quality and delayed payments because there was no supervision of their contracts. About 15 per cent of China's construction products are said to be substandard last year, while building firms were owed 20 billion yuan ($2.3 billion), causing more and more distress for project owners and contractors, said the official. The supervision system was first brought in to cover the Beijing Tianjin-Tangu Expressway and hydro-electric power stations in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the late 1980s. Now, many construction projects, including the Guangzhou metro system, the new Beijing railway station and the gigantic Three Gorges Dam project, are endorsing it. Ministry officials say they plan to bring the new system into housing projects as complaints have been rising. The Shanghai-based Wen Hui Daily [WEN HUI BAO] reported last week that up to 60 per cent of the city's new homes leak.
