We will stand firm together with the large number of Hong Kong people who love China and Hong Kong in the recovery of Hong Kong's sovereignty, following the principles of `one country, two systems,' and `Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong' set out in the Basic Law." At a ceremony to issue letters of appointment to advisers to Hong Kong regional affairs held today, Zhou Nan said: "Since Hong Kong entered the transitional period, Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly stressed it is important for those Hong Kong people who love China and Hong Kong to actively participate in all sorts of social and political affairs. In the previous period, according to suggestions made by Hong Kong people, the Chinese Government has set up the Preliminary Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and has appointed two batches of advisers on Hong Kong affairs. Facts have proved that these moves are conducive to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and are also an effective way to encourage Hong Kong people to get involved in social and political affairs in the transition period and to prepare them for `administering Hong Kong'." Zhou Nan pointed out: "The historic moment when Hong Kong will return to the embrace of the motherland is drawing near. Although there are people who have tried in every possible way to create obstacles to the return of Hong Kong to its motherland, their wishful attempts are doomed to failure. The Chinese people, who have risen to their feet, will never allow themselves to be ordered about and trampled upon any more." Zhou Nan quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying: "Every son and daughter of the Chinese people takes pride in their nation, no matter what clothes they are dressed in and what position they hold. Hong Kong people also have a sense of pride in their nation. Hong Kong people can administer Hong Kong well. They should have such confidence in themselves. Hong Kong's prosperity has been brought about by Hong Kong people with Chinese as the main body." Zhou Nan stressed: "We must create such confidence: Without British cooperation, we can still achieve a smooth transition and administer Hong Kong well." He hoped the appointed advisers on regional affairs would, together with the Hong Kong people, make concerted efforts to remove all obstacles and work for a smooth transition and a happier and more prosperous Hong Kong.
