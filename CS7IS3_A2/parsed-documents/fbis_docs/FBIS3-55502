In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday [10 January], Kharchenko said that in 1994 Russia and the United States plan to carry out 26 joint projects, compared to 17 in 1993. He said the documents on mutual understanding and military cooperation signed by Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev during his official visit to the U.S. last year open up new prospects for partnership between the two countries. The documents have also sealed both sides' intention to leave the years of nuclear confrontation between the two superpowers in the past for good. Grachev and his American counterpart agreed to meet annually, exchange delegations at all levels and train the Russian military in the U.S. The delegations of the two ministries will discuss a wide range of issues, including national security and employment of the former army personnel in civilian sectors of the economy. The two countries will also provide each other with information. The agreements provide for exchanges of ships and aircraft, joint manoeuvres and war games, Kharchenko said. In April 1993 the armies of the two countries conducted the first joint manoeuvres to rescue the crews of aircraft and helicopters in the Polar region. In June the U.S. and NATO navy forces held war games in the Baltic Sea which were also attended by warships of all Baltic Sea states, including the Russian mine- laying destroyer Nastoychiviy. Russia and the U.S. will conduct joint manoeuvres of their peace-keeping forces in the Volga region this coming summer, Kharchenko said.
