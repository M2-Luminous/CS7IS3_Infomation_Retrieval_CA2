Is it quiet? [Silajdzic] Yes, I spoke with them at 10 tonight -- our time tonight -- and they said that actually the attacks on Goradze intensified after the air strikes. Now it's rather quiet, but I'm afraid that those people are looking for a very difficult and tense night tonight and God knows only what happens tomorrow. [Snow] But it is your judgment that the air strikes may have been enough and may now have done the trick and stopped the Serb attack on Goradze? [Silajdzic] The air strikes were too late, too limited to impress the Serbs. They obviously were not impressed for they intensified, as I said, their attacks on Goradze today. Twenty-five people died after the air strikes, and I must say that torture of Goradze people must stop. Either by the UN and Nato action, or by lifting the arms embargo for the Bosnian's so as we can defend ourselves. [Snow] Now how about the Russian Foreign Ministry's suggestion today that UN peacekeepers now going, if General Rose can find the peacekeepers to go in there, go into Goradze and disarm both sides, the Serbs and your own soldiers, Bosnian government soldiers, in Goradze? [Silajdzic] Well that's disarming the victim. So the Serbs who were attacking Goradze for 15 days, attacking the safe zone, attacking civilian areas, attacking the UNPROFOR base, and now they should be disarmed together with their victims. And I heard on the news that Russian Minister Kozyrev said that this was a dreadful mistake. So the 15 days of killing civilians is not a mistake. Don't human lives mean anything anymore? So, the Serbs will have to withdraw to the exclusion zone lines in order for the peace negotiations to be continued. [Snow] Well now, that's what the Americans appear to be saying as well. If the Serbs do now relax their pressure, if they do now stop, and if they are ready for ceasefire talks, are you ready to do that too? [Silajdzic] Well, as soon as they withdraw, because they attacked the safe zone, as soon as they withdraw behind the exclusion zone lines to be established by the Security Council, of course we are ready to talk. The problem was that they were saying they were ready to talk and applying the tactics of talking and negotiating. We warned General Rose from the very beginning that this was their tactics. [Snow] But you will talk Mr. Silajdzic about a ceasefire all over Bosnia provided this attack on Goradze stops? Is that right, you will do that? [Silajdzic] I'm sorry, will you repeat the question? [Snow] You are prepared to sit down and talk with the Serbs and General Rose about a ceasefire over the whole of Bosnia if the pressure on Goradze stops, is that right? [Silajdzic] Not if the pressure on Goradze stops, when they withdraw behind the lines of the exclusion zone, that means 20 kms in the radius around Goradze, then we are ready to sit and talk yes. [Snow] Thank you very much, Mr. Silajdzic.
