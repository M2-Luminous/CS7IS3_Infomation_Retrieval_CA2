After a short time, however, it started to snow, and here and there the negative aspects of the electronic transfer system began to be noticed. Therefore, in order to shed some light on interbank electronic accounting and accounting in general, let's profit from the commentary on this matter by the NBU's deputy chairman of the board, Oleksandr Kyreyev. The Ukrainian system of electronic payments comprises a system of channels which need to be filled with water--that is to say, with money--in order for movement to be observed there. Money is not lacking--and the channels have dried up. How is money to be made? As of now, the conditions are not favorable for economic entities to trade: The longer that items can be kept in storage warehouses, the more favorable it will be to sell. Other factors ruining the payment system include an essential barrier in accounting operations between enterprises--payment in kind (this occurs particularly in rural areas and may be seen when you drive through Ukraine: Bila Tserkva is surrounded by tires, Novomoskovsk--by pans, the Vinnytsa and Cherkassk regions--by sacks of sugar, which people have received in lieu of payment and which they want to sell). And until monetary operations have been normalized at the enterprise level, until we succeed in raising money for unsold products, and until we turn around the postponed "grain" credits, there can be no talk of the normal operation of a system of electronic payments. The disease of "dried-up channels" cannot be overcome by purely banking measures. The National Bank was hardly able to stand up under the storm of criticism that was evoked by the prohibition of a debit balance. But: in the first ten days of February five banks went bankrupt (Blagobank, Ekomedbank, Universalbank, Niva, and Olevskyy); at present there is another bank which is on the brink of closing down. Information about the above-mentioned bankruptcies spread at the speed of sound, and many banks having free access to the debit wire began to throw their own debts onto the bankrupt banks. The latter, thereby, closed down with very large debts. On one occasion we managed to trace the path taken by a certain sum of money: In the space of a single day this money turned up in five different banks and was shifted across two oblasts. And so, taking into consideration the fact that electronic payments are extremely fast, the NBU decreed the following: A commercial bank must first recognize a demand made by another commercial ban, and then pay whatever is necessary. Other payments must be put on hold. At present the commercial banks are complaining particularly about correspondence-type accounts introduced by the National Bank. They say that they cannot conduct accounts this way. But we have already been living for a long time under the conditions of a nonmonolithic banking system. Indeed, five or six years ago there was in effect a system of interbranch turnover or circulation whereby money was only calculated on the accounts of the enterprises involved, but the actual payment would take place in the bank accounts themselves. Nowadays, when numerous commercial banks have begun to handle their own accounts and clear their own money, the National Bank--as the sole currency-emission center--is insisting that the commercial banks pay for its account, for the state's account, as--in the final analysis the taxpayer. Why can commercial banks carry out currency emissions in their own names when they do not agree upon the volume of such emissions? And if a commercial bank complains that a debit or negative balance does not allow it to make payments or pay from clearing accounts, that means that such a bank is finished as a bank: The money received from customers has gone into credits, and the customer-depositors cannot conduct transactions or even obtain ready cash. That is to say, if a bank is capable of performing only the third of its three basic functions (servicing cash-type savings accounts, clearing services, and handling credits), can it be called a complete bank? Or is it not a bank at all? There are quite enough such institutions among our banks. However, many bankers have justifications for their behavior. To be sure, how can they support the liquidation of they own banks if--during the hectic period of this year--they have approved credits to the state, and the latter was subsequently unable to settle their accounts? The problem of paying back the credits could bring about the next banking crisis inasmuch as the "grain" and "sugar" money already deposited at the new prices for these goods to be purchased by the rural areas has not yet been paid back. No matter what measures may be taken within the framework of the new payments system--Oleksandr Kyreyev emphasizes--they will not yield a positive result without a complex of state actions regarding the stabilization of the economy. According to Mr. Kyreyev, the National Bank has not rescued any type of account; it has merely designated certain technological changes. All types of accounts are operative. But of those that we have happily mastered, the most effective forms of handing accounts are the systems of payment deliveries via electronic mail (which includes checks, letters of credit, and everything else), and the most handy and recommended form of handling accounts at present is payment delivery.
