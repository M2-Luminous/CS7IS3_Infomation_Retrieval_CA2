The truck belongs to Thammawutkan Transport Company. Mr. Thawin Pawaratphichit, owner of the company, informed the police that the truck and its driver disappeared on 11 March. The police inspected the truck and found a large water container connected with electrical wires. The police rescue unit was asked to disconnect the wires. Master Sergeant Somkiat Nakon told reporters that the explosive is C-4 buried in ammonium nitrate mixed with diesel oil, and it could have been powerful if detonated. He said: [Begin Somkiat recording] The bomb was connected to almost a complete circuit and was ready to explode if someone pushed the switch. The local police opened the water tank and shoveled off the fertilizer. After seeing electrical wires, they called my unit in and I disconnected the wires. [end recording] The truck was later driven into Lumpini Park, which was not crowded during the daytime. The operation to defuse the explosive was observed by a large crowd. The authorities found three pounds of C-4 explosives and 14 detonators. A dead male body wrapped in a plastic sheet was then found at the bottom of the water tank. Police Major General Nithat Sawettanan, the commander of the Southern Metropolitan Police Commission, said that Thawin rented his truck to foreigners for 12,000 baht on 9 March. The truck was to load cargo at Makro wholesale center in the Bangkapi area on 10 March. The driver telephoned Thawin on the same day and said that he had already received the money, but then was not heard from since. But on 11 March, the truck was involved in an accident with a motorcycle in front of Central Chitlom department store. The driver was a foreigner who disappeared after paying for the damage to the motorcycle. Police authorities later drove the truck to the police station. A police expert disclosed that if detonated in the open air, the destruction could extend as far as one kilometer. The police believe that the production of this large bomb needed five or six hours and a secluded area, possibly the department store's underground parking lot or a nearby place. Lieutenant General Chaiyasit Kanchanakit of the Metropolitan Police Commission inspected the truck but refused to comment. However, many people suspected that the bomb may have been intended to sabotage several important places such as embassies in the area.
