The Serbs are protesting about the amount of military equipment, especially ammunition, that the Dutch troops are taking to Srebrenica. The Serbs are also preventing 180 Canadian troops from leaving the Muslim enclave. The Dutch contingent is authorized to relieve the Canadian blue helmets under an agreement signed by several parties including the Bosnian Serbs. At first the takeover operation encountered no resistance, but in the past few days the Serbs have toughened their stance.
