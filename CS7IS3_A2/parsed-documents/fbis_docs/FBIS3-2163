They were not worried that Most-Favored-Nation [MFN] status would thereby be affected and believed that the United States should not link these two issues. Zheng Guoxiong was asked at a Shunde City Investment Project Fair to comment on the legal actions concerning Wei Jingsheng shortly before U.S. Secretary of State Christopher's visit to China. He said that the Chinese Ministry of Justice had handled the relevant problems according to state laws and that it was entirely China's internal affair. He held that China has always opposed Western countries imposing their views and human rights standards on China and that the actions of the Chinese Ministry of Justice should not affect China's MFN status. When attending a Kun Tong District Basic Law Promotion Carnival, Chen Fengying said that the United States should not talk about the law-enforcement actions of the Ministry of Justice and China's MFN status in the same breath, because countries would do anything they thought they should according to law. MFN status is a problem of trade and mutual economic benefits between China and the United States and should not be linked to human rights problems. She pointed out that the human rights problems contained in U.S. accusations were also seen in the United States, some being even more serious than in other countries. She did not believe that the United States set human rights conditions when dealing with trading or other types of relations with other countries. Therefore, she believed that it was inappropriate for the United States to set human rights conditions when discussing MFN status with China. Cheng Yiu-tong, who was also present on the same occasion, argued that: China detained the persons concerned before the visit of the American officials merely in accordance with its own legal procedures. This fact reflects that China will not yield to the pressure exerted by the United States under the pretext of its human rights. In fact, China has also improved greatly on the human rights issue in the past few years. Regarding the question that the United States will first have to ascertain China's human rights status before considering granting it MFN status, Cheng Yiu-tong said: This shows that the United States confuses economics and politics over this question. China's reaction clearly tells the United States that China will make no compromise on these questions of principle and that China will handle relevant questions in accordance with its own legal procedures.
