Hata made the remark at a meeting of the House of Councillors Budget Committee in reply to Makoto Taneda, legislator from the Social Democratic Party, the No. 2 opposition party. "Medical services or minesweeping following the end of fighting, such as those Japan carried out in the Persian Gulf, could be possible," Hata said when asked what kind of support Japan can provide. "But it would be extremely difficult to engage in those united with military actions." As for the right of collective security in the UN Charter, Takao Ode, director general of the cabinet legislation bureau, said Japan owns the right as a sovereign state, but cannot execute it because of the constitution that renounces war. "The pacifism and the spirit of international cooperation in the preamble of the constitution agree with the ideas in the UN Charter," Ode said. "Japan will do its duty within the Constitution, and cannot use, or threaten to use, forces banned in Article 9 of the Constitution." Regarding possible UN sanctions against North Korea over its suspected nuclear development program, Hata declined to say what steps Japan can take in the sanctions because of an anxiety "of sending the wrong message" to North Korea. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told the same session Japan and South Korea have agreed that the sanctions should not be punitive, but should be those urging North Korea to return to a safeguard system of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Hata told reporters earlier in the day that Japan supports the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue. Meanwhile, a government source said Japan cannot take the initiative and needs to "give priority to the intentions of South Korea."
