It is clear that Pelletreau's statements during his current tour of the Gulf about the possibility of Iraqi rearmament are intended to scare the Gulf states and to guarantee continued U.S. domination of these states, the conclusion of more arms deals with them, and therefore the gradual plundering of their wealth. This is because Pelletreau and the others know very well that Iraq, which fought grinding battles in the confrontation against Iranian aggression for eight years, is not an element of threat to the Arab Gulf states or to the security of the region, but is a basic factor for ensuring the requirements of security and stability for the region, as proven in the past when Iraq protected, with the blood of its sons, the Arab Gulf states from the greed and evils of expansionist Iranian policy. Were it not for that brave Iraqi stand, these states would be in a different situation today. Therefore, drawing a parallel between Iraq and Iran today is a clear twisting of historical facts. By his allegations, Pelletreau only tries to tell and convince the Gulf states that they are in continuous need of U.S. protection through the conclusion of joint defense pacts and the purchase of surplus arms from U.S. arsenals, which they do not need to defend their security. This is because what is threatening the Gulf is not Iraq but the U.S. presence, which is continuously seeking only its interests, without being concerned about any other interests, as past experiences have proven in various parts of the world. The United States will definitely leave the region once it finds that its interests no longer require its continuous presence in it, as has happened in several cases. It is natural for Pelletreau not to warn the states of the region about the real danger threatening them, namely, the danger of the expansionist regimes the United States itself has helped create, as well as the Zionist danger, which is directed not only against them, but against all the countries of the Arab nation. This is because Pelletreau is manipulated by his Zionist overlords as one of its obedient tools. Pelletreau ignores that real danger and frightens the Arab Gulf states with an imaginary danger he claims to be coming from Iraq. We must not forget that the U.S. Administration always creates a false uproar whenever the UN Security Council is about to review the unfair blockade on Iraq. The United States is determined to shuffle the cards and create tension this time, having realized that the initiative is no longer solely in its hands, as was the case during the previous review. It is no secret to anyone that the motives behind such U.S. allegations are not to achieve security and stability in the region, but to plunder its oil resources and serve Zionist aims. The U.S. Administration was behind the ignition of the Iran-Iraq War, the arrival of Khomeyni and the supply of arms to his regime. The Irangate scandal is only one piece of evidence branding the United States with collusion. The United States, and no one else, creates terrorist regimes to disturb security and stability so it can deploy its forces and fleets, occupy the region, and violate all international conventions and norms as well as human rights which it falsely claims to uphold. So, it is not strange for statements to be released from time to time by dirty characters such as Pelletreau, Lake, and Indyk who, as our Arab people know, are just tools manipulated by Zionism and Freemasonry whenever they wish.
