It is likely, however, that at least a part of these losses will be compensated by UN bodies. Damage resulting from the economic embargo imposed on Serbian-Montenegrin Yugoslavia in June 1992 was estimated at $290 million (approximately 8.56 billion Czech korunas [Kc]) late last year. The bulk of this sum, $260 million, is made up of claims by foreign trade companies for goods delivered before the embargo was imposed. The goods in question were mostly engineering products, vehicles, and some chemicals, Jiri Vetrovsky, director of the Ministry of Finance Foreign Exchange Department, stated. In an explanatory statement on the bill, by means of which the Czech Republic joined the sanctions, the government voices the expectation that losses resulting from observance of the sanctions will be addressed in negotiations with the UN Security Council. Of the countries that apply sanctions against Yugoslavia, the impact of the embargo is felt mostly severely by Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Hungary's losses have already exceeded the sum of $1.3 billion. Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Geza Jeszenszky proposed the establishment of a UN fund, from which assistance would be given to states adhering to the embargo. Peace mediator David Owen also called for the compensation of losses last month. For losses incurred in connection with the conflict in the Persian Gulf, in the course of which an embargo had been imposed on Iraq and Kuwait, the Czech Republic claims, for the time being, a compensation of approximately Kc7.3 billion. It is asserting this claim through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the UN Compensation Commission. A total of 42 organizations suffered losses as a result of the embargo, of which 19 meet the UN conditions for compensation. The main part of the damages, worth about Kc5.5 billion, is accounted for by claims for unpaid deliveries to Iraq and Kuwait. The remainder results from unsalable inventories, outstanding interest payments for credits extended under duress, and damage to property.
