The sides failed to sign the final protocol on the ceasefire and the disengagement of troops, Russian Deputy Defence Minister Georgiy Kondratyev told TASS. The major provisions of the document were agreed upon thanks to mediation by Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev. Armenian Ambassador in Russia Feliks Mamikonyan told TASS that Azerbaijan insisted that its territories be freed simultaneously with the beginning of troops disengagement. He added that it was that question which demanded additional consultations with Baku. However, Kondratyev told TASS that Mamadrafi Mammadov, as it turned out, was not authorised to sign the final document and requested additional time for consultations with the president of Azerbaijan. The embassy of Azerbaijan in Moscow confirmed that the republican defence minister had left for Baku, but refused to comment on the disagreements at the talks. Kondratyev expressed hope that the protocol would be signed in the near future. According to the Armenian ambassador, representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Russia had signed the ceasefire and disengagement protocol.
