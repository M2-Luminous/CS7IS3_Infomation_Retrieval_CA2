FR940118-2-00061 FR940118-2-00047 F. After its appointment becomes effective, the trustee shall file monthly reports with the parties and the Court setting forth the trustee's efforts to accomplish divestiture of Baroid's diamond bit business as contemplated under this Final Judgment; provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. Such reports shall include the name, address, and telephone number of each person who, during the preceding thirty (30) days, made an offer to acquire, expressed an interest in acquiring, entered into negotiations to acquire, or was contacted or made an inquiry about acquiring, any ownership interest in Baroid's diamond bit business, and shall describe in detail each contact with any such person during that period. The trustee shall maintain full records of all efforts made to divest these operations. G. Within six months after its appointment has become effective, if the trustee has not accomplished the divestiture required by Section VII of this Final Judgment, the trustee shall promptly file with the Court a report setting forth (1) the trustee's efforts to accomplish the required divestiture, (2) the reasons, in the trustee's judgment, why any required divestiture have not been accomplished, and (3) the trustee's recommendations; provided, however, that to the extent such reports contain information that the trustee deems confidential, such reports shall not be filed in the public docket of the Court. The trustee shall at the same time furnish such report to the parties, who shall each have the right to be heard and to make additional recommendations consistent with the purpose of the trust. The Court shall thereafter enter such orders as it shall deem appropriate in order to carry out the purpose of the trust, which shall, if necessary, include extending the trust and the term of the trustee's appointment. VIII Notification Immediately following entry of a binding contract, contingent upon compliance with the terms of this Final Judgment, to effect any proposed divestiture pursuant to sections IV, V, VI, or VII of this Final Judgment, defendants or the trustee, whichever is then responsible for effecting the divestiture, shall notify plaintiff of the proposed divestiture. If the trustee is responsible, it shall similarly notify defendants. The notice shall set forth the details of the proposed transaction and list the name, address, and telephone number of each person not previously identified who offered to, or expressed an interest in or desire to, acquire any ownership interest in the business that is the subject of the binding contract, together with full details of same. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt by plaintiff of such notice, plaintiff may request additional information concerning the proposed divestiture and the proposed purchaser. Defendants and/or the trustee shall furnish any additional information requested within twenty (20) days of the receipt of the request, unless the parties shall otherwise agree. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice or within twenty (20) days after plaintiff has been provided the additional information requested (including any additional information requested of persons other than defendants or the trustee), whichever is later, plaintiff shall provide written notice to defendants and the trustee, if there is one, stating whether or not it objects to the proposed divestiture. If plaintiff provides written notice to defendants and/or the trustee that it does not object, then the divestiture may be consummated, subject only to defendants' limited right to object to the sale under the provisions in sections VI(C) and VII(C). Absent written notice that the plaintiff does not object to the proposed purchaser, a divestiture proposed under Section IV shall not be consummated. Upon objection by plaintiff, a divestiture proposed under section V shall not be consummated. Upon objection by plaintiff, or by defendants under the proviso in sections VI(C) and VII(C), a divestiture proposed under section VI or VII shall not be consummated unless approved by the Court.
