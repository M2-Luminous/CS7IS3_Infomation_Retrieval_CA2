FBIS4-43494 "drweu117__a94020" FBIS-WEU-94-117-A Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 ANNEX Italy & Vatican City Government To Move `Quickly' on Privatizations Government To Move `Quickly' on Privatizations BR1406142894 Rome ANSAMAIL Database in English 2121 GMT 14 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR1406142894 Rome ANSAMAIL Database English BFN [Unattributed article: "Treasury Minister on Privatizations at Lower House"] [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 14 -- The government intends to move quickly on privatizations and the sale of share packages of STET [Tutin Telephone Finance Company], the IRI-controlled [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] telecommunications financial holding company, ENEL [National Electric Power Board], and the ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] energy divisions "will depend, in the first place, on the fulfillment of the preparatory norms on privatization," said Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini. In a question and answer session at the Lower House today, Dini disclosed that before the summer is out, the government will lay down the guidelines for the formation of privatization authorities in the services sector, one authority for each sector. Before this, however, the government must complete an "act of concession" for ENEL for the production and distribution of energy to prepare the board for privatization. Responding to MPs worries about maintaining a public role in STET and ENEL, the minister explained, "The contents of the privatization decree correspond precisely to this concern. In fact, a golden share will stay in the state's hands and, look at this carefully, while the limit on the size of a single holding will expire in three years, the golden share will never be less." On the point of protection of the rights of small shareholders, the minister said the executive will follow through on the idea of "slate voting" for the boards of the newly-privatized companies whereby majority shareholders and small shareholders and their representatives will run majority and minority slates. Asked about the fate of IRI, Dini said, in substance, that it was too early to say. The privatization and liquidation of IRI companies will, however, be pursued "with maximum speed" and will always be accompanied by "relevant management activities." The minister, who began talking while seated at the government bench and was then told by the duty speaker to stand when addressing the chamber, as is customary, also dismissed allegations of a conflict of interest between Premier Silvio Berlusconi's government duties and his ownership of Fininvest, Italy's second-largest private business enterprise. "I would like to reassure the Parliament on this point because the number of filters between the premier's coordination center and the one where decisions are made are such as to stop any intermingling of interests." He identified the "filters" as "the panel of three ministers, Treasury, Budget and Industry, the consulting and guarantee committee on privatizations, chaired by the Treasury director general, the companies' boards of directors and, in some cases, the directors of the holdings." He went on to report that "national interests will always be taken into account" in the privatization process and pointed out that thus far 63 percent of the shares sold off have wound up in Italy. The new government also intends to fulfill the promise of the past executive: that revenues from privatizations "must be deposited in a fund for the retirement of state securities for the purpose of reducing the volume of the public debt in circulation." After affirming that plans for the privatization of STET will go forward "without any further thinking," the minister responded to a proposal from the opposition Communist Refoundation for a halt to this plan to prepare for the merger of the telecom holding company, RAI, the public radio and television broadcaster, the news agency ANSA, Olivetti, the big computer manufacturer, and IRI's Finseil. "If ideas of industry synergies among the telephone, television and information media sectors should emerge, account could be taken of this during the privatization program," said the minister. On the hot topic of social security funds, following a calculation yesterday that a Constitutional Court ruling will cost the state an additional 30 trillion lire (18.75 billion dollars), Dini said the government is committed to legislative changes, "especially in the fiscal area." These changes, he explained, will be aimed at furthering the growth of "financial intermediaries as required for the creation and development of broadly-based shareholding companies and to curb and rationalize social security spending."
