He pointed out that Article 2 deals with the term of the Russian troops' withdrawal and that the Moldovan delegation insisted on 31 December 1995 or January 1996 as the deadline for the withdrawal. "This is Moldova's official position based on the judgments of our experts," said Osmochescu. According to him, Russia insists on a period of three years, arguing that the withdrawal will have to take place through the territory of a third country. Some information media have reported that Moscow will demand four years for the withdrawal of its troops. Osmochescu also mentioned that additional issues, such as the utilization of the Tiraspol airport and compensations for repatriating the Russian officers were discussed. The Moldovan delegation considers that these compensations can be covered from the money gained through the selling of the flats and houses freed by the Russian officers, and not from the budget. The Dniester Republic's representatives in the negotiations tried to claim their share of the 14th Army's property. These claims were not accepted either by the Moldovan or by the Russian delegations. The 10th round of negotiations will be held in Chisinau in July or August this year, said Osmochescu. Nicolae Turtureanu, the representative of the Moldovan Defense Ministry, did not take part in the negotiations. Concerning this, Osmochescu said that "it is not exceptional; a large part of the Moldovan delegation had to be renewed." The head of the military delegation was Vasile Grosu, head of the Artillery Direction of the Moldovan Defense Ministry.
