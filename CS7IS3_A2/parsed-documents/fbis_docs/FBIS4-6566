According to the report, a group of about 200 Khmer Rouge forces of the 519th Division at 0500 on 21 April opened fire on a former Khmer Serei command post, which is now under control of the Cambodian Government, at Boeng Ta Kuan in Thmar Puok District, Banteay Meanchey Province, about 20 km from Ta Phraya District, Sa Kaeo Province. As a result, people's houses and markets were damaged; government soldiers were running away from the attack. The shelling continued until afternoon. About 600 Cambodian people, mainly children and the elderly, crossed the border into Thailand's Ban Khlong Phaeng, Tambon Thapsadet, Taphraya District. Thai soldiers and policemen disarmed them and gave them help on humanitarian grounds. General Atchawin Sawetserani, Burapha Task Force deputy commander, ordered that a temporary shelter be given to those people until the fighting inside Cambodia calms down. They will be pushed back once the shelling stops.
