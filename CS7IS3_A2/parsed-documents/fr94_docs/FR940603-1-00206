FR940603-1-00206 FR940603-1-00009 a. The cost of materials shall be determined by the invoices. b. The cost of labor shall be the reasonable cost thereof, but in no event shall it exceed an amount determined by calculating the ratio of the total labor costs to the total material costs in the section of the Proposal involved, and multiplying the cost of materials for the unit in question by this ratio. Section 6. Supervision and Inspection a. The Bidder shall cause the construction work on the Project to receive constant supervision by a competent superintendent (hereinafter called the ``Superintendent'') who shall be present at all times during working hours where construction is being carried on. The Bidder shall also employ, in connection with the construction of the Project, capable, experienced and reliable foremen and such skilled workmen as may be required for the various classes of work to be performed. Directions and instructions given to the Superintendent shall be binding upon the Bidder. b. The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Bidder if in the judgment of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner or the Supervisor, if any, shall have the right to require the Bidder to increase the number of its employees and to increase or change the amount or kind of tools and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner or Supervisor; but the failure of the Owner or Supervisor to give any such directions shall not relieve the Bidder of its obligations to complete the work within the time and in the manner specified in this Proposal. c. The manner of construction of the Project, and all materials and equipment used therein, shall be subject to the inspection, tests and approval of the Owner and the Administrator, and the Bidder shall furnish all information required by the Owner or by the Administrator concerning the nature or source of any materials incorporated or to be incorporated in the Project. The Owner and the Administrator shall have the right to inspect all payrolls, invoices of materials, and other data and records of the Bidder and of any subcontractor, relevant to the construction of the Project. The Bidder shall provide all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests and shall maintain an office at the site of the Project, with telephone service where obtainable and at least one office employee to whom directions and instructions of the Owner may be delivered. Delivery of such directions or instructions in writing to the employee of the Bidder at such office shall constitute delivery to the Bidder. The Bidder shall have an authorized agent accompany the Engineer when final inspection is made and, if requested by the Owner, when any other inspection is made. d. In the event that the Owner, or the Administrator, shall determine that the construction contains or may contain numerous defects, it shall be the duty of the Bidder and the Bidder's Surety or Sureties, if any, to have an inspection made by an engineer approved by the Owner and the Administrator for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent and location of such defects. e. The Engineer may recommend to the Owner that the Bidder suspend the work wholly or in part for such period or periods as the Engineer may deem necessary due to unsuitable weather or such other conditions as are considered unfavorable for the satisfactory prosecution of the work or because of the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions of the Contract: Provided, however, that the Bidder shall not suspend work pursuant to this provision without written authority from the Owner to do so. The time of completion hereinabove set forth shall be increased by the number of days of any such suspension, except when such suspension is due to the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract. In the event that work is suspended by the Bidder with the consent of the Owner, the Bidder before resuming work shall give the Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours notice thereof in writing. Section 7. Defective Materials and Workmanship a. The acceptance of any materials, equipment (except owner furnished materials) or any workmanship by the Owner or the Engineer shall not preclude the subsequent rejection thereof if such materials, equipment, or workmanship shall be found to be defective after delivery or installation, and any such materials, equipment or workmanship found defective before final acceptance of the construction shall be replaced or remedied, as the case may be, by and at the expense of the Bidder. Any such condemned material or equipment shall be immediately removed from the site of the Project by the Bidder at the Bidder's expense. The Bidder shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long as any defective materials, equipment or workmanship in respect to the Project, of which the Bidder shall have had notice, shall not have been replaced or remedied, as the case may be.
