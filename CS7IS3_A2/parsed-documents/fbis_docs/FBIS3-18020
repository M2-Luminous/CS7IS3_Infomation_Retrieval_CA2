By contrast, the Norwegian delegation stated that it was disappointed by the EU's position on farming subsidies and regretted that the Twelve were unable to reach a common position on the thorny question of fishing, an essential economic resource for Norway. "We have achieved major progress on the question of capital movements, secondary residences, and fishing, for which we have obtained a transitional period equal to that granted to Spain and Portugal," stated Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto. On the other hand, invoking the extremely harsh climatic conditions in Finland, the minister had asked the Twelve that special arrangements in the matter of farm subsidies be extended to Finnish agriculture as a whole, and not limited to farms located beyond the 62d parallel. He declared, however, he was satisfied by the Union's proposal to create an "objective 6" allowing sparsely populated areas to benefit from Community regional aid. The Norwegians were much less enthusiastic. Trade and Maritime Transportation Minister Grete Knudsen stuck to her demand that the country's four Nordic regions benefit from structural fund "objective 1," which is aimed in principle at regions with a GDP below 75 percent of the Community average. It was not possible to discuss this question on Tuesday, but will undoubtedly be returned to the negotiating table when talks resume in Brussels on Saturday for negotiations "to the finish." The Greek presidency still aims to conclude the negotiations by the scheduled 1 March deadline. The fishing question also poses major problems. The Twelve have not yet been able to adopt a common position on questions of access to fishery product resources and markets. Spain claims access to fish stocks in Norwegian waters, and France demands guaranteed market access for eight sensitive categories of fish, notably salmon, mackerel, herring, and shrimp. EU ministers will meet on Friday evening in order to try to arrive at a common position allowing them to negotiate on this sensitive subject with Norway on Saturday. Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, who is presiding over the negotiations, stated he was "much more optimistic than a few days ago" on the chances of concluding negotiations by the date set.
