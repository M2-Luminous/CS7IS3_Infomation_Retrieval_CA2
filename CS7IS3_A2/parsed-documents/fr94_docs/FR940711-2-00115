Purpose. To transmit guidance on the Secretary's required performance measures and the Secretary's implementing instructions for performance standards for Program Years (PY's) 1994 and 1995 (July 1, 1994&hyph;June 30, 1995; July 1, 1995&hyph;June 30, 1996). 2. Background. Sec. 106 of JTPA, as amended, directs the Secretary to establish performance standards for adult, youth, and dislocated worker programs. These standards may be updated every two years based on the most recent JTPA program experience, as well as program emphases and goals established by the Department of Labor. The Secretary also issues instructions for implementing standards and parameter criteria for States to follow in adjusting the Secretary's standards for service delivery areas (SDAs) and substate areas (SSAs). The Job Training Reform Amendments (JTRA) of 1992 mandated significant changes in the design and operation of local job training programs, as well as the criteria used to assess their performance. Revised Section 106 requires that performance standards for Title II&hyph;A, Title II&hyph;C, Section 204(d) and Title III programs measure the number of job placements that provide a minimum of 20 hours of work per week, and that programs be rewarded based on high performance, increased service to the ``hard-to-serve,'' and quality job placements that are both high-paying and offer employer-assisted benefits. Incentive and sanction policies are to be structured around more explicit criteria, and performance standards failure is now federally defined to ensure greater uniformity in assessing underperformance nationwide. As a result of the JTPA amendments, section 204(d) now mandates performance measures for the older worker program. To assist the Department in responding to the substantive changes required in the section 106 amendments, a Technical Workgroup was convened in Washington, DC, in mid-July 1993. The workgroup had representatives from State and local JTPA programs; public interest groups, including the Partnership for Training and Employment Careers; the U.S. Conference of Mayors; the National Association of Counties; the National Governors' Association; and the National Council on the Aging; and staff from the Department of Labor (DOL) Office of the Inspector General. This Guidance Letter incorporates, to a large extent, the workgroup's findings. 3. Performance Management Goals for PY's 1994&hyph;1995. Departmental goals, initially established for PY 1990 in anticipation of the amendments, remain unchanged and are as follows:
