"We can welcome this agreement only if it is not aimed against Serbs. Only if it leads us to peace and not war," he said following a meeting here with Vladimir Shumeyko, the chairman of the upper house of Russia's parliament, the Federation Council. He said the United States was trying to take over the role of the United Nations in the peace process by brokering the agreement Tuesday under which Bosnia's Moslems and Croats would form a federation on territory they control in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He charged that Washington was "biased in favor of the Moslems" and voiced concern that the United States was "monopolising" the process. "We would like to see America unbiased, impartial and then we would accept one power to mediate those talks. But I don't think that the United Nations should be abandoned and let one power arbitrate," he said. Karadzic, who agreed to Russian requests Tuesday to open Tuzla airport in northern Bosnia to humanitarian flights as long as this was under Russian supervision, also said he told Shumeyko, whose chamber is empowered to authorise the deployment of Russian troops abroad, that he was ready to pull back on territorial gains made in the 23-month war. "We are ready to give back, to roll back, a big amount of territory. (...) We are ready for compromises and we want Russia to support us in compromises provided we protect basic Serbian national interests," he stated. Karadzic called for "Bosnia's new borders" to be "guaranteed by an international agreement at the highest level" and cited a proposal by President Boris Yeltsin to hold a five-nation summit as an initiative that could lead to such a treaty.
