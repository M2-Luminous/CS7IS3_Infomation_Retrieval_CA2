U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff, in separate meetings with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda, also shared the view with Japan that China's role is important in solving the problem, according to the officials. During a 15-minute meeting, Tarnoff and Kakizawa agreed on the need to seek China's agreement to solve the issue diplomatically, they said. In a subsequent meeting, Tarnoff and Fukuda agreed to continue to work toward a peaceful solution while seeking international coordination. They reaffirmed an accord reached among Tokyo, Seoul and Washington last weekend that the U.N. Security Council should "urgently" consider action against North Korea for its refusal to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), they said. Tarnoff told Fukuda that the visit to North Korea by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is in response to an invitation by Pyongyang and that he will be making the trip as a private citizen. He did not say whether the U.S. Government is asking Carter to deliver a message to Pyongyang, they said. Tarnoff arrived in Japan on Thursday for talks with Japanese officials on political and security matters. He is to leave Tokyo for Seoul on Friday evening. In the nearly two-hours of talks followed by a luncheon meeting, Tarnoff and Fukuda discussed a wide range of international topics, including Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia, China and Haiti, the officials said. While pointing out that it is too early to predict Washington's future relations with China after extending the most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status, Tarnoff said the U.S. wants to promote ties with China. He voiced U.S. support for Japan's stance in seeking normalization of ties with Russia based on the Tokyo declaration adopted when Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited Japan last October, they said. Turning to Vietnam, Fukuda welcomed the improvement of ties between Washington and Hanoi.
