Speaking at his weekly news conference, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said that Turkey has been supplying the region with 20 megawatts of power by using the lines between Silopi and Zakho. He recalled that the Iraqi Administration has not been able to supply the Province of Dahuk with power since last August. We have taken this step to temporarily solve the problem confronting the Iraqi people, he said. Ataman stressed that this aid should be assessed within the framework of the humanitarian aid Turkey extends to Iraq. It is important, he said, for the Iraqi Government to recreate the conditions whereby it can supply power to the region. According to information supplied by the Foreign Ministry spokesman, the Turkish Red Crescent extended a total of 7,098 tonnes of food to 1,007,955 persons in Dahuk, Irbil, and Sulaymaniyah during the past six months.
