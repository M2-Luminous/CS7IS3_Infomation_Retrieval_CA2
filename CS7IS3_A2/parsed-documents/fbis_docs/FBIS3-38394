The AUGSBURGER ALLGEMEINE reports (in its Wednesday [2 February] edition) that among other things, DM220 million are to be saved in the purchase and development of arms equipment. The Defense Ministry wants to save DM60 million by provisionally leaving the army officer training college in Hannover instead of moving it to Dresden, as planned. [passage omitted] The paper also said the ministry hopes to save around DM235 million by cutting personnel levels. For example, some 1,500 civilian vacancies will not be filled and the number of soldiers serving for a fixed period will be reduced by 400 to 213,800.
