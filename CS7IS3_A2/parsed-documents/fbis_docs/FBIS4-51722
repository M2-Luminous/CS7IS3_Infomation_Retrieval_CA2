Since the growing incidence of unrest is occuring at a time of rising political consciousness among Indonesians, the authorities need to manage the underlying problems quickly and effectively in order to safeguard stability. As the rioting in Medan has shown, large public demonstrations can degenerate easily into violence that can cause instability, as has happened in the past. It also shows that much needs to be done to improve and stabilise labour-management relations. One issue is the degree of compliance by employers with the new minimum wage rate set by the government. Cooperation by management has not been forthcoming. Why else would the Supreme Court urge judges to punish errant employers with prison sentences? Indeed, President Suharto had asked employers to go beyond implementing the minimum rate in improving the working conditions of employees. Then there are questions about the effectiveness of the state-sponsored All-Indonesian Workers Union (SPSI) in representing the interest of workers. For example, a few months ago, the Indonesian armed forces chief, General Feisal Tanjung, drew attention to their plight, saying that SPSI had failed to function as a labour union because many of its senior officials were serving the interests of management instead of workers. But, it must be said, the Indonesian Labour Welfare Union (SBSI), the country's largest independent trade union which is not officially recognized was pushing too hard on workers' right. The government had already begun to focus its attention on that issue. It raised the minimum wage by 26 percent for workers in and around Jakarta and promised to review the situation at a later date. It also revoked the decree introduced some years ago, that allowed employers to ask the military to intervene to end strikes. Similarly, last September, the government undertook to restructure SPSI in order to make it less centralised and, thus, more responsive to the views of its constituent sectoral unions. Indonesia cannot afford irresponsible behaviour by labour or management. The SBSI's demand for almost doubling the minimum wage is excessive. Acceding to it would endanger economic growth and, thus, the country's ability to generate enough jobs to stem rising unemployment. According to Manpower Minister Abdul Latief, 38 percent of Indonesia's workforce of 81 million are without work or are under-employed. Even if the current growth rate of around 6 percent is sustained, joblessness would grow by 2 percent annually. Particularly troubling is high unemployment among university graduates. Only 30 to 40 percent of them are expected to be absorbed in the coming years. Raising wages to an unrealistic level, especially when labour productivity is low, will lead to more unemployment because it will make the country less attractive to overseas investors, who can put in their money in other countries such as China, Vietnam and India, where labour is plentiful and cheap. This has already begun to happen. Foreign investment in Indonesia dropped by 22 percent last year. Investments are also needed to contain growth of its external debt that has reached U.S.$90 million. The issue of workers' rights has surfaced at a delicate time, when the country is in the throes of social change, while it faces new economic challenges. A firm hand is needed to stamp out trouble-makers, and to deter those looking for trouble. A more sophisticated and responsive machinery is needed to manage the delicate labour-management relations. However the authorities respond to these challenges, the Medan riots should be an eye-opener to all sides.
