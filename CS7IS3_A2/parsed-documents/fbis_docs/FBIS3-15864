The Estonian Environment Minister Andres Tarand says that experts are ready for this. It is believed that the dismantling of the fuel rods will take three months. Tarand suspects, however, that Russia may start slowing down the dismantling of the nuclear reactors. Tarand says that because of difficulties that have emerged in the negotiations between Estonia and Russia, Russia may think of some pretexts to delay the start of the work.
