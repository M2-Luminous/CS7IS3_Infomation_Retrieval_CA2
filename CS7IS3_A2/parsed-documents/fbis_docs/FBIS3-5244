Inter-bank foreign exchange transactions grew as much as 136 percent last year and the role of Korean banks in these deals has strengthened greatly, the Finance Ministry said Monday. Foreign exchange transactions were worth 587.8 billion U.S. dollars last year, up 39.8 percent from 420.4 billion dollars in 1992. Trade volume, which was 332.2 billion dollars in 1990, grew 9.1 percent to 352.5 billion dollars in 1991 and 19.3 percent to 420.4 billion dollars in 1992, but last year's two-digit rise was chiefly attributed to the foreign exchange liberalization measures initiated from 1993, Ministry officials said. Daily inter-bank trading averaged 1,172 million dollars last year, up 135.8 percent from 497 million dollars a year earlier. Daily volume totaled 1,859 million dollars in January and 2,134 million dollars last month. Spot transactions that stood at 344 million dollars a day in 1992 expanded 71.5 percent last year to 591 million dollars while forward trading surged 279.7 percent to 581 million dollars from 153 million dollars. Forward exchange transactions that require underlying documents kept growing this year to total 1,013 million dollars in January, exceeding 846 million dollars in spot dealings. Forward trading reached 1,514 million dollars in February, compared with 1,082 million dollars in spot deals, with the preference for futures reflecting the Korean foreign exchange market's further advancement, officials said. In addition, local banks accounted for 63.2 percent of inter-bank transactions last year, up from 51.7 percent in 1992. Under a three-phase financial liberalization plan that took effect last October, the daily fluctuation band of the inter-bank foreign exchange rate was widened and underlying document requirements for forward contracts relaxed.
