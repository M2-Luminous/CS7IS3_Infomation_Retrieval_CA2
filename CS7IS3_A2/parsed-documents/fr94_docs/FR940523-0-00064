FR940523-0-00064 FR940523-0-00014 The term ``written authorization'' means a written statement from either the NRC or an Agreement State that a licensee has performed in the past, or is authorized to perform in the future, a remedial action that is necessary to comply with the requirements of UMTRCA, or where appropriate with applicable Agreement State requirements. B. Subpart B_Reimbursement Criteria 1. Section 765.10␣Eligibility for Reimbursement Section 765.10 outlines the basic eligibility requirements governing reimbursement. In particular, as required by section 1001 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a), §765.10 specifies that licensees shall be eligible for reimbursement of certain costs of remedial action, subject to the procedures and limitations specified in this rule. Section 765.10(a) of the rule provides that costs of remedial action attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States are reimbursable. Section 765.10(b) states that prior to reimbursement, the Department must determine the number of total dry short tons of byproduct material present at the site on October 24, 1992 and Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material. This section provides that these determinations are subject to the appeals procedures specified in the rule. Provisions are made concerning reimbursement in the event of an appeal. 2. Section 765.11␣Reimbursable Costs Section 765.11 defines the requirements that a licensee must meet to be reimbursed for costs of remedial action at its active uranium or thorium processing site. Reimbursable costs of remedial action must be incurred prior to December 31, 2002, or be in accordance with a plan for subsequent remedial action approved by the Department. These costs of remedial action shall be reimbursed only if supported by reasonable documentation and approved by the Department in accordance with this rule. This documentation must demonstrate that the costs of remedial action incurred by a licensee are necessary to comply with applicable requirements of UMTRCA, or, where appropriate, with requirements established by an Agreement State. These requirements are contained in a reclamation plan, or other written authorization, issued or approved by NRC or an Agreement State, for work performed prior to or after enactment of UMTRCA. In addition, costs of remedial action are reimbursable only if the Department determines that they are attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States and present at the site on October 24, 1992. These costs are equal to the total costs of remedial action at a site multiplied by the Federal reimbursement ratio established for the site, and approved by the Department for reimbursement. Section 765.11 limits the amount of reimbursement paid to any one licensee of an active uranium processing site to an amount not to exceed $5.50, as adjusted for inflation, multiplied by the number of Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material. Total reimbursement in the aggregate of uranium site licensees is limited to $270 million, as adjusted for inflation. Reimbursement of costs of remedial action at the eligible thorium processing site may only be made for costs incurred for offsite disposal, and is limited to $40 million, as adjusted for inflation. 3. Section 765.12␣Inflation Index Adjustment Procedures Title X directs the Department to determine an appropriate inflation index by which to increase annually (1) The $5.50 per dry short ton of byproduct material limit on reimbursement to individual uranium site licensees, (2) the amount of $270 million authorized for payment to active uranium processing site licensees, (3) the amount of $40 million authorized for payment to the active thorium processing site licensee, and (4) the aggregate amount of $310 million authorized for payment to all licensees by Title X. As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, the Department intends to use the Consumer Price Index-Urban (CPI&hyph;U) as the appropriate inflation index for these adjustments. Section 765.12 of the rule provides that the ␣␣ CPI&hyph;U will be used to adjust these amounts annually beginning in 1994, to account for inflation that occurred in the previous calendar year. C. Subpart C_Procedures for Filing and Processing Reimbursement Requests Subpart C establishes the procedures for preparing and processing reimbursement claims. These procedures are designed to ensure that all information the Department needs to review a claim is made available to the Department, that claims are evaluated on a consistent basis, and that claims are processed in an efficient and equitable manner. 1. Section 765.20␣Reimbursement Request Filing Procedures Section 765.20 of the rule establishes the filing procedures, content, and format that a licensee must follow when submitting a claim for reimbursement. Each claim for reimbursement of remedial action costs must be supported by reasonable documentation. A copy of the licensee's approved reclamation plan or other written authorization from NRC or an Agreement State must be submitted with the initial claim. Any revisions to this plan or authorization by NRC or an Agreement State must be submitted with the next claim prepared following approval of the revision. Each claim must provide a summary of all costs of remedial action for which reimbursement is claimed. The summary of costs must identify the pre- and post-UMTRCA costs associated with each major activity or requirement established by the site's reclamation plan or other written authorization. The claim for reimbursement must also include a summary of the documentation available to support the claim. All summary documentation used in support of a claim must be cross-referenced to the relevant page and activity of the licensee's reclamation plan or other written authorization for pre- and post-UMTRCA costs. All documentation used in support of a claim must be made accessible to the Department, and the documentation should demonstrate that each cost for which reimbursement is claimed was incurred for a pre- or post-UMTRCA specific activity included in a reclamation plan or other written authorization, approved by NRC or an Agreement State. Where available, invoices, payroll records, receipts, and other documents should be used by the licensee to support claims for reimbursement. The rule requires licensees to utilize documents that were prepared contemporaneous to the time the cost which they support was incurred, whenever these documents are available. Documents prepared substantially after the cost was incurred will be considered by the Department in reviewing claims if that documentation is the only means available to document costs for which reimbursement is sought. The Department may audit, or require a licensee to audit, any documentation used to support a claim on a case-by-case basis and will exercise its discretion in determining the weight to accord to various supporting documents. 2. Section 765.21␣Processing Reimbursement Requests Section 765.21 outlines the procedures to be followed by the Department in processing each claim for reimbursement.
