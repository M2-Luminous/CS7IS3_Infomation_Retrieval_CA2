KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an article on this subject, which is entitled "Forecasts Not Coming True: Russia is not Flourishing, but Neither has it Slided Down into the Abyss." The tactical and even strategic importance of this day in the struggle of the new centre with the old one, that of the Soviet Union, cannot be overestimated, the newspaper writes. "Against the background of the more and more obvious weakening of the Gorbachev administration the idea of sovereignty as a cure-all, as about the only hope for the revival, was gaining popularity and support ... It has been repeated too often, but it is a fact that Russia was virtually restored from ashes on more than one occasion after far more serious upheavals. So, the hope is still here." The newspaper sets forth President Yeltsin's speech at the Friday press conference, devoted to Russia's Independence Day. The article is entitled "President Optimistic About the Future." ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI frontpages the statement saying that to ponder over this historic date means, in the first place, "to ponder over the importance of this country. Even in the most difficult of times Russians continue to think about the role played by their country in the world. As a rule, such thoughts develop into ambitious projects and undertakings, which shake the foundations of this (and not only this) country and, unfortunately, do not always bring the desired results. Voices can be heard more and more often, which warn the authorities against taking hasty 'ambitious' decision, no matter how attractive they may look ..." The newspaper emphasizes the words of Sergey Filatov, chief of staff of President Yeltsin's Administration, that the coming anniversary confirms the fact that "by gaining independence, the Russian Federation has been preserved as an integrated state and continues to be consolidated." TRUD frontpages a report about President Yeltsin's press conference under the headline "A New Political Reality has Taken Shape in the Country." The newspaper quotes the president's answer to the question of a TRUD correspondent about his assessment of propsects of the establishment of social democracy in Russia. Yeltsin's said: "I think there is a basis in Russia for the development of social democracy. We shall have a true social democratic party or movement." KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA emphasizes Yeltsin's words that "I will not surrender Chernomyrdin, even to KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA." The newspaper points out that Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays obviously lost the battle to Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and was publicly rebuked by the president, who asked First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets to tell Chubays to keep away from Moscow's problems." SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA and PRAVDA strongly criticise Yeltsin's performance on the post of the president. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA carries excerpts from a manuscript of Leonid Velikodny, former air force pilot, who describes the team of the authors of perestroyka as "amateurs and saboteurs." PRAVDA publishes an article on the same subject, stressing that, in its opinion, the future of President Yeltsin is rather bleak. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries a report about Yeltsin's press conference under the headline "On the Eve of the Third Anniversary of his Presidency, Yeltsin Announces All-Out Advance of the Economic Reform, but Puts Luzhkov in Charge of Privatization in Moscow." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries as well an interview with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, which deals with his plan of creating an Euroasian union. According to Nazarbayev, "Kazakhstan should never plan anything detrimental to Russia, and it never will. This does not meet its strategic and historic interests. It is in line with Kazakhstan's interest to be on friendly terms with Russia, to be close to it and confident of each other's goodwill. This is the strategic goal." Jan Eliasson, head of the CSCE Minsk Group for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, said in an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA that he welcomes "Russia's energetic effort aimed at achieving ceasefire." "Russia's role in the region is indisputable, and we should take advantage of its knowledge and experience for settling the conflict," he said. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publishes an interview with Sergey Shakhray. He believes that federalism today is the only way to preserve a stable political regime and the unity of the state.
