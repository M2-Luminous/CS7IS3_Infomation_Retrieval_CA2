This was announced by Ye Qing, vice-minister of the State Planning Commission, here on Tuesday [12 April]. He was addressing 500 American business leaders attending the China-U.S. Trade and Investment Conference, organized by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec). The plan envisions an average 9 percent annual growth rate for the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the 1990s. And GDP growth will continue to be on the fast track through the first decade of the next century. According to the plan, China will build 1,000 kilometres of new railways and 3,500 to 4,000 kilometres of highways each year in the future. Also, about 14 million new lines for digital phones will be needed each year to expand phone service. Ye said China will augment its handling capacity in ports by 300 million to 400 million tons over the next 15 years. The ports will mainly handle oil and other cargo. A number of large open-pit coal mines will be built to increase the country's annual coal production output by 30 million to 35 million tons each year. And the nation's steel output is expected to surpass 100 million tons by 2000. To achieve that goal, China has to renovate its existing 10 major steel works, while setting up some new manufacturing bases. Ye said China is gradually opening its onshore oilfields to foreign explorers and developers. The offshore oilfields have already been opened. Analysts said that China is picking up momentum in developing its onshore oil in the country's vast West to offset the dwindling output of the old fields in the Northeast and East. By 2010, the country's oil-refining capacity is expected to be almost double the 1993 level of 160 million tons. Ye revealed that China will also give priority to developing the machinery, automotive, petrochemical and construction industries. In the machinery sector, Ye said priority will be given to developing basic components, power generation equipment, electronic communication systems, computers and aircraft for major and spur flights. "The market for automobiles will be huge," Ye added, noting that the government's strategy is to enable ordinary families to own cars in the coming years.
