Experts thought that apart from the normal courtesy, Raphel would get nothing more from Indian officials. They were also of the view that the majority of political parties would display their wrath against her. As a matter of fact, the reaction to her visit was quite different. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao did not meet Raphel. There is a rumor that Ms. Raphel is angry with the Indian Government for not giving her the opportunity to meet with the prime minister during her stay in New Delhi, despite several attempts to do so. Rao's close aides are very conscious about not giving any foreigner reason to criticize India's traditional hospitality. Many of the prime minister's administrative staff and his political colleagues held cordial meetings with Raphel. Tea and dinner parties were arranged for Raphel, during which she held talks with several prominent personalities. Home Minister Chavan, who is a bitter critic of the Clinton administration's Kashmir policy, talked with Robin Raphel for about an hour. An Indian official of Raphel's rank would hardly get the opportunity to meet officials in Washington equivalent to those Raphel was able to meet in New Delhi. Despite this, the female diplomat was accorded a very cordial reception in the Indian capital. What is the reason for this cordiality? Our weakness toward the white-skinned people is perhaps the main reason behind this attitude. It is also due to the enthusiasm of some of our bureaucrats and ministers who want to get on the Americans' good side. During her visit, both sides were especially cautious. Raphel did not make any straightforward comments, which is quite contrary to her nature. She was very careful about her utterances and thoughtfully considered her words before making any statements. This American lady emulated the style adopted by diplomats in the past in dealing with such situations. For the time being, Raphel has deviated from the style being followed by the new and inexperienced officials of the Clinton administration. Perhaps Raphel changed her approach because she is the first pawn the U.S. President has sent to India. Mr. Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state and the second pawn, is due in India in the first week of April. It would be foolish for New Delhi to seek consolation in the sweet words Raphel uttered during her visit. It would be wrong to deduce from Raphel's visit that there has been some change in the U.S. administration's policy toward India centering on Kashmir and the human rights issue. Similarly, it would also be wrong to assume that the U.S. efforts to sell F-16's to Pakistan by amending the Pressler Amendment have been stalled by this visit. It may be mentioned that the Indian Government was also very careful during Robin Raphel's visit, as it does not want to offend the U.S. Government unnecessarily. New Delhi adopted this posture keeping in mind Narasimha Rao's forthcoming visit to Washington. India does not believe that a dramatic improvement is possible in the relationship between Delhi and Washington at present, nor does it believe it is possible for the United States to overcome its weakness for Pakistan. For these reasons, Stephen Solarz is not willing to become the U.S. ambassador to India. An intelligent man like Solarz could not fail to realize that he will become powerless once he arrives in New Delhi. Although a marked improvement in political relations between the two countries would be difficult, it is possible to increase U.S. economic assistance to India. It is not difficult to realize that this is needed. Despite his apparent reluctance, Prime Minister Rao is eager to visit the United States. Rao and his advisers are encouraged by the success of his recent trip to Britain. They believe that India will be able to secure a lot of facilities from the United States if Rao is able to hold direct talks with President Clinton. It is unwise to think that India will be able to get additional benefits from the United States even if it does not respond to the U.S. Government's nuclear program for South Asia. Definite hints in this regard may be given during Strobe Talbott's visit. It would be wrong to think that Robin Raphel left a lot behind for India apart from her mouthful of laughter. It is necessary to see and observe what she says in Pakistan after she leaves India.
