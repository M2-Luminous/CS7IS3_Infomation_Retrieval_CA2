In this speech, He Zhiqiang recalled the remarkable achievements scored on all fronts in reform and opening up in our province over the past 15 years. He emphasized that to achieve the strategic second-step goal under the new situation, we must pay great attention to the party's propaganda and ideological work; constantly raise the level of ethics and political consciousness of the masses of people of various nationalities; and form a powerful ideological propelling force and a spiritual force of unity among the people in the course of reform, opening up, and modernization. It is not only party committees that should grasp propaganda and ideological work, but governments as well. It is not only propaganda departments that should grasp propaganda and ideological work, but economic departments, as well. The leadership and the rank and file, and various trades and professions should make concerted efforts to carry out work in this regard. Only in this way will a new situation emerge in propaganda and ideological work. Propaganda and ideological work should focus closely on the main theme of reform, development, and stability; take economic construction as the center; and uphold unity, stability, and promotion. It is necessary to more widely publicize the study of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; by publicizing theories on the socialist market economy, to enable the cadres and the people to establish a sense of the socialist market economy and concentrate their attention on the four modernizations so that the economy will grow further; and to lay a foundation for social progress and social stability. Propaganda and ideological work should regard as its objective the training of four have's new people, should uphold the standard of three beneficial's, should have clearer targets, and should encourage and carry forward the pioneering spirit. Through propaganda and education, propaganda and ideological work should integrate new concepts that are in line with the market economy with traditional fine values of the Chinese nation, and should develop the spirit of hard work and selfless dedication so that the dynamic role of the pioneering spirit in the new period can be brought into full play in the practice of reform and construction. Propaganda and ideological work should energetically explore new ways and new methods; improve operational mechanisms; develop various carriers; and make use of modern transmitting devices so that propaganda and ideological work can change from something invisible into something visible, thus increasing its impact and effectiveness. It should fully arouse the enthusiasm of cadres, workers, and staff members concerning the promotion of progress and the development of various trades, professions, and undertakings, Governor He Zhiqiang said in conclusion.
