The meeting is discussing aspects of the issues to be analyzed by the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] session, the current situation of the harvest, and May Day activities. The reports read in the meeting make evident the willingness of the workers to again pick up the analysis of the problems brought up at the workers assemblies and continue to monitor closely indexes such as profitability, costs, and use of resources. Likewise, it was announced that a process of assemblies for economic efficiency will begin on 15 May. Positive results can already be seen in this regard if we keep in mind that there is a significant drop in absenteeism and issuance of medical certificates. This means -- a participant stressed -- that our workers have internalized the issue. There was a special briefing by Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres who said that the sugarcane harvest has been significantly affected by the rains and that this requires a greater effort by the manual cutting brigades, as well as the combines teams. Torres added that earnest mobilized workers, who are now tackling sugarcane weeding and planting efforts, are joining in this struggle.
