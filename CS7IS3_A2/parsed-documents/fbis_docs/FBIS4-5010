Additionally, he appealed for the reform of financial services through the promotion of competitive actions by commenting, "One direction conceivable for the reform of financial systems would be maximum competition and creativity as well as checks and balances emanating from market forces." In the beginning of his speech, he pointed out, "Strengthening of the financial systems are an important issue from the standpoint of Japanese economic growth." He expressed viewpoints as the Governor of the BOJ after citing as objectives of the reform of the financial system 1) promotion of competition, 2) controls based on market forces, and 3) improvements in the financial system's infrastructure. Specifically, after saying, "As long as we treat financial services as an industry, we should encourage active innovation," he pointed out that innovative efforts were lagging by adding, "In contrast to the automotive and electrical equipment industries, financial innovation has consisted almost entirely of imported concepts." As reasons, he cited the pervasive tendency to imitate each other and the lack of competitive ideas and stressed the need for a change in perception by stating, "The competitive strength of Japanese financial institutions will weaken unless they alter their practices so that they challenge themselves to provide new types of services and benefit from successful ventures or face the penalties imposed by unsuccessful ventures." He then explained that in order to avoid a repeat of the bubble economy, we must preclude a drop in managements' morale by saying, "We have room for strengthening control through market functions such as supervision of managers based on changing stock prices in the securities markets and checks exercised by ordinary creditors and depositors." Finally, in terms of appraising risks and returns for management as a whole, he stated, "There is a need to improve the infrastructure in the areas of accounting systems and information disclosure rules," and stressed the importance of improving the infrastructure for financial transactions by pointing out "the importance of improving settlement systems."
