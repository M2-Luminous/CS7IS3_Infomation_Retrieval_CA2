One of two surface-to-surface missiles was intercepted by south Yemeni anti-aircraft fire but the other exploded near a mosque in the northern suburb of al-Shaykh 'Uthman, officials said. Sixteen worshipers were hurt inside the mosque when the missile struck during dawn prayers. The raid left pools of blood on the carpets and the courtyard, witnesses said. Five people were injured in nearby dwellings. Hundreds later gathered in the area to denounce "the killer regime" of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner. The missile attack came just hours after the United Nations Security Council had adopted a resolution calling for a ceasefire in the civil war in Yemen, which erupted May 5. Heavy artillery duels on the war front just north of Aden were so intense Thursday morning that buildings in the city shook heavily. Southern warplanes were constantly taking off and landing at Aden Airport as they flew sorties against the northern forces of Salih, who has strongly opposed any UN "interference" in the conflict. The presidential council of the breakaway southern state led by 'Ali Salim al-Bid announced it would "unconditionally respect" the Security Council resolution and assist a fact finding mission being dispatched by the world body. There was no immediate reaction from Sanaa, where the government held a meeting to discuss the resolution. [passage omitted]
