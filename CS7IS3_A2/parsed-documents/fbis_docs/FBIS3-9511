Demirel, on an official visit in Bucharest, participated in the dinner Romanian President Ion Iliescu gave in his honor this evening. TRT correspondent Mesut Ertugay reports from Bucharest: [Begin recording] [Ertugay] Demirel, on an official visit in Bucharest, participated in the dinner Iliescu gave in his honor. During the speech he delivered at the dinner, Demirel indicated that Romania and Turkey, which share the same geography, historical neighborhood, and friendship, also share a common future. Explaining that the relations between the two countries are based on respect and security between states and love and understanding between the peoples, Demirel said that strengthening this friendship bridge will further common interests. Demirel said extremist movements and aggressive nationalism are threatening state structures and causing wars in various parts of the world these days. Noting that international organizations are ineffective in fighting circles which are the cause of instability, Demirel stated that regional clashes cast a shadow over agreements. Demirel stressed that under these circumstances great duties befall Turkey and Romania. Demirel said: [Demirel] We cannot accept that [word indistinct] in our region be made a center for instability like in the past. The first condition for this is that all regional states respect each others' territorial integrity and avoid making the existing border issues a reason for discussion. The geographical and historical realities of the Balkans do not permit additional ruptures. [Ertugay] Recalling that the borders of the political geography in the Balkans were reshaped with the countries that emerged following Yugoslavia's dissolution, Demirel said that now the main concern should be to find a permanent solution to the human shame being lived in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Noting that the developments achieved under the leadership of the United States are very satisfactory, Demirel said that the Bosnian Serbs should also show the same political maturity as the Bosnians and the Croats. Demirel said: [Demirel] Serbia and Nagorno-Karabakh, within today's borders, should take their rightful place among the Balkan countries. We will establish our future jointly and with the voluntary contribution of all our neighbors. Solidarity will take the place of clashes in our region. [passage indistinct] [Ergutay] Iliescu, in turn, voiced Romania's concern over the clashes in the region. Iliescu stated that the clashes, the loss of lives, and the refugee drama in the former Yugoslav territories are preventing the people from having better living conditions and are adverse to democratic goals. Pointing out that Yugoslavia supports efforts toward finding a just solution to the issue, Iliescu added that they believe that a continuous security system should be established in Europe. Within this framework, Iliescu stated, they view the NATO as the sole organization which has the capability of establishing security in Europe. Indicating that Turkey and Romania have outstandingly good relations which have their roots based in history, Iliescu added that they greatly appreciate the Turkish people's readiness to share their economic and social success.
