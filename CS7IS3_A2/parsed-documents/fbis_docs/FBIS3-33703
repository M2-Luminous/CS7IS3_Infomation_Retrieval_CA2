The prime minister described his majesty the king's visit and talks in Washington as very successful. He told the News at Ten that he had also briefed the UN Sanctions Committee on Jordan's losses due to the sanctions imposed on Iraq and that the Committee had promised to cooperate with Jordan. [Begin recording] [Al-Majali] The purpose of the meeting is to meet with the committee which has been appointed by the Security Council for the sanctions on Iraq. And I gave them a paper on this to show what is the damage to the Jordan economy, especially to our factories, because Iraq is our main market for most of the industries in Jordan. And again, we explained to them how much we are affected by the inspection of the cargo in the high seas which has cost Jordan quite a lot in the last three years. They were very understanding and they were very cooperative. And, in fact, we discussed the procedures about this, that there should be a certain base as a policy for this, so we do not have to get into the routine towards this. And I met with the secretary general, as well, to exchange with him the views about the sanctions, and in the same time to discuss the peace process. [Reporter] Have you received any promises from them? [Al-Majali] I think they will be very serious in discussing all what we have put to them, and we asked that we should get contribution for the damage for our economy. And we hope that we will get it. In fact, when we were in the United States again we put the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the president about these things. And they both promised to help Jordan overcome these difficulties.
