This means that Poland has accepted formally the criteria which NATO set to the partner states (clarity of defense planning and defense budgets, democratic control over the Armed Forces, readiness to take part in peacekeeping missions), as well as the principles of military cooperation (such as training and exercises) and political cooperation (consultations in the event of security threats). The expact program of cooperation must still be negotiated. Pawlak tried to persuade his interlocutors from NATO and the European Union [EU] that, despite the cabinet change, integration with the West still remains Poland's strategic goal. "The Polish nation will not swerve from the road to West Europe which it has chosen," he stressed. Journalists' attention, however, was attracted to the fact that, while delivering his speech before the European Parliament, the prime minister omitted a sentence which was included in the text that had been circulated beforehand. The omitted sentence was as follows: "...the results of elections, held in September of last year, did not in the least affect the change in the perspective in which the government of the Polish Republic sees its relations with the Union. The highest possible quality of these relations is still the priority of Polish politics...." The Government's Press Office explained that this omission, just like other omissions in the prime minister's speech, was caused by lack of time. The prime minister pointed out in Brussels that cooperation with West Europe favorably influences the internal transformations in Poland. He is trying to advertise Partnership for Development -- an idea proposed at the meeting between leaders of the United States and the Visegrad states in Prague (on 12 January). In his speech to representatives of the 16 NATO states, Prime Minister Pawlak evaluated PFP as an opportunity to strengthen ties with NATO. This opportunity should draw us closer to Western security structures. "Poland wants to take advantage of the Partnership to maintain good cooperation also with its neighbors to the east," he added. Amadeo de Francis, deputy secretary general of NATO (who received the prime minister at NATO Headquarters since Manfred Woerner was sick) said at a press conference that PFP will enhance Poland's security. He did not rule out the possibility that NATO may provide financial aid for the partner states to facilitate their participation in the program. Waldemar Pawlak expressed his disappointment over the fact that the NATO summit (10-11 January in Brussels) did not meet the expectations related to Poland's future membership in this organization; however, he also said he was satisfied with the fact that NATO sees relations between the security of member states and the security of Central and East Europe. In his talk with European Parliament Chairman Egon Klepsch and in his speech to the deputies, the prime minister emphasized that the treaty of association with the EC, which has just come into effect, is treated by Poland as preparation for future membership in the EU. Egon Klepsch recalled, however, that the necessary conditions for admitting Poland and other East and Central European states to EU are, among others, observance of pluralist democracy and the introduction of free-market economies. The subject discussed during the meeting of Waldemar Pawlak and Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luk Dehaene was Poland's integration with West Europe. Thirty-three percent of respondents to a Public Opinion Research Center poll believe that PFP offers real chances for Poland to enter NATO; 27 percent are of the opposite opinion. The remaining people surveyed either do not know anything about this subject, or do not have an opinion either way.
