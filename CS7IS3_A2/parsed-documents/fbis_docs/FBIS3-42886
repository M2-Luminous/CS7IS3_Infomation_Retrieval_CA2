Revanche"] [No 4, Jan pp 10-13] [Text] Politics has returned to business as usual. Again it is dictated by the military-industrial complex. The retirement of Yegor Gaydar and Ella Pamfilova and then the announcement of Boris Fedorov's retirement brought an end to the alignment of forces in the country and in the power structures that had lasted approximately since May 1992. The period of doubt was in the past: Before that it had still seemed to me, as, probably, to many others as well, that even after the December elections the harmful Gaydar reforms would be continued in Russia. Harmful because they were inadequate, half-measures; although they were needed they were merely monetaristic, anti-inflationary, and not structural and not economic reforms. Now it is clear--we will not even have the harmful ones. Under the guise of social policy, in the name of the well-being of all the people, a planned economy with apportionment will be restored. Its rulers will be Viktor Chernomyrdin, Oleg Soskovets, Aleksandr Zaveryukha and....Yuriy Skokov. And the president? He has now become a figurehead. Does he have an understanding attitude toward the first deputy prime minister's decision to resign? That is, an understanding that there will be no radical economic reforms. But, after all, the president's job is to guarantee structural transformations. And if it turns out that you cannot, well, be belle of the ball, there will be others, and your lot is to become a decoration. And Gaydar will not be able to console us by saying that he does not intend to join the president's opposition, that Kozyrev will learn to outsing Zhirinovskiy, or that the West will repeat that Yeltsin still means democracy, and with all this Russia, instead of moving along the axis of time, will again revolve in the Chaadayev circle, in which there will be more Augusts and more Octobers. Why is all this so? I am trying to find an answer to this question. Grachev's Times In light of recent events, it is becoming increasingly apparent that in October 1993 the military actually took the upper hand. In this case I mean by military not only generals and colonels and not even the Army as such, but the entire military-industrial complex in alliance with the bureaucracy, although this includes the Army too, of course. Of course this has been interpreted differently--as a victory for democracy, as the elimination of obstacles on the path to reform. Recent actions of Yeltsin and the government confirm that the military, having lost a certain amount of power during Gorbachev's times, have not only regained it but have acquired even more influence over our lives than they had before. Let us begin with a symbolic episode--in Russia's history it has frequently been the case that in order to understand what was going on, the symbol almost carries more weight than that which it designates. A couple of days before the October events, Yeltsin called all the powerful ministers to a meeting. When Grachev came in late, Yeltsin pointed at his watch (many people saw this scene on television) and in response Grachev pointed at his, as if to say: "No, my watch is more accurate than yours." That seemed to be the end of the incident. What is important, however, is not whose watch was more accurate but the very fact that the military minister showed up at a meeting after the president had, and he did it intentionally: He knew that all the television channels of Russia and the world would broadcast this event. This occurred two days before 3 October, and the country's leaders, journalists, and even military units already knew something about the imminent events. Suffice it to recall Yeltsin's route: the Taman Division, then the division imeni Dzerzhinskiy. Rutskoy had probably done something too. There had been conferences and negotiations. In the situation that had developed the meeting acquired truly symbolic importance--at that very moment Grachev placed himself in a special position. But why was it that Yeltsin met with Grachev at 0400 hours on 4 October and that this meeting took place in the Ministry of Defense and not in the president's residence? And, finally: Why was it that on 3 October the authorities did not stop the thug-demonstrators from moving toward October Square, the building of the Supreme Soviet, and the television center? As cochairmen of the Democratic Russia movement, I participated directly in the organization of the movement through Moscow of demonstrations involving approximately 400,000 people. On the eve of one of them, in March 1990, Luzhkov, Murashev, and I were called in by Yanayev, Pugo, and Kryuchkov. There was a discussion about the possible consequences of gathering together such an immense mass of people and moving them through the streets of Moscow. At first they tried to persuade us to call off the procession and rally, threatening that we would be held personally responsible for the consequences. We said that we were prepared to take full responsibility, but under the condition that the events would develop according to our scenario, that is, according to the procedure for holding demonstrations approved in Moscow. If it were not violated, there would be no excesses. The route for the demonstration was agreed upon, and Ministry of Internal Affairs forces were provided for it: All side streets adjoining Sadovoye Circle were blocked by trucks loaded with sand and vehicles with water cannons, and there were cordons of soldiers. All the streets leading to the center were cut off. Under these conditions, the slightest deviation from the earmarked route was quite an impossible task. Nothing of the kind was envisioned on those October days in Moscow, although the technical capabilities for this, of course, existed. Even after Rutskoy and then Makashov as well called for storming the television center, no measures were taken, and this enabled the commandos not only to reach their goal but also to begin the attack. Why? It is possible to formulate two hypotheses. The first: Those who wanted to but could not block the movement of the commandos did not have realistic forces. They did not have the subdivisions necessary to prevent this, and all appeals on the part of the authorities to the power structures were futile. Television and radio inflamed the situation: The troops are advancing on Moscow, they have already entered Moscow, they are moving toward the center, when in fact there were no troops at all. And they did not arrive until the morning of 4 October. Could it be that the military were twisting Yeltsin's arm and forcing him to accept certain of their conditions? The second version is that the authorities themselves provoked this particular development of events and no other: They let the commandos through to the Supreme Soviet and gave them the opportunity to storm the mayor's office and Ostankino (the more so since the seizure of Ostankino did not make any difference anyway: It was possible to cut off broadcasting in a moment). Therefore, let everything develop according the "their" scenario: Rutskoy and Khasbulatov would show their putschist nature, the public would see that there was nowhere to turn, and everyone would breathe a sigh of relief and say: "Thank you, God, for putting an end to this parliament." Both of these versions are quite possible. But, judging from subsequent events, the former seems more probable. Literally the next day after the October events, Yeltsin convened the Security Council of Russia, where he raised only one question: about the new military doctrine. And this was done immediately after the events, before the fires had been put out, before the dead had been buried, as if throughout all of Russia, throughout the whole world, there were no problems that were more important. In the new military doctrine it is necessary to single out two basic provisions: recognition of the extension of Russia's interests to the entire territory of the former USSR (with exceptions regarding the Baltic republics) and Russia's right to make the first nuclear strike. How will these new provisions turn out for Russia and the rest of the world, and will they not damage the arms restriction and the international stability that have been observed recently? Yeltsin's statements about the reduction of arms by two-thirds, made during the first days of his presidency, have not been repeated recently. Instead there are photographs of the commander-in-chief with a machine gun in his hands and his assurances: No more concessions to the West. And the military order for this year will be at last year's level. This order is being filled today by more than 2,000 enterprises and 660 scientific institutes. Not a single new conversion program will be financed in 1994. To this one might add Russia's blocking of attempts by countries of Eastern and Central Europe to join NATO. I shall give one more symbolic example. During Yeltsin's official visit to Warsaw, he had a conversation with the president of Poland. To Lech Walesca's question as to whether or not Poland is a sovereign state and is, accordingly, eligible to join NATO, Yeltsin gave a positive response. Grachev, who was standing nearby, tried to intervene and correct the president, to which Yeltsin quite fairly remarked to him: "Who is president of Russia, you or I?" But after returning to Moscow, Yeltsin apparently received certain clarifications and took a negative position regarding this question, which had a harsh resonance during his visit to Brussels. Thus, the Army is already exerting an influence on foreign policy as well. The scale of military control has reached alarming dimensions. On 19 January there was a session of the Security Council of the Russian Federation at which they considered military-technical (and, consequently, also financial?) problems of the new doctrine. Boris Fedorov was not allowed to attend this meeting. The country has no budget, the Government of Russia has not been formed, but the demands of the military are already being discussed. Trench Thinking Through the efforts of the powerful party-state machine, which mobilized all means of influencing the minds and feelings of the people--the schools, literature, the press, art, science, institutions, institutes, organizations, punitive organs, the Army--three or four generations of Soviet people were duped every day, one and all. And this was not without results. How many people believed that they had achieved happiness on this earth, how many of them prayed for Stalin while sitting in prison camps? Some people even today believe that Hitler attacked the Soviet Union suddenly. As a result, a large part of the society today is still psychologically in a condition if not of war, then in any case of defense from the surrounding world. Many Russians, even those who have never fought, are still sitting in the trenches ideologically. A kind of "trench" thinking, which pervades our society from bottom to top, is exerting an immense influence on the country's life today. I am convinced that we must get over this condition. Until in Russia there are monuments, for example, to the German, Italian, French, and Romanian soldiers who died here during the war, and flowers are placed on them, we will not get well as a nation. The victory of the military is closely interwoven with the foreign political course of the authorities. The provisions of the military doctrine to the effect that Russia's interests extend to all the territory of the former USSR and the attempts to impose a particular foreign policy on all countries of the former European "socialist camp" again place millions of people in a difficult position--after all, they believed that they had escaped Moscow's control forever. Many have openly advanced the great-power ideology as one of the constituent parts of the official state policy. The present foreign political strategy of the authorities can lead (and already is leading) to severe consequences. Up until quite recently, Russia has been waging or is waging an undeclared war at many points of the former USSR which might be called imperialist. The largest problems lie in the nearby foreign countries, in the attitude of Russian authorities to the former Soviet republics. Externally, events are developing differently everywhere, but at the bottom of the problem there always lies something specific and, as a rule, concealed--Russia's interest in retaining the Black Sea coast, the large uranium mine in Tajikistan, enterprises of the military-industrial complex that are scattered everywhere, such, for example, as the aircraft plant in Tbilisi or defense enterprises of the Dniester region. But if it were only that. By Hook or By Crook There is a more and more overt desire to subordinate the former Soviet republics, to assign to them the role that was previously played by countries of the "socialist camp": to be a buffer zone between Russia and distant foreign countries. The civilized divorce did not take place: Disputes arose out of the Black Sea fleet and the Crimea, out of nuclear weapons and space objects. There was the desire, even at gigantic costs, to use economic measures to force the former republics to enter the CIS. But, as distinct from the USSR, we did not want to take any responsibility for what was going on there: neither for the carnage in Georgia nor the famine in Armenia. In order to understand the fundamentals of the "new" policy, it is necessary to answer this question: According to which indicators does the Russian Federation today determine which former Soviet republics to support and which not to? In places where attempts are made to show independence and get out of control, Russia supports "national liberation" movements under the pretext of protecting the Russian-speaking population. Sometimes the direct participation of Russian forces is camouflaged and presented to the whole world as a peace-making mission in interethnic conflicts. One can see a clear unwillingness to take the remaining divisions back to Russia. The nearby foreign countries are the source of the main threat to Russia's vital interests, as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation A. Kozyrev said at a conference of Russian ambassadors in the CIS and Baltic countries. In the minister's opinion, Russia should continue her military presence in the countries of the Commonwealth. Imperialist intentions are being manifested in many ways. We supported the structures of the Dniester Republic created through the efforts of Lukyanov as well as allied power structures in order to take the Moldovans in hand. In September 1993 there was a military parade of the armed forces of the Dniester region, which was shown on television. Who was financing the Dniester region during the military events, and who is financing it today? We know only that it was not Moldova, of which the Dniester region is a part: The Dniester authorities rejected Moldova's "services" during the conflict. Does this mean that Russia was financing them secretly? Directly, out of the budget or with "credits" of the Central Bank of Russia? Under what items are the payments made? Or are the authorities especially financing certain Russian enterprises, which then send money to Tiraspol? Is the Central Bank of Russia taking part in this? Does Gerashchenko know about this, and is he not the one who transferred the CPSU money abroad at one time? I do not think I am the only one interested in the answers to these questions. There is a similar situation in the Caucasus as well. Russia has actually been engaged in a war against Georgia, but the authorities have denied this or tried to speak with society in some kind of strange language. If one compares tiny Abkhazia, which is a part of Georgia, for example, with Tambov Oblast, the question arises: Where could the Tambov governor have gotten Su-27's, MiG-29's, modern tanks, and thousands of automatic Kalashnikovs? Where did Abkhazia get such a quantity of aircraft, tanks, and artillery? With the help of which forces did Abkhazia conduct large-scale military operations? Who financed the deliveries and the maintenance of the Abkhazian army and hundreds of volunteers from Russia? I do not want to accuse the authorities of Russia of first being on Abkhazia's side and then on the other side. We know how this war began. Shevardnadze is to blame, Ardzinba is to blame, and it is difficult to say right now which of them is more to blame. But clarifying for the society the question of Russia's role in this war is not the main thing. Should they have supported the Abkhaz against the "entrenched" Georgia in their desire for independence and self-sufficiency? They did support them. And the Abkhaz "liberated" their entire territory, but with the help of Russian troops and technical equipment. Have things gone too far? Wrath was replaced with kindness, Shevardnadze was supported and forced to enter the CIS. Why? The Azerbaijan-Armenian conflict, of course, had plenty of causes of its own, but Russia's role there was not beyond reproach either. There are many vague words about strategic objectives, but there are no official, exhaustive statements from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the government, or the president regarding this. Strategy must be comprehensible so that the society can at least determine its attitude toward it. If we say that democracy means an open society, Russia's interests must be known. They must not be concealed as they were before. But the most alarming situation today is developing in Central Asia. Here, as before, Russia is in a state of undeclared war, a war with unstated objectives. Russia is making war in Tajikistan on the side of the puppet pro-Uzbek regime, a reactionary regime that is mercilessly suppressing the very principles of free thought and democracy in Tajikistan. People calling for democratic transformations are now being forced to live outside Tajikistan, actually in emigration, in Russia, India, and other countries. And now, along with this puppet regime, the Russian authorities are taking advantage of the residuals of the Tajik opposition, the residuals of the democratic forces. Kozyrev is going to Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in order to persuade the Kyrgyz and Kazakhs to enter this conflict on Russia's side so that Russia will not be fighting alone here but to take cover under the flags of several countries, as during the time of the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. There is probably a hope of restoring the empire lying here too. It is one thing when communists at rallies demand the restoration of the USSR, and something altogether different when it is the official position and actual policy of the authorities. Our present leaders have apparently not learned anything from the experience of 10 years of war in Afghanistan. The Soviet empire collapsed because it was impossible to maintain such a large number of territories at its own expense, and attempts to reinvigorate this policy are doomed in advance to failure. [No 5, Feb pp 18-20] [Text] At moments of crisis, Russia has always chosen the road of traditionalism, abandoning attempts to become a modern society. Economy in the Western sense of this word, namely a system based on natural and harmonious development of various elements (agriculture and industry, the state and private sectors, civilian and military production) never existed even in prerevolutionary Russia. One can discuss the Russian economy more as an extremely premodern system in which the requirements of social control prevailed over strictly economic considerations (one need recall only the ups and downs of liberating the serfs), which created obstacles to the establishment of a new structure for the society. From the very beginning of the changes (the age of Peter the Great) an artificial construct, one that was not capable of self-advancement, was created. All of these structural peculiarities were not surmounted in 1917 but, on the contrary, they became stronger. The lack of balance among various constituent parts of the economy increased. Relations among subjects of the national economic complex, instead of being natural, were imposed by political will, which gave little consideration to the elementary norms of the functioning of the economic system. The Socialist Fish Unfortunately, today the gigantic supermonopoly of the state actually determines the picture of gross national production as much as ever. The central planning and distribution organs have changed their names but not their functions. The ministries and departments have changed their stripes and become branch holding companies and concerns, squashing almost all attempts at competition. The Central Bank has taken over many distribution functions. It engages in the distribution of finances at the federal level, and this is practically the same thing as distribution of resources and planning of physical volumes of production. At the regional level, distribution functions are performed by the local nomenklatura. And that is the main work of the administration as a whole in the krays, oblasts, republics, and in Moscow, including the most lucrative trade in the bureaucratic business--quotas on export deliveries. The extremely severe pressure from the "Soviet" economic leaders has nullified the economic changes made at the beginning of 1992 by the Gaydar government. They are returning to the so-called planned, cost-oriented economy. I will give an absurd but typical example from which it is possible to draw certain conclusions. E. Chernyy, chairman of the presidium of the Union of Independent Fish Industry Workers, wrote in IZVESTIYA about the fact that the former Ministry of the Fish Industry (now the Committee on Fishing of the Russian Federation) submitted to the government a regular "plan of the century." Instead of demonopolizing the branch and placing fish processing enterprises and ships in private hands (which, incidentally, requires no subsidies) and creating a multitude of competing fishing and fish processing enterprises, the committee suggests giving itself a monopoly on everything related to fishing in Russia. Moreover, it requests from the state 4 trillion rubles [R] (three-fourths of which are to be in dollars), material resources worth R700 billion and exemption from taxes, and customs fees and duties. The production cost of fish would be 10 times higher than the world price. The "effectiveness" of the branch, of course, would be socialist as before: While catching as many fish as Japan does, we maintained a fleet that was 6 (six!) times larger than Japan's in terms of tonnage. If one takes into account the fact that in addition to the Committee on Fishing we have about 400 branch department-monopolies and there is not a single one of them that does not require subsidies, and the total revenue side of Russia's budget is only R22 trillion, one can understand that to preserve the branch ministries and meet their demands will lead Russia to hyperinflation and the collapse of the national economy. On the initiative of the branch monopolists, the authorities will introduce new duties on foodstuffs and industrial goods. These measures will help neither Russian industry nor agriculture nor the consumer. They will merely eliminate competitors, expand the field for raising prices, and create cozy conditions for the talentless leaders of the monopolies: They will not have to be concerned about reducing production costs, modernizing production, changing over to new models, and so forth. Predominant in banking are pseudo-commercial banks that almost do not depend on deposits from the population or enterprises: They are still redistributing the same state finances. Among them there are still branch banks which monopolize each branch even more. The fear of competition has led to banning the activity of foreign banks. The example of the sale of gas is very typical: Ukraine is curtailing deliveries under the pretext that it is because of delayed payments, but at the same time they offer gas to Serbia, even though it would be quite unrealistic to expect payments from it--inflation there runs into the hundreds of thousands of percentage points. Again the economy is under the influence of politics. One can always hear complaints about inflation and excessive taxes, but literally all critics--from communists to "radical" democrats--remain completely silent about the causes: expenditures on the Army, the military-industrial complex, the kolkhozes, and factories that are operated at a loss which are on the shoulders of the Russian taxpayer. If every fifth able-bodied person in the country is sitting in a tank or working on manufacturing one, what kind of economic upturn can there be? They remain silent, probably, because now it is dangerous to mention the military-industrial complex and the Army. This is another effect of the psychological victory of the military. Privatization, initiative to create different nonstate forms of ownership, competition and the free market, convertibility of the ruble, open foreign economic activity (including openness for Western investments), the establishment of real commercial banks, reduction of state costs, the beginning of a new tax policy, social protection--this is a selection of measures that must be implemented in order to escape from the old type of economy and reach a new one. We need not to reduce ministry staffs, but to achieve complete elimination of all branch monopolies, beginning with Agroprom [Agro-industrial Complex] and the Ministry of Trade. During the transition period, the ministers must appoint only those who are capable of conducting legally intelligent self-elimination of the ministry and creating a competitive environment in their branch. But, as we see, events are developing in exactly the opposite direction. The Countryside--Eternal Pain and Hindrance The stumbling block of previous and current Russian reformers has been agrarian relations. The most impoverished situation exists in agriculture today. But not because of the shortage of technical equipment, fuel, or money, but because of new relations among the producer, consumer, and intermediary (state) that have developed recently. An ugly symbiosis has developed between the peasant and the kolkhoz, or, rather, the kolkhoz worker and the kolkhoz. They are all sucking off one another like parasites. The kolkhoz workers for better or worse have finally received large farmstead plots where they raise the things that are most necessary for their families (this is also partially commercial production as well). And one can only rejoice at that. But the peasant has been placed in conditions whereby he needs the kolkhoz like the air he breathes since there (and only there) is the possibility of stealing grain to feed his cattle, and for a bottle of vodka he can use the equipment to cultivate his plot. Additionally, the kolkhoz is for the peasant a kind of guarantee against unforeseen circumstances. The kolkhoz cannot get along without the peasant either: The fields must be planted, at least some of the crops must be harvested, and it is necessary to render an accounting for ruined credit, subsidies, and technical equipment. This parasitic symbiosis created by that gigantic monopoly, Agroprom, is also the main social impediment to the development of agrarian production in Russia, the introduction of the institution of private ownership of the land, and the formation of farmer-run or voluntary collective farms. Up to this point in Russia's agriculture, there have been practically no commodity-monetary relations: Instead of buying and selling products, the kolkhoz workers "turn them over," and in exchange they "receive" something. The powerful agrarian lobby in the new Duma and government will continue to demand incredible subsidies from the state. The agrarian nomenklatura has always referred to Western practice, where in fact many states grant subsidies to agriculture. But, as before, the experts on the kolkhoz system say nothing about the immense differences in political, economic, and even technological conditions between Russia and the Western countries: The Western countries subsidize each farmer individually, providing additional payment for the crop that has been raised or for reducing the planted areas. We have everything upside down: The subsidies are received not by the kolkhoz worker and not by the farmer, but by Agroprom--a structure that has no analogues in any developed country. A truly democratic power must think about how to get out of the economy, leaving the state only indirect instruments of regulation--tax, credit-financial, excise, and customs. Unfortunately, all this tells us that the powerful economic structures are still active, and they are the ones that determine the political and economic life of modern Russia. Zhirinovskiy--A Mirror of Russian Society I do not see anything surprising or unexpected in Zhirinovskiy's victory in the elections. The simplest thing to say is that communists and fascists voted for him, but the real causes of this result go much deeper. For centuries the absence of a social space outside the limits of "state interests" was compensated for in Russia by other realities--boorishness and tyranny. On the one hand there was arbitrariness, complete lawlessness, and violence, and on the other--obsequiousness, tractability, servility, and powerlessness. The main things that made it impossible for the people of Russia to break out of the totalitarian system--whether it be before or after 1917--was the unformed nature of the civilian society in Russia, the state monopoly over any action that had been established here, and the absence of any kind of socium at all beyond the all-pervasive state. The vicious circle outlined even by Chernyshevskiy, the "almighty state--subjects deprived of initiative," guaranteed the system's constant self-perpetuation. Even the reforms did not break the circle but merely modernized the system in order to preserve and strengthen the regime. With respect to the spiritual sphere, socialist experimentation led to a redoubling of the lack of freedom. The social consciousness of prerevolutionary Russia was mainly traditionalist and mythological. Irrational (heathen and orthodox) ideas, symbols, and ideals prevailed in it. It is also possible to discuss the lack of freedom here in the sense that the people lived and acted guided mainly not by reason but by prejudices. Their freedom was fettered by a system of all kinds of mental restrictions and habits. After 1917 it was as though an additional lack of freedom was superimposed on top of this lack of freedom--also in the form of a framework or system of restrictive principles, but this time Marxist-Leninist ones that were supposed to be rationalistic. The redoubled lack of freedom is the most appreciable result of totalitarianism in the spiritual life of modern Russia. It is the main reason for the distorted perception of the world as well as for the fact that Russia has not yet found an identity. Zhirinovskiy's victory is mainly the non-success of Yeltsin's reforms and, on the other hand, a quality of Russian society, a condition of its mentality. The results of the elections were only a mirror in which Russians had to look in order to see themselves. I am not inclined to dramatize Zhirinovskiy's success and see it almost as the onset of the brown plague. It is dangerous, of course, but not so much as to make a tragedy of it. And for the authorities it is a kind of lottery win. When something did not go right in Gorbachev's age, it took Ligachev to present it as the embodiment of reaction and the cause of failure. If Ligachev had not done it, Gorbachev would have played this role himself. If Gorbachev had not done it, then the Supreme Soviet of Russia would have appeared immediately: It turns out that all the difficulties lie in conservatism and the reactionary nature of the communist deputies and Khasbulatov-Rutskoy. If they had not been there, it would have been necessary to replace them, and perhaps Zhirinovskiy can do this: For the near future he will do as someone else to blame for the failures of reform. When they say that Stalin destroyed the people, one must remember that the Stalinist regime was also made up of the same people who were parties to the crimes of this regime. It is impossible to draw a line, to say these are the victims and these are the hangmen. There is both a hangman and a victim in each of us. When an understanding of this reaches people, when we stop pointing at Gaydar or Zhirinovskiy, when we want to really see the difficulties of our life, only then will we enter on a normal path. But for now, give us the next person to blame. The Essence and Form of the New Regime The process of renewal is taking place extremely slowly, and Russia's current condition can be characterized by a proverb: "I would like to go to heaven, but my sins keep me out." That which until recently kept us in a premodern condition continues to be a reality even today. At crisis moments in history, Russia has always chosen the path of traditionalism, abandoning attempts to become a modern society. Today we are again faced with a choice: And again we are trying to overcome traditionalism, archaism, and collectivism, which were excellently preserved during the Soviet period. In the summer of 1992, one can pinpoint the beginning of the departure from the course toward liberal reforms, toward resolute and specific advancement. At that time, Gaydar began to pursue an anti-Gaydar course. At the same time Yeltsin and the government were experiencing stronger and stronger pressure from the military-industrial complex, the Army, the Russian bureaucracy, and the agro-industrial nomenklatura, including kolkhoz chairmen and sovkhoz directors. Today there is practically nothing left of reformism except rhetoric. Politics has become duplicitous, hidden, and frequently dishonest. Last year was a year of decline of the reformist course which Gaydar brought with him. The result of this policy is an increase in the distance between the authorities and society, the loss of social reference points, predatory, unconcealed enrichment of the nomenklatura through "converting" power and connections into wealth, and ultimately loss for Zhirinovskiy. The essence of what will take place in Russia in the near future will be the strengthening of the dominance of the military-industrial complex in alliance with the neo-Soviet nomenklatura and deceived democratic forces. The form in which it will begin to be realized will be an authoritarian regime: Today headed by Yeltsin, tomorrow, possibly, by someone else. This is not the first time that reforms are being constrained not only by the will of those gathered in the government, but by those social forces that dominate in Russia. Among them one can single out three main ones. First, those employed in the military-industrial complex. Most of them have nothing to gain from a market economy. The second force is our kolkhoz peasantry, most of whom are depraved, having become accustomed to a parasitic way of life, theft, and poor work, supported by the agricultural nomenklatura. Third, the bureaucracy: 20 million bureaucrats, almost all of them corrupt, who have seen an additional possibility of taking bribes and are the basis of the shadow economy. All three forces are against the market, against democracy, against getting rid of the poverty we are experiencing. It has been said that parliament has become the embodiment of forces of reaction, communist forces, an impediment to further reforms of which it was necessary to rid ourselves in order to reform Russia. And Yeltsin supposedly meant democracy, and victory over parliament was a triumph of democracy. One cannot say that these judgments were completely wrong. In the Supreme Soviet there was indeed much more conservatism with respect to reforms than in the structures of executive power, but the essence lies elsewhere. By Yeltsin's time a new class of neo-Soviet nomenklatura had formed in Russia. This class was represented by both branches of power: both the executive and the legislative. In and of itself the name "authoritarian regime" tells us little: It could be reformist, enlightened, and aimed at progress. The present authoritarian regime has no justification for calling itself either reformist or progressive or democratic. This is an authoritarian regime which expresses the interests of the monopolistic and militarized economy of Russia, reinforced by imperialist ambitions. Regarding what occurred in Russia during those October days of 1917, Osip Mandelshtam found a capacious expression--"noise of the times." He defined everything that was going on in Russia at the time as noise, not yet very clearly expressed and still difficult to distinguish, but powerful, disturbing, and frightening. And here again is the "noise of the times" which is reaching the entire world. What will it evoke this time? Need we have fear about the future? How will the Eastern winds affect the entire world this time?
