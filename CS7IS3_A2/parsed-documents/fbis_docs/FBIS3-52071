The Argentine Foreign Ministry released a communique "lamenting and strongly criticizing this attitude which does not reflect at all the Argentine people and government's deep feelings of friendship and cooperation." During the rally Edesur employees hung signs bearing all kinds of insults against "the Chileans" in front of the company building. They also burned flags, an effigy of Edesur Chairman Torralba Ugarte, and a coffin that contained a Chilean flag and a list of the company's Chilean executives. The demonstrators were protesting the dismissal of three company workers on charges of sabotage. They also asked for better security measures and job stability, and that there should be no more intimidation to get workers to sign up for voluntary retirement.
