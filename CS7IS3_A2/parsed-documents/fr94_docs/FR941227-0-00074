FR941227-0-00074 FR941227-0-00013 (2) Transferee. If a transferee acquires all or a portion of a transferor's qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant under this section, the transferee's schedule of ruling amounts with respect to the interest acquired will be determined under paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. (i) Taxable year of disposition. If a transferee does not file a request for a schedule of ruling amounts on or before the deemed payment deadline for the taxable year of the transferee in which the disposition occurs (that is, the date that is two and one-half months after the close of that year), the transferee's ruling amount with respect to the interest acquired in the nuclear power plant for that year is the amount described in the following sentence. This amount is the amount contained in the transferor's current schedule of ruling amounts for that plant for the taxable year of the transferor in which the disposition occurred, multiplied by the product of_ (A) The portion of the transferor's qualifying interest that is transferred; and (B) A fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable year of the transferor including and following the date of disposition, and the denominator of which is the number of days in that taxable year. (ii) Taxable years after the year of disposition. A transferee of a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant must file a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts with respect to that interest on or before the deemed payment deadline for the first taxable year of the transferee beginning after the disposition. See §1.468A&hyph;3(i)(1)(ii)(B). If the transferee does not timely file such a request, the transferee's ruling amount with respect to that interest for the affected year or years will be zero, unless the Internal Revenue Service waives the application of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) upon a showing of good cause for the delay. (3) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (e). Example. (i) X Corporation is a calendar year taxpayer engaged in the sale of electric energy generated by a nuclear power plant. The plant is owned entirely by X . On May 27, 1995, X transfers a 60 percent qualifying interest in the plant to Y Corporation, a calendar year taxpayer. Before the transfer, X had received a schedule of ruling amounts containing an annual ruling amount of $10 million for the taxable years 1993 through 2013. For 1995, neither X nor Y files a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts. (ii) Under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, X 's ruling amount for 1995 is calculated as follows: ($10,000,000×40%) + ($10,000,000×60%×146/365)=$6,400,000. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, Y's ruling amount for 1995 is calculated as follows: $10,000,000×60%×219/365=$3,600,000. Under paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section, X and Y must file requests for revised schedules of ruling amounts by March 15, 1997.
