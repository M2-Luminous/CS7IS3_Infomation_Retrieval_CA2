The forces are comprised of military trucks, artillery pieces, and infantry troops in an attempt to drive toward the liberated zones of Democratic Kampuchea. On 17 January, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea and the people attacked and destroyed these attacking forces at Pongro and Ta Pen along Route 68 below Samraong. Over 20 soldiers were killed and a number of others wounded. The remaining troops fled the battlefield and returned to their villages because the majority of the puppet soldiers were forcibly drafted from villages where people were harvesting crops.
