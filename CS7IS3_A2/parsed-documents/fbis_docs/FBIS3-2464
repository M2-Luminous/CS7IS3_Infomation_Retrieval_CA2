That is, we plan to work hard to basically solve the problem of food and clothes for the 80 million poor people in seven years. This is a significant decision by the party Central Committee and State Council based on our country's tremendous achievements in the poverty relief scheme and development efforts. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: Poverty is not socialism and socialism wants to eliminate poverty. In the 40-odd years since the founding of the PRC, led by the party and government, people in our country of all nationalities have made arduous efforts and scored world-renowned achievements in eliminating poverty and winning national prosperity, wealth, and power. In particular, following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, a range of rural reform polices, consisting mainly of the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output, launched the rural economy on unprecedented development. Peasants' income rose sharply. In some areas, peasants led the way toward a comparatively well-off status, and most of the peasants now have enough to eat and wear. The problem of poverty, one that has long plagued rural areas, has been solved to a significant extent. The party and government have always been concerned about production and living in poor areas and have viewed and pursued poverty-relief work as a key task. Following reform and opening up, they have adopted various measures to strengthen poverty-relief work. They have increased capital inputs and adjusted and reformed the traditional poverty-relief methods, linking relief to developmental projects instead of keeping them as pure welfare programs. As a result, extensive areas of chronic poverty changed their outlook and poverty was reduced significantly. This was an achievement of a historic nature, one scored against the persistently high percentages of poor populations and deteriorating poverty in the 1980's and fully revealing the superiority of the socialist system. However, ours is a big country where situations differ and development varies in level. While the problem of having enough to eat and wear is no longer a national problem, there are still some areas where development remains slow and part of the population still do not have enough to eat and wear. People in a few extremely poor areas still lead a very hard life. The implementation of the "Plan To Tackle the Most Difficult Problems in the Eighth Seven-Year Poverty Relief Plan" carries great realistic and profound historical significance. Solving the problem of having enough to eat and wear for 80 million people by the end of this century means the solution of the subsistence problem for one quarter of the world's population. This will be a great event forever written on Chinese history as well as a great act in the development of mankind. Poor people account for only a minority of the country's rural population, however most of them live in hilly areas, rocky mountains, deserts, high-altitude mountains, loess plateaus, areas of high epidemics, and reservoir areas in the mid-west. Remoteness, inaccessibility, imbalanced ecology, slow economic development, and backward culture and education mean harsh living conditions. Therefore, seven years will be required to solve the problem of having enough to eat and wear for populations in these poor areas. The task is much more difficult than the poverty-relief work in the early phase. We are determined, confident, and capable of winning this poverty-fighting battle. First, the party Central Committee and the State Council are taking this task very seriously. The 14th Party Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee convened last year, and the central rural work conference and related documents all stressed the significance of poverty relief and development work and put forward objectives and requirements. The leading comrade of the party Central Committee and State Council made many visits to poor areas to conduct investigations and studies and organized leadership there. These are the important guarantees for winning the battle of tackling key problems in poverty-relief work. Secondly, the vast number of cadres and people in poor areas have a strong wish to rid themselves of poverty and backwardness. There is enormous motivation among them to shed poverty and attain wealth. This is the inner dynamism for fighting this decisive battle against poverty. The fact that a large number of models who rid themselves of poverty and attained wealth with essential state help and their own independent effort have emerged from previous poverty relief and development, fully proves the point. Thirdly, further deepening reforms, especially the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system, has brought unprecedented opportunity and wide prospects for economic development in poor areas. For instance, as a result of comprehensive opening up, large numbers of remote borders and backward, quiet, and inland poor areas are becoming outposts for opening up and key ports for border trade. High-speed growth in coastal economically advanced areas have created massive labor service markets and job opportunities for the abundant labor supply in poor areas. As reforms in the circulation sector gradually unfold and prices are deregulated, poor areas may look forward to a real possibility of exchanging their rich natural resources for goods and services of coastal, economically advanced areas on parity and increases in their income. Fourth, the state will increase, as it has done before, inputs in poor areas and the effort at poverty relief and development. The State Council has decided to, from now until 2000, annually increase 1 billion yuan worth of work-relief programs and special interest-inclusive loans. Provinces, cities, and autonomous regions will also increase input in poverty relief and development. These are the material guarantees for the effort to take on the most difficult problems in poverty relief. Strengthening leadership at all levels in poor areas is an important condition for the battle to fight poverty. Policies, capital, and projects are naturally important, but they require a strong and combative leadership in order to be useful. Such a strong leadership must have sustained and unflinching courage, an enterprising spirit, readiness for long-term struggle, concern for the masses, and a good, pragmatic, and down-to-earth work style. Such leadership will unify party members, cadres, and the masses to change poverty. Tackling the most difficult problems in poverty relief is not only an affair for poor areas, but also a common responsibility for the whole society, and requires the effort of all members in society. All professions, trades, departments, democratic parties, and people's associations must look at poverty relief as part of their duties, practice traditional Chinese ethics, and give their hearts and contribute their efforts to the poverty-fighting battle. The implementation of the "Plan To Tackle the Most Difficult Problems in the Eighth Seven-Year Poverty Relief Plan" marks the last decisive stage of poverty relief and development, which is aimed at solving the problem of having enough to eat and wear in rural areas. The realization of the scheme marks a new historical stage in the economic and social development of poor areas. Leading cadres must have a great sense of responsibility and mission, and fight well the historically significant battle of tackling the most difficult problems in poverty relief. If our ancient ancestors could feel "ashamed of getting pay while there are beggars in town," should we not feel the same today? We believe that, led by the Central Committee and State Council, the people of all nationalities throughout the country will be united in heart and mind, join in concerted effort, win this hard battle, and march into the 21st century triumphantly.
