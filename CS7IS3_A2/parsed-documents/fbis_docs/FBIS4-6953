As yet another season of war draws to a close, little has changed in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge [KR], buoyed by consecutive victories over the government army at Pailin and Anlong Veng, are vowing to wreak havoc throughout the country. And the government in Phnom Penh, while stung by the losses, nevertheless maintains that a military solution is the only answer to the insurgency. Appealing for cooler heads in the aftermath of the Khmer Rouge's fierce counter-offensive on Pailin, Sihanouk urged the two sides to come together for peace talks, bemoaning that this "fratricidal war continues to ruin and bleed our nation white". The leaders of the two warring parties have reluctantly agreed, but if previous negotiations are anything to go by, the chances for success are slim. An earlier attempt by the king to bring the combatants together was linked to a so-called "Five Point Plan." This called, amongst other things, for the Khmer Rouge to declare a ceasefire, open its zones of control and demobilise its estimated 9,000 man-strong guerrilla army. In exchange the government would open negotiations with the rebels to discuss their demands for an advisory role in government and an offer of cabinet positions for certain "acceptable Khmer Rouge officials." The Khmer Rouge's nominal chief, Khieu Samphan, rejected the deal, saying there could be no preconditions, and the government responded by intensifying the war against the guerrillas. The main stumbling block, now as in all previous peace attempts, is what to do with the Khmer Rouge's powerful military. The Khmer Rouge leadership knows that without its guns and border sanctuaries it is doomed and will not abandon them for vague promises of political legitimacy. At February's international donor conference in Tokyo, the Cambodian government dismissed the Khmer Rouge threat as little more than the last flickers of a dying revolution and said the country faced bigger problems in overcoming widespread poverty and infrastructure woes. But as the guerrillas proved over the dry season, they remain a formidable force and potent source of instability in the country. Cambodia is not going to be able to make a break from its tragic past as long as they remain at odds with the government. In recent weeks they have kidnapped and shot at foreign aid workers and travellers and even advised Sihanouk to leave the country for safety. Their ability to create terror at will has disabled the nascent tourism industry and chilled foreign investors. Clearly the Khmer Rouge cannot be ignored and, as the recent fighting showed, are unlikely to be beaten on the battlefield. But this is not to say the Khmer Rouge -- or rather the resentment, racial enmity and destabilization they represent -- cannot be vanquished. By offering Khmer Rouge leaders a limited role in government, the Phnom Penh government can temporarily muzzle the military threat posed by the guerrilla group and allow Cambodia's suspended development to begin anew. Economic growth and democracy are the answers to the Khmer Rouge problem. The ideology of the Marxist group is dead and the issues that have traditionally sustained them -- the illegality of the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh and unlawful Vietnamese immigration -- have been made redundant by the UN peace mission or are being addressed. If other issues like official corruption and abuse of power can also be taken care of, there is no reason why a true national reconciliation cannot take place in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge's footmen will not stay in the jungle if they can see a better, more just way in mainstream society.
