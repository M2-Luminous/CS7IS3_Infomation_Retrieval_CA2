Wang Qun and the leading personnel respectively held forums with leaders of Baotou city, the Baotou Iron and Steel Company, the First and Second Neimenggu Machine-Building Plants, the Neimenggu Aluminium Plant, and a number of city level enterprises. They also visited township enterprises in the suburban township of Houyingzi. Wang Qun pointed out: We should apply the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the spirit of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping in educating cadres and the masses at present to enable them to discern that the establishment of socialist market economic systems represents a profound and great revolution, that the road in this regard must be followed, that the regression to the old ways of a planned economy is out of the question; and that we can not get ahead through the capitalist road. While it is natural for us to take risks in developing the market economy, we will encounter a "blind alley" and even greater risk and will "subjugate the party and the country" if we fail to conduct reform and to achieve development. There are many difficulties which enterprises are currently encountering and will encounter in the future in the course of achieving a large change. Only by overcoming these difficulties can they have a brilliant future. The state will issue a large number of measures for reforms in the year of 1994 and the issuance will have important and crucial significance on the establishment of the socialist market economy system. We should educate cadres and the masses to clearly discern the situation and to correctly deal with relations between reform and development and between reform and stability; relations between the central authorities and localities, the state and enterprises, staff members and workers, and immediate and long- term interests. The opportunity we face has not changed. After 15 years of reform and development, the national and international environments are now extremely favorable for us. It can be said that "everything is ready and all we need is an east wind". "An east wind" entails having the leadership at all levels dare to make efforts to pioneer and to display the spirit of pioneering the road of advance and if they do not, it entails their inability of paving the road to deepening reform, the turning of the quickening of development into empty talk, and losing the opportunity. Wang Qun stressed: Our enterprises should conduct their development along the road of modernization, market, internationalization, and grouping. Large and medium-sized enterprises should take the lead in this regard, base themselves on international markets, gain ground in market competition, and seek self development. They should push forward reform as a whole and make a breakthroughs in the key aspects. The departments of governments, banks, industry and commerce, labor affairs, and insurance should cooperate with the quickening of reform. The emphasis of reform should be placed on enterprises and in large and medium-sized enterprises in particular. The orientation of enterprise reform is to establish modern enterprise systems and the current emphasis should be placed on conducting reform in the three internal systems. Leadership at all levels should integrate the spirit of the central decision with the principle of "three advantages" and grasp the essence of the "decision's" spirit. We should resolutely implement the spirit of "the decision" and proceed from reality in adopting ways and styles for reform. We may apply any method as long as it conforms with the "three advantages." Ways that prove effective in reforms should be popularized among localities. By no means should we always remain these ways in the period of "experimentation conducted by specific units." Leading comrades including Wang Qun urged the leading organs and enterprises to pay attention to making scientific and technological progress, to pay special attention to studying managerial knowledge, to learn about markets, to master markets, and to upgrade their capability of controlling markets. In the final analysis, market competition means the competition of scientific and technological personnel and means that efforts should be made to upgrade the technological content of products and to join in the competition with high-quality and high-grade products. Wang Qun said: In the historical change of establishing the systems of market economy, it is imperative to enhance the party's leadership; to strengthen the ideological work and the enforcement of discipline; and to bring our political strong points into full play. He also urged leading cadres to enhance their professional ambition and their sense of responsibility and their concept of the whole situation and to continuously and somehow create something or make progress in leading the program of effecting great change. Wang Qun, Qian Fenyong, and Shen Shuji also put forward specific opinions on the practical problems encountered by enterprises.
