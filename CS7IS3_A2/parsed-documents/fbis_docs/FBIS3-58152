"It will be a very wide invitation that is extended to Central and East European nations, Russia, Ukraine, and I very much hope they will take it up," Major told reporters on his arrival at NATO headquarters. He said the Partnership for Peace plan under which the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would give former East bloc countries a cooperative link with the Atlanic alliance but not full membership was the best option at present. The British leader also said the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was of concern to NATO heads of state and government, "particularly amongst those with large numbers of troops there." But he indicated there was unlikely to be any major change in NATO policy on the 21-month conflict, noting that the alliance had already approved the use of air strikes if requested by the United Nations. "That was the position and that remains the position today," Major said.
