Credit unions accepting nonmember and public unit accounts in excess of 20 percent of total shares are still required to develop a written plan and send it to the Regional Director. However, prior NCUA approval is required only for amounts exceeding 20% of total shares and $1.5 million. effective date: June 20, 1994. addresses: National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314&hyph;3428 for further information contact: Michael J. McKenna, Staff Attorney, Office of General Counsel, at the above address, or telephone: (703) 518&hyph;6540. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The NCUA Board, as part of its ongoing program of regulatory review, is revising the regulation under which federally insured credit unions maintain nonmember and public unit accounts. Federal credit unions (FCUs) are authorized by section 107(6) of the Federal Credit Union Act [12 U.S.C. 1757(6)] to receive nonmember shares from other credit unions, from certain governmental entities (``public units'') and, if the credit union has a ``low-income'' designation from NCUA, from other outside sources. These nonmember accounts, and equivalent accounts authorized for federally insured state credit unions under state law are defined by section 101(5) of the Act [12 U.S.C. 1752(5)] as ``accounts'' and ``member accounts'' for purposes of the various provisions of the FCU Act, including those establishing insurance coverage by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). Prior to these final amendments, NCUA's regulation on nonmember accounts has required any federally-insured credit union that wishes to accept nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent of total shares to submit to NCUA a plan setting forth the intended use of the funds and obtain NCUA approval. On February 28, 1994, the NCUA Board issued proposed amendments to change the amount of nonmember and public unit accounts that a credit union may maintain without a waiver, to 20 percent of total shares or $1.5 million, whichever is greater (See 59 FR 10334, March 4, 1994). The Board is now adopting these proposed amendments, without substantive change from the proposal. B. Comments Thirteen comments were received. Six were received from FCUs, one from a state-chartered credit union, one from a state credit union league, three from national trade associations, and two from bank trade organizations. Six commenters expressed complete approval of the proposed amendments. Most of these commenters believe the amendments will not have an effect on safety and soundness and will greatly reduce paperwork requirements. Five commenters expressed general support. The bank trade organizations opposed the proposed amendments. C. Discussion The Board proposed that a credit union be able to maintain permissible nonmember accounts up to 20 percent of total shares or $1.5 million, whichever is greater, before a waiver by the regional director is required. Eleven commenters supported this rule change. They believe that this amendment would generally benefit smaller credit unions by allowing them to receive significant amounts of nonmember deposits without the administrative delay caused by the current regulation. However, two of these commenters would go further and remove all limitations on the use of nonmember deposits. One commenter recommended that the final rule provide for an annual automatic increase of $250,000 in the $1.5 million nonmember threshold. The Board has determined that it will not increase the $1.5 million threshold until it has an opportunity to assess the impact of this final rule.
