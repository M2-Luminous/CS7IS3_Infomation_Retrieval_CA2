Christopher originally intended to apply the question of MFN to put pressure on China, urging the country to improve its "human rights" situation. The Chinese side frankly told him, however, that "China will never accept the human rights values of the United States." Moreover, China opposes linking trade with the question of human rights. As a result, the ball has again reached the U.S. court. What course should be followed? The United States is indeed facing an important choice. On 16 March, the third day after Christopher's visit to China, U.S. President Clinton made his first response. In Sino-U.S. relations, he said, "the question of human rights is important, but so are other issues." He also promised that the utmost effort will be made to remove the differences between the two countries and expressed his determination to resolve the contention with China on the question of human rights. The Chinese Government immediately pointed out that his remarks constituted "a positive sign." Following that, calls for extending China's MFN status were made one after another from various U.S. circles, and all were opposed to the linkage of human rights and trade. Former President Bush, former Secretaries of State Kissinger and Vance, and other major figures from the political circles personally made appeals, which were followed by large numbers of entrepreneurs, economists, parliamentary members, and government officials, gradually forming a powerful opinion. The WASHINGTON POST pointed out frankly in an article that the revocation of China's MFN status would be "a big economic mistake" by the United States. In addition to harming China's economic interests, it will also harm U.S. economic interests. As a matter of fact, China had pointed out long ago that Sino-U.S. relations are based on common interests rather than the same ideology and political system. Many Americans also made estimates of the U.S. economy. The chairman of the U.S.-China Commerce Committee said that the volume of U.S. exports to China totaled $9 billion last year. Once China's MFN status is revoked, the Chinese side will undoubtedly retaliate, which will in turn affect U.S. trade with China. Another chairman of the U.S. Shoe Wholesale and Retail Association said that Chinese shoes account for half of the U.S. market. If imports from China are ceased, the prices of shoes will soar. If China's MFN status is revoked, some people predicted, inflation in the United States will increase by at least 0.15 percent annually. According to U.S. officials, as Clinton made an executive order last year, linking China's MFN status to the question of human rights, the United States had to ask China to accept its human rights request, though it did not want bilateral trade ties to be affected. In fact, the United States has gotten caught in a web of its own spinning. It is true that the U.S. President's executive order will not work in China. Although human rights and trade are two different matters, the United States tried to lump the two together in an attempt to exert pressure on China. In the end, however, it bound its own hands and feet. Whoever started the trouble should end it, and it is unlikely that China will help the United States extricate itself from this predicament. Since the U.S. President issued an executive order last year linking human rights with trade, he must have an option available for separating the two this year. The status quo of human rights in the United States also needs to be improved. The poor human rights record of the United States is known to all. The British weekly the ECONOMIST has asked: How would the Americans feel if foreign countries had imposed trade sanctions against the United States for its poor human rights record in 1955? How could the United States prove that its human rights situation has improved if the trade sanctions had continued to the present day? If trade is used as the method, the weekly pointed out, besides the adverse influence on China and the United States, it will get out of control and affect other countries and regions. The U.S. paper the NEW YORK TIMES said in a report published the day before yesterday that the economic authority under President Clinton had reached a common understanding: The U.S. annual practice of making use of human rights to threaten the revocation of China's MFN status is outdated and should be replaced. The report also said that this proposal is making the rounds at the White House and the State Department. "It seems that this mentality has taken ground in Congress." Of course, these moves are worth welcoming. The settling of the MFN issue once and for all is in conformity with the fundamental interests of the China and the United States. As the United States has not yet made a decision, we still have to wait and see. The question of MFN has great relevance for Hong Kong. As for China, it is prepared for either of the two outcomes: "It is hoping for the best result, but is also prepared for the worst."
