The 48-year-old Adolfas Slezevicius was then charged with heading the cabinet. Introducing him to their readers, the newspapers joked that the new premier and, consequently, the new Lithuania is just two centimeters short of complete happiness (Slezevicius is 198 cm tall). The "boy" and his government have been in power for a year. What has been accomplished and what has not been? This ITAR-TASS correspondent put that question to the prime minister. The premier preferred to be self-critical this time. We have been forced, he said, to make unpopular decisions. For instance, we could not keep buying gas from Russia at double the price at which it is sold in Lithuania, since our debt was snowballing. The same thing has been true of electricity, in order to ensure that its prime cost does not exceed the retail price. [Burbulis] Has the current government made any mistakes which it has later had to correct? [Slezevicius] Yes, it has taken a number of wrong steps which have damaged the economy and people. One of the most important and worrying problems is that of settlements between economic players, and mutual debts -- which currently stand at around 900 million litai (approximately $200 million). [Burbulis] For the first time Lithuania's prime minister is also the chairman of the ruling party -- the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party. How are these two jobs being combined? [Slezevicius] I think that this is the democratic Western model for running a country -- when the party which wins the election forms the cabinet.
