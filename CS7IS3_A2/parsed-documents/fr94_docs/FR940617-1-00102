FR940617-1-00102 FR940617-1-00012 ( x ) Don rubber gloves used in sampling hands and secure at wrist. (K) Sampling techniques. ( 1 ) At specified sampling times, aseptically add 50 to 100 milliliters of sampling solution to glove and hand to be sampled, and fasten glove securely above wrist. ( 2 ) After adding sampling solution, uniformly massage all surfaces of hand for 1 minute, paying particular attention to the area under the nails. ( 3 ) After massaging, aseptically sample the fluid of the glove. Transfer immediately a measured volume of the sample to a serial dilution tube containing a suitable antimicrobial inactivator. (L) Enumeration of bacteria in sampling solution. Enumerate the bacteria in the sampling solution by a standard plate count procedure such as that described in ``Standard Methods for the Evaluation of Dairy Products'' (available from American Public Health Association, Inc., 1015 15th St. NW., Washington, DC 20005) but using soybean-casein digest agar and a suitable inactivator for the antimicrobial where necessary. The suitability of the inactivator is to be demonstrated using a procedure such as described in E 1054, ``Test Methods for Evaluating Inactivators of Antimicrobial Agents Used in Disinfectant, Sanitizer, and Antiseptic Products,'' in ``Annual Book of ASTM Standards,'' vol. 11.04, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from The American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103&hyph;1187, or may be examined at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 7520 Standish Pl., suite 201, Rockville, MD, or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. Prepare sample dilutions in dilution fluid. Plate in duplicate. Incubate plated sample at 30 # 2 â—‹C for 48 hours before reading. (M) Determination of reduction obtained. ( 1 ) At each sampling interval, determine changes from baseline counts obtained with test material. ( 2 ) For a more realistic appraisal of the activity of products, all raw data should be converted to common (base 10) logarithms. Reductions should be calculated from average of the logarithms. This will also facilitate statistical analysis of data. (N) Comparison of test materials with a positive control material. ( 1 ) In order to validate the testing procedure, equipment, and facilities, it is required that the test formulation be compared with an active control formulation. This will require an equivalent number of panelists to be assigned to the control formulation on a random basis. All test parameters will be equivalent for both formulations, except that the scrub procedure for the established formulation may be different from that of the test formulation. Both test and control formulations are to be run concurrently. Identity of the formulations used by panelists are to be blinded from those individuals counting plates and analyzing data. ( 2 ) To validate the assay, compare changes from baseline counts obtained with control material at each sampling interval. (O) Statistical analyses. Either of the statistical approaches to the evaluation of the data detailed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(O) of this section is acceptable. ( 1 ) Treat data as a binomial response. That is, if a subject achieves the target reduction, it is judged a success; if not, it is a failure. A potential problem to this approach is that information may be lost. For example, if at the 1 minute time frame, a large number of subjects using one skin scrub achieve a 2-log reduction and those on the other scrub attain only a 1-log reduction, the binomial procedure will indicate both scrubs achieve the same degree of reduction. If it is believed that the binomial approach causes loss of information by not including numerical response data, then the alternate statistical analysis described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(0)( 2 ) of this section is applicable. If the success rate is in the 90 percent range, then the variance is relatively small, sample size requirements are relatively small, and confidence intervals are reasonable. However, if the success rates drop to the 70 percent range, then relatively large sample sizes are required to obtain the same power as one gets for 90 percent success rates.
