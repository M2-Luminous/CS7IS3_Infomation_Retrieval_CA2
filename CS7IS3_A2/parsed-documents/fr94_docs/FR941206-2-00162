FR941206-2-00162 FR941206-2-00110 All primary applicants must submit a completed Form CD&hyph;511, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters; Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and Lobbying.'' Applicants are further advised that: (1) Nonprocurement Debarment and Suspension. Prospective participants (as defined at 15 CFR Part 26, Section 105) are subject to 15 CFR Part 26, ``Nonprocurement Debarment and Suspension'' and the related section of the certification form; (2) Drug Free Workplace. Grantees (as defined at 15 CFR part 26, Section 605) are subject to 15 CFR Part 26, Subpart F, ``Government-wide Requirements for Drug-Free Workplace (Grants)'' and the related section of the certification form; (3) Anti-lobbying. Persons (as defined at 15 CFR Part 28, Section 105) are subject to the lobbying provisions of 31 U.S.C. 1352, ``Limitation on use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracting and financial transactions,'' and the lobbying section of the certification form, which applies to applicants/bidders for grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts for more than $100,000, and loans and loan guarantees for more than $150,000, or the single family maximum mortgage limit for affected programs, whichever is greater; and (4) Anti-lobbying Disclosures. Any applicant that has paid or will pay for lobbying using any funds must submit an SF&hyph;LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities,'' as required under 15 CFR Part 28, Appendix B. For awards granted by NTIA, the recipient shall require applicants/bidders for subgrants, contracts, subcontracts, or other lower tier covered transactions at any tier under the grant award to submit, if applicable, a completed Form CD&hyph;512, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-Lower Tier Covered Transactions and Lobbying'' and disclosure form, SF&hyph;LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities.'' Form CD&hyph;512 is intended for the use of recipients and should not be transmitted to the Department. An SF&hyph;LLL completed by any tier recipient or subrecipient should be submitted to the Department in accordance with the instructions contained in the award document. Approving a request to amend an award to increase funding or to extend the period of performance is at the total discretion of the Department. Recipients and subrecipients are subject to all Federal laws and Federal and DOC policies, regulations, and procedures applicable to Federal assistance awards. In addition, unsatisfactory performance by the applicant under prior Federal awards may result in the application not being considered for funding. Applicants are reminded that a false statement on the application may be grounds for denial or termination of funds and grounds for possible punishment by a fine or imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001. Special Note: As originally stated in the August 20, 1987, PTFP Final Rules (52 FR 31496 (1987)), and as reaffirmed and clarified in a November 22, 1991, PTFP Policy Statement (56 FR 59168 (1991)), NTIA has established a policy which is intended to encourage stations to increase from 25% to 50% the matching percentage for those proposals that call for equipment replacement, improvement, or augmentation. There are, however, some exceptions to this general policy direction. Small community-licensee stations, for example, will not be subjected to this policy. The same is true of a station that is licensed to a large institution (e.g., a college or university) that can document that it does not receive direct or in-kind support from the larger institution. Also, a showing of extraordinary need or an emergency situation will be taken into consideration as justification for grants of up to 75% of the project cost for such proposals. Nonetheless, except in these instances, the presumption of 50% funding will be the general rule for the replacement, improvement, or augmentation of equipment. A point of clarification is in order: NTIA expects to continue funding projects to activate stations or to extend service at up to 75% of the total project cost. NTIA will do this because applicants proposing to provide first service to a geographic area ordinarily incur considerable costs that are not eligible for NTIA funding; such costs include those for construction or renovation of buildings and other similar expenses. II. Documentation Concerning Discrimination Complaints The NTIA Administrator is hereby extending a blanket waiver to all PTFP FY 1995 applicants and grant recipients exempting them from the requirements contained at 15 CFR 2301.5(d)(2)(xvii) and 2301.21(b)(1&hyph;2). Based on its experience, NTIA has found these requirements to be too burdensome and generally not pertinent to the PTFP's selection criteria. This blanket waiver means that FY 1995 PTFP applicants will not be required to provide a detailed list and explanation of any complaints of discrimination currently pending or decided against the applicant before any court or governmental agency. Moreover, FY 1995 PTFP grant recipients, once their projects are completed, will not be required to submit such documentation on their Annual Status Reports; nor will recipients have to provide the special academic certification concerning their admissions policies or their policies regarding the receiving or providing of services. Applicants are reminded, however, that they are still obligated to comply with the general Federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination, as stated in 15 CFR 2301.22(b)(15) and in Assurance No. 36 of the PTFP Application Form.
