Discussions centered on France's cooperation to support the Malian Government's and people's efforts following the devaluation of the CFA franc. Here is Michel Roussin speaking to Mahamadou Kone. [Begin Roussin recording] During this working session, we discussed how to organize our cooperation at this difficult time for us all -- for Malians and their brothers in other franc zone countries and also for us, the French. A number of pledges have been made and as Prime Minister Edouard Balladur stated and President Mitterrand reiterated in Yamoussoukro, France honors its commitments and France is here to support the substantial efforts made by the government and especially by the people, who understand that once this difficult period is over, it will be followed by economic growth and development will become a reality. For this reason, we must remain by the side of our African partners and this is what I have come to discuss in concrete terms with the prime minister and the finance minister. My talks were less technical with the president than they were with the prime minister and the finance minister. The president gave a broad overview of the prevailing situation in the subregion. Of course, we also discussed how to manage the effects of the devaluation. I confirmed to the president France's friendly support for Mali during this delicate period, as my presence here today in Bamako with a large delegation attests. We also discussed the upcoming summit in Ouagadougou, where leaders of the members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union are scheduled to meet and together draw the first conclusions from the effects of the devaluation and get organized for the next phase of this courageous exercise which -- I am optimistic -- can enable everyone to experience an economic rebirth. [end recording] Mahamadou Kone also informs us that the French cooperation minister will leave Bamako for Paris this afternoon.
