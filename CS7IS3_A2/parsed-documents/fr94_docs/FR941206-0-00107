FR941206-0-00107 FR941206-0-00015 20. The Commission is not persuaded to delete the small business incentive. It states that its current application processing standards, which involve a case-by-case analysis of each transaction, are sufficient to guard against sham small business applications. With respect to petitioners' arguments regarding notice, the Commission points out that the Notice of Proposed Rule Making in this proceeding, 6 FCC Red 3275 (1991), 56 FR 26365 (June 7, 1991), invited commenters to discuss a range of issues regarding the national ownership caps, and some commenters emphasized that access to capital is a problem for new entrants and small businesses in general, not just minority-owned entities. The Commission further notes that it intends to explore minority ownership issues in an upcoming proceeding. 21. Pursuant to the rules adopted in the First Reconsideration Order, the national ownership limits automatically increased from 18 AM and 18 FM to 20 AM and 20 FM on September 16, 1994. On October 7, 1994, NABOB and NBMC filed a ``Joint Motion for Rescission and Stay'' asking the Commission to rescind the automatic increase and stay the effective date of that increase until the Commission has acted on their petition for reconsideration and evaluated the effect of the 18AM/18FM cap on minority ownership. The Commission notes that NABOB/NBMC's petition for reconsideration is resolved in the Second Reconsideration Order, and that the Radio Station Ownership Report released concurrently with that Order analyzes the effect that the increase in the national caps has had on minority broadcasters to the extent presently possible. The Commission finds the request for stay to be moot, and denies the request for rescission. Time Brokerage Arrangements 22. The Commission defines time brokerage as a type of joint venture that generally involves the sale by a licensee of discrete blocks of time to a ``broker'' who then supplies the programming to fill that time and sells the commercial spot announcements to support it. The First Reconsideration Order affirmed the Commission's earlier holding that if a time brokerage agreement between two stations in the same market involves more than 15 percent of the brokered station's programming per week, the brokered station will be treated as if it was owned by the brokering station for purposes of the national and local ownership rules. 23. TRAC/WACC note that time brokerage decisions have been made by the Commission's staff and argue that the Commission should not be bound in future rulemakings by policy decisions of its staff made in ex parte informal adjudications. TRAC/WACC also note that members of the public are not given notice of, and may not have standing to participate in, declaratory rulings at the staff level. NAB counters that the revised time brokerage rules and policies, as adopted and applied by the staff in its rulings, are lawful and are designed to adequately ensure that licensees do not relinquish control of their stations and remain responsive to the obligations of a licensee. 24. The Commission states that the language of the First Reconsideration Order was intended to reflect the Commission's continuing view that particular situations are better resolved on a case-by-case basis. The Commission further finds that the specific aspects of time brokerage arrangements questioned by TRAC/WACC in its petition were thoroughly discussed previously in this proceeding, where the Commission adopted restrictions on time brokerage arrangements so that they will be counted as ownership interests where significant brokering between competing stations is involved. Furthermore, the Commission reiterates that a licensee must retain ultimate control over its station. The Commission concludes that TRAC/WACC has not introduced any new arguments to convince it that it needs to take further action in this proceeding with respect to time brokerage. It also states its belief that imposition of any additional restrictions on time brokerage arrangements would run counter to one of the objectives of this proceeding, which was to strengthen the radio industry by giving radio broadcasters more flexibility. 25. The Commission notes that it previously decided not to require the termination of an agreement that does not comply with the local ownership rules if the agreement was entered into prior to the effective date of the rules. These agreements were, in effect, ``grandfathered.'' The Commission clarifies that when a brokering station is sold, an existing brokerage agreement that would be barred by the rules if entered initially at the time of the sale, may be transferred. The new owner may enjoy all rights and limitations with respect to the multiple ownership rules as the original owner, but only for the duration of the term of the agreement in effect at the time of transfer. The purchaser of a station or stations involved in a brokerage agreement, however, cannot create a new violation or exacerbate an existing rule violation by that acquisition. Thus, for example, a station combination that involves a brokerage agreement and that exceeds the 25 percent audience share limit, but is nonetheless permissible under the rules, could not be acquired by a party with another station in the same market. A similar station combination with an audience share of 24 percent could not be acquired by a licensee with a station enjoying a 3 percent share in the same market. In addition, parties will not be permitted to renew or extend time brokerage agreements, including those that are grandfathered, once the initial term expires if, at the time of expiration, the agreement would not be permissible under the rules.
