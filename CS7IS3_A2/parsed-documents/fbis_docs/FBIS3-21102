All this was perhaps inevitable. As a result of this situation Fiat Auto Managing Director Paolo Cantarella decided to run through the contents of his strategic plan again, explaining its reasons and goals. He began by analyzing the trend in demand (after the collapse in 1993 a recovery is forecast starting this year and a subsequent gradual improvement), as well as the moves by European and American competitors. All companies are resorting to investments and restructuring, but Fiat Auto is investing more than anyone, and with complete confidence. From 1992 to date it has already invested 20 trillion lire and the same amount is planned for the future. Strategy The large investments and restructuring in progress are two aspects of the same strategic plan, aimed at the development of Fiat Auto, even in the long term. It is based on four areas of action: Product and range, costs, sales network and service, and the break- even point. These are the factors which Fiat considers essential for ensuring global competitiveness, profitability, and the conditions for ongoing improvement. Some fundamental policy milestones have already been achieved, symbolically represented by the Punto model and the Melfi plant, although others remain unfulfilled. This explains the conflicts within Fiat Auto, whose results are still disappointing (a drop in sales and market share, full-time lay-offs, and continuing losses) yet more new models are being introduced and the company appears fully convinced of its future success. Product and Range Paolo Cantarella's plan foresees valorization of the group's brands, coverage of market niches, and definition of life cycles in line with the top international competitors (the lifespan of Fiat Auto models, already down to 8.4 years, the European average, is destined to fall to six years, like the Japanese). The group's 14 basic models listed in 1993 are to rise to 19 in 1996: Fiat brands will increase from six to nine, and both Lancia and Alfa from four to five. According to the plans, 1994 will see the introduction of 10 new models. Fiat is to launch the coupe, the Punto cabriolet, and the hatchback, as yet nameless (code name U60), as well as the new Ducato. Lancia is to introduce the Dedra station wagon, its first of this type, and at the end of the year, the follow-up to the Thema. Finally Alfa is to present a sports model and a coupe, plus two different models for the segment that currently only has the 33. All these new cars, presented at the Mirafiori plant, give the impression of reliability, thanks also to their well-defined features. The total renewal and extension of the range are combined with corresponding efforts aimed at mechanical components. For example, the Mirafiori plant has begun to produce transmissions for segment B and C models (4,300 a day at full capacity, an investment of 810 billion lire); while in the spring the Pratola Serra plant (formerly Arna) is to produce the first five-cylinder engines and later, again at the Mira plant, the revolutionary "Torque" (base of 1,600 cc, 16 valves, 1,100 produced per day, an investment of 380 billion lire). Plants The plan approved at the end of 1993 calls for reorganization to obtain maximum competitiveness levels from each final plant (with an average daily production of 1,400 vehicles), quality (assigning specific missions), and flexibility. The models for the Mirafiori plant are Panda, Punto, Type D sedan and station wagon, and Uno (completely knocked down); for Rivalta both the Dedra versions; for Cassino the Tipo, Tempra, and two Tipo C's; for Melfi Punto and Y11; for Termini Punto; for Pomigliano the two new Alfa automobiles, the Delta, and 155 model; finally for Arese the sports model and the Alfa coupe. The Arese plant, still the "driving force" behind the Alfa brand, has been assigned the mission of manufacturing special vehicles; Mirafiori becomes strategic for the D segment (23 percent of the European market), Rivalta for the E (10 percent), Cassino for the C (31 percent), and Termini Imerese for the B (27 percent). Pomigliano (C and D) already produces 1,200 vehicles a day, double the capacity of the former Alfa Sud, and a rate destined to rise further. Costs Reorganization of the industrial structure, according to Cantarella, is fundamental for cost optimization, together with the introduction of the integrated factory and rationalization of the system of suppliers, drastically reduced in number but now working even closer with the firm and even in partnership with it. This area also involves efforts at lowering the break-even point (the goal is 1.2 million vehicles, the number sold by Fiat Auto in Europe in 1993), via a reduction in fixed costs throughout the company, at the same time ensuring by making the necessary sacrifices, maintained flexibility so as to exploit opportunities. Network and Service In order to extend and improve the sales network over 230 billion lire were invested last year which will rise to around 300 billion lire this year. This is confirmation of the interest shown in this area, which is as strategic as after-sales service. Various measures are planned or already implemented, including dualizing of a number of sales outlets and service centers to enable dealers to enhance competitiveness, above all when the market trend is unfavorable. Cantarella aims at 1,060 European Alfa Romeo outlets (974 today and 840 in 1987) and 1,224 for Lancia (1,127) for 1996. Overseas An important item in the investment program is Fiat Auto's operations abroad, in particular Turkey, Poland, and Brazil. These three markets are recording constant growth in sales and the Fiat market share. Last year Tofas (a Fiat joint venture) gained 47.2 percent of the Turkish market (410,000 registrations), Fiat Poland 54 percent of the domestic market (241,000), and FIASA (100 percent Fiat) 22.8 percent of the market in Brazil (972,000). Fiat Auto has allocated approximately 3 trillion lire to development projects in these areas, convinced of the opportunities they will offer, also as outlets for products manufactured in Italian plants (one example being the completely knocked down Uno). In 1993 Fiat Auto exported 76,624 vehicles there, compared to the 18,354 of 1991, and should exceed the 185,000 mark in 1996 (18,000 to Brazil, 34,000 to Poland, and 133,000 to Turkey).
