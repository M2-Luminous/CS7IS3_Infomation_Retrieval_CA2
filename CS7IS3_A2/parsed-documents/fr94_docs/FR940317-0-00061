FR940317-0-00061 FR940317-0-00022 A. Application of Antifraud Provisions Participants in the municipal securities market do not dispute the need for ongoing disclosure following an offering of securities, but municipal issuers reportedly resist developing a routine of ongoing disclosure to the investing market because of concerns about the costs of generating and disseminating that information and about potential liability relating to such disclosure. These issuers and obligors are at times advised by their professional advisors that there is no duty under the federal securities laws to make disclosure following the completion of the distribution. 85 At least some municipal issuers thus appear to believe that silence shields them from liability for what may later be found to be false or misleading information. As a practical matter, however, municipal issuers do not have the option of remaining silent. Given the wide range of information routinely released to the public, formally and informally, by these issuers in their day-to-day operations, the stream of information on which the market relies does not cease with the close of a municipal offering. In light of the public nature of these issuers and their accountability and governmental functions, a variety of information about issuers of municipal securities is collected by state and local governmental bodies, and routinely made publicly available. 86 Municipal officials also make frequent public statements and issue press releases concerning the entity's fiscal affairs. 85 See Stamas, ``Issuers' Intentions on Secondary Market Disclosure Are Starting to Appear in Official Statements,'' The Bond Buyer (Dec. 14, 1992) at 1; Stamas, ``Why the Issue of Secondary-Market Disclosure Remains on the Back Burner: It Can Be Risky,'' The Bond Buyer (Sept. 20, 1991) at 1; Stamas, ``Analysts Warn Issuers About Some Lawyers' Disclosure Advice,'' The Bond Buyer (Jan. 15, 1991) at 1. 86 See NASACT Blue Ribbon Committee Report at 2, 24; NASACT 1990 Task Force Report at 21. A municipal issuer may not be subject to the mandated continuous reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, but when it releases information to the public that is reasonably expected to reach investors and the trading markets, those disclosures are subject to the antifraud provisions. 87 The fact that they are not published for purposes of informing the securities markets does not alter the mandate that they not violate antifraud proscriptions. 88 Those statements are a principal source of significant, current information about the issuer of the security, and thus reasonably can be expected to reach investors and the trading market. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has said: ``The securities markets are highly sensitive to press releases and to information contained in all sorts of publicly released . . . documents, and the investor is foolish who would ignore such releases.'' 89 Since investors obtain information concerning the fiscal health of a municipal issuer from its public statements concerning financial and other matters, ``[t]he nature of these statements and the assumptions upon which they are based must be carefully and accurately communicated to the public, so that potential investors may be fully informed of all material facts relevant to their investment decision.'' 90 87 See Public Statements by Corporate Representatives, Securities Act Release No. 6504 (Jan. 20, 1984) 49 FR 2468, 2469; In re Ames Dept. Stores Inc. Stock Litigation, 991 F.2d 953, 965&hyph;67 (2d Cir. 1993) (with respect to corporate information). 88 See Fippinger, The Securities Law of Public Finance (2d ed. 1993) at 291 (``[P]ress releases, conversations with analysts, information meetings, official comments on budget negotiations, and even angry reactions by public officials to rating agency downgrades'' are subject to antifraud provisions). 89 Ames , 991 F.2d at 963 (corporate information). 90 NY City Report at Ch. III at 2. The report found that public statements by City officials were misleading, since they were characterized by unwarranted reassurances as to the soundness and attractiveness of the City's securities, including statements that the City's budget problems, no matter how serious, had nothing to do with the City's ability to pay its debts. Id. at 110&hyph;111. Municipal issuers should also be sensitive to whether their official statements contain forward-looking statements, such as projections of revenues, that remain alive in the market and may require updating in light of subsequent events. Guides for Disclosure of Projections of Future Economic Performance, Exchange Act Rel. No. 5992 (Nov. 7, 1978), 43 FR 53246. To the extent that the official statement in many cases remains the principal (or perhaps even the sole) source of information concerning an outstanding security, the potential for an obligation to update is of particular importance. The current process by which municipal issuers and their officials release information to market participants does not address the risk of misleading investors, because there is no mechanism for disseminating information about the municipal issuer to the market as a whole. To the contrary, in the municipal market, information released publicly frequently is disseminated only to a narrow segment of the marketplace. For example, market participants who request current information from indenture trustees are often turned away on the grounds that they are not current holders of the securities. 91 As a result, investors purchasing municipal securities in the secondary market risk doing so on the basis of incomplete and outdated information. 91 Under notice provisions of indentures, the issuer and trustee generally are required to provide notice to existing bondholders of events of default and other significant matters, such as a draw on reserves, a failure to renew a letter of credit, or a substitution of collateral. ABA 1991 Guidelines at 10. Indeed, trustees often deny requests by market participants for information out of concern for liability arising from exceeding the authority set forth in the indenture. Fippinger at 325. This situation led the American Bankers Association Corporate Trust Committee, in cooperation with the National Association of Bond Lawyers, to develop agreed upon guidelines for indenture provisions permitting the trustee to provide public notice of specified events. See ABA 1991 Guidelines.
