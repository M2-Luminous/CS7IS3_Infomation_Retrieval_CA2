Criminal proceedings have been initiated against a long-standing deputy director of the biggest Swiss bank in Zurich, the responsible authorities have announced. According to information released by Jacques Antenen, deputy investigating judge of Waadt Canton, the seizure of $150 million at the SBG took place in connection with investigations against suspected money-launderers of the Colombian Medellin drug cartel. The Zurich District Prosecutor's Office is convinced that the approximately $150 million is dirty money, as District Prosecutor Dieter Jann-Corrodi said upon inquiry. "I have not heard of any bigger case anywhere in the world so far," he said. Investigations Since June 1993 Since June 1993 the Waadt judiciary has been investigating Colombian citizens who belong to a criminal organization located in the Colombian town of Barranquilla and are linked with the Medellin cartel. They are suspected of having violated the regulations concerning money-laundering in the cantons of Waadt, Neuenburg, and Geneva. According to Antenen, they invested money in, among other things, a restaurant and other real estate properties, but that was less than 1 million Swiss francs. According to the Waadt investigating judge, investigations are being carried out together with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and the authorities in Zurich and are also spread to the cantons of Neuenburg and Geneva. On 23 February a Colombian woman was arrested; she is still in detention pending trial. Within the framework of the investigations, the Waadt judicial authorities applied to the authorities in Zurich for legal aid to seize more than $150 million at the SBG. SBG Deputy Director Claims He Knows Nothing Criminal investigations have been initiated in Zurich against the SBG deputy director, who acted as a trustee. The Zurich District Prosecutor's Office accused the deputy director of having long known about the dirty origin of the money but not having reacted when the penal law on money-laundering came into force in August 1990. His temporary arrest was announced on 27 February. [passage omitted] The deputy director claims not to have known anything about the dirty origin of the money, District Prosecutor Jann-Corrode said.
