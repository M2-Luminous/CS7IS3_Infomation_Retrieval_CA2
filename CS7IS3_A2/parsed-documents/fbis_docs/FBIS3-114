FBIS3-114 "drafr040_e_94013" FBIS-AFR-94-040 Document Type:Daily Report 1 Mar 1994 WEST AFRICA Togo Court Denies Receiving Full Results From CEN AB2802203594 Paris AFP in French 1617 GMT 28 Feb 94 AB2802203594 Paris AFP Language: French Article Type:BFN [Text] Lome, 28 Feb (AFP) -- The president of the Supreme Court of Togo, Mr. Emmanuel Apedoh, told AFP today that the full results of the legislative elections organized on 6 and 20 February in Togo have not yet been sent by the National Electoral Commission (CEN). He specified that he is still without "the reports on the counting of votes" in the five constituencies where incidents disrupted the polls and which the CEN declined to publish the results during the second round of the elections. This statement calls into question the earlier one made by the CEN and the Togolese Government that the full results have been sent to the Supreme Court on 23 February. Questioned this morning, an official of the CEN admitted that certain documents on the results in the five constituencies have not as yet been sent to the Supreme Court but it will be done "in the course of the day." The two parties opposed to President Gnassingbe Eyadema claimed to have won 43 out of the 81 seats at stake, and therefore the absolute majority in parliament which, according to the constitution, gives them the prerogative to form the new government. Supporters of the head of state have announced their intention to call for the annulment of the polls in the five constituencies (all claimed by the opposition) whose results the CEN did not publish. This confusion has already caused a discrepancy in the scheduled political timetable. Thus it is out of the question that the new National Assembly can be officially inaugurated on 1 March as expected since it can only sit "without further considerations" on the second Tuesday following the official proclamation of the election results. And yet the Supreme Court has a maximum of 15 days "after receiving the full results" to declare them official and final.
