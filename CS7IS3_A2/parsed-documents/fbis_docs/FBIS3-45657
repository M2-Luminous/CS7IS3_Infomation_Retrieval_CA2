In the near future, China's postal departments will possess their own airplanes and will substantially improve their services, putting an end to the past situation of having no express delivery. Since the 1950's, China's postal departments have primarily relied on railroad and aviation services to deliver mail. Because the volume of mail has risen sharply in recent years -- an overall increase of 20 percent annually and an increase in express delivery of 71.7 percent and even 100 percent in some regions -- the railroad and aviation services can no longer meet the demand. Of all complaints received by the express delivery postal departments, more than 80 percent were related to losses incurred in economy and credibility because of the late delivery of mail. In the past, when China had no express delivery services, it took an average of 5 to 7 days to deliver a letter from one province to another. For a remote province, it could take more than 10 days. The postal services have failed to correspond with the rapid development of the national economy. At present, the postal departments have to pay airlines a considerable amount in freight charges to transport air mail items. As this operational system faces many contradictions and problems, it cannot meet the increasing needs. The postal departments should be capable of carrying out independent operations as soon as possible. On one hand, the postal departments should consult with the aviation departments and continue postal services through the airlines. On the other, they should set up an independent postal aviation company in order to increase social efficiency. Preparations for the establishment of the new air mail service company are going smoothly in various aspects. It is being said that the preparatory work for the company has entered a new stage.
