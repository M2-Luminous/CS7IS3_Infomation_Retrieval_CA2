The official spoke as the Governor, Chris Patten, was preparing to disclose the contents of the secret Sino-British talks on political reform in Hong Kong later today. In Beijing, an official said the Chinese Government would be publishing its own account of how the talks failed after assessing the Hong Kong government's White Paper. The Beijing official said: "We would like to see what Mr Patten wants to say about the breakdown of the talks before we release our side of the story." It is understood the Chinese account will focus on its concessions during the negotiations. The Chinese official in Hong Kong said that technically there was "no 17th [final] round of talks" because Peter Lai, the deputy secretary of constitutional affairs, rejected China's compromise proposal during a preliminary discussion with the Chinese team leader, Jiang Enzhu. The Chinese compromise proposal was to give Hong Kong fully elected district boards before 1997. After the transfer of sovereignty the new government would add 100 appointed district board members to the 338 directly elected members. He said that, as the talks drew to a close, there was tentative agreement on three of the five key issues. They were: The lowering of the voting age to 18; the affirmation that district boards were to be given no executive powers; and the right of members of the National People's Congress to take part in Legislative Council elections. The issues where there was no sign of an agreement were: The abolition of appointed seats on the district boards; and whether the single vote, single seat method should be applied to all three echelons of election. A Hong Kong government official said the British side could not accept China's compromise proposals because the number of seats for the district boards was a matter to be decided by the future Special Adminstrative Region (SAR) government. He believed the Chinese compromise proposal amounted to "an undermining of the SAR's autonomy". On his arrival in Beijing for the Preliminary Working Committee meeting, a PWC member, Tsang Yok-shing, said he hoped the Chinese side would release its document on the talks as soon as possible.
