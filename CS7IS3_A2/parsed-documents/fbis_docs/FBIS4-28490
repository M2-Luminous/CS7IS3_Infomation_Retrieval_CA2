An unpublished document carried in the June issue of THIS IS YOMIURI magazine vividly reveals how the bureaucrats are casting shadows and throwing cold water on the political leadership. Following the establishment of the Hosokawa coalition government, there were calls for establishing an open economy, and the Economic Reform Study Committee [commonly called the Hiraiwa Committee] was organized. The Hiraiwa Committee submitted the interim and final reports on Japanese economic reform in November and December last year, respectively. The Hiraiwa Reports were expected to put forward strong guidelines and concrete plans to stimulate Japan's languishing economy and open its markets to the international community. However, the final report was characterized as "watered down." The Hiraiwa Committee had had two points to discuss. The first was which character to give supervisory organs in order to have them steadily carry out deregulation, a pillar of economic reform. The second point was where to set the deadline for such deregulation. If these two points are strictly determined, the regulations will be steadily relaxed; if in the end they are loosely set, economic reform ultimately will be only so much fanfare without results. Let me cite examples from THIS IS YOMIURI on these two points and quote the committee members from the bureaucracy to see how they worked to protect the interests of their particular government agencies. Following is an argument over the character to give a third-party organ to supervise the execution of deregulation. [Professor Iwao Nakatani of Hitotsubashi University] -- It is common sense in advanced nations to have an organization that raises grievances with a government's administrative branch and discuss matters. A similar supervisory organization is needed for Japan. [Yoshihiko Yoshino, presently governor of the Japan Development Bank and formerly Ministry of Finance [MOF] administrative vice minister] -- It is very difficult to set up a third-party organization for the administrative branch of government. It is going too far to have one with the character of the Fourth Estate completely independent of the administration or one that can go into administrative agencies and inspect them. [Kenichi Kakudo, chairman of Norin Chukin--the Central Bank for Agriculture and Forestry--and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] vice minister] -- It is an extraordinarily serious issue for an independent third-party organ to go into administrative agencies and inspect them. These arguments well convey the determination of committee members from the bureaucracy to prevent others from doing anything to the place of origin, the executive branch. Other committee members, who were not bureaucrats, made the following remarks regarding this. [Toshio Suzuki, chairman of the Nomura Research Institute] -- It will probably be better for Diet members themselves to propose legislation on establishing a third-party organ. Since the administrative branch is responsible for carrying out deregulation, there is no sense in having a supervisory organ created on the administrative side. It is self-evident that the legislative branch should establish such an organization. But committee members originating in the bureaucracy again put up a fierce resistance. [Former MOF Vice Minister Yoshino] -- What in the world do you mean by your calling for a legislative proposal devised by Diet members for establishing a third-party organ? If you mean that the government cannot be trusted, there is no meaning in having this group make suggestions to the government. It goes too far to propose a legislative bill. [Former MAFF Vice Minister Kakudo] -- It is going far too far. [Suzuki] The idea did not come from distrust of the government. I would like to have the legislative branch have responsibility in this matter. Through these debates, the third-party organ in charge of promoting and supervising deregulation was defined as "a strong organization, based on law, with its own independent office and the right to making recommendations." But as a matter of fact, it has become a far less independent entity compared to the Fair Trade Commission supported by Article 3 of the Law on National Administrative Organizations. Next comes the term of carrying out deregulation. [Suzuki] A five-year term was mentioned on one item. But there is no other mention of deadlines. I would like to hear the views of this committee's members. [Hiroko Ota, visiting associate professor at Osaka University] It is important to specify deadlines for abolishing regulations. [Kakudo] Regulations have their own circumstances and reasons for how and why they were introduced. So, an across-the-board deadline (for deregulation) may pose a problem. In the end, an abstract mention of "a large-scale reduction in five years" was made in the report. The report thus was watered down by resistance of the bureaucracy. The inside document made me feel that the first step to move away from being a bureaucratic nation is to make public the circumstances involving the report and to let the people see for themselves the realities of the bureaucracy.
