That was the opinion in Congress yesterday, which is also shared by Senator Pedro Simon, government leader in the Senate, and by Senator Mario Covas, PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] leader in the Senate. The blocs faithful to presidential hopefuls Paulo Maluf from the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], and to Jose Sarney and Orestes Quercia from the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], were notoriously absent from the voting session. "They were all talking about that in the Senate plenum: the presidential hopefuls estimate that if the stability plan is successful, no one will be able to compete with Fernando Henrique Cardoso," Pedro Simon told O GLOBO. "There is no need to launch a formal candidacy. No event this year can avoid being influenced by the election campaign. And it has been this way from the start," Senator Mario Covas said. Covas, who supports the candidacy of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, asserted that if he had been beside Cardoso on the rostrum when he denied being a candidate, "I would have kicked him in the ankle." Yesterday afternoon, when it was evident that the government would not obtain a quorum for approving its measures without the help of the PPR -- which declared it would obstruct the voting session, and abandoned the hall -- Covas sought out Deputy Armando Pinheiro (PPR-Sao Paulo), a Maluf supporter, to try to obtain his support. The officialist congressmen believe that the intransigent attitude of the PPR bloc simply reflects the campaign strategy of presidential hopeful Paulo Maluf. The thesis that former President Jose Sarney also helped block the approval of the stabilization plan was based on the nearly total absence of Maranhao deputies from the Chamber -- as confirmed by the appearance of Deputy Sarney Jr. (PFL-MA) [Liberal Front Party -- Maranhao] who crossed the chamber smiling, without voting or abiding the role call. "The launching of the Fernando Henrique's candidacy and the lack of political coordination has led us to this result," said Deputy Gonzaga Mota (PMDB-CE) [PMDB-Ceara], rapporteur for the stability program in the lower house.
