In the wake of the Hebron massacre and threats of Palestinian retaliation, it was nerve-racking meeting Hanna Sinyurah at his office on Nabulus Road. Sinyurah, who was heading for Tunis, said politely that our meeting would either take place at his office or no interview. Not only was he short of time, but he was short of patience for the "psychological war of fear" which separates east and west Jerusalem. Walking up two flights of stairs in the old, decrepit office building, I found Sinyurah seated behind a desk flooded with paperwork. Wearing a crewneck sweater and a trendy sports jacket, Sinyurah looked out of place in his more conservative surroundings. His manner was cool, reserved and all business; time was of the essence. Our meeting came at the end of a particularly hectic month. Named the chairman of the new International Palestine Bank, scheduled to open as soon as it received approval from the Bank of Israel and the PLO, Sinyurah had been traveling constantly between Madrid, Tunis and Israel. The bank is being established by Sinyurah and a prominent group of Palestinians, together with Bank Leumi, the Commercial Bank of Morocco and Spain's Banco Central Hispano. The consortium hopes to establish branches throughout the territories and will be involved in all banking ventures, including local and international investments, transactions and project development. Sinyurah, however, says all economic plans will remain frozen until problems in the political sphere are resolved. Sinyurah, a pharmacist and the former editor of the now-defunct AL-FAJR daily, just launched the new English-language Palestinian weekly, THE JERUSALEM TIMES. Unlike AL-FAJR, a known mouthpiece for the PLO, Sinyurah says he's trying to insure the TIMES remains independent of the powers-that-be and to turn it into a commercially viable entity; his focus is on ad revenues rather than big-name benefactors to keep it afloat. Sinyurah also serves as chairman of the European-Palestinian Chamber of Commerce and is a member of the board of trustees of the Workers' Education Association. Considered a prominent member of east Jerusalem's intelligentsia, Sinyurah boasts friends and contacts on both sides of the Green Line. An idea man bubbling with blueprints for economic prosperity in the territories. Sinyurah has nonetheless been forced to succumb to the tortoise-like movement of the peace negotiators: No peace, no bank. [Frydman] How is the delay in the peace negotiations affecting the development of the Palestine Bank? [Sinyurah] We are waiting for approval by the Bank of Israel. But the progress of the bank runs at the same rate as the peace process. Right now, everything is on hold. [Frydman] How did the Palestine Bank develop> [Sinyurah] It grew out of discussions between the Palestinians and Bank Leumi, which resulted in an agreement for the International Palestine Bank to buy branches of Bank Leumi in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This grew into a four-way partnership, which will operate all types of banking activities, with emphasis on international trade relations, investments and transfers of money in and out of the area. [Frydman] Jordan is also establishing a network of banks in the territories. Is this healthy competition, or a threat? [Sinyurah] Look, the Palestinian authorities have adopted a market economy, so we are encouraging investment. All the partners are our neighbors. We want our people, who have suffered the most, to develop the economy, but we certainly understand that we cannot do it alone and need international assistance. There is a signed agreement between the PLO and Jordan on economic cooperation. There is a similar signed agreement with the Egyptians. We are also working on such an agreement with the Israeli side. [Frydman] According to Bank Leumi, the bank's initial capital is slated to be about $40 million. Is this enough for a smooth beginning? [Sinyurah] You can actually start a bank according to regulations with $10 million. So, when you begin with $40 million it's a good start. At the same time, we will be growing. We have already been contacted by American and German interests. [Frydman] Is the bank planning any specific investments in Jerusalem? [Sinyurah] Unfortunately, the status of Jerusalem will be held off to second-stage negotiations at the peace talks. And that must change, because really this principle issue cannot be postponed. However, as far as Jerusalem goes, at the moment we have no intention of opening a branch of the bank. But the four partners will have interest in a Dutch holding company, which will have offices in Jerusalem. [Frydman] What are the bank's goals and priorities in Jerusalem? [Sinyurah] In the future, as a bank we are looking forward to investing in the infrastructure of the Palestinian economy. As a Palestinian, I am concerned that the life of east Jerusalemites will be improved. There are shortages of housing for Palestinians. There's a big gap in infrastructure as compared to that of west Jerusalem. And we feel that not only our bank but also other interests should invest in the development of the infrastructure of east Jerusalem so that it can one day be comparable to the west side's economy. [Frydman] What's your opinion of the Olmert administration as compared to the Kollek administration so far? [Sinyurah] Well, I know both Kollek and Olmert personally. Yet, at the same time, I feel that today Olmert is at the mercy of the ultra-religious community. Jerusalem has always been a right-wing city and I think he will lead the way for more tension to develop. I'm watching Olmert on issues such as housing, upgrading services, etc. I'm not going to prejudge Olmert, but we have not seen much of anything yet. [Frydman] Hindsight is 20/20. Had the residents of east Jerusalem come out to vote in the mayoral election, do you think the Palestinians would have more of a voice in City Hall? Was it a mistake? [Sinyurah] I have been involved in politics for a long time and I feel that at least under the present situation Palestinians have been denied civil rights. Palestinians did not come out to vote because it would have meant legitimizing the present state of affairs. [Frydman] Yet how else can you change the status quo? [Sinyurah] I also believe that we can emphasize our rights by establishing Palestinian prosperity and I feel that if there is Palestinian prosperity in east Jerusalem along with Israeli prosperity in west Jerusalem that can also build bridges of cooperation. I still believe in cooperation between both sides of Jerusalem, but only on an equality basis and this doesn't seem to be the case right now. [Frydman] What is your vision for the future of Jerusalem--a divided city? A unified municipality? [Sinyurah] An undivided city, but with two sovereignties in cooperation with each other. This city has its history, its two peoples. If we want to have peace we must consider this, but that does not mean that we cannot have peace, if people are sincere and understanding. Right now, there are a lot of Palestinians who are deprived of their rights. [Frydman] You wear many hats. How do you plan to juggle serving as head of the Palestinian Bank with publishing a brand new newspaper and ensuring its financial success? [Sinyurah] First of all, I come from the media. I have been working in this line of work for the past 20 years. I was out of it for a very brief period of five months and I could not stand it, which is why I came back into the business working for THE JERUSALEM TIMES. This won't take up so much of my time because I am no longer working as editor-in-chief but serve as its publisher. As far as AL-FAJR, I can tell you that the English edition of that paper never lost money. It was the financial troubles of the Arabic edition that led to the demise of both the English and Arabic papers. I also plan to enter into local radio as soon as possible. [Frydman] Let's get into the logistics of the new newspaper. Who's your target market--what's your strategy? [Sinyurah] Right now we are printing 5,000 copies weekly. We are trying to regain AL-FAJR's lost readers from the United States. Our goal is to increase our circulation to 10,000 copies. At present we have a local audience of one thousand Palestinians, but our target audience is Israelis and here I am still having a lot of problems in that market. I have about two hundred regulars, but I want to broaden this number to about three thousand. That's why I am adding a new dimension to the JERUSALEM TIMES, which will focus on the business/economic aspects of Israel, in which many Israelis are interested. This will provide Israeli businessmen with information about how the Palestinian economy is developing. We have an excellent market in major cities in the United States, which includes Middle East experts, university faculty, students, etc. AL-FAJR also used to have quite a few American-Jewish readers--our next target market. We would also like to expand the TIMES to goverment readers as well. [Frydman] Can the TIMES realistically stay a commercial paper with an even-handed viewpoint, or will it inevitably become politically biased like AL-FAJR? [Sinyurah] Well, there will be a political section in the paper. But again, my concentration will be developing the economic section. There will also be a cultural section to demonstrate the mosaic of Palestinian cultural life and people, and a religious section. [Frydman] Do you plan to open your paper to opposing viewpoints? Will Israeli writers find room on your op-ed page? [Sinyurah] We have already contributions from Israelis, a British-Jewish expert on Jerusalem, etc., so yes, our paper is open to anyone who has something to say regardless of opinion, but in a way that will build the bridges of understanding of our two peoples. At the same time, my newspaper is open to all perspectives in the Palestinian camp. [Frydman] What was the feeling in your community about the immediate condemnation of the Hebron massacre by Prime Minister Rabin, Rabbi Lau, Mayor Olmert, and the majority of the population? [Sinyurah] I can tell you that although they had expressed their outrage, Palestinians worry about how we are going to protect ourselves. [Frydman] Many Israelis perceive a double-standard here, because when terrorists strike Israelis, it seems that groups jockey to claim responsibility, and condemnation doesn't occur unless there's international pressure. [Sinyurah] That's not true. I think actions against humanity are not accepted by the Palestinians in general. And many Palestinian leaders--'Arafat and others--have condemned terror. [Frydman] What's your feeling about the Western Wall plaza being closed by police authorities for fear of violence? [Sinyurah] I think the Israeli authorities were being wise in wanting to avoid clashes. All the holy sites should be protected. Unfortunately, despite security measures we had the massacre in Hebron, so clearly the protection is not adequate. But the steps taken were appropriate. [Frydman] In light of the massacre and the fanatics on both sides of the fence, is peace a reality or are we all deluding ourselves? [Sinyurah] Look, we have no other alternative. If we allow the extremists to win then we have no future. The only way to fight back is to cooperate. We must stress education. We have to change the stereotypes. It's a long process. We are changing from a mentality of war to a new mentality of working together. It won't happen overnight. It's going to take 10, 15, 20 years. [Frydman] What is your next venture? [Sinyurah] To work at peace. I would like to remain in politics, but only in the background. My real goal is to do everything possible to improve the economic status and push forward initiatives in the area--which would stabilize the forces. We can have all the agreements in the world, but real peace will only come with economic prosperity in the occupied territories.
