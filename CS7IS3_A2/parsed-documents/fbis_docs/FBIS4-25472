From now on, the provincial government will not grant approval for the establishment of property development companies or the requisition of land for real estate projects. State macrocontrol, through controlling the total volume of credit over the last year, has brought thousands of property development companies across the province to understand a grim fact: Property development companies which have an ample supply of capital and whose projects meet market needs can gain the initiative in market competition, while those which rely only on bank loans for their existence and are interested in building luxury villas or residential units will just go bust. Statistics provided by the provincial construction commission show that property investment increased by 230 percent in 1992 over the previous year, the 1993 figure was 1.3 times that of 1992, and that property investment across the province in 1993 accounted for 37.5 percent of total infrastructure investment, clearly indicating the excessive scale of property development. Experts say, after analysis, that even if new projects are not undertaken, it will take the market several years to absorb existing real estate projects. Guangdong will not undertake any real estate projects this year. Those property development enterprises which are suffering from stockpiles of land will be required to transfer some of their land to property development companies which have abundant capital but no land, projects under construction will be continued or suspended depending on market requirements, and completed houses should be sold as soon as possible to recover capital for new development projects.
