This is a proposal worthy of our close attention. Our country started belatedly in building the market, and yet the momentum has been quite strong. We truly need to learn from the successful experiences of economically developed countries and regions in building the market and draw lessons from their failures to avoid detours as much as possible and to bring our market construction onto the path of healthy, regular, and orderly [jian kang gui fan you xu di 0256 1660 6016 5400 2589 1645 4104] development. To do this, the most important thing is to operate the market according to economic laws. The "Shanghai Joint Automobile Exchange Market," which was set up to meet demands, has blazed a new trail in operating according to market laws, and it has provided many revelations. One of the revelations is that Shanghai should seize the opportunity to make a head start in building a socialist market economic structure. Statistics show that China's automobile production and sales continued to grow in 1993, and the basic pattern is supply exceeding demand. The total number of cars produced in the country last year reached 1.3 million, while demand remained at 1.25 million or so. There are currently more than 100 automobile manufacturers, over 700 vehicle modification and special vehicle producing enterprises, and several thousand dealers. The automobile industry is a backbone of the nation's industry. While we must protect the enthusiasm for developing the automobile industry, rushing headlong into the automobile market like a swarm of bees can hardly produce the economies of scale of a large market and will make our efforts to build a uniform national market go up in smoke; this is detrimental to the interests of the producers, suppliers, and consumers. Shanghai, on the other hand, possesses favorable conditions for building a unified national automobile market. Its output of Santanas reached 100,000 last year, nearly half of the nation's total output. In addition, it has more than 300 automobile dealers and over 20 car manufacturing and vehicle modification plants. Because of the necessity to build a unified national market, it will be very important for Shanghai, which occupies an important place in China's car production and sales, to build a specialized national automobile market ahead of other places; this will help change the current state of affairs of China's automobile industry, which is suffering from clogged circulation channels of supply and demand, chaotic price signals, slow market feedback, and sluggish structural adjustment. We should exercise extreme care in building specialized markets and refrain from blindly "going for it" while disregarding existing conditions. However, we must lose no time in meticulously preparing for building the market when we are sure it is the correct thing to do, so as to allow the automobile, an important material resource, to play a bigger role in the national economy. The second revelation is that market construction must be compatible with market economic laws. For example, it is necessary to select different trading methods according to characteristics of commodities, and not simply follow the market craze. The "Joint Automobile Exchange Market" is a specialized automobile market based mainly on direct contacts and spot trading among producers, suppliers, and consumers, and is not prepared to introduce the futures trading mechanism. The practice is compatible with the general laws of market economy. There are special requirements for futures trading. For example, product standards and varieties must be simple; standardization of product quality must be easy; price fluctuation range must be wide; large quantity purchases and sales must be possible; and products must mostly be large quantities of primary products such as grains and nonferrous metals. Not all products, such as finished industrial goods, are suitable for futures trading. Automobiles are finished products, and the spot trading method is suitable as long as buyers and sellers reach agreements. In addition, there is now a balance of supply and demand for automobiles and prices have stabilized over a certain period, making automobiles unsuitable for the futures trade. In addition, the diversified range and flexible spot trading method can meet the demands of suppliers and consumers at different levels. It is also much better than the futures trading mechanism. This shows that selecting a trading method compatible with market laws is a prerequisite to normal market development. The third revelation is that in the process of market construction, the government should correctly identify its role. The "Joint Automobile Exchange Market" was organized through the leadership of the industry and commerce departments. However, it is not aimed at profit-making and the government cannot directly intervene in the market's economic activities. The government has essentially avoided committing a common error when involved in market construction, that is, extending its power in the market. In reality, when the government extends its power in economic activities it will definitely create chaos in the market. The government should only play its role in regularizing enterprise activities, safeguarding market order, and protecting operators' interests. It should only act as a "referee" and not an "athlete" who directly participates in the competition. We should particularly remember the profound lessons we have learned in the past. Building a new socialist market economic system is linked very closely to market construction. In the past, we committed errors in our undertakings and understanding in the process of market construction. By the time we realized our errors, certain opportunities were already lost. When taking the lead in building a new socialist market economic system, Shanghai must not repeat the same misfortune. Shanghai should be commended for succeeding in many of its undertakings in establishing the automobile market. Do you agree with the points discussed here?
