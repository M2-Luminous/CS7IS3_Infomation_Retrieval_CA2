I explained to his majesty ... [Dhiyab, interrupting] Mr. Minister, have there been any Arab initiatives about Yemen? [Basindwah] Mediation would be in order when you have two evenly matched sides. We are not after a military victory in order to force our control over all of Yemen. A political solution should be pursued, in the sense of securing the participation of citizens of the southern governorates in office. This is what the president intends to do -- to let southern-born Yemenis keep the positions they had previously been allocated.
