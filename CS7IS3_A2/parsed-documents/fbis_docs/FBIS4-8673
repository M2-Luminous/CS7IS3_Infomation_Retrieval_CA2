He stressed that he would do this even if he were to be brought before the State Tribunal. Since the information that 16 PSL and SLD deputies proposed amendments on 15 April to the Small Constitution (the possibility of rejecting a presidential veto in personnel issues and prolonging the period of the Sejm's functioning from the moment it is dissolved until a new parliament begins working) was released, the politicians of the coalition have been saying that they do not want a war with the Belvedere. Such statements were made both by Jozef Oleksy, who said that meetings and talks should be held, and Michal Strak, who commented on this issue as the only PSL politician ("The coalition did not and does not want a war with the president"). They also recall that for the time being it is only an initiative launched by a group of deputies and within a week the clubs will take a stance on it. Speaker Oleksy said that the amendment bill might be discussed by the Sejm at the beginning of May at the soonest. Some (Marek Borowski, for instance) believe that it is the president, not the coalition, that is heading for a conflict, and they point to the fact that it is because of him that the government has not had a deputy prime minister and finance minister for a few months now. The coalition representatives recall that Lech Walesa himself started speaking about changes in the Small Constitution -- he discussed changing the status of the National Security Council and of the Constitutional Tribunal. They also claim (Jozef Oleksy and Michal Strak, for instance) that they do not want to restrict the president's powers, because he still may or may not sign nominations. A novelty would be only the possibility of rejecting this veto in a parliamentary ballot, which would eliminate a situation in which "a paralysis of the political system is a fact." (Jerzy Jaskiernia) In a television program "Minor Skirmishes" on Sunday, Aleksander Kwasniewski said that in a dispute between the president and the prime minister the Sejm should fulfill the role of an arbiter. Lech Falandysz pointed out, however, that it would be a judge in its own case because the Sejm is dominated by the coalition which has formed this government; he stated in addition that the next step of the coalition would be nominating its own ministers in the presidential ministries. Kwasniewski said that these suspicions were too great. He also stated that the coalition would collect two-thirds of votes necessary to pass amendments to the Constitution. Coalition politicians (M. Strak, Z.Siemiatkowski, A. Kwasniewski) are not concealing the fact that the direct reason for the deputies' initiative is the deadlock that developed after Lech Walesa rejected the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati. The president cannot dissolve the Sejm because the deputies want to amend the Small Constitution, claim SLD politicians. The same opinions are voiced by Constitutional Professors Piotr Winczorek and Stanislaw Gebethner; they recall that the Sejm has established the government and passed the budget; therefore, there is no reason why it should be dissolved. It is not clear what the behavior of the other deputies' clubs would be if there were a ballot on the amendments to the Small Constitution. The opinions of politicians of the Labor Union and the Democratic Union [UD] are not unequivocal. Even though Ryszard Bugaj believes that the president's powers should be thought over, he is against any changes in the Constitution only because the coalition is going through problems. His party colleague Janusz Szymanski is of the opinion that amending the Constitution is a necessary step because when the Small Constitution was being drafted, the authors counted on activities in good faith and in conformity with the law, which is not always the case. Tadeusz Mazowiecki of UD believes that the proposal on amending the Constitution (which the parliament is entitled to do) should not be a reason to threaten to dissolve it; however, according to Jan Litynski (UD) the war with the president was started by the coalition -- when it tried to restrict his powers. UD will not take part in this dispute.
