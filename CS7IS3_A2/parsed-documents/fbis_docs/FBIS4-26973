Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, personally arrived at the field to instruct and observe an exercise, and make an important speech. During the session, Vice Chairman Zhang Zhen made a special trip to visit the All-Army Exhibition of Renovated Equipment for Night Fighting Training, whereas General Chief of Staff Zhang Wannian presided over the meeting. The on-the-spot meeting focused on the theme of resolving how should night combat and training be conducted under hi-tech conditions -- through lectures on night combat theory; exchanging experiences; demonstration maneuvers between two units, with results scored in tactics, ways of training, contents, and logistics -- while playing a role in guidance, promotion, and standardization for the whole Army to unfold in-depth reform of night exercises. The leading and related departments of various military regions and service arms in charge of training, and comrades of some command institutes and academies universally reflected that the recent on-the-spot demonstration and seminar were characterized by inheritance, as well as blazing new trails, and were very valuable at that, while opening wide the train of thought for developing the tradition of night fighting and promoting reform in night training. Various troops throughout the Army have deepened training reform over the past two years, based on the general design and arrangements made by the Central Military Commission and General Staff Headquarters. Focusing on the knotty issues in night fighting this year, the Army, Navy and Air Force have worked together to tackle the bottlenecks through concerted efforts. They figured out measures characterized by developing the strong points and avoiding weaknesses in order to find countermeasures that aim to avoid the opponent's strong points and attack its weaknesses. They worked hard at contention in intelligence and courage, determined moves giving play to the Army's might in integrity, and reformed technological equipment while creating new tactics. As a result, a whole range of night fighting tactics and ways of night training having characteristics of the times, as well as of our Army, gradually have taken shape, which brought along the comprehensive study in combat and training issues under hi-tech conditions, and promoted in-depth development throughout the reform of training. The recent on-the-spot demonstration placed the main results of night training reform, which reflected the joint efforts and pooled wisdom of the officers and men of the whole Army, under the test of a live exercise in fighting tactics. For the first time in our Army's history of training, live exercises in night fighting tactics on the scale of a reinforced infantry division, as well as of a reinforced tank regiment, were conducted. For the first time, a live ground exercise in fighting tactics was conducted with the air arm, airborne troops, and Air Force units under ground force command working in coordination. This has augmented faith in night combat, while finding solutions to both the ways and means. During the meeting, Military Commission Vice Chairmen Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, Chief of General Staff Zhang Wannian, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Li Jing, and Cao Gangchuan; Xu Caihou, deputy director of the General Political Department; Zhao Nanqi, commandant of the Academy of Military Sciences; Zhu Dunfa, commandant of PLA National Defense University; Wu Quanxu, assistant to the chief of general staff; Zhou Liangyou, deputy director of the General Logistics Department; and comrades participating in the all-Army on-the-spot demonstration of reform in night fighting and night training; visited the exhibition of all-Army night vision equipment, and renovated equipment for night fighting and night training. On display at this exhibition were renovated night fighting reconnaissance, camouflage, command, and countermeasure equipment with which our Army already has been equipped. They all were researched and manufactured with the Army's own efforts. All this showed that the level of our Army's night combat equipment has greatly improved, and the means of night vision and night combat have been markedly elevated. In his important speech at the meeting, Vice Chairman Liu stressed that all PLA troops must deepen research on issues concerning combat under hi-tech conditions. He said: Issues of combat under hi-tech conditions are an entirely new topic. What we were familiar with in the past was entirely incompatible with the demands of future combat. It is imperative to strengthen research on this issue, and to think of ways and countermeasures to develop our military thinking, strategies and tactics. Focal efforts should be exerted on studying and researching hi-tech warfare. Regarding hi-tech warfare, general knowledge about it is not enough, nor is general research; genuine efforts and hard work are called for. Whether in studying high-tech knowledge or research in hi-tech warfare, our leading comrades at all levels -- especially chief military officers and political commissars or instructors -- must do a good job in playing an exemplary role, take the lead in study, earnestly think how they should plan for the development of army building and improvement of army combat effectiveness. Efforts must be made to inherit and develop our Army's traditional tactics. The strategies and tactics of the people's war were a magic wand for our Army to win victory over the enemy; we will always inherit its basic concepts. However, regarding specific fighting tactics, we must proceed from the characteristics of combat under hi-tech conditions, while continuously developing them and blazing new trails. It is necessary to grasp those key and difficult points that have a bearing on the overall situation, and to tackle those bottlenecks with focused efforts, resolving them one after another. All sides, departments, and levels should work with concerted efforts, pool their wisdom, and grasp implementation to seek development. Vice Chairman Liu required officers and men of the whole Army to do a good job in bringing forward the tradition of the Red Army and of army building in accordance with the general requirement of Chairman Jiang's "five-point instruction," to provide staunch and powerful security insurance for reform, opening up, and modernization, and to live up to the trust of the party and people. At the meeting, Chief of General Staff Zhang expounded on how to deepen reform in night training. He indicated that to continue to deepen reform in night training, it is imperative to grasp firmly the core issue of developing and creating new night combat tactics. To achieve this, it is necessary to do a good job of grasping five important links: First, we should proceed from the new fighting tactics of our opponent in creating our own. Second, we should proceed from giving play to the effects of existing weapons and equipment to create new fighting tactics. Third, it is necessary to proceed from the characteristics of future battlefields in creating new fighting tactics. Fourth, we should proceed from resolving the difficult point of hi-tech warfare creating new fighting tactics. Fifth, it is necessary to proceed from developing our Army's flexible strategies and tactics to create new fighting tactics. These five links are the chief channels in the reform of fighting tactics, as well as the important signs for testing fighting tactics. They reflect the organic combination of the subjective and the objective, common nature and individuality, and inheritance and development; they are interrelated with mutual infiltration. Only by analyzing and studying them in synthesis will it be possible to create new fighting tactics.
