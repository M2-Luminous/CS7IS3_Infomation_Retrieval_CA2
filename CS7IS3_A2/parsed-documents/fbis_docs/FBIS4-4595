Babbling [todulda] about North Korea's fictitious nuclear development, the warmonger let loose a bellicose, reckless remark [mangbal] that the United States is prepared to stop nuclear development even at the risk of unleashing a war on the Korean peninsula. He cried [koadoeda] that the United States made a series of military preparations for it. The warmonger clearly revealed a plot to isolate [korip], crush [apsal] us, and openly threatened [nogolchoguro wihyop] us by saying that the U.S. strategy is to take step-by-step pressures by isolating North Korea and that more serious measures will be taken in the future. Perry frankly confessed that the spare parts for U.S. combat planes and ground crews were taken to military bases in South Korea and Japan, that the South Korean puppets are preparing some kind of weapons, and that preparations for deploying launching pads for Patriot missiles in South Korea are proceeding. He even let loose an open war outburst [nogolchogin chonjaeng pogon] without hesitation that the United States will strike an overwhelming aerial blow within 24 hours against someone's provocation. Perry raved [todulda] that he will have in-depth talks with the South Korean puppets during his planned junket [haenggak] to South Korea on not only simple military countermeasures but also on when, how, and why the military measures should be taken. In this way, he himself revealed that his junket is an out-and-out war junket aimed at giving a new order after examining war preparing troops in South Korea. The warmonger's bellicose remark, which coincides with the U.S. bellicose class' commotions [sodong] aimed at pressuring the Republic, vividly shows that it is none other than the United States that leads the situation on the Korean peninsula to confrontation and war.
