First reluctantly, then the floodgates open. He is shut up at home, like a caged lion, studying, writing, and meditating after his defeat in October 1993, a defeat that burns like the white parliament building burned. The former vice president is contemplating retaliation, but it is no easy matter. Yeltsin is still in the Kremlin, and the opposition is hardly the picture of unity. He would like to be its leader, but agreement is hard to reach. The matter will be on the agenda of the major "patriotic assembly" scheduled for September. Target: the presidential elections. A month ago, Rutskoy said: "We will defeat the regime in May 1995." Is that how it will be? "I said that we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in different conditions, when a regime that is against the people is no longer in power. We must build up a mass movement, a popular movement, that will win power." [Sergi] You have given a movement of this type two years to grow... [Rutskoy] Yes, a phase that we refer to as "accumulation of capital" is needed. We envisage permanent membership and rigid discipline, almost like a party, but converting the movement into a party is the long-term prospect. The purpose of the movement will be to unite the various socially-oriented patriotic currents. [Sergi] You have complained that the opposition failed to win owing to lack of unity... [Rutskoy] October 1993 was not only a tragedy, it was the crucial moment in which the dice were cast for the fate of the state: It had to choose between a road leading nowhere and the path toward a democratic society enjoying social justice. But there was no popular mass movement, no united opposition with a concrete platform, so the opposition was defeated. The other parties merely fled, communists included. There was just Rutskoy... [Sergi] However, you have criticism for yourself as well? [Rutskoy] Of course, but Rutskoy stood firm. He did not run away; he held out to the end. Those who held out to the end with me were the dead, the wounded, and the mutilated. When they ask me now who I believe in, I say that I believe in those who defended the power of the people and democracy in those decisive days. Those in whom I do not believe are the ones who watched the tragedy from a distance and are now trying to take the credit as saviors of the people. [Sergi] Do you not think that, to build up a mass political movement, you will also have to talk to people whose views are not identical to your own? [Rutskoy] In the initial phase, the purpose of the movement is to unite parties and movements. The opposition must have clear goals and strategies rooted in the law. Man lives by objective and subjective laws. Equality before the law means democracy, and man must be able to live decently, to develop his potential without limits and restrictions, with rights, freedom, and social guarantees. Moreover, if Russia wishes to remain a state, it must obviously remain a major power. [Sergi] And how can this strategic project be accomplished? [Rutskoy] First of all, it needs stability, and words are not enough: There must be deeds. There is no need to sign agreements on social harmony to render a society stable; priorities must be set: housing, food and clothing supplies, health, education, the environment, six issues that affect social stability. But respect for the law, social discipline, behavior according to certain rules, discipline at work, and discipline in business to prevent it from becoming speculation are needed as well. It must all be rooted in the law. And the president will follow. Mussolini used to say, more or less, that the duce elected by the people was above the law. We all know what became of him. [Sergi] Will you manage to win the Russians over in two years? [Rutskoy] The movement can have a future when the leader and the movement itself present a definite, clear platform to the people. How long have I taken to explain it to you? Five minutes. Have you understood what I have said? What can be deleted from my scheme of things? If we take out the law, the Constitution will collapse. The president must not be someone who seizes control of all the command buttons. The Constitution, which, moreover, was approved with distortions, does not envisage presidential responsibility. If I were president, the first thing I would do is add a chapter establishing the responsibilities of the citizen and the public officials referred to in the Constitution. But nothing changes here. First we had the emperor, then the "gensek." The same people, painted in a different color, are still in the Kremlin today. Yeltsin has torn up his party membership card. Before, he was a... handball player, then he tore up his membership card and became a tennis player. [Sergi] Do you think the leader of the movement and the presidential candidate will necessarily be you? [Rutskoy] It would be immodest to say it must be me. However, it must be a person who stood up in October 1993. The nation cannot have a leader who lurked in the bushes. If someone like that appears on the scene, I shall never give way. Giving way to someone who turned tail at the decisive moment would mean getting the same thing that we have now. I entered politics in 1990, I am neither one of the nomenklatura, nor a bureaucrat, nor a civil servant. I came in off the streets. I used to fly, I served in the Air Force, I fought. My ideas were not born today; I brought them into politics with me in 1990, and I have never backed down from my position. I have finished writing a book on "The Fall of the Empire," and I have begun work on another, "The Acquisition of Trust." Russia is a country of extraordinary wealth, but it does not know how to use it in the interests of the nation. I have never entertained ideas of dominating the world, nor has Russia ever laid claim to superiority. Russia and the Soviet Union have played a stabilizing role in the world system. Russia must now regain this role, and so it must be powerful and democratic, with a just society. The state has always taken first place here, ideology relegating man to second place. But my ideology brings man right to the fore. Any idea can be discredited, buried in the dust. Hitler killed off the idea of national socialism, Yeltsin has done so for the idea of democracy. Of course, quoting Hitler as an example... but what can you do? It is history. [Sergi] As far as one can make out, everyone, starting with yourself, in this phase of Russian political history, has gone for the issue of patriotic nationalism, but everyone sees it in his or her own way. Yourself, Zhirinovskiy, Solzhenitsyn, and even Yeltsin... [Rutskoy] But if you read Solzhenitsyn's essay on the set-up that he envisages for Russia, you will see that his vision matches mine perfectly. The only thing on which I disagree with Solzhenitsyn is his view that Russia must not aspire to major power status. I, and I am not alone in this, am convinced that weakness merely inspires compassion and that only strength can engender respect. Russia will not be accorded respect as long as it is weak. Yes, the term "patriotic" is being bandied about by a lot of people, but what sort of patriotism is Yeltsin's if he has dismantled the Soviet Union? Nazi Germany failed to defeat the power that was the USSR in four years. Three drunken idiots, acting hand in glove, signed a document demolishing that power while the fourth -- Gorbachev -- went off and left them to it because he lacked the strength of mind to stop them. The responsibility for the destruction of this power rests on those four men. And look at the humiliating situation into which Russia has fallen thanks to Yeltsin's patriotism, and look how Kozyrev is behaving. His foreign policy is no better than a doormat. The "Americanization" of foreign policy has brought us what we have in Russia today, and look at the result: The celebrations for the anniversary of the Normandy landings have taken place without Russian participation. As for Zhirinovskiy's patriotism, it is idiotism, not patriotism. [Sergi] But who is Zhirinovskiy talking to? [Rutskoy] There is a vacuum, and, as we know, nature abhors a vacuum, so it gets filled with Zhirinovskiy. [Sergi] Do you really believe that Russia can be reborn? [Rutskoy] The USSR cannot be reborn in the form in which it existed before. It was a cow that used to chew the cud in its head in Russia and had its udder in the republics for milking. I would not need a union along those same lines. Anyone who wants to come back into Russia as a subject of the Federation is welcome to do so, the doors are open. Those who choose not to, well, it is their own business. But relations with the latter must be based on international principles: The frontiers will be closed, and gas, electricity, oil, and raw materials will all have to be sold at world market prices. After a month, the peoples of those nations will throw their leaders out. There is no need to drag anyone kicking and screaming into Russia; they will come of their own accord, and it will be a union of peoples, a state that has regained its historical perspective. The frontiers must be strictly closed. At the slightest sign of disrespect toward Russia, electricity, gas, and all other supplies will be cut off. We shall send a wagonload of cognac with our congratulations upon complete independence. A month later those same rulers will no longer be in government, as they will have been kicked out by their own peoples. [Sergi] But this is what Zhirinovskiy is promising too... [Rutskoy] No, by no means. He has other mechanisms in mind. [Sergi] So you think there can be a second union, but that joining will be voluntary, not by annexation. [Rutskoy] Absolutely voluntary annexation. All that it will take will be a referendum, then it will be back into Russia as a member of the Federation with equal economic and political rights. [Sergi] Are you not afraid that a platform like that might alarm the rest of the world? [Rutskoy] What fears could it raise? Did the Soviet Union ever hold Italy in its power or say it had national interests in Italy? Then why not be afraid of the United States, which sent planes to bomb Yugoslavia from Italian territory? Why fear the USSR and not the United States? The world is an axis, and the axis is the sword. It all depends on who holds it by the hilt. The axis is more stable when it rests on two supports: one power and another power. On the other hand, if a single power holds the axis... [Sergi] Do you miss the days when there were two superpowers? [Rutskoy] I miss nothing. I say this is the way it must be, and, if I become president, this is how it will be. I know how to do it; without intimidation. I know how to build up relations in such a way that they do not regard you as an enemy. [Sergi] Would you sign the NATO's Partnership for Peace now? [Rutskoy] No. It is not a Partnership for Peace, it is a partnership for subjugating Russia. No patriot would ever sign a document like that, as it would be a betrayal of the nation. [Sergi] What do you have to say about the forthcoming G-7 meeting? [Rutskoy] Russia will never be a member of the Big Seven. The G-7 will never become the G-8 as long as Russia is in a humiliating position. [Sergi] But Russia is a country rich in resources... [Rutskoy] The USSR experienced a 17-percent drop in national income over the four years of the World War. It has plummeted by 45 percent in the three years of the reforms. Industrial output fell by 24 percent in four years of war, and it has now fallen by 60 percent. [Sergi] I imagine you will have read Yeltsin's book. Is the anecdote about the Italian shoes that you recommended to the president to improve his image true? [Rutskoy] Quite true, but he left out the fact that he took those shoes. And he also took clothes and everything else that some Italian friends of mine had brought me.
