The ceremony began at 0930 local time at the ceremonies hall of the Intercontinental Hotel at (?Koume Palace) and was marked by speeches from Higher Education Minister Michel Anchouey and (Yves Oualele), secretary general at the Office of the Prime Minister, and by Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba. Moussa Mounguegui, you were present at this ceremony. Please, summarize what transpired: [Mounguegui] On behalf of his fellow cabinet members, the minister of higher education praised the job done by the prime minister as manager of Omar Bongo's presidential campaign and as head of government, a government that ably handled the transition period from the national conference to the organization of presidential elections on 5 December last year. In spite of the unfavorable social and political atmosphere, the government did not fail in its mission. Those who compose the adminstration are happy to work with Mr. Oye-Mba, Minister Michel Anchouey added. The secretary general at the Office of the Prime Minister observed that 1993 was rich in lessons, and hoped that 1994 would be marked by new vitality. Mr. (Yves Oualele) seized the opportunity to present to the head of government workers' overall concerns. Beside duties, the worker also has rights. For this reason, the secretary general at the Office of the Prime Minister called for the setting up a higher civil service council as soon as possible. In his reply, the head of government acknowledged that 1993 was rich in events and lessons. For him, 1994 will enable us to evaluate these lessons. Now that the transition period has ended with the presidential election, deservingly won by Mr. Omar Bongo, Mr. Casimir Oye-Mba made it a point to caution, in his words, those who are making capital out of Mr. Bongo's victory. To his detractors, the prime minister stated that he was not yet finished, and that he remained cool and composed. The head of government congratulated his cabinet and office aides for the work they have done. To workers, the prime minister gave the reminder that rights and duties go hand in hand. Mr. Oye-Mba then expressed the government's intention to resume discussions with international finance institutions. In conclusion, he expressed the following wishes to Gabon and its people. He was speaking to Philippe Tonda: [Begin Bongo recording] I wish our country peace, civil peace, without which nothing can ever be undertaken, or built. My wish for our our country is that the political pluralism which we have instituted lead us to democracy, because I am among those who think that we do not really have democracy yet. So far as I am concerned, democracy is not the constitution that enshrines it, nor is it just the constitutional court, which interprets that constitution, nor is it just the National Communications Council, which regulates the audiovisual landscape. Democracy is first and foremost accepting other men, accepting living with other men, agreeing to live together not only with our affinities and similarities -- and, surely, these are legion -- but also with our differences and dissimilarities, since this is the reality of human nature. Most fortunately in our our country, the things that unite us are many. We are a small country: 1 million inhabitants on an area of nearly 290,000 square km --that is really very little. Surely, you have gone around Gabon just like me. Our country is empty in terms of men. Now, it is men who, in reality, constitute the primary wealth of nations. I would like here to reecho an idea which has permeated the minds of Gabonese, and according to which the fact of our country being so richly endowed by nature is enough. I say that is not true. My wish as we enter 1994 is that democracy really take root in the daily behavior of each one of us, in our actions and in our attitudes, in our way of reasoning and, once more -- hopefully -- in our hearts. My wish also is that our country settle down to work and that it restore growth. A short while ago, you mentioned the prescriptions of the Bretton Woods institutions. I contend that we must resume talks with the IMF and the World Bank, not because I consider their therapies to be always correct -- not at all. In fact, I know a thing or two about these institutions. But in the world as it is today we have no choice -- we have no choice. So we must resume active -- since there has never been a complete break -- discussions with these institutions. In fact, it is very easy to lay the blame on the Bretton Woods institutions. But if we did not have problems, we would not be compelled to go and see people in Washington. It is up to us to manage to develop our potentials and manage our resources in such a way that we never find it necessary to go and see the people in Washington. [end recording]
