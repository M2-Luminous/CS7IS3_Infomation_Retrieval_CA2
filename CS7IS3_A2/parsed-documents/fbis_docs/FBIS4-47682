This was announced by the chief director of election administration, Mr. Piet Colyn, at a news conference a short while ago. Mr. Colyn said the final provisional count would be made known by early tomorrow morning. He said good progress was being made and minor problems were being ironed out. [Begin Colyn recording] By 5 o'clock this afternoon a high percentage of the counting will be completed. We have experienced problems with the counting, especially in two areas. The one area is where we have a voting venue comprising various voting stations. To give you examples: the one at Nasrec [National Exhibition Center], Pretoria show grounds, the exhibition center in Durban. These are well in progress now and those results will start coming in. The other area is the outlying parts of the country where you have tremendous logistical problems to do with counting. I'm confident that the counting of votes will more or less be completed by midnight tonight. We get positive reports from all over the country. As far as Northern Transvaal is concerned, problems experienced there, I'm quite sure, they have been resolved now. We have sent in expert teams to assist it. And today we can specialize on those kinds of problems that we still experience and identify the particular individual voting station still experiencing problems, and send in teams to assist with the counting in those stations.
