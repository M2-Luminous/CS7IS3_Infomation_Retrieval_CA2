Cao Zhigang, an 11-year-old boy living in the mountainous Jinggang area of Jiangxi Province recently wrote a letter of thanks to Fang Lue, a teacher at the Beijing-based Central Institute of Finance and Banking, who has been providing him with a stipend. In the letter Cao said he had scored an average of 99 out of the possible 100 points in all subjects in his final exams last term. He also sent to Fang a parcel of sunflower seeds he had picked himself. His letter was carried in advertisements for the "Hope Project" distributed in Beijing and other major cities all over China. Specifically, the project involves mobilizing people from all walks of life to finance the re-entry to school of dropout students in poor rural areas. New China has made great progress in education since its founding in 1949. However, owing to the uneven economic growth, insufficient funding for education in poor rural areas and the low incomes of many rural families, an estimated one million school-age children drop out each year throughout China. Since the China Juvenile Development Fund initiated the "Hope Project" nationwide in October 1989, tens of millions of Chinese have donated a total of 200 million yuan to the fund. Many Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots, as well as Chinese nationals residing abroad, have also donated money to the project. As a result, 200 "Hope Primary Schools" have been built in poor areas in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Qinghai and Gansu provinces in northwest China, as well as in Yunnan, Guizhou, Shanxi and Gansu provinces. An official of the China Juvenile Development Fund said that China has about 70 million urban families, 50 million of which are relatively well off. If one percent of the 50 million families support the "Hope Project," half a million children from poor families will be able to receive an education, he said. The project is well known all over China, thanks to the showing of movies and TV series, and the publication of books in support of the project, as well as widespread reporting by the mass media. Xu Yongguang, secretary-general of the fund, said that the fund has introduced a whole range of systems in such areas as accepting donations, deciding on who should receive financing and building primary schools. He said that China currently has 10 million children who cannot afford an education. "The `Hope Project' has enabled 540,000 students to receive an education. So we can only say that initial success has been scored," he said. The amount of donations for the project in the first three months of this year far exceeds that for the same period in 1993, he said. The projects to be undertaken this year should finance the education of a half a million students and the construction of 100 primary schools, he said. He said that delegates to a conference on the project held earlier this year decided to basically solve the problem of dropouts within the remainder of the century and assist the Chinese Government in making nine-year compulsory education universal by the end of the century.
