Commission To Hold En Banc Hearing on Children's Television (MM Docket No. 93&hyph;48) The Federal Communications Commission will hold an en banc hearing on children's television on Tuesday, June 28, 1994. The hearing will convene at 9 a.m. in Room 856, at 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC, and will be open to the public. The Commission has determined that it would be useful to hear oral presentations and a direct exchange of viewpoints on the issues raised in the pending children's television proceeding. The issues in this proceeding focus on the Commission's current definition of informational and educational programming and the amount of informational and educational programming a broadcaster must air to meet its obligation to children under the Children's Television Act. The Commission had earlier issued a Notice of Inquiry, 8 FCC Rcd 1841 (1993) (58 FR 14367, March 17, 1993), in this proceeding, comments were filed on May 7, 1993, and reply comment were filed on June 7, 1993. Parties wishing to make oral presentations and appear on panels to debate issues at this hearing should submit written requests by close-of-business, Wednesday, May 11, 1994, to: Larry A. Miller, Video Services Division, Mass Media Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW._room 702, Washington, DC 20554. Such requests should clearly identify the speaker, the organization represented (if any), relevant experience and training, and the specific topic(s) to be discussed. Appropriate topics include any issues related to the NOI , and specifically comments on changes in the availability, quantity, quality and effectiveness of programming directed to the educational and informational needs of children, including standard-length programming, that have occurred between the enactment of the Children's Television Act of 1990 and the present. The Commission is also interested in comments on the economics of providing educational and informational programming for children either to the home or to the classroom. Depending on the number of requests, it may be necessary to limit the number of presenters. If so, we will select speakers for the hearing in order to achieve broad representation of different viewpoints. With this in mind, interested parties wishing to present similar material are encouraged to propose a single representative or consolidated presentation. The precise format and schedule for the en banc hearing, as well as a list of the selected presenters, will be specified in a future public notice; however, we anticipate that presentations will be limited to no more than five minutes. Persons selected to appear will be required to submit to the Secretary by close-of-business, Wednesday, June 8, 1994, an original and 9 copies of the proposed remarks, a summary of those remarks of no more than two pages, a brief speaker biography, and a description of the organization represented. In addition, 21 copies of the material submitted to the Secretary must be submitted to the Video Services Division by close-of-business on June 8, 1994. Interested persons not desiring to participate or not selected to participate in the en banc hearing may file written comments on June 8, 1994. Persons filing written comments only should comply with Sections 1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules. Persons wishing to respond to testimony presented at the hearing are invited to do so by July 15, 1994. For more information contact Larry Miller, Video Services Division, (202) 632&hyph;6993.
