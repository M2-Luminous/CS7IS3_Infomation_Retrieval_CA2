Roman Herzog rejected general dual citizenship. He was criticized for that by the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. Still, the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] hopes that the FDP will support Herzog in the third ballot. The CDU/CSU has threatened that the climate in the coalition will deteriorate if the FDP does not comply with its wishes. Will your party yield to pressure? [Schwaetzer] No, on no account. It would be better for the CDU/CSU to cease these threatening gestures because this is no way to behave between partners. It is simply bad form. By the way, the threats will certainly have an effect on the FDP, but by no means the desired one. The FDP will discuss its future plans completely independently between the individual ballots. The FDP will support Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. We have an excellent presidential candidate. It would have been good for the CDU/CSU if it had endorsed our fine candidate instead of desperately searching for a candidate of its own. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Anyway, the FDP will not yield to pressure. We will calmly discuss our behavior in every individual ballot. [Welter] Thus, we have to discuss the hypothetical case that, after the deliberations between the ballots, you might arrive at the conclusion that Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher will not participate in the third ballot. This possibility cannot be ruled out completely. Will it then be possible for the FDP to vote for candidate Herzog whom it criticized strongly in the past? [Schwaetzer] A candidate that has been nominated by another party is never the ideal or desired candidate of the Liberals. Thus, the FDP will have to deliberate carefully which candidate it should support. I am optimistic that the FDP will vote largely unanimously for a certain candidate. This might require a longer process of discussion, but this is the way many decisions are made within the FDP. My personal opinion is -- I already stressed this before some of the candidates were nominated -- that what we need in the next five years is a president who can build bridges, who can bring people together, and who does not polarize society. Particularly because other countries are observing Germany with a sharp eye, it is very important for the head of state himself to represent a confidence-building measure. [Welter] You have just described the qualities of the future president. Yet, you mention no name. [Schwaetzer] This is not my task at the moment. We support Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, and we will vote for her. [passage omitted]
