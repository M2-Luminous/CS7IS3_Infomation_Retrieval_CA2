FR940622-1-00046 FR940622-1-00013 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 63 [AD-FRL&hyph;5002&hyph;4] National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories: Early Reductions Program High Risk List Amendment AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ACTION: Proposed rule and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: On December 29, 1992, the EPA promulgated final regulations implementing the Early Reductions Program under section 112(i)(5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA). As part of that rulemaking, EPA designated a list of high risk hazardous air pollutants and limited the use of offsetting reductions in other hazardous air pollutants as counting towards the required reductions in high-risk pollutants. The proposed standards would delete acrylic acid (CAS No. 79107) from the list of high-risk pollutants. This action would be in accordance with the terms of a settlement agreement reached in the following case: Basic Acrylic Monomer Manufacturers v EPA, No. 93&hyph;1179 (D.C. Cir.). DATES: Comments. Comments must be received on or before August 8, 1994. Public Hearing. If anyone contacts EPA requesting to speak at a public hearing by July 13, 1994, a public hearing will be held on July 22, 1994, beginning at 9 a.m. Persons interested in attending a hearing should call Ms. Linda Tilley at (919) 541&hyph;5648 to verify that a hearing will be held.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The information presented in this preamble is organized as follows: I. Background II. Summary of and Rationale for Proposed Rule III. Administrative Requirements 1. Background On December 29, 1992, the EPA promulgated final regulations implementing the Early Reductions Program under section 112(i)(5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7412 (i)(5), 57 FR 61970 (December 29, 1992). As part of that rulemaking, EPA designated a list of 47 high risk hazardous air pollutants and limited the use of offsetting reductions in other hazardous air pollutants as counting towards the required reductions in high-risk pollutants by assigning these pollutants various weighting factors. Acrylic acid (CAS No. 79107) was designated as a high-risk pollutant and was assigned a weighting factor of 10.
