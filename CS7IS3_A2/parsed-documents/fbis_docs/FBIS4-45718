Its cost in damage to buildings, crops and trees is hard to calculate, but they believe curbing it will save between £1 billion and £2.3 billion. Pending European agreements will cut British sulphur emissions by 80 per cent by 2010, stopping further damage in all but 5 per cent of the country and allowing lakes, rivers, trees and heather to start recovering. Scientists have been studying "critical loads" -- the point at which acid rain begins to kill or injure plants, animals, and fish. But damage to buildings is also severe and some ancient cathedrals have been irreparably eroded. In chalky areas, where the acid is neutralised as it falls, there is virtually no effect on soils. In areas of granite, peat or sand where there is natural acidity, the extra acid falling as rain kills fish and plants and damages trees. The Government has already overseen a 30 per cent reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions from the 1980 level. Last week officials agreed to take this to 50 per cent by 2000, 70 per cent by 2005, and 80 per cent by 2010. Ministers are expected to agree the new protocol in the next few days. Although the targets appear drastic, the Government is likely to achieve them by closing the coal mines and switching from coal to gas-fired power generation. Gas does not produce the sulphur for acid rain. Maps produced by scientists show that 121,000 square kilometres of the UK is being damaged by acid rain out of a total of 250,000 square kilometres. This will be reduced to 14,000 square kilometres if the targets are met. Even so, the ceasing of acid rain does not guarantee the reversal of the process of damage. In some areas it may be 20 years or more before the biological life begins to recover, and in many the soil structure has changed so much that the plant and fish life which recolonises will be different from the original.
