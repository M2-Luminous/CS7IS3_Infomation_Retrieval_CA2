Top INPE officials are meeting in Brasilia today with leaders from 10 African countries, also interested in using the satellite's resources. According to Minister Israel Vargas, the Brazilian Space Agency, a civilian body, will circumvent the boycotts encountered by Brazil in the transfer of sensitive technology from the developed nations. "Our space program is strictly peaceful," he observed. In the minister's opinion, the new space agency will enable Brazil to enter the low-altitude communications satellite market. "One of the agency's first assignments is to reexamine the entire Brazilian space program," he said. At present, the Ministry of Science and Technology has signed major space cooperation agreements with China and is studying a partnership with Argentina.
