In a survey conducted by the pressure group, Hong Kong Policy Viewers, only 26 per cent of 660 respondents said the PWC represented Hong Kong people. Forty per cent said the group did not represent them while the remaining respondents, or 32 per cent, said they doubted whether the PWC would represent their views. The people who were questioned also said they were dissatisfied with the present representation and appointment system of the PWC. PWC members are appointed by the Chinese government on the recommendations of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the Xinhua News Agency, China's de facto embassy in the territory. The poll found that 63 per cent of the respondents were dissatisfied with the choice and the manner in which the PWC members were appointed, while only 15 per cent said they were satisfied. Spokesman for Hong Kong Policy Viewers, Simon Chiu, said these figures showed the PWC did not have much credibility in the eyes of Hong Kong people. During the recent political row between Britain and China, Governor Chris Patten said the PWC did not represent the view of Hong Kong people. But Chinese officials have maintained the PWC spoke for the people of Hong Kong. Chiu called on the Chinese government to appoint people from different political camps to make it more accountable to the people of Hong Kong so that it will have the trust of the people of Hong Kong. He said some of the PWC's meetings should be opened to the public and the press. "By opening some parts of their meetings to the press, people in Hong Kong can find out what the PWC is doing and have a better understanding of its function," Chiu said. He also called on the Chinese government to set up a better channel through which the public can to express its views to the PWC. [sentence as published] The survey found that 48 per cent of respondents did not believe the existing channel would allow the PWC to gather their views while 31 per cent had reservations. Chiu said the Hong Kong Policy Viewers would ask to meet PWC members to voice their concerns. The survey was carried out in the last two weeks of December.
