Ye Qing, Vice-Minister of the State Planning Committee, said telecommunications have been a bottleneck in the national economy despite momentous growth in the last few years. Major difficulties have been the lack of capital, technology and proper management, Ye said over the weekend at the International Conference on China's Telecommunications. The conference, held in Beijing, was called to provide China with international expertise and perspectives in its determined effort to improve telecommunications. It was organized by the State Planning Committee and sponsored by Morgan Stanley and Co, Arthur Andersen and Co, Captel International and Baker and McKenzie. Ye said China is receptive to international suggestions in drafting its telecommunications development strategy for the 1990s. It is predicted that by 2000 domestic demand for telephones will soar to 30 million to 50 million. The demand for fax machines will be 2 million to 3 million; for mobile phones 4 million to 6 million; and for programme-controlled exchanges, 18 million to 23 million lines. Wu Xiaolong, director-general of the Ministry of Electronics Industry's overall development department, said that in the remainder of this century priority will be given to developing programme-controlled exchanges, fibre-optic networks, and mobile, satellite and microwave telecommunications systems. He predicted that telecommunications industrial output will surpass 100 billion yuan ($11.5 billion) by 2000, over 15 percent of the country's entire electronics production. By then, Wu said, the technical level of major telecommunications products in China will match the international norms of the mid-1990s. The Ministry of Electronics Industry has taken on the country's most ambitious development plan: to build an information superhighway, The plan has three major parts. First comes the Golden Bridge, a telecommunications network linking departments of the State Council with 30 provinces and autonomous regions, 500 cities, 12,000 large- and medium-sized enterprises, 100 leading business groups and the country's key projects. Second comes the Golden Customs which will link authorities managing foreign trade, foreign exchange control and customs with foreign trade enterprises. This will speed up the handling of customs statistics, tax rebates, cash settlement and verification of licenses and certifications of country of origin. The third is the Golden Card project in 10 coastal cities with the aim to replace cash with checks and credit cards. Wu reiterated that China welcomes foreigners to invest in the domestic manufacture of telecommunications equipment, Meocre Li, a senior manager with Arthur Andersen, said his auditing and consulting firm is working on the first direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange of a Chinese-incorporated power-generation company.
