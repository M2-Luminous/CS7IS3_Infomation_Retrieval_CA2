Sound Proudly." We intend to write ourselves, and we are also inviting the readers, specialists, producers, and dealers to share their views on the production and sale of Lithuanian consumer goods. In the opinion of the editorial board, the problems in this sphere are numerous. Why did some enterprises fail to restructure their production to meet market demands? Why do many Lithuanian quality goods not have demand on the domestic market? Why are imported goods so much in demand on our market, the majority of which are neither better nor cheaper than ours? We will try to stir producers' responsibility and customers' respect for trademarks with the inscription "Made in Lithuania." [Klimasauskas] This is a good idea. I have been thinking for a long time that we must be a nation of nihilists. We are unable to rejoice at our successes, a few of which we have achieved. As true provincials, we loathe everything that is homemade. We boast only of the past, as aged people.... Many politicians do not even want to see the sun over their heads, to say nothing of the obvious economic stabilization. Nor do consumers value homemade goods on the commodity market due to the same nihilistic attitude. Without optimism and self-respect, however, we will not achieve anything or be interesting to others. We really have something to boast about. Many light industry enterprises work stably and sell their production without difficulty. Those who have worn Lithuanian knitted clothes, eaten products from the dairy plant in Birzai, sat on furniture with upholstery manufactured in "Audejas" [weaver], worn suits made by "Lelija" [lily], drunk coffee from "Jesia's" china cups, will not find fault with them. "Snaige" [snowflake] refrigerators and freezers are in demand both on the domestic and foreign markets. The output of refrigerators, portable television sets, and bicycles climbed by 166, 110, and 107 percent, respectively, over the last year. Our estimations are based not on the financial results that can be manipulated but on output units. Thus, they can be trusted. The situation in the food processing industry is more difficult. The production of many food stuffs is declining, and they are replaced by an increasing number of imported goods. Lithuania is losing both the foreign market it has had and its own market. We used to boast about "feeding Russia," but we have become food importers. The first reason is the improper beginning of the agrarian reform which was a terrible blow to food producers. The second reason is the outdated food processing industry. [passage omitted] Producers have already realized that they must work not for "his majesty the plan" but for consumers. They must only find ways for pleasing the latter. [Koncius] The production of quality goods requires investments. Where could we get money for up-to-date technologies and more productive equipment? [Klimasauskas] Lithuania has chosen such a model of privatization which has actually produced no investments. Investment coupons for which the new owners acquired capital goods is not money. One cannot buy new equipment for them, while only traders can get bank loans with a 100-percent annual interest rate because turnover is faster in trade. Practically no one is investing in industry because this brings no profit today. Even a layman can notice this: New and lovely stores open every day, but no one has heard about the construction of new industrial enterprises. The exception is joint ventures with foreign partners who bring their own capital earned at a normal interest rate. Incidentally, our people also have capital. I do not believe those businessmen who claim that there are several billion dollars in Lithuania. I believe, however, that the internal unused reserves may reach $500 million in various foreign currencies. However, until we have a well-arranged banking system, admit foreign banks, and peg the litas to some stable foreign currency, we will have neither normal credits nor investments in industry. The longer this will last, the worse and more expensive our goods will be. [Koncius] In your opinion, what should the exchange rate be when tying the litas to the U.S. dollar? [Klimasauskas] I think that neither the sheep would be hurt nor the wolf would feel hungry if the dollar cost no less than four litai. Such an exchange rate would satisfy exporters and do no damage to customers in Lithuania. I believe that international financial organizations would also approve this exchange rate. [Koncius] The production of quality goods requires not only money but also ideas. Does Lithuania have a sufficient amount of new ideas? [passage omitted] [Klimasauskas] I have already mentioned ingenious producers. Unfortunately, we also have many such manufacturers who failed to offer anything to the market. Let us take the Vilnius enterprise "Sigma," for example. I suppose that bright heads would have really found possibilities for producing personal computers there. Sadly, the slot machines made at this enterprise are in low demand. [passage omitted] I understand perfectly well that bright heads are needed not only in production but also in the government, because a market economy is not chaotic, and it must be managed reasonably. The government has done and will do its best in supporting producers of consumer goods. However, it will promote only those who will prove that they have their own brains. [Koncius] The problems in trade are no less numerous. [Klimasauskas] First of all, the Seimas must speed up the adoption of the draft laws on trade and the protection of consumers' rights. Until we have them, the bazaar trade will flourish, and there will be no real competition. The absence of these laws also impairs the effective work of trade inspection institutions. Only the law will allow us to combat piratical importers from other countries who come to us with expired goods and dishonest competition, and without proper service and guarantees. [Koncius] Could you personally already pronounce the words "Made in Lithuania" with pride? [Klimasauskas] First of all, I would like journalists to learn to pronounce these words, because the prestige of our goods largely depends on the press, radio, and television. [passage omitted]
