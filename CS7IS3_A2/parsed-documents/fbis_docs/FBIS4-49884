In his speech, Li noted that China, along with other countries in the world, will continue to make efforts to strengthen a multi-lateral trade system in the world and maintain an open world trade environment. Li expressed his hope that on the basis of the multi-lateral trade system, China will further its economic and trade relations with other countries so as to make its due contributions to the world economy. In her report, Wu Yi, minister of Chinese foreign trade and economic cooperation, said that China resolutely advocates the multi-lateral trade system represented by GATT and is speeding up negotiations on its re-entry into GATT, adding that China's determination to re-enter GATT is firm and China has made great efforts to this end.

Wu expressed her thanks to most contracting parties who support China for its re-entry into GATT. Meanwhile, she hoped that some contracting parties can realize their commitments and take action to support China in the bid.
