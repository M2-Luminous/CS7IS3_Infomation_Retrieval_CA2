I welcome both of them. Good evening, Mr. Chancellor and Mr. Vice Chancellor. Can one deduce from your readiness to come to this interview that the reports from Brussels 10 minutes ago are correct -- that the membership treaty with the European Union [EU] has been concluded? [Vranitzky] Yes, these reports are correct. I am very relieved. The hard and persistent work has paid off. I would like to thank and congratulate our government colleagues in Brussels, who really did superhuman work over these past hours and days in Brussels. I also thank the members of provincial governments, the social partners, and the many officials and other associates and helpers who accompanied them. We have gone through a very important stage in a project, the importance of which can hardly be overestimated, and now we will immediately -- over the next few hours and days -- take the next necessary steps regarding the implementation in Austria -- that is, government motions, draft laws, and the other things that are necessary in this connection. [Hochner] Mr. Vice Chancellor, you are standing beside the chancellor and you have just smiled very obviously. Is this just relief that an agreement has been achieved or is this also satisfaction with the compromise that has been accomplished? [Busek] First of all, one has to say that the details of the past hours or minutes have a bit obscured the view on the whole. After all, the whole is Austria's step into the European Union, which gives us more security, more market opportunities, more prospects for the future. My smile was directed at that, because with this, we have opened up a future for us, which gives us the most varied opportunities to make the best of it. I believe we should not overlook the forest in view of the individual trees that we have watched during the most recent negotiations -- a forest gives us hope and provides us with opportunities for development, because it is better to be in the European Union and to follow a path together instead of remaining alone. I think this is one of the main considerations, and this is also the question we are going to ask the Austrians -- namely which way they want to follow. A lot of things will still have to be done in this respect. I already know there will probably be one point or another where someone will know better and say this or that should have been achieved in addition. However, I believe one has to see the whole picture here. It is indeed a historical step we are taking -- just as we followed the path to freedom in 1955 with the State Treaty, we have now followed a path that will, as Austrians and for our homeland Austria, provide more opportunities in the future. [Hochner] Mr. Chancellor, the conclusion of the agreement with the European Union has required compromises -- compromises in agriculture and also regarding the Transit Treaty. What would you tell those critics who do not see the whole picture -- the goal of joining the European Union -- but say: The Austrian Government has toppled over here; it should not have made these compromises? [Vranitzky] I would simply tell those critics the Austrian Government has not toppled over and it should indeed have taken and had to take this step, clearly pursuing the goal we had set for ourselves. This toppling over that is so often mentioned must first be proved, and this will be extremely difficult to prove. This is one point. The second point is we now must begin to work out the next steps together with the Austrian people. We have brought home a result. A high percentage of the Austrian people are in favor of Austria's following this path into a common Europe. However, there is also quite a considerable percentage who are undecided or even against that. It is necessary now to work out, together with the Austrian people, this conviction and this positive attitude so the number of those citizens, who have not yet decided to follow the path together with those citizens who have already decided, goes down, so we can achieve an agreement and a unification of interests, a unification of comments and attitudes. This is far more important now than dealing with those on the political scene who have always been against it. Both the Greens and Haider's Freedom Party of Austria came out today against EU membership, and this was assessed as a surprise. For me, it was not a surprise at all. For the past months and years they have been against it. Therefore, no one should be surprised if opposing voices come from this corner. This is obviously part of the political conflicts we will have to go through in the future. The most important issue, however, is that we must win over that partner who has the actual say in the referendum, and that is the Austrian population. [Hochner] Mr. Vice Chancellor, during the last stage of these negotiations, the Austrian Government -- the coalition -- acted with a cohesion it rarely showed during the preparations for these negotiations. I just recall the latest discussion about second residences. Is there not a danger that this cohesion has been lost when it is now necessary to explain the results of Brussels to the Austrian people so they vote yes in the referendum? [Busek] We have achieved a goal together in a good style in the negotiating delegation and also in tackling our task here in Vienna together. You may be quite certain that we, as the government parties, will not lose sight of the goal -- namely leading Austria into a good future. We have a lot of work to do, accompanying the treaty and, of course, in implementing it. I believe narrow-minded pettiness will be inappropriate here. I believe we will also have to call on all our colleagues to act in this manner. Of course, there is one or the other question that will be mentioned then. However, it is true such agreements are never perfect but also have the character of a compromise, with which all sides have to live. However, these things must recede into the background in view of the fact we have opened up a good, new future for us, and we must take all measures to accompany this development. I may say we have already achieved some things parallel to the negotiations in Brussels and in Vienna, which we will implement accordingly. I am very optimistic in this respect, because if we do not recognize the dimension of this issue, we will, I believe, fail the political task. And in this respect, one can already see the cohesion of the two government parties, despite all the differences we have now and then. However, we are not a unified national party but two different parties that form one government. I would really like to see an alternative to that, because from what you hear from the opposition parties nowadays, you cannot form a common government. [Hochner] A penultimate question to both of you: The approval by the Austrians at the referendum is not preprogrammed, even though some polls indicate that. What would happen in politics if the Austrians were to come out against the membership treaty that was negotiated by the Austrian Government in Brussels? [Vranitzky] Well, if this is the penultimate question, I am already curious about the last question. My answer to your penultimate question is that I do not at all expect that the Austrian people will not want to follow this path, which the Austrian Government has worked out. This would probably also mean not joining the other peoples in Europe, and just today we have seen and heard on television and on the radio that the East European neighboring states are vehemently pushing into the European Union. Just imagine a situation in which West Europe is united and East Europe joins in, and somewhere in no-man's land there is Austria. After some years, the citizens would certainly say: This government did not live up to its responsibility. We will certainly not give them any reason to say that. [Hochner] Mr. Vice Chancellor. [Busek] Well, what is going to happen if.... Let us assume that the people vote yes, then what are you going to do with this question? [Hochner] Then I have to ask the opposition parties. You are right. The last question is nothing mysterious but just involves technical matters because the day is a bit hectic and my colleagues from the domestic policy department have asked me for it. When will the Austrian Government give a press conference to brief the public about the actual result of the negotiations? [Vranitzky] Well, in view of the interest the Austrian public has been taking in that, you can imagine we will certainly be asked sufficiently and extensively about this matter, and we will certainly face up to this task tomorrow -- together with those of our colleagues who will return from Brussels during the night. [Hochner] Thank you gentlemen, and good evening.
