Leaders at all levels were responsible for their assigned cases, personally commanded the cases at the forefront, and focused forces on major and serious cases. From January to April, the discipline inspection and supervision organs in the whole province accepted and handled 33,125 cases reported by the masses in their letters and visits. They investigated and handled 3,429 cases on party members and cadres who violated law and discipline, of which 1,790 cases were already concluded. A total of 1,775 people were dealt with according to party and political disciplinary actions, and 85 people were subjected to criminal sanctions. Compared with last year, this year's investigation work had four distinguishing features. First, the numbers of the cases investigated and handled and the discipline violators who were punished were large and showed a large-scale increase. In this year's first four months, the number of the cases investigated and handled rose by 71.36 percent over the same period of the previous year; and the numbers of the people who were dealt with according to party disciplinary actions, political disciplinary actions, and criminal law were respectively 54.82 percent, 201.39 percent, and 63.46 percent higher than the same period of the previous year. The numbers of investigated and handled cases increased by 1.31 times and 1.27 times over the same period of last year in Handan city and Hengshui Prefecture, respectively. Second, a batch of major and serious cases were investigated and handled. From January to April, there were a total of 187 major and serious cases investigated and handled across the province, an increase of 32.62 percent over the same period of the previous year. Of the total, 75 cases involved leading cadres at and above the deputy county head level, an increase of 368.73 percent over the same period of the previous year. Third, there is a large proportion of cases on violation of economic discipline in the total investigated and handled cases. Discipline inspection and supervision organs at all levels, focusing on economic construction, the central task, stressed the investigation and handling of economic discipline breaches to protect the smooth development of reform and opening up. From January to April, they investigated and handled 1,681 economic cases, 49.02 percent of the total cases registered and an increase of 41.4 percent over the same period of the previous year, and recovered an economic loss of 399.45 million yuan for the country. Recently, an extraordinary big case about bribery during the contracting of construction projects was uncovered in Handan city. Thirty-nine people were involved, the amount of money violating law and discipline reached over 400,000 yuan, and six cadres at the county level and four scientific and technical cadres were arrested according to law. The discipline inspection commission and procuratorate in Wuan city uncovered an extraordinary big bribe- taking case in the city's industrial and commercial bank and credit cooperative, and of the 17 people involved in the case, six cadres at and above the deputy section chief level took bribes totaling 512,000 yuan. Fourth, a batch of major and serious cases committed by groups and regional cases were cracked. Most of such cases involved many people each, and many of them were characterized by people in and outside a department or at higher and lower levels collaborating with each other and were complicated and difficult to deal with. Discipline inspection and supervision organs closely coordinated with law-enforcement organizations and commanded in unison to make breakthroughs in major cases. The provincial discipline inspection commission and supervision department alone investigated and handled four such cases. All cities and prefectures also made breakthroughs in a batch of major and serious cases. For example, Zhang Liejun, former general manager; and Yang Kuizhong, Wang Xihuan, and Lee Zhiqiang, deputy general managers of a general company in Qinhuangdao city economic and technological development zone, practiced fraud and issued forged receipts to draw 15,505.80 yuan in cash through a certain company and bank and shared 1,000 yuan each. They also used their subordinating company's money earned from selling old electric wires to pay for their personal contract deposits, 1,000 yuan for each. Besides, Zhang, Yang, and Wang also accepted 2,000 yuan in bribes each. Now Zhang Liejun, Yang Kuizhong, and Wang Xihuan have been expelled from the party and dismissed from their positions as general manager and deputy general manager. At the same time, the judicial organ also investigated their crimes of embezzlement and accepting bribes. Li Zhiqiang was placed on probation within the party for two years and dismissed from the administrative post as deputy general manager as punishment.
