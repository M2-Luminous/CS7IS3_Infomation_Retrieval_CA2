The tension surrounding the indefinite transportation strike, which is in its 10th day, decreased at dawn today after strike leaders promised police not to cause disturbances during their demonstrations. The Sandinist transportation sector is insisting on its demands that the government "freeze" fuel prices, abolish the sector's taxes, and execute the plan to reorganize transportation in the nation. Hundreds of buses and taxis are still parked at the four entrances to the traffic circle at the Metro Center on the southwestern periphery of the capital, blocking the normal flow of private vehicles. Some 200 meters from the traffic circle are Nicaragua's main police headquarters and the Metropolitan Cathedral. The concentration of buses and taxis in this area has forced the suspension of bus services which, since last Sunday, had provided the public with almost five routes. Gustavo Aguiluz, CNT spokesman, which called the strike on 24 January, today asserted that the CNT will continue trying to work out with the government the possibility of a dialogue to end the protest. Nevertheless, Aguiluz said the strike will continue if the government refuses to fulfill the agreements signed in September, which ended a nationwide transportation strike that had resulted in two deaths, dozens of casualties and arrests, and the loss of some $16 million.
