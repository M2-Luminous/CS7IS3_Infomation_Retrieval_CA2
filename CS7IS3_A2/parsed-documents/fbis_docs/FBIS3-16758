Today we present an appeal by the left-center opposition, which has the blessing of Metropolitan Ioann of St. Petersburg and Ladoga: There is calamity in our common Russian home. This is being discussed by families, on the street, in dying plants, and cold schools, it is being mentioned by the opposition and the government, religious and political figures, the Federal Assembly, and the president. Everyone secretly thinks the same -- we cannot go on living like this. A halt must be called. We have one means of salvation -- we must come to our senses, extend our hands to one another in forgiveness of the mutual recriminations and transgressions. There will be no winners or losers in this confrontation. Each new conflict increases the danger of Russia's destruction. We contrast the folly of words and deeds with respect for the law and creative activity in the name of Russia. A social contract between all patriotic forces, movements, ideologies, and faiths that reject violence, racism, and nationalism and that set civic service to the homeland above all else is what can stop the catastrophe. The only freedom is that which brings prosperity to the fatherland, strengthens its independence, and provides guarantees of personal safety and faith in the future. We people of different views, with a different way of life and thinking, representatives of various fragments of our multifaceted ideology and policy, state that we are setting up the movement "Accord for Russia," uniting all Russia's patriots -- as has frequently happened in times of trouble for Russia -- pooling our wealth, ability, and moral and political experience.... The "Accord for Russia" movement is open to all citizens in our multiethnic Russia who are able to help their fatherland at its time of severe trial. We do not differentiate between liberals and communists, entrepreneurs and workers, private farmers, and kolkhoz workers, nor do we distinguish between republicans and supporters of presidential authority. We are uniting to perform urgent tasks in an endeavor: -- to avert the definitive breakup of historic Russia, the destruction of the cultural, economic, and political ties that have developed over the centuries between its equal peoples; -- to restore the power and might of Russia's statehood, providing its peoples and citizens with security and conditions for economic prosperity and the development of the individual; -- to protect national cadres and the scientific, technical, and defense potential of our great country; -- to stop reforms "for reforms' sake," the destruction of national production, protect the national market and national capital, and ensure conditions for Russia's move toward a postindustrial future; -- to bar the way to rampant crime and looting of the wealth that has been created by the work of several generations of our people and provide legal protection for state and private property; -- to avert unemployment and starvation, provide every citizen of the country with a fitting way of life and standard of living; -- to restore our peoples' sense of community, membership of and pride in a sovereign state, and their belief in justice, conscience, and good. We have behind us the constructive experience and heroism of Russia's great citizens and our homeland's patriots. We have behind us the experience of 1,000 years of Russian statehood. We will strive to secure national accord, the consolidation of society, and mobilize all patriotic citizens to restore ravaged errant Russia. [Signed] V. Zorkin, A. Rutskoy, M. Lapshin, A.

Thus, a coalition of left-centrist forces -- effectively, the main popular-patriotic forces -- has been formed. The intended split in the opposition following the amnesty has not taken place. On the contrary, most opposition forces have united. They include politicians and representatives of the creative intelligentsia -- supporters of nonviolence and a rule-of-law state. The real democrats are wavering. But the door to the future is open to them. As for the radicals from "Russia's Choice" and "Democratic Russia," I think that they have had their day. Without simplifying the situation I will say: The way is closed to everyone who wants to see a repeat of October 1994 [date as published].
