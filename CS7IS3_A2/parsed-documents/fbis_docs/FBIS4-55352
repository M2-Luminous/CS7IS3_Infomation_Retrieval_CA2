As a result of Walesa's veto, these elections will be conducted according to the existing electoral law, dated June 1990 and updated with special provisions for the city of Warsaw passed earlier this year. (Polonia TV Network, 18 Apr 94) The most important difference between the current electoral system and the vetoed alternative is the threshold at which proportional representation applies. According to the current law, election by simple majority applies in gminas (municipalities, the smallest administrative units) of up to 40,000 residents and proportional representation in those over 40,000. The proposal approved by the Sejm but rejected by Walesa would have lowered the cutoff to gminas with 15,000 inhabitants. The president criticized the new law as "an attempt by the governing coalition to politicize the elections by putting its own people into the local governments." Walesa also expressed dissatisfaction with a provision that "forbids conducting campaigns in churches," arguing that "separation of church and state is a political fact that the church fully respects. There is no need to emphasize this any further." The presidential statement met with strong support from the secretary of Episcopate Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, who "was very pleased with the presidential veto." (GAZETA WYBORCZA 13 Apr 94) Depending on the gmina's population, between 15 and 100 council members will be elected in single- or multiple-seat districts in the following manner: 15 council members in gminas with fewer than 4,000 inhabitants; 18 in gminas with 4,000-7,000 inhabitants; 20 in gminas with 7,000-10,000 inhabitants; 24 in gminas with 10,000-20,000 inhabitants; 28 in gminas with 20,000-40,000 inhabitants; 30 in gminas with 40,000-60,000 inhabitants; 36 in gminas with 60,000-80,000 inhabitants; 40 in gminas with 80,000-100,000 inhabitants; and up to 100 members to those gminas (exclusively in Warsaw, which is divided into several gminas) with more than 1 million inhabitants.

Candidates in single-seat voting districts are required to provide petitions with at least 15 signatures supporting their nomination; petitions with 150 signatures are needed for candidate lists in multiseat districts." Residents of Warsaw will vote according to the new "law on the administration system of the capital city of Warsaw," which divides the city into several gminas.
