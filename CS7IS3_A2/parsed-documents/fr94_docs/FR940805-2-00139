FR940805-2-00139 FR940805-2-00073 ``Investigators submitting human gene transfer proposals for Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee review must include the Informed Consent document as approved by the local Institutional Review Boards. A separate Informed Consent document should be used for the gene transfer portion of a research project when gene transfer is used as an adjunct in the study of another technique, e.g., when a gene is used as a 'marker' or to enhance the power of immunotherapy for cancer. ``Because of the relative novelty of the procedures that are used, the potentially irreversible consequences of the procedures performed, and the fact that many of the potential risks remain undefined, the Informed Consent process should include the following specific information in addition to any requirements of the DHHS regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR 46). Indicate if each of the specified items appears in the Informed Consent document or, if not included in the Informed Consent document, how those items will be presented to potential subjects. Include an explanation if any of the following items are omitted from the consent process or the Informed Consent document. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a. General Requirements of Human Subjects Research Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(1). Description/purpose of the study. ``The subjects should be provided with a detailed explanation in non-technical language of the purpose of the study and the procedures associated with the conduct of the proposed study, including a description of the gene transfer component. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(2). Alternatives. ``The Informed Consent document should indicate the availability of therapies and the possibility of other investigational interventions and approaches. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(3). Voluntary participation. ``The subjects should be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that failure to participate in the study or withdrawal of consent will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which the subjects are otherwise entitled. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(4). Benefits. ``The subjects should be provided with an accurate description of the possible benefits, if any, of participating in the proposed study. For studies that are not reasonably expected to provide a therapeutic benefit to subjects, the Informed Consent document should clearly state that no direct clinical benefit to subjects is expected to occur as a result of participation in the study, although knowledge may be gained that may benefit others. Appendix M&hyph;I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(5). Possible risks, discomforts, and side effects. ``There should be clear itemization in the Informed Consent document of types of adverse experiences, their relative severity, and their expected frequencies. For consistency, the following definitions are suggested: side effects that are listed as mild should be ones which do not require a therapeutic intervention; moderate side effects require an intervention; and severe side effects are potentially fatal or life-threatening, disabling, or require prolonged hospitalization. ``If verbal descriptors (e.g., `rare,' `uncommon,' or `frequent') are used to express quantitative information regarding risk, these terms should be explained. ``The Informed Consent document should provide information regarding the approximate number of people who have previously received the genetic material under study. It is necessary to warn potential subjects that, for genetic materials previously used in relatively few or no humans, unforeseen risks are possible, including ones that could be severe.
