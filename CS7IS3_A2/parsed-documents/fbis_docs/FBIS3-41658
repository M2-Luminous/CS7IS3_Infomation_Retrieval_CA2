Toepfer: First of all: Despite all understanding for personal involvement, it is impossible that someone protests without any consideration for law and order and then gets an appointment with the minister. Therefore, I would like to make one thing clear: My condition was an end to the occupation -- then the talk. I offered this talk so that I could make it clear that there is nothing like a ``sacrificial area'' in the new laender -- following the slogan: The storage site from the old GDR [German Democratic Republic] times is used without any checks so that it can take in the radioactive waste from all over Germany as quickly as possible. This impression is wrong. In the case of Morsleben, we have ordered independent, comprehensive examinations, we have tightened the safety measures, and have reduced the active potential of the waste. There is no safety discount. In order to make this clear we discussed the matter with Greenpeace, but hardly ever have I had such an awkward feeling as during these talks. SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: You stick to Morsleben. What is the conclusion derived from that for the Federal Government's energy policy? Toepfer: Morsleben does not mean that the licensing procedure for the Konrad final storage site is no longer possible. Whoever believed that this has been settled by putting low-radioactive waste in final storage in Morsleben, is very wrong. Of course, the corresponding steps for getting a permit for the Konrad mine continue. By closing down Greifswald and Rheinsberg, and because of an extremely high amount of other sources of radiation and radioactive waste, we have a considerable amount of waste in the new laender. We must integrate Morsleben quite normally into Germany's waste disposal infrastructure -- just as the facilities in the western laender are available for waste from all over Germany, too. SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: This also means that the Federal Government and its environment minister stick to nuclear energy -- and, as a result, accept all ensuing waste disposal problems. Toepfer: I really think that it is a very superficial morality not to use a technology in our country, which has been recognized as being difficult, while knowing that, in other countries, it will be used even more intensively. The safety standards -- or better, the safety culture, which is more than just safety technology -- which have been developed in our country also mean that it is better for us to accept responsibility for this technology in our country than to fob it off on those places where it is used with rather less safety, such as in Central and Eastern Europe, for instance. However, we must be aware of the fact that we are not dealing with an absolutely risk-free technology, so that constant safety checks are indispensable. In order to justify nuclear energy, I have never made relative environmental comparisons between the various energy sources. Any energy must prove to be justifiable with its remaining risk. We also cannot -- as we did in the past -- ignore our obligation for research, a more intensive use of other energy sources, and saving energy by saying that we have got nuclear energy and thus something like a prrpetual-motion energy policy. I want to make every effort to facilitate energy supplies without nuclear energy, but I see the necessity to preserve the specific option of nuclear energy at the moment and to contribute to decisively expanding the safety standards in a new generation of nuclear power plants. SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: In the laender, you are also dealing with environmental ministers from a completely different camp, for instance with experienced ministers of the Greens. Is cooperation with these colleagues now possible, at least on certain issues, despite or because of your just-described attitude? Toepfer: I can answer this question with yes without any reservations. I have already mentioned exceptions, such as energy policy. In environmental policy, in particular, we must not always stress the party policy differences in our answers, but must ask which are the environmentally justifiable answers. I really think that this is extremely important, and the citizens expect that from us. They do not ask whether a good answer was worked out by a green, a black, or a red politician. And in some corners, and at some edges, one surprisingly finds coinciding views. [passage omitted]
