[passage omitted] This morning, fierce fighting started up again in Kigali, the capital. One of our special correspondents, Christophe Boisbouvier, reports: [Boisbouvier] The battalion of paratroopers commanded by Major Tabakunze is still trying to resist the advance of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] forces of Paul Kagame. But the RPF vise is tightening round the town, and there is confirmation now, at midday, that the rebel forces who have come from both the north and south have managed to link up with the pocket that had been holding out for six days; they are now attacking the gendarmerie camp between the town and the airport. This link-up has two consequences. First of all it has cut the Rwandan Armed Forces in two, one part in the town and the other at the airport, and then it has also cut the road between the town and the airport used for the evacuation of foreigners. Nevertheless, it appears that the last Belgian convoys going to fetch the last foreign nationals in Kigali are able to get to the airport without too many problems. As for the French soldiers, they may all have left Rwanda before the end of the day. After three years of more or less active French military presence in Rwanda, a page is being turned.
