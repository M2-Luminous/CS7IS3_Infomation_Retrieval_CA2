Livajic: "Drazen Budisa on the HSLS Podium"] [Excerpt] "The documents which have been signed on the federation of Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina are of historical significance and represent a turning point in the difficult times in which the two peoples are living. l cannot conceal my satisfaction at the fact that this is the implementation of a policy which the Croatian Social Liberal Alliance [HSLS], in contrast to the ruling party, has supported from the very beginning, because this is the concept which will make possible the existence of our neighboring state and thereby the reintegration of occupied territories into Croatia," Drazen Budisa, president of the HSLS, said in a public speech in Omis [a coastal town south of Split]. He stressed his reservations regarding the possible confederal agreement between Croatia and the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, warning that only integral states can make agreements on confederal alliances. "If no significant changes are made to establish the legal order of the Croatian state in the occupied areas, the HSLS will oppose the scheduling of a referendum on creating the confederal alliance," Budisa stressed, stating his opinion that the best solution for all the people in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be that it remain a federal state of three peoples with equal rights and with good links to Croatia but also to Serbia.
