Industrial output is near to bottoming out and inventory adjustments are also improving, Fujii told a news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. Fujii had been saying that the economy is mixed with good and bad signs and that experts were split in their assessments. The cabinet adopted a monthly economic report at the morning meeting. The June report prepared by the Economic Planning Agency stressed emergence of improving areas in the still-sluggish economy. The previous report had emphasized the sluggishness of the economy although noting some signs of improvement. Fujii also said that international organizations are forecasting a recovery in the second half of 1994 for the Japanese economy in their latest economy reports. He particularly cited reports by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Monday and by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April. The two institutions said in separate reports that the Japanese economy will pick up in the second half from sluggish growth in the first half to post a real 2 percent growth in 1994 before staging a full recovery in 1995. To back up the improving outlook at home and abroad at "this delicate time," Fujii stressed the importance of steadily implementing the fiscal 1994 budget and the government's record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package launched in February. The long-delayed budget for the current year that started April 1 is expected to pass the House of Representatives on Wednesday, with deliberations in the House of Councillors to begin the same day. The government is now running under a provisional budget. Turning to the issue of possible economic sanctions against North Korea, Fujii said it all depends on the UN Security Council. He cited the move to stop bank remittances to Iraq during the Persian Gulf War in 1990 as an example of the Finance Ministry's experience in complying with UN resolutions.
