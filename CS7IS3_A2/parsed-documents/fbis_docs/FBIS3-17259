He said in an exclusive interview with Interfax that a state commission had been set up last year under the chairmanship of first Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Abdulmajid Dostiyev which had initiated contacts and negotiated with all political groups on civic accord and return of refugees. This commission, jointly with other organizations, in particular the UN, had succeeded in having 800,000 refugees, notably displaced persons, returning to Tajikistan. By official accounts, he said, there are no more than 30,000 Tajik refugees in Afghanistan and the commission was doing its best for their return. IF Note: The UN High Commissioner's Office on Refugees resumed repatriation of Tajik refugees from Afghanistan via Uzbekistan Wednesday. A large group of Tajik refugees is expected to arrive in the southern town of Termez in the afternoon of March 23 to be moved into Tajikistan by bus. Last year 8000 Tajik refugees had returned via Termez from the Sakhi camp outside the Afghan town of Mazar-e Sharif. Fattoyev thought that the armed opposition wanted the refugees to be kept abroad "as hostages or a card in the power game." He said that the overriding goals of the talks with the opposition was securing the return of the remaining refugees, a civic accord, cessation of armed struggle by the opposition and easing the tension on the Tajik-Afghan border. "Our willingness to start talks is no sign of our weakness. The opposite is true, the government holds the situation in the country under control but is prepared to hear its political opponents. This is a goodwill gesture." Fattoyev also thought that it would not be proper to say that the talks were put off because the date of their start had not been negotiated. IF Note: A senior official in the Russian Foreign Ministry told Interfax that the talks between the Tajik government and the armed opposition were to start in Moscow but no exact date had been specified. He thought that the date had been changed from mid-April to some time later because "much time is consumed in sending the invitations and other organizational matters." In Fattoyev's view, the talks were not the overriding issue because the government had more urgent matters to handle. In particular, "we have to stop the production decline at least in the agriculture, have the sowing done, move enough foodstuffs, diesel fuel and gasoline in and restart the basic economic mechanisms." Fattoyev strongly denied rumors that Dushanbe was under significant pressure from Tashkent as far as relations with the opposition were concerned. "Uzbekistan is our closest neighbor which has its interests in Tajikistan but its wishes and advice are made known in the way this is done throughout the civilized world," Fattoyev emphasized. In his words, Tajikistan is a sovereign state "and any pressure or dictation or interference, in particular into relations with the opposition, is out of the question." He was convinced that talks with the opposition will take place. He thought that the government had to talk with those opposition leaders who had an influence with the armed groups. IF Note: An informed source close to the Tajik government said that the government did not want to talk to those who represented only themselves. The source told Interfax that "any field commander has greater influence in the republic than former kazikalon (spiritual authority) Akbar Turajonzoda (now staying in Iran) or Atakhon Latifi, chairman of the Coordinating Center of Tajikistan's Democratic Forces. "These men act as minor mediating figures. We should talk with those who command armed opposition," he emphasized. This was, in his view, the reason why the talks could not start. Fattoyev felt that it was the opposition leaders who were dragging their feet. He believed that "there was no consensus in the opposition" whereas the Tajik government knew what it could offer. Local observers thought that the talks would hardly bear fruit immediately and improve the situation for the sole reason that the opposition is divided but the government would meet the opposition halfway for the sake of accord.
