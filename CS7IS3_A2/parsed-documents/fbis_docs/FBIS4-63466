Reception is fair to unmonitorable. Marynenko begins by commenting on the seriousness of the situation in the Crimea and on misinformation in the mass media. He asks Mykhalchenko to give his opinion on the situation. Mykhalchenko replies: Mykhalchenko replies: "I would like to say first that the situation in the Crimea right now is, unfortunately, very, very dangerous. One of the sides in the Crimea--that is, the extremist forces of the Russian community--has in fact reached an abyss. Thus, it is now evident that there could be a civil war, and the latest events plainly show this." Mykhalchenko says he has been in the Crimea recently and noticed that the Crimean Tatars were ready to act very resolutely if the policy of separating Crimea from Ukraine and joining it to Russia did not stop, fearing another deportation of the Crimean Tatars, this time forever. He notes that pro-Russian separatist forces in Crimea are being destructive while Russia is calling for mutual understanding. Marynenko asks Mykhalchenko about the closed Ukrainian parliament session on 20 May. Mykhalchenko replies: "The Ukrainian president gave objective information to the deputies of the newly elected Supreme Council about the situation in the Crimea, showing them our possibilities for keeping the situation under control. He said-- this is not word for word but the general sense of it--that Ukraine has reached the final stroke, that one cannot retreat now, and that the president is prepared to act vigorously and firmly, and so on. He proposed a whole set of actions for keeping the Crimea as part of Ukraine and for not allowing [word indistinct] a civil war there. Unfortunately, I repeat unfortunately, our parliament again adopted a half-way decision only to suspend all of these documents, which facilitate the operation of the documents adopted by Crimea's parliament: One should revoke unconditionally and so on." Mykhalchenko adds that a considerable number of the deputies in the Ukrainian Supreme Council acted against Ukrainian interests and that they said in parliament that events in Crimea should be allowed to take their course. He dwells on the fact that the Crimean Tatars did not take part in voting on the decision in the Crimean Supreme Council, that they do not support the separation of the Crimea from Ukraine, and that their position is important. Marynenko asks Mykhalchenko what President Kravchuk can do if the Ukrainian Supreme Council does not agree to his proposals. Mykhalchenko replies: "The Supreme Council is the highest legislative authority in Ukraine, but Ukraine's president is the guarantor of statehood. Ukraine's president is the guarantor of the Constitution, whatever kind of constitution it is, and the president should defend the current Constitution. I think the president will act vigorously and do everything possible to preserve Ukraine's statehood, so that territorial issues are resolved only in accordance with the Constitution." He adds that the people of Ukraine will be the judges of the Ukrainian Supreme Council. Marynenko brings up the fact that Russia and Crimea concluded an agreement without going through Kiev, to which Mykhalchenko replies that Ukraine informed the United Nations and other international organizations that Crimea does not have the right to sign international or political agreements on its own or even to hold talks on these issues. He dwells on Russia's history of dictatorship and says that Russia trains other states to view its policy towards its neighbors as policy not based on international law, but on force. Marynenko questions Mykhalchenko about the recent telephone conversation betwen Presidents Kravchuk and Yeltsin. Mykhalchenko replies: "The point is that in this conversation, as far as I know, Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk raised the issue of mutual relations between Ukraine and Russia, saying that the signing of a broad political treaty between Ukraine and Russia should be accelerated as should the dividing up of the Black Sea Fleet. The events in the Crimea were undoubtedly touched on. Leonid Makarovych posited that the situation really is entering a dead end now, that the president of Ukraine cannot expect something because there is nothing to expect, and so on, and that he will act firmly according to these circumstances. Undoubtedly Yeltsin did not agree with this position, but the president of Ukraine made no promises that he will not act purposefully or vigorously. Leonid Makarovych said that he would act within the framework of Ukraine's Constitution, which gives the president many possibilities for various courses of action. That is, Leonid Makarovych did not promise to be passive. He made a promise to act within the bounds of Ukraine's Constitution. This is his right." Marynenko mentions that Yeltsin said that the Crimea is a sovereign autonomous republic. Mykhalchenko mentions the difference in Russia's policy toward Crimea as an autonomous republic within Ukraine and its policy toward autonomous republics within the Russian Federation, and says that the Crimea cannot be both sovereign and autonomous. He says that when he was in the United States recently none of the officials he spoke to there had any doubt that the Crimea was autonomous within Ukraine or that it was essentially a regional authority. Asked about the treaty between Ukraine and Russia, Mykhalchenko replies that President Yeltsin said he would not sign an agreement until the Black Sea Fleet issue was resolved. Mykhalchenko doubts that Russia will resolve the Black Sea Fleet issue or that it would agree to the signing of a treaty. He says that the Black Sea Fleet is used to intimidate Ukraine. According to Mykhalchenko, although Crimean Vice Premier Yevgeniy Saburov has Ukrainian citizenship, other members of the Crimean Government do not, even though this is against Ukrainian law. The interview ends with Mykhalchenko saying that Ukraine sometimes reacts belatedly to the actions of Crimea's extremists, mentioning the possibility of civil war, and stressing that the Crimean Tatars will not allow another deportation.
