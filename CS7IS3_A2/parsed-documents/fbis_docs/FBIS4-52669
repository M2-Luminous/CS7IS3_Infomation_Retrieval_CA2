"North Korea had originally planned to begin changing nuclear fuel rods (at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon) on May 4, but so far there has not been any information that it has been carried out," said the official, who declined to be identified. The reactor in question is an experimental one and therefore no technical difficulties are expected, even if the refueling plans are postponed, the official said. "Pyongyang knows very well that U.S.-North Korean contacts will be broken off if it forces the changing of fuel rods without the presence of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)," he said. The official, however, declined to discuss whether Pyongyang had informed Washington that it would delay its plans to change the fuel rods. The United States and North Korea had a working-level contact in New York on Monday. Kenneth Quinones, the State Department's North Korea desk officer, represented Washington at the meeting. Asked about the prospect for the third round of talks, the official said the United States is hopeful. "We firmly hope that (dialogue on holding the talks) has reached the final phase," he noted. Nevertheless, he said there would have to be many more working-level contacts, indicating a continued verbal tug-of-war between Washington and Pyongyang before the third round of talks could be realized. The official said he believed that North Korea and the IAEA would "soon" resume negotiations. "Once IAEA inspections begin, it would probably take about one week," he said, recalling that IAEA Secretary-General Hans Blix is expected to report back to the United Nations Security Council on the progress in the North Korean nuclear row by mid-May. "The United States understands the technical position of the IAEA and is fully supporting the IAEA in that respect," he added.
