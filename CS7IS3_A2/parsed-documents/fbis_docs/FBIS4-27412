He also called on the Pacific Basin Economic Council to help stabilize security concerns in the Asia-Pacific region by creating economic activity. He was speaking during a defense and security session of the 27th Pacific Basin Economic Council [PBEC] meeting yesterday afternoon. The PBEC, he said, could help alleviate the situation in the Peninsula and help North Korea to "enter the mainstream of the Pacific Basin community" by inviting the North to participate in PBEC activities. Prospects of greater trade opportunities and investments can "provide some incentives for North Korea to respond positively to any PBEC initiative in that direction." Mr. de Villa also suggested that the PBEC develop a vital role in the economic pursuits in the South China Sea where there is a need for continuing dialogues on the demilitarization of the area. Maintenance of the status quo is necessary "with respect to the claims of sovereignty and exploration of possible modes of cooperation in scientific research, inventory, exploitation and development of its resources with the participation of the claimant countries," he added. Corporate involvement in enhancing the security and stability of the region is vital, said Secretary de Villa. Although the Asia- Pacific region has managed to adapt "rather well" to the changes in the international community with the end of the Cold War, it still faces problems of "incalculable impact on peaceful endeavors amidst the optimism in the economic progress of the region."
