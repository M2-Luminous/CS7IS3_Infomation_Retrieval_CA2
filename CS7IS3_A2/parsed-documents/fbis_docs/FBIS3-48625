Japan's three common carriers submitted a petition Thursday [27 January] to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications requesting an investigation into discount services offered in Japan by U.S. firms. Meanwhile, three Japanese agents of the U.S. firms told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that they have agreed to file a complaint with the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) if restrictions are placed on their services. For the Japanese Government, the bickering comes at a crucial time as U.S. negotiators are threatening possible sanctions if the ongoing framework trade talks fail to reach an agreement before President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa hold their summit in Washington on February 11. "We are confident that we will not have to take such actions," said Toshio Kawakami, president of USF Pacific Inc., stressing that its discount services are legal both domestically and internationally. "But if the ministry decides to restrict our services, we will have to explain to our parent U.S. firms preparing to file a complaint," he said. The Tokyo agent to New York-based US Fibercom Network Inc. began operations in October with a call-back service offering up to 40 percent lower rates than the three Japanese carriers. The two other agents are International Network Services Inc. for USA Global Link in Iowa, and Telecom System Co. for International Telephone Co. in New York. The Japanese carriers, led by KDD, a former international telecommunications monopoly, said in a joint statement that the call-back system "unfairly uses their lines free of charge and causes trouble to their customers by making lines busy." The two other Japanese carriers are International Digital Communications Inc. and International Telecom Japan Inc. In the past two years, U.S. discount services entered Japan with the call-back system. The user calls a switching center in the United States and hangs up after two rings. After a few seconds, the center calls back and the user dials the number he wishes to call, thereby making the U.S. the country of origin. Back in the U.S., the operators lease lines from major carriers like American Telephone and Telegraph Co. under discount contracts for large-lot users in order to offer cheap international telephone rates to individuals and companies. Under a written agreement, the three agents are to "continue offering the call-back service with an aim to further spread the advanced U.S. telecommunications service in Japan." "We will agree to hold friendly talks" with the three Japanese firms and the ministry, "but are prepared to ask for help, while explaining the situation in Japan to the USTR, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and other U.S. Government institutions that support our call- back service," Kawakami said. Kawakami stressed that the service brings benefits of the yen's appreciation and deregulations to Japanese companies now actively streamlining amid the prolonged economic slump. ''This is one of the key policies'' of the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and the services ''also help Japan in reducing its current-account surplus with the United States,'' he said. But the share is still very small at less than 1 percent of the 250 billion yen market in Japan, Kawakami said. A KDD spokesman described the service as ''abnormal,'' stressing that the lines are used free of charge. Kawakami said the three agents have also sent a joint notice to the ministry and the Japanese companies indicating they are prepared to pay if reasonable rates are presented. ''We haven't received such notice yet, but will in any case seek restrictions on the services,'' the spokesman said. Ministry officials had said the discount services are no problem under the existing telecommunications licensing system, and the ministry has no control over rates provided by overseas switching facilities. In fact, the ministry issued permission to the three firms. Telecommunications licenses are divided into two main types -- one for common carriers, obliging them to submit rates for ministry approval, and one allowing the free fixing of rates for those providing service without possessing domestic switching machines and lines. But the officials had hinted at problems concerning `civil laws'.
