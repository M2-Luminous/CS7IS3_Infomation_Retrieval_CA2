Shebalkin under "There Is Such a Service" rubric: "`Small Forces' for Radiation"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Recently, a vessel was detained in Kaliningrad trade port a few hours before departure. It turned out that the cargo of the motor ship "Composer Musorgskiy" was posing a radioactive danger. This means that the lives of the people working there were threatened to a certain extent. Moreover, exports of radioactive substances (uranium) without relative documentation are forbidden. Eventually, the motor ship was sent to the place of its destination -- St. Petersburg. Here is another criminal fact. The Kaliningrad asphalt cement plant has devices which control the production of the mixture with sensors operating on radioisotopes. Some local dodgers kept an eye on those colorful "castings" and took the devices away despite the warning signs. The militia ran their feet off to find the culprits. Finally, the stolen devices were found. The thieves, most probably, had not found a customer, while someone must have stored, carried, and transported personal death for a long time. It is regrettable that the plant failed to ensure proper security for the radioactive devices. Let us remember Chernobyl. We live thousands of kilometers away from the site of the tragedy, but we felt its effects. We will, probably, feel them for a long time. That is why the Russian president issued a decree approving the resolution "On Federal Control Over Nuclear and Radioactive Security." This is a joint document of the president, the legislature, and the government. By the way, I will remind everyone that even Gorbachev tried to introduce such control back in 1985, because the former USSR is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Unfortunately, the project remained only a collection of good proposals for offices and officials. [passage omitted] Nevertheless, the key and supreme principle of control in any civilized country is its nondepartmental character, as well as responsibility before the coming generations. Until now, we have had administrative control -- from the Atomic Ministry and the Ministries of Atomic Energy, Construction, and Defense. No one washes one's dirty linen in public, as a rule. That is why the establishment of independent subunits in oblasts was an important event. "The inspection supervises how organizations, enterprises, and military units of the garrison and the fleet observe the rules of storing and utilizing radioactive substances," says Dmitriy Gennadyevich Sorokin, chief of the Kaliningrad Oblast inspection. "Our staff is small, there are three more people besides me, while the work load is quite impressive. Dozens of enterprises in the oblast use devices with radioactive substances. Furthermore, there is a large number of military units where there is more equipment with radioisotopes than one knows what to do with them." "There are several problems that hamper the activities of our inspection. As any budget organization, it is experiencing financial difficulties today. We have no means of transport or the necessary equipment for qualitative analysis of radioactive materials. In the case of the motor ship "Composer Musorgskiy," by the way, we failed to establish the exact effect of the "evil" cargo on the environment." [passage omitted] "I will dwell on the discussion concerning the possible construction of a nuclear power plant in our oblast." "The rate of construction of atomic power stations is increasing around the world. Incidentally, our neighbors are also building them. Lithuania is the leader in terms of energy production at a nuclear station. Poland has its own stations, while Belarus has ordered a project for itself from Canada." "My opinion is likely to be viewed as subjective, but it is the assessment of a competent specialist. A nuclear power station is less polluting than any coal station, while the energy produced there is the cheapest. However, the issue of constructing an atomic station in our region is a matter for energy specialists." [passage omitted]
