Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that one of the two men killed was Yusuf Naji, the murderer of the late Shin Bet agent No'am Kohen. As may be recalled, Naji was a former collaborator with the authorities and Kohen was his handler. In the course of a meeting, Naji and his accomplices shot No'am Kohen and his two bodyguards. No'am Kohen died as a result of the shooting and the Shin Bet has been conducting a manhunt after Naji ever since.
