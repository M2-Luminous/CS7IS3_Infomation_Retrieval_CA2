The industry welcomed a total of 40 million overseas tourists and reaped a record 4.6 billion U.S. dollars in foreign exchange by the end of the year, up 4.9 percent and 16.5 percent respectively over the 1992 figure. In an interview with XINHUA, a high-ranking official of the State Administration of Tourism said that China now ranks 17th in the world in terms of foreign exchange earnings from tourism, dramatically up from the 41st place 15 years ago. To ensure steady growth in the booming tourism, the government has urged the country's tourism institutions and agencies to take harsh measures next year to curb random charges on overseas tourists surcharged by guides and drivers who pressurize tourists into shopping and thus receive commissions. The official said that the government will strictly forbid hotels and restaurants catering for foreigners to receive sales commission or brokerage of any kind through dealing with tourist groups. They should supply the exact food to the tourists as ordered under the contract. No unauthorized changes should be made in the diet. The official said that the relevant departments should also pay great attention to improving toilet sanitation at scenic spots, about which overseas tourists complain most. Moreover, according to the official, the relevant government departments will take tougher and more effective measures to crack down on such illegal activities as prostitution, gambling and drug taking, and to punish severely people who connive at such behavior. As for Chinese citizens who are to go abroad for sightseeing, the state tourism departments will map out plans for such visits, the official added.
