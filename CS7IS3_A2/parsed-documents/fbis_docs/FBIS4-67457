Various foundations and associations are springing up like mushrooms. Meanwhile the situation with health of Russians is getting closer and closer to the concept of "catastrophe." A. Yablokov, chairman of the Interdepartmental Commission for Ecological Security, of the RF [Russian Federation] Security Council, provides an even more tragic formulation: "Ecocide in action." He stated recently, "I have ceased hoping that the government, caught up in the burning issues that face society today, will itself recognize the terrible danger of ecocide. Society as a whole must force the authorities to act!" That was the topic of our discussion with Andrey Demin, a consultant in the MVK [Interdepartmental Commission] apparatus. Demin: So far, we do not have any broad public movement for health. The organizations that basically engage in these questions are rather narrow organizations of professionals, primarily medical doctors. But no one is coordinating their activities. The "Green" -- ecological -- movement is developmentally two to three years ahead of the "White" movement for health that is being born today. In analyzing what is occurring, we attempt not simply to confirm the tragedy, but also to seek an answer to the question, "What should we do?" I would answer that question in this way: the only path is to build health into the country's socioeconomic development. The crux of the matter is to assure that health actually becomes the chief priority for the state, and to assure that every decision is made with a consideration of its consequences for people's health. Sukhaya: What are the first steps in the "White" movement? Demin: It is necessary first of all to at least collect the information and to unite the organizations that already exist. One of our first projects is the preparation and publication of an atlas, entitled "Health and the Environment." It contains a scientifically substantiated picture of the state of health of the population of Russia over its entire territory. The task is to depart from the impersonal average figures and provide specific information. Because the first report on the health of Russians did not appear until late 1992. We are just beginning to make our way out of the fog. All the base figures and indicators used to be hidden and classified. For example, a document on the problems of alcoholism at Goskomstat [State Statistics Committee] was prepared for the leadership in only a few carefully numbered copies. It used to be felt that some "chief administrator," issuing commands from Moscow, could change the entire situation in the country. Recently I was at a seminar in Canada. I kept hearing the term "a society that is moved by information." That is, a society not moved by somebody's will, not by fraud, not by slogans or an attractive idea, but by objective information. By having that information, people are capable of understanding and changing a lot. If, of course, they still have hope... The information about health was too frightening, and too obviously pointed the finger of responsibility at the system, so it was "classified." But in recent years the authorities, who have begun everything "from a clean slate," have taken the risk of declassifying the situation. And thank God that the job has been brought to its end. The first report was a purely informational one. We were given the task of creating a mirror. The mirror appeared. Russians looked into it and they were terrified. But they learned the truth about themselves. Moreover, the President's Edict and the government's decree stating that similar reports are a mandatory annual procedure were enacted. Sukhaya: Let's hope to God that, with every passing year, this mirror will frighten us less and less. But it is also important that that mirror should not be "curved." Demin: The first experience has indicated that we can no longer deal only with average figures. There used to be indicators for the mortality rate and the birth rate for the entire Soviet Union. But with the tremendous difference between, say, Central Asia and the Baltic republics, they lost any real sense. They were all leveled off. It is impossible to change or resolve anything by orienting oneself on them. In 1992 joint research was carried out in Karelia by local specialists and their neighbors from Finland. They studied the people who were living right next to one another -- on identical land, under the same sky, amid the same forests and lakes. But how different the situation proved to be with our neighbors' health! For example, on the Russian side the overall mortality rate in the 33-64 year age group was almost twice as high, and the mortality rate from cardiovascular diseases was almost 67 percent higher. We should have realized long ago that health is not simply something that is "God-given." It directly depends upon, for example, whether the city has a normal water-supply line. Sukhaya: It would seem that "omnipotent" Moscow answered for the average figures. Does the specific data also presuppose actions taken locally? Demin: Of course a lot can be done by people's own efforts, but some things require federal support. We plan to send out our atlas for all the territories, and to make the objective picture known to the local population. Quite recently a group of specialists on the initiative of and under the leadership of A. Yablokov prepared a report entitled "The Population's Health and the Chemical Pollution of the Environment in Russia." Once again, this was the first attempt, on the basis of a tremendous amount of factual material, to compile the proof of the pernicious influence that specific chemical factors have upon various indicators of people's well-being. By having that information, everyone is free to decide how to avoid the threat to life -- his own, and that of his children and grandchildren: whether he should leave a dangerous area or, by uniting with other victims, to force the polluter (including by way of the court) to stop his poisonous emissions. The report was a compilation of hundreds of scientifically proven figures and facts. We shall quote only a few of them. The industrial emissions from our enterprises are counted in the millions of tons. The annual amount of pollutants for every inhabitant of Russia is approximately 300 kilograms. The cities that head this sad list of leaders are Norilsk, Nikel, Novotroitsk, Angarsk, Monchegorsk, and Novokuybyshevsk. And, as compared with Moscow, Samara, or Arkhangelsk, the indicators are higher by tens of times! In Moscow the highest level of pollution of the atmospheric air is typical of the center, the northwest, and the northeast. The level of the disease rate for bronchial asthma among children here is higher by a factor of three or more than in the city's relatively clean rayons. In the children who have been subjected to the effect of the polluted air, health problems arise even before the moment of birth. For example, in Moscow the weight of newborn infants born to mothers living in the area influenced by the emissions from the Motor Vehicles Plant imeni Likhachev is an average of 400 grams less than in the cleaner control rayon. The causes of childhood disability today include in first place affections of the central nervous system. The frequency of such diseases constitutes, on the average, 38 per 1000 children, but in ecologically serious rayons that figure jumps to 50 or more. In Russia there is a constant increase in the number of pregnancy pathologies, primarily in the major industrial centers. In Ufa the indicator for various complications in pregnant women during the past 20 years increased from 8.9 to 20.1 per hundred births -- this is almost three times more than the average republic level. The reason is that a tremendous number of women work in enterprises of the petrochemical complex. In Bratsk 40 percent of the women who have decided to have children have a premature cessation of pregnancy, and 51 percent have a pathology in childbirth. So just think about how many chances a future mother who lives here has for carrying and giving birth to a child without any complications. The serious ecological situation increases the risk of having cancer. The highest indicators for lung cancer are recorded in the major industrial oblasts: Leningrad, Nizhniy Novgorod, Saratov, and Chelyabinsk oblasts. The cities that are especially dangerous are those where aluminum plants that use obsolete technology are located (Krasnoturinsk, Kamensk-Uralskiy, Shelekhov, Bratsk). There is increased oncological mortality among the population of cities where enterprises for the smelting of copper and nickel are located (Rezh, Ufaley, and Karabash in Sverdlovsk Oblast, and Nikel in Murmansk Oblast). In Magnitogorsk in the atmospheric air the concentration of the very dangerous carcinogen benzapyrene exceeds the PDK [maximum permissible concentration] by as much as a factor of 90. There is increased danger to people's health in many cities with a well-developed chemical or petrochemical industry. For example, in "chemical" Sterlitamak the oncological disease rate is twice as high, the stillbirth rate is six to seven times higher; the frequency of congenital defects in development is three times higher; and the disease rate for bronchial asthma is six times higher. It was not too long ago when information such as this probably would have been classified. Today we are attempting to publicize it as rapidly and as widely as possible. Not in order to frighten people, but in order to get them to take action. Sukhaya: Do you believe in my favorite saying, "Forewarned is forearmed?" Demin: Definitely, a person can wave a warning aside and fail to pay any attention to it. But he must have the right to receive this kind of information. This is a bitter truth. But there is no need to be afraid of mirrors. As I have already said, by having information, people are capable of understanding and changing much in their lives, if, of course, they still have hope...
