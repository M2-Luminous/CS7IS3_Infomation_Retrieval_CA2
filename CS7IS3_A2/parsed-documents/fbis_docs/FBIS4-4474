"The UN statement underlined what the international community wants North Korea to do to help resolve the issue of Pyongyang's suspected nuclear program through dialogue," Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "We will support this statement," the top government spokesman said. All 15 members of the UN Security Council, including China, a traditional ally of North Korea, agreed to issue the statement Thursday calling for Pyongyang to accept full inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Later in the day, Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman Kishichiro Amae also told a press conference that Japan supports the U.N. presidential [as received] statement on North Korea because it "clearly shows as a unified opinion of the world community" what North Korea should do to solve the problem through dialogue. He added that Japan "strongly wishes North Korea would pay serious attention to the statement." "We also consider that the role of China, in her relationship with North Korea, is still very, very important," he said.
