According to the draft law (written by Paul Simon of the Democratic Party and Hank Brown of the Republican Party), Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary were supposed to be included on the list of countries that would be able to receive surplus U.S. defense equipment. Within the framework of special cooperation programs, the Polish Army would be able to lease U.S. military equipment, draw upon U.S. expertise, and gradually change its equipment to make it conform to NATO standards. The draft law also envisioned the signing of agreements, using the agreement with Korea as a model, concerning rapid supplies of aerial weapons. Senators Simon and Brown have expressed their hope that the law will speed up Poland's integration into NATO. In a conversation with ZYCIE WARSZAWY yesterday, Brown's press spokesman confirmed that the Department of State took a negative position on the draft law in this form. The White House declined comment.
