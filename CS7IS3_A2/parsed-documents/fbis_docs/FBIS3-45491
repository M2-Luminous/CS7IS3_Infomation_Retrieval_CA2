Government bodies involved in the IPR issue were requested to draft explanatory notes detailing their responses and efforts thus far for presentation to U.S. officials and private bodies as the government here seeks to consolidate gains from recent legislation. The ROC [Republic of China] last April was first placed on a "priority watch list" of 16 nations ordered to step up measures against IPR violations or face retaliation under the United States Trade Representative's package of sanctions known as Super 301. Taiwan and Thailand were the only nations retained on the list when it was revised last August. On January 3, the USTR's office requested reports from those two nations prior to a further reassessment. The officials, representing the MOEA [Ministry of Economic Affairs], the Ministry of Justice, The Legislative Yuan, and Ministry of the Interior met yesterday for the 14th session of the inter-ministerial task force on IPR. The task force meets about every two months on issues regarding enforcement of international copyright law. Concrete progress on IPR issues was reviewed, including full passage by the legislature of the Cable Television Law last November and the finalization of amendments to the Intellectual Property law in December, which combined to significantly strengthen enforcement of international statutes. Still before the legislature is a bill on recordings which will further clarify regulations on the production, purchase and rental and audio and video tapes. Other measures include the planned establishment of a special intellectual property rights bureau under the MOEA. The MOEA last night said present efforts of the inter-ministerial group were focused in the categories of legislation, prosecution under the law, and spot checks on shops and entertainment establishments and strengthening customs enforcement. Those measures have been aided by cooperation with the U.S. government and private groups including the International Anti-counterfeiting Coalition, Inc.
