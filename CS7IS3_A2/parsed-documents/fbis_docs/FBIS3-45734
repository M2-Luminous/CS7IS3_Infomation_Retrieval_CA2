Cosea made the remarks to reporters at the Bucharest airport upon his return from China. During the visit, he said, his delegation witnessed the enormous economic achievements in China and toured the fabulously flourishing special economic zones in its part. His delegation exchanged opinions on economic reforms with Chinese Government leaders at central and lower levels, Cosea said. Besides mutual cooperation in the domain of economic reforms, his delegation agreed with Chinese officials that Romania and China should further advance their economic and trade relations, he said. The Romanian Government took interest in developing economic relations with China in that China is not only an extremely important and stable partner of Romania, but also a huge market to exploit, he said. Expressing "double satisfaction" at the outcome of his visit to China, he stressed that the new international environment and the economic reforms underway in the two countries was in no way limiting the development of their relations, but only altered the framework for cooperation. Romania should make extensive efforts in search of means of furthering Sino-Romanian relations, he said. He added that his delegation returned home very well prepared on certain questions and that discussions would be held with the Ministries of Trade, Industries and Finance so that specific ways could be worked out to foster closer economic and trade ties with China.
