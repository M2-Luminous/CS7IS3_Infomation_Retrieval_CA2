This will go towards: - Expanding support for non-governmental organisations working in the area to provide water, food and health services; - Helping to protect the environment in the ecologically fragile Kagera region of Tanzania, including research into alternative fuels to prevent deforestation; - Assisting Uganda with the disposal of corpses; - Improving the management of the aid operation, including the continuation of an airbridge at Mwanza in north-west Tanzania to ferry in supplies and the exploration of the possible alternative uses of road, rail or water. This brings the amount given to help Rwandan refugees to over 11 million pounds since April, including the UK share of EC aid.
