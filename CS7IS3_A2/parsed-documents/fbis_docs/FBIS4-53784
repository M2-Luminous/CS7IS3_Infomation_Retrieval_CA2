In a statement released through the foundation here Thursday [19 May], Kim expressed regret at the incorrect reporting on his interview with the U.S. newspaper and asked South Koreans not to misunderstand him. "I have persistently said North Korea's nuclear ambitions must be completely done away with in tens of lectures, meetings and interviews that I have had since my arrival in the United States, " he said. THE WASHINGTON TIMES' story contained none of his remarks' true meaning, he stressed. On his comments regarding a visit to the United States by North Korean President Kim Il-song, he said he had never proposed that President Bill Clinton invite Kim to visit Washington. "But I have said that I strongly believe Kim's participation in a U.N. General Assembly session as the head of state of a member nation would have the positive effect of solving the North Korean nuclear issue, promoting inter-Korean cooperation and easing tension on the Korean peninsula," he added. Free discussion of various topics related to national unification will help the government forge a unification policy on the basis of a national consensus, he said, noting that all programs derived from such a policy must be carried out solely by the government.
