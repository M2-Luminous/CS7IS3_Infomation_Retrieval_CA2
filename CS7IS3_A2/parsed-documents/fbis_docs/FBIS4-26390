They went to the areas that are heavily guarded against the flood -- the Zhaoqing area along the Xi Jiang and the large dam on the Bei Jiang, to give guidance and make arrangements for the work to combat the floods and deal with emergencies. The group feels that, so far, the work of preventing floods and providing relief to disaster-hit areas has been successful in Guangdong. The group inspected the condition of the disaster in the flood-prevention areas of Yunan County and Fengkai County along the Xi Jiang in Zhaoqing and called for the local government to try every possible means to help more than 50,000 people besieged by the floods get through their difficulties. The group praised the people in Daqiaowei, Deqing County, for their meritorious deeds in combating the floods, as more than 10,000 local cadres and masses struggled for three days and nights to build an embankment of sand bags one meter high and seven km long to rein in the flood water overflow and secure the lives and properties of some 100,000 people in five townships and towns. The group also carefully inspected Fengle County in Dinghu District of Zhaoqing, which is a "difficult place to fortify against the flood." Yesterday, the group hurriedly left Zhaoqing for Lubao Town, the front-line flood control command post of the Bei Jiang Dam, to inspect the three dangerous sections in Xialingzhou.
