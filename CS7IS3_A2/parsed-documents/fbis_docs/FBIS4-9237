The detention are in conformity with the law. During the sudden controls the police organs have detained citizens from Vlore, Pogradeci, Delvina, Gjirokaster (south of Albania), Shkoder, Hasi, Bulqiza (north) and from Tirana (central Albania). The police has taken from them tommy guns, pistols, knives and munitions. Besides the arms, the police has also confiscated a lot of anticonstitutional documents which proves the expansionist and annexionist Greek intentions toward Albania and the Albanian territories, as well as the flagrant Greek endeavour to make Greek the southern part of Albania.
