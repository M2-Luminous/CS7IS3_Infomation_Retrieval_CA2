He often falls into a comatose state these days, thus signaling a red flag in his physical condition. Although President Kim Il-song has boasted to foreign visitors that he keeps healthy thanks to his "optimistic outlook on life," informed sources, such as those who have recently visited North Korea and met President Kim Il-song and Chinese medical circles, say that his physical health has been deteriorating with each passing day because of various geriatric diseases, such as senile dementia, enlargement of the lump on the back of his neck, neurotic disorder of the lumbar vertebra, heaviness in the chest from a heart pacemaker, and mental confusion. When he appeared on the rostrum of the Kumsusan Assembly Hall in Pyongyang to deliver a New Year's address on 31 December it was revealed that he has distinct difficulty in walking resulting from retrogressive arthritis. The arthritis causes pain in the area above the hip, so he has to be assisted by two or three secret servicemen when he climbs up stairs. The most distinct proof of the deterioration of his health is a speech disorder resulting from senile dementia. While reading this year's New Year's address, he made errors and his pronunciation was indistinct from a droop in his lower lip. These errors and indistinct pronunciation of words occurred some 70 times during this year's New Year's address, compared with 30 times during his 1993 New Year's address. Because of the senile dementia, his right hand trembles, he has difficulty in chewing food, and frequently uses a handkerchief to wipe off the area around his mouth. His sight has deteriorated to the extent that he has to read documents in large printed letters with reading glasses. The hearing in his right ear is so deteriorated that he frequently says, "What did you say?" For this reason, when he receives foreign visitors, he has Sony Japanese-made speakers installed in each seat. The lump on the back of his head, which is an obesity-caused tumor, is confirmed to have deteriorated so much that it presses against the larynx nerve. The lump is not life-threatening, but an operation to remove it is impossible because it is located close to the cranial nerve. Some 10 doctors recommended by the CPC performed an acupuncture procedure in October 1992, but he still suffers from increasing pain from the pressure on the larynx nerve. Because of the neurotic disorder of the lumbar vertebra, President Kim Il-song has recently reduced the length of his discussions and speeches to one hour and half an hour respectively under ordinary circumstances. He refrains from traveling by airplane or by car on unsurfaced roads, which can adversely affect the lumbar vertebra. He also avoids standing or walking for long periods of time. He uses a wheel chair when he is at his villa. The degree of his shaking backward and forward while standing has increased compared with last year, as witnessed by many. In addition, President Kim Il-song, who has cardiovascular disease, invited a medical specialist from the former East Germany at the end of 1972 to perform an operation to dilate his heart blood vessels and to insert a heart pacemaker. In 1987, he was operated on again for the insertion of another aid device by a French surgical specialist. Since the end of 1991, medical doctors from the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan have regularly visited North Korea to check his physical condition. In February 1992, however, he was unconscious for a few minutes, so he received a secret treatment at a villa in Chongjin for one month in the middle of September of that year. Meanwhile, with Kim Il-song's health deteriorating with each passing day, the North Korean authorities are reported to be training those who resemble Kim's appearance and constitution, selecting them through an advertisement on "recruiting actors for a documentary film" for security and acting training, including intonation and walking-style training, to prevent confusion that may result after Kim Il-song's death.
