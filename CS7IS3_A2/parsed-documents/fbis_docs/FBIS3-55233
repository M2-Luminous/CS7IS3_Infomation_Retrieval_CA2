Let me pass my most sincere greetings and wishes of prosperity and happiness to you and the entire diplomatic corps. I want to emphasize that I am extremely happy to have the chance to meet you and share opinions with you on various issues of bilateral relations and international problems. I am grateful to you for the nice wishes and opinions that you have repeatedly voiced at meetings with me and other Council of Ministers representatives. I sincerely hope that the spirit of mutual understanding, friendship, and personal sympathy will prevail in our relations. I am convinced that this will serve the interests of our states and nations. Due to the nature of your work you are well-informed about the problems Belarus are experiencing. I do not want to conceal the fact that we are living through hard times -- critical processes in the economy are aggravating which has a negative impact on the sociopolitical sphere and causes negative reaction on the part of certain social groups. Many people have difficulties comprehending what is going on, and demand that the course of reform be abandoned. We clearly see the seriousness of the current historic period and are doing our best to decently exit the situation. Of course, the economy is not the only important factor. A radical reshaping of the political and administrative systems is under way that involves changes in mentality and ideology and thus, the entire system of personal and social values. At the same time, everyday mentality fails to follow these processes, also because we have not formed a comprehensive theoretical footing for the latter. This causes frustration and dissatisfaction and optimistic thinking often gives way to pessimism. Doubts continue to grow regarding the authenticity of the path upon which the Republic has set out. Diametrically opposing opinions are voiced -- some suggest orienting toward the East, while others maintain that the key to resolving our problems lies in the West. With regard to this, I would like to answer one question that disturbs me: Does Belarus has its own foreign policy? Yes, we have such a policy and its essence is not seeking priorities from the so-called "class perspective." Its essence is to be driven solely by national-regional interests. It is based on refraining from using force or threatening to use force. As you know, the Republic of Belarus, having proclaimed independence and won statehood, declared a ban on possessing nuclear arms and ever since, has been consistently pursuing this policy on the international arena. Thus, we were the first among the former USSR republics, and in general, among the world's nations, to initiate nuclear disarmament without putting forward any preconditions. By doing this, we laid our own little brick into the common foundation for European and international security. At the same time, we are not expecting any gratitude from the world community. The main issue for us is trust, mutual understanding, and an opportunity for full-blooded international cooperation. These principled approaches determine the primary directions of our foreign policy, based on our vision of world problems and ways to resolve them. This does not depend on conjuncture -- this is a result of our convictions and the political evaluation of the Republic's place and mission as a European state. This is a form of our participation in resolving global international problems. We carefully examined the initiative voiced by NATO states on implementing a new concept of European security called "Partnership for Peace." I believe that these issues will be discussed in detail in the course of President Clinton's visit to Belarus. We are ready for this, and we will try to be reliable partners for our neighbors both in the East and the West. On Domestic Situation I have already said that our domestic situation is complicated and contradictory. Its major peculiarity lies in the fact that proclaimed democratic values and goals have not received legislative footing. The lack of a precise scheme for the division of powers often becomes the source of instability and political opposition. Paradoxical situations arise when the sprouts of the market economy are treated with an iron hand of administrating, while the emerging entrepreneurship is fought as dissidence. I mean the notorious reports on corruption. What happened? In my opinion, certain forces, intentionally or not, used data that lacked judicial evaluation to launch an attack on democracy. These groupings decided to review the process of democratic reform and reverse market changes. When left and right radicalisms merge, this may initiate mob rule which may block the Republic's path to the market, destroy social accord, and hamper the process of political changes in general. Of course, all this should be submitted to an in-depth analysis, but many people have already understood that the government, just like the legislature, needs more reliable legal and constitutional protection and immunity against cheap populism and petty heroism. A Couple of Words on Our Economy The socioeconomic development of Belarus has recently been accompanied by further exacerbation of critical phenomena, the shrinking of production and investments, inflation and deregulation of the consumer market. This has led to a deterioration in living standards. The main cause of the crisis is the destruction of the single economic space of the former USSR. However, there also exist domestic factors. Due to well-known historic conditions, an abnormal structure of production has developed in the Republic, inadequate for the demands and purchasing power of our citizens. The Belarusian economy is currently one of the most open economies. The Republic exports 19 percent of its products, importing 18 percent of consumer goods. For example, in 1992, Belarus imported 100 percent of natural gas, coal, steel pipes, cars, tractor trailers, wood processing machines, and so on. Aside from this, high material and power outlays are the typical traits of the Belarusian economy. The situation was not that acute when the country received cheap raw materials, semimanufactures, and power resources from Russia and the other republics of the former USSR. Today, when prices for raw materials and power have reached the world level and the quality of Belarusian products does not meet international standards, further development of the structure of the economy granting competitiveness to just 3 percent of its products would lead to complete bankruptcy. Thus, the primary task currently facing the state is global structural reshaping. We are trying to exercise maximum control over this process to alleviate inevitable accompanying hardships afflicting society. With difficulty, so far, we have managed to achieve this. Belarus has the lowest rates of reduction in major economic indicators among all the CIS states with a similar socioeconomic structure, although due to understandable reasons prices for main power resources are five to 10 times higher in the Republic than in Russia. This is the principal factor determining the low exchange rate of the Belarusian "hare" as compared to the Russian ruble. Local peculiarities aggravate the situation. Among these, we should first of all underline the demographic structure unfavorable to economic development -- pensioners and elderly represent a significant part of society. People from many regions of the former USSR have often preferred to retire in Belarus. The second negative peculiarity is the unheard-of concentration of the former Soviet Army's units and the necessity to observe USSR's commitments in the field of disarmament. Belarus is strictly implementing these commitments. Third, we are continuing an exhausting battle against the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident. We are forced to direct huge financial resources to resolve these problems, complicating and retarding the progress of reform. However, we are steadily pursuing the course for privatizing state property, demonopolizing industries, and fundamentally reforming the credit and banking system. We understand that unlike the deregulation of prices, these systematic institutional changes cannot be carried out overnight, even if the former enjoy sociopolitical acceptance on the part of the people. Serious problems emerge on our way. The "invisible" hand of the market brings changes undesirable for society. This is demonstrated by the experience of many countries living through a transitional period. When prices are set free, the application of Western-type monetary methods is often inefficient and may bring opposite results. The government has a concept as to how to resolve these problems. This concept is based on the sober evaluation of our potential and understanding of an active involvement of the state in realigning the economy. Interaction with Russia is the cornerstone of this concept. You have probably noticed that the government needed civic courage, resoluteness, and untraditional thinking to take some of these measures. We have often had to conduct acute political battles, debate with our opponents, and break through the lack of understanding. We are absolutely positive that we took a correct line in stipulating an economic union within the CIS framework, a single ruble zone with Russia, and a coordinated customs legislation. This will give our people the possibility to live and work in a civilized manner. To persuade the people, the government is forced to act as a political organization, and sometimes perform similar functions. It is not through coincidence that we are occasionally called a "team" or even a "party." With regard to this, I want to emphasize that we are carrying the burden of political responsibility for the fate of the nation. In light of this, the social orientation of West European democratic and social-democratic parties seems most attractive to us. The virtues of these parties are widely known. They were the first to give a theoretical footing to building a society of class peace, took an active part in eliminating the postwar economic crisis in Europe, and substantially contributed to the building of the states of law. Their cooperation on the international arena has granted a lasting peace in Europe; onetime enemies have been actively cooperating; economic integration is being accompanied by a political one. I believe that these achievements can be successfully applied on Belarusian soil after introducing appropriate corrections given the new historic conditions. Speaking in the town of Mir a year ago, I formulated the government's economic and sociopolitical strategies. Ever since, nobody has come up with an alternative program oriented toward the interests of the people. This gives me confidence in the correctness of the chosen path. I am ready to cooperate with all the forces sharing these democratic and social values. I hope for understanding and support from all political forces loyal to the ideas of the national renaissance of the Republic of Belarus. I also count on your understanding and support. Happy New Year! With all my heart I wish prosperity, peace, and well-being to your nations. I am addressing all the Belarusian citizens and compatriots abroad with New Year greetings. I wish you good health, happiness, and success in work for the benefit of our native land.
