FR941205-0-00027 FR941205-0-00002 (a) (1) An applicant for asylum who has not been convicted of an aggravated felony shall be eligible pursuant to §§274a.12(c)(8) and 274a.13(a) of this chapter to submit an Application for Employment Authorization (Form I&hyph;765). The application shall be submitted no earlier than 150 days after the date on which a complete application for asylum submitted in accordance with §§208.3 and 208.4 of this part has been received. If an application for asylum has been returned as incomplete in accordance with §208.3(c)(5), the 150-day period will commence upon receipt by the INS of a complete application for asylum. An applicant whose application for asylum has been denied by an asylum officer or by an immigration judge within the 150-day period shall not be eligible to apply for employment authorization. After the expiration of the 150-day period, the INS shall have 30 days from the date of filing of an initial application for employment authorization to grant or deny that application. If the INS fails to adjudicate the asylum application within that period, the alien shall be eligible for interim employment authorization under this chapter. If an application for asylum is denied by an immigration judge or an asylum officer within the 30-day period, but prior to a decision on the application for employment authorization, the application for employment authorization shall be denied. (2) An applicant who has been convicted of an aggravated felony shall not be granted employment authorization. In cases where an applicant has previously received employment authorization and his or her application for asylum or withholding of deportation is denied because the applicant has been convicted of an aggravated felony, the employment authorization shall terminate as of the date of the denial. (3) For purposes of this paragraph (a), the time periods within which the alien may not apply for employment authorization and within which the INS must respond to any such application shall begin when the alien has filed a complete asylum application in accordance with §§208.3 and 208.4. Any delay requested or caused by the applicant shall not be counted as part of these time periods. Such time periods also shall be extended by the equivalent of the time between issuance of a request for evidence under §103.2(b)(8) of this chapter and the receipt of the applicant's response to such request. (4) An applicant who fails without good cause to appear for a scheduled interview before an asylum officer or a hearing before an immigration judge shall not be granted employment authorization pursuant to §274a.12(c)(8) of this chapter. (5) The provisions of paragraphs (a) (1), (3), and (4) of this section shall apply to persons who have filed an application for asylum or withholding of deportation on or after January 4, 1995. (b) Subject to the restrictions in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, employment authorization shall be renewable, in increments to be determined by the Commissioner, for the continuous period of time necessary for the asylum officer or immigration judge to decide the asylum application and, if necessary, for final adjudication of any administrative or judicial review. * * * * * (3) If an application for asylum filed on or after November 29, 1990 is denied pursuant to §208.14(c)(4) or §208.16(c)(2)(ii) because the applicant has been convicted of an aggravated felony, any employment authorization previously issued under §208.7(a) shall automatically terminate as of the date of the denial. * * * * * 7. Section 208.8 is revised to read as follows: §208.8 Limitations on travel outside the United States. An applicant who leaves the United States pursuant to advance parole granted under 8 CFR 212.5(e) shall be presumed to have abandoned his application under this section if he returns to the country of claimed persecution unless the applicant is able to establish compelling reasons for such return. 8. Section 208.9 is amended by: a. Revising paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e); b.
