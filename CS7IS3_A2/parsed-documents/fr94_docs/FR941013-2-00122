FR941013-2-00122 FR941013-2-00088 Office of Commercial Space Transportation [Docket 49815 (Licensing Commercial Space Launch Activities); and Docket No. 43098 (Financial Responsibility Requirements); Notice 94&hyph;17] RIN 2105&hyph;AB85; 2105&hyph;AA26 Public Meeting; Notice AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, Office of Commercial Space Transportation, DOT. ACTION: Notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Office of Commercial Space Transportation (OCST) is holding a public meeting to obtain industry input to assist it with rulemaking activities currently under consideration. OCST seeks information that will assist it in developing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) addressing specific requirements for launch and launch site operator license applications submitted to OCST. OCST seeks to standardize its review of license applications while at the same time allowing prospective licensees design and operational flexibility for their proposals. OCST also plans to develop a second NPRM addressing implementation of financial responsibility requirements and allocation of risks associated with the conduct of licensed activities. Accordingly, OCST seeks views concerning the range of activities that may be covered by these requirements and the scope of the U.S. Government's payment of third-party claims that exceed the amount of required liability insurance. DATES: The meeting is scheduled to take place on October 27 and 28, 1994, from 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. each day, in Room 2230 of the Department of Transportation's Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC. ADDRESSES: Written submissions may be provided to OCST in addition to or in place of oral remarks presented at the public meeting. We would appreciate receiving each submission in triplicate with an indication of the Docket Number (listed above) to which it refers. One submission may be used to address both the licensing and financial responsibility dockets. Submissions should be sent to Docket Clerk, Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street SW., Room 4107, Washington, DC 20590. Comments will be available for public inspection at this address from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Written submissions should be provided by November 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Linda Strine, Deputy Assistant Director for Program Affairs, OCST, (202) 366&hyph;2980. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Background The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984, 49 U.S.C. 2601&hyph;2623, as recodified at 49 U.S.C. Subtitle IX_Commercial Space Transportation, ch. 701, Commercial Space Launch Activities, 49 U.S.C. 70101&hyph;70119 (1994) (the Act), authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to oversee and regulate commercial launch activities and the commercial operation of launch sites carried out within the United States or by its citizens. The Act requires that this responsibility be exercised to protect the public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. The Secretary's responsibilities under the Act, including licensing commercial launches and the operation of launch sites, as well as the obligation to encourage, facilitate and promote establishment of a competitive United States commercial space transportation industry, are implemented by OCST. OCST implements its licensing and regulatory authority through the Commercial Space Transportation Licensing Regulations (Regulations), 14 C.F.R. Ch. III. At the time the Regulations were published in April 1988, no commercial launches had yet taken place. In adopting its approach to licensing commercial launch activities, as reflected in the Regulations, OCST recognized the need to establish a regulatory environment responsive to the needs of an emerging industry while assuring the public that commercial launch activities would be conducted safely and responsibly. At that time, OCST indicated that it would ``continue to evaluate and, when necessary, re-shape its program in response to growth, innovation, and diversity in this critically important industry.'' 53 Fed. Reg. 11006. Both OCST's experience in administering the Act and launch companies' experience in operating in a commercial environment subject to DOT's regulatory oversight have evolved with time. OCST now seeks to streamline its licensing process while continuing to ensure safety and preserving the flexibility necessary to address myriad launch technologies and associated issues. Accordingly, OCST contemplates issuing rules of general applicability to enhance industry certainty regarding what is required of an applicant in the licensing process and what is required of a licensee after a license has been issued. Launch and Launch Site Operator Licensing Procedures Under the Act, a DOT license is required for any person to launch a launch vehicle or operate a launch site within the United States. In addition, a license is also required for a U.S. citizen to launch a launch vehicle or operate a launch site outside the United States. Foreign corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, associations or other entities controlled by U.S. citizens do not need licenses to conduct these activities from foreign territory unless the foreign nation involved has agreed that the United States shall exercise jurisdiction over the activity. In exercising this licensing authority under the Act, the Secretary must protect public health and safety, safety of property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. The Regulations issued in 1988 reflect OCST's approach to evaluating license applications on a case-by-case basis. To date, OCST has relied on these Regulations, and on guidelines it makes available upon applicant request, to advise prospective applicants of the information OCST requires to perform safety and mission reviews of a launch license application. Having obtained six years of experience in evaluating launch proposals and conducting safety research, OCST is now prepared to streamline the launch licensing process by standardizing requirements wherever possible without impeding innovation. In response to industry requests for greater certainty in the application process, and in order to achieve consistency, OCST proposes to codify certain specific information requirements in regulations. In doing so, the issues to be addressed include: (1) the scope of launch licenses; (2) risk management techniques that enable license applicants to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety; (3) application information requirements; (4) relationship to and consistency with Federal range requirements; and (5) reliance by license applicants on, among other things, industry standards. With respect to launch license application reviews, OCST is interested in obtaining views on at least the following: •What elements of a launch proposal must OCST evaluate to assure launch safety; •Which pre-launch or launch processing operations and procedures should OCST assess to assure launch safety;
