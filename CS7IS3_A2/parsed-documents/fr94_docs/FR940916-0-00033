FR940916-0-00033 FR940916-0-00014 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [CA 79&hyph;1&hyph;6637a; FRL&hyph;5069&hyph;2] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision, Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is taking direct final action on revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP). The revisions concern rules from the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD). The revised rules control VOC emissions from Architectural Coatings, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing, Storage of Petroleum Products, Organic Liquid Loading and Can Coating. This approval action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). In addition, the final action on these rules serves as a final determination that the deficiencies in these rules have been corrected and that on the effective date of this action, any sanctions or Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) obligations are permanently stopped. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. DATES: This final rule is effective on November 15, 1994 unless adverse or critical comments are received by October 17, 1994. If the effective date is delayed, a timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Copies of the rule revisions and EPA's evaluation report for each rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region IX office during normal business hours. Copies of the submitted rule revisions are available for inspection at the following locations: Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105 Environmental Protection Agency, Air Docket 6102, 401 ``M'' Street SW., Washington, DC 20460 California Air Resources Board, Stationary Source Division, Rule Evaluation Section, 2020 ``L'' Street, Sacramento, CA 92123&hyph;1095 Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District, 8475 Jackson Road, suite 230, Sacramento, CA 95826.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Applicability The rules being approved into the California SIP include: SMAQMD's Rule 442, Architectural Coatings; Rule 443, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing; Rule 446, Storage of Petroleum Products; Rule 447, Organic Liquid Loadings; and Rule 452, Can Coating. These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on March 29, 1994. Background On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act or pre-amended Act), that included the Sacramento Metro Area. 43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because this area was unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. (40 CFR 52.222). On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2) of the 1977 Act, that the above district's portion of the California SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies. Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance. 1 EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. The Sacramento Metro Area is classified as severe; 2 therefore, this area was subject to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. 1 Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed post-1987 ozone and carbon monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice'' (Blue Book) (notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1988); and the existing control technique guidelines (CTGs). 2 The Sacramento Metro Area retained its designation of nonattainment and was classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 55 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on March 29, 1994, including the rules being acted on in this notice. This notice addresses EPA's direct-final action for SMAQMD's Rule 442, Architectural Coatings; Rule 443, Leaks from Synthetic Organic Chemical and Polymer Manufacturing; Rule 446, Storage of Petroleum Products; Rule 447, Organic Liquid Loadings; and Rule 452, Can Coating. The SMAQMD adopted these rules on November 16, 1993. These submitted rules were found to be complete on June 3, 1994 pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V 3 and are being finalized for approval into the SIP. 3 EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216). Rule 442 controls VOC emissions from all coatings applied to stationary structures and their appurtenances, to mobile homes, to pavements, or to curbs; Rule 443 limits emissions of VOCs from leaking components at chemical plants that manufacture synthetic organic chemicals and polymers; Rule 446 controls emissions of VOCs from storage tanks for organic liquids with vapor pressures greater than 1.5 psia under actual storage conditions; Rule 447 controls VOC emissions at loading facilities of organic liquids; and Rule 452 limits emissions of VOCs from operations involved in coating of metal containers, coil and cans. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. These rules were originally adopted as part of SMAQMD's effort to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and final action for these rules.
