The German Federation of Trade and Industry [DIHT] considers it necessary to indicate this fact in good time before the European elections. "The waves of criticism vis-a-vis Germany's net-payer position should not go any higher," DIHT's Peter Korn told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE in Brussels, where he and fellow DIHT employees presented a report entitled "Germany -- the Paymaster of Europe?" The occasion for this report was the Bundesbank's November 1993 monthly report, which had led people to believe that Germany was at a disadvantage because it was making excessive net payments to the EU. These net payments are the difference between Germany's contributions to the EU budget and the services that Germany has already derived from the EU. In 1992, this net payment amounted to 22.1 billion German marks [DM]. However, for 30 years now, German enterprises have been reaping greater advantages from European integration than the enterprises of other countries because they have always maintained close economic contacts with foreign enterprises, said DIHT business manager Franz Schoser. He admitted that the advantages of the European single market for the national economies of EU member countries are relatively difficult to document. "However, the mere continuation of the EU's growth in the 1980's and 1990's serves to emphasize the stimulating effects of this single market," he said. In 1991, German payments to the EU budget rose by 46.7 percent against 1990 and amounted to DM33 billion. In 1992 they rose by another 8.2 percent, reaching DM35 billion. The Bundesbank criticized this increase because, in terms of the ratio between the GNP and average purchasing power in the EU countries, united Germany has dropped to sixth place in the European prosperity league. In its report, the DIHT points out that the EU Commission used to apply a different method of reckoning, and used the ratio between per capita GNP expressed in ECU's on the one hand, and market prices of commodities on the other hand, as a basis for assessing prosperity. By this method, postunification Germany was in third place, behind Denmark and Luxembourg. Altogether, therefore, the German net contribution to the EU suits Germany's size and economic potential. In 1991, financial refluxes from Brussels back to Germany were 28.4 percent less than in 1990 and amounted to DM14 billion; in 1992 they sank by 2.9 percent and amounted to DM13.6 billion. The DIHT has no criticism of the refluxes, but is critical of the distortions caused by the agrarian portion of the European budget. Thus, German agriculture has received 14.6 percent of the resources of the Agrarian Fund, while at the same time German agriculture only takes up 1.1 percent of the German GNP. What is decisive is that Germany is the main beneficiary of free trade within the EU. The DIHT welcomes the fact that in the meantime, the EU has recognized the eastern laender as a top-priority aid region, thanks to which between 1994 and 1999, the eastern laender received DM27.6 billion out of the Restructuring Fund. The DIHT doubts whether Germany will be granted a rebate in its payments to the EU, like Great Britain. A limited German rebate would only be expedient as a temporary measure. The main objective of European policy must be to bring about a change in common agrarian policy and to render the new laender appropriate assistance within the framework of regional policy.
