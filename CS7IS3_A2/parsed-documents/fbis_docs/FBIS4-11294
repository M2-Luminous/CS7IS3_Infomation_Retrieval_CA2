To get there, one has to cross Haiti's highest mountain range on trails not fit for motor vehicles, often less than 3 meters wide and occasionally at an altitude of 2,000 meters. After crossing what is left of the Pine Forest and the Thiotte area, considered the country's leading coffee-producing region, one sees nothing but desolation. The spectacle that greets one's eyes is that of a semidesert region whose people are wallowing in poverty. Since the UN Security Council reimposed the sanctions in November, smuggling and prostitution have gained ground. Agriculture, once the peasants' principal or even sole source of income, is quickly being replaced by oil products. On a strip of over 30 km, today's peasants are more concerned about buying and reselling "black gold" than they are with working the fields. Furthermore, some of them say quite openly that the dam on the Pedernales that serves Anse-a-Pitres and the Dominican region of the Pedernales is underutilized on the Haitian side. With no management whatsoever, water from the irrigation system built over a decade ago by Presidents Duvalier and Blanco is unequally distributed and a bag of fertilizer selling for 200 gourdes is out of reach of small farmers. One is forced to conclude that farming in the region today is a rich man's trade. Robert, a 37-year-old farmer lucky enough to attend school for four years of his life, attributes this situation to the poor crop harvested this year and a tight economic situation that has resulted in an excessive rise in the cost of basic products. The fuel trade has replaced coffee, for which the last spectacular boom in world prices was around 1975. Every day, peasants from Bannann, Savane Longue, and Anse-a-Pitres transport thousands of liters of fuel from the various supply points in the border area by donkey or on their own backs and haul it to users in the southeastern and western regions of the country, particularly Jacmel and Port-au-Prince. Haitian merchants in Bannann, Boni, and Savane Longue are served by Dominican traffickers. Haitians cross the border with no problem and get their supply from Kiki, Carlo, or Selom, all Dominicans who in recent years have officially set themselves up as livestock breeders in this very isolated mountainous region. According to the Haitian peasants, however, the truth is a different matter. In actual fact, these Dominican "livestock breeders" are nothing but traffickers who have been smuggling sugar over the border since about 1985. As in the case of the Haitians from Bannann, fuel has now taken the place of sugar for these Dominican "business tycoons" from the "Banano" region. Kiki, Selom, and Carlo require advance payment from the Hatians on fuel purchases, yet they have not yet delivered fuel paid for in January. In Anse-a-Pitres, smuggling and the "fuel market" have expanded considerably. An average of 5,000 gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel cross the border daily, although this commune of over 13,000 inhabitants does not even have three vehicles! There are depots all over the place, a disaster waiting to happen. Oil products are stored in summary dwellings usually built of wood. Already in early March, two homes were ravaged by a fire caused by improper fuel handling. In the daytime, Haitians and Dominicans transport a limited number of fuel containers by sailboat or on foot. It is said that surveillance is strict, but by nightfall Dominican soldiers close their eyes and allow products to get through in exchange for a cut of 3 pesos (3.6 gourds) a gallon. Deals are made "in the field" in Haitian territory. At this spot located less than 2 km from the border, Haitian buyers, looking for all the world like lovers on their way to moonlit evening trysts, stand by their containers waiting for Dominican vendors! All night long, dozens of Dominican traffickers from Pedernales come on foot to unload their supply. At the same time, Haitian sailboats transfer their fuel from Dominican boats anchored in the open sea. In Anse-a-Pitres, business is done in pesos. In recent weeks, Dominican currency has clearly risen in value compared with the Haitian gourde. The rate of exchange has stabilized at 23-24 percent, but the money changers up their rates when they see trucks or boats from the capital or chief regional towns. Local suppliers of oil products react similarly upon seeing these new-type visitors. The Dominican traffickers have also learned to calculate, which they demonstrated clearly by deciding on 19 March to stage a strike. Saturday evening, the Haitians futilely protested the unilateral decision, and the pitch was raised a tone by the leaders of the movement and a handful of traffickers who managed to get through the line to market their products despite the strikers' ban. Armed with sticks and machetes, the Dominican leaders forced the latter to retreat or sell their products at the price set for a Haitian buyer who had deserted his camp. According to one Dominican leader on hand this Saturday evening, the purpose of the movement was to raise the selling price of oil products. The Dominicans claim that a gallon of gasoline going for 35 pesos (42 gourdes) just before the protest movement should cost 45 or 50 (54 or 60 gourdes), while diesel fuel should be sold for between 35 and 40 pesos. Dominican smugglers justify their demands by the fact that their profit margin on a gallon of fuel is insignificant because of deductions made by truckers and Dominican soldiers who are among the prime middlemen and/or beneficiaries of the market. Because of the official ban placed on the sale of oil products in containers by the Balaguer Government, small-time Dominican traffickers are forced to pay truckers 27 pesos for a gallon of gasoline that costs 20 at the pump, they say. The movement, initiated by the Dominicans, seemed to be succeeding by Sunday morning and had a significant impact on the prices paid for oil products in Anse-a-Pitres, considered the main supplier for southeastern Haiti. Boats from Jacmel and Marigot spent hours waiting on Sunday before giving up at noon without ever getting their supply. And yet, they have little choice since waiting is profitable. Once the pie has been split between border runners, soldiers (100 gourdes/drum as the fee between boats), haulers (100 gourdes from Pedernales to Anse-a-Pitres and 520/drum to the capital), the merchants still make a 100-percent profit! "We have lost everything. The crop was bad and `gas' is our only sure source of income. But after the embargo is lifted, the people who do not own land or livestock will definitely have no way to make it," said the farmer who acted as our guide. When asked about a possible date on which the embargo would be lifted, Boyer, a young farmer called intelligent by travelers from Port-au-Prince, left it up to God: "God only knows (...); the people say it will be in two years," he said mischievously.
