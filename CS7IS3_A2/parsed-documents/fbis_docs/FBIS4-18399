As long as there is even the slightest danger that the affected people will be threatened by torture and death, they must not be deported, she stated in Bonn. The minister pointed out that many Kurds have been recognized as asylum-seekers, and that, within the framework of the negotiations on the asylum compromise, Turkey was regarded by all parties as an unsafe country of origin.
