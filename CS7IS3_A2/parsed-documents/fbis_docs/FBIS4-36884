FBIS4-36884 "drnes114_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 SYRIA Damascus Expects `Something New' From Christopher Damascus Expects `Something New' From Christopher PM1406104394 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Arabic 14 Jun 94 p 5 PM1406104394 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Arabic BFN [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Damascus Urges Christopher To Bring Something New If He Wants Successful Visit"] [Excerpt] Damascus, Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- [passage omitted] On the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's arrival in the region a Syrian official has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that, if Christopher wants his latest visit to succeed, he must bring something new as well as clear answers to the fundamental questions Damascus raised during his recent visit, because both the fate and the resumption of the peace process will be determined by these answers. The Syrian official added that Damascus does not believe that Christopher is coming to the region empty-handed. Or that he is going to expose himself to the difficulty and hardship of travel without bringing something new with him. Nor do we believe that the United States would risk its credibility and reputation and evade its pivotal role in the peace process. The Syrian official pointed out that Syria is waiting to see what Christopher is going to bring with him. And that it stresses once again that he is going to receive every response inasmuch as Syria truthfully and sincerely aspires to peace -- a peace called the peace of the brave based on justice and comprehensiveness. The official said: If Israel really is seeking to establish this peace, it -- before anyone else -- knows the roads leading to it, otherwise this peace is going to remain a dream that cannot be realized, thereby pushing the region toward numerous probabilities. The Syrian official accused Israel of seeking to achieve separate deals on all the Arab axes. And that it has prepared for them secretly under the peace slogan in order to impose its conditions on the Arabs individually. The official said: We do not believe that Washington is going to let Israel diminish its role. Because the current U.S. role does not allow it to implement the will of one party to the exclusion of another, especially when that party is in breach of international law. And Israel's interests and relations with the Arabs cannot allow it to be able to impose its conditions and what it terms its peace and security in the region. And the United States is fully aware that separate deals will not lead to peace. In fact, that attitude is going to make peace prospects remote.
