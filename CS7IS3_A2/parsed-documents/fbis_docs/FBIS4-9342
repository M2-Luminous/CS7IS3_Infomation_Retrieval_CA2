The government reviewed the implementation of the Zagreb agreement and preparations for the continuation of the negotiating process with Croatia and the UN. As Mikelic told journalists after the session, at tomorrow's talks on the implementation of the cease-fire agreement with Croatia -- to be held in Turanj near Karlovac -- the Serb side will raise the issue of certain corrections to the buffer zones; that is, the line of separation. We must raise this issue because we have been tasked by the parliament, and we are also forced by complaints from the field. We will reexamine the maps and see what people have not accepted in the implementation of the agreement, Mikelic stressed. The government also adopted stances on the forthcoming talks with the UN special envoy, Yasushi Akashi. As it was said today, the government will set firm conditions, the fulfillment of which will be a precondition for the resumption of talks with Croatia. First of all, Krajina will demand at least a partial annulment of provision 12 of UN Security Council Resolution 820 to make possible talks and negotiations on equal basis, Mikelic said. The Krajina delegation for talks with Akashi will comprise RSK president Milan Martic, prime minister Mikelic, and foreign minister Milan Babic. The delegation will also raise the issue of the reconstruction of Vukovar, for which, according to Mikelic, funds have been secured but have been given to Croatia. We will demand, he said, that the funds be used and that reconstruction begin. The RSK government also has one condition for talks on economic relations with Croatia -- the payment of pensions. "Croatia must honor this to open talks on economic relations. The reopening of traffic links is at the moment out of the question," Mikelic said categorically. According to figures Mikelic presented yesterday while explaining his government's program, around 40,000 pensioners who worked in Croatia are demanding to be paid pensions.
