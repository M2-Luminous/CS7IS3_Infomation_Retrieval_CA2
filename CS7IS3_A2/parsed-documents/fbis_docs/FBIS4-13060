FBIS4-13060 "drnes074cc_94004" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 Islamic Affairs Secular Magazine Attacks AL-SHA'B, Others Secular Magazine Attacks AL-SHA'B, Others NC1504120194 NC1504120194 BFN [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 11 April carries several articles attacking the Labor Party's newspaper AL-SHA'B, "extremist books," and a well-known Islamic writer. It presents portraits of two Islamic figures and praises scriptwriters and actors for espousing the battle against terror. Each of the five subjects covered in this editorial report is dealt with under its own heading as follows: AL-SHA'B CRITICIZED A 2,000-word article on pages 58-59 by Wahid Hamid attacks the Socialist Labor Party's [SLP] biweekly mouthpiece AL-SHA'B [The People]. In the article, headlined "A Newspaper Against the People," the writer contends that both the paper and the SLP are a single-family enterprise, bringing together a group of relatives and in-laws who share "a hereditary dream of leadership, pursued even if it is a leadership of a ruined homeland." Hamid claims the paper has no allegiance to the country but instead, "with great ignorance," advocates "the abolition of the Egyptian character" under the claim of establishing an Islamic character. He says the paper, rather than defending the homeland's causes in a sober way, uses exaggeration, invective, sensationalism, and incitement, which does a disservice to any cause it defends. He says the government pays no heed to this publication and might even benefit from it as providing an example of democratic free speech. The writer accuses AL-SHA'B of belittling the Egyptian Government and people but admiring the systems of government in Sudan and Iraq. Stating that the Iraqi regime would never permit an Islamic government in the country, he says AL-SHA'B's support for this regime must spring from its "automatic sympathy with fascism everywhere, in addition to the usual personal interests well understood by politicians and media people." Commenting on a recent article by SLP Secretary General 'Adil Husayn in which he calls on the people to support his party's jihad until victory is achieved, the writer asks if the Islamic state that AL-SHA'B and the SLP advocate will be any different from the so-called Islamic governments in Afghanistan and Iran. He remarks that even the Saudi Government is a civilian government that merely permits the Wahhabists [puritanical Muslim sect] to monitor Islamic observances. The writer concludes by saying: "A religious state is a mere fantasy that is not in harmony with the spirit of Islam, a religion that has preserved people's rights and left them their free will and liberty. We are on the side of Islam. We seek to make it prosper and fight its opponents but without having to live under a failed dictatorship that professes to be Muslim." EXTREMIST BOOKS On pages 60-61, 'Abd-al-Sattar al-Tawilah takes issue with "extremist books." In an article entitled "A Document of Shame Against Islam and Muslims," he disputes the arguments set forth in the book "Putting the Apostates on Trial" by Ahmad al-Suyufi and says it approves of the assassination of secular writer Faraj Fudah and others accused of apostasy. He says that al-Suyufi expresses views similar to those of Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, Shaykh Mahmud Mazru'ah, and Shaykh Qardawi. He objects to the book's premise that a person changing his religion is comparable with national treason and says that even fascist constitutions guarantee freedom of belief. Al-Tawilah faults the argument that excuses assassinations on the grounds that the government does not permit the religious stream to form a political party or tortures prisoners in jail. He remarks: "Numerous political forces are not permitted to form political parties. Does this mean they have the right to resort to murder and sabotage?" HUWAYDI VIEWED An article by Ibrahim 'Isa on pages 61-63 entitled "Fahmi Huwaydi's Pistol Has a Silencer" comments on the writings of the well-known Islamic writer, Huwaydi. He faults him for quoting other Islamic and secular writers out of context to level accusations at them, generally in an indirect manner, without "declaring anything but leaving things to simmer at a suitable temperature so that the bacteria of accusations will survive without being proclaimed but also without dying." He says he believes "Fahmi Huwaydi possesses an exceptional ability and an astonishing, talented, and admirable know-how in clothing truth with falsehood" to arouse the anger of any "fanatic" or any other reader against writers holding views different from his own to the point of making his readers want to "throttle" those writers. He disputes Huwaydi's description as a "moderate" and says: "The man, talented in several ways, can present himself, and is represented by others, as a moderate. Behind this screen, manipulation occurs. I do not know from where his description as a moderate comes. Is it the calm tone of lamentation in his lines or is it the silencer he uses when he accuses others of disbelief?" While acknowledging Huwaydi's former "important and great" literary contributions, he accuses him of abandoning his past intellectual achievements by not coming out strongly against the call to kill apostates and for his call to hold a dialogue between the government and the extremists. ISLAMIC FIGURES HIGHLIGHTED A 1,800-word report by Usamah Salamah on pages 30-31 discusses the case of a lawyer, Mukhtar Nuh, a formerly obscure but ambitious figure who has been an active member of the Egyptian Lawyers Association as a Muslim Brotherhood representative since 1985. The report discusses his early life since his enrollment as a law student in 1971 and notes that this "skillful guitar player" and member of the drama group at Cairo University's School of Law turned to religion after graduation and was detained by the authorities for 10 months in 1981 in connection with the "religious streams." His first public connection with the Muslim Brotherhood is said to date back to 1985 when he raised the slogan: "Yes, we want it to be Islamic" during the Egyptian Lawyers Association elections. 'Umar al-Talmasani, the late general guide of the Muslim Brotherhood, is reported to have told a group of lawyers at that time: "Mukhtar Nuh will become president of the Lawyers Association in 10 years but will become Muslim Brotherhood general guide in just five years." The report notes that Nuh currently enjoys the backing of Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, who helped nominate him for a seat in the People's Assembly 1987 general election. Nuh is no longer a People's Assembly member but remains active in the Lawyers Association. A 2,000-word report by 'Abdallah Kamal on pages 32-33 speaks of the experiences of 'Abdallah al-Samawi, occasionally referred to by the writer as Taha al-Samawi, an Islamist jailed several times and who espouses the concept of repudiating society for its disbelief. Al-Samawi describes himself as "only a preacher" but the writer says he is behind the rulings to set video rental shops on fire and links him with the "Repudiation and Renunciation" group. ARTISTS PRAISED In a 700-word article on page 34, Ahmad Hamrush expresses dismay at the continuing "terrorist acts by some extremist groups wearing the guise of Islam." He regrets the failure of the political establishment, which he says is plagued by corruption, to do anything about this phenomenon, and praises writers and moviemakers for endeavoring to resist extremism. He notes that Egyptian television has stopped broadcasting some programs and interviewing some personalities that did not properly interpret religion. Instead it is now showing artistic works mentioned elsewhere.
