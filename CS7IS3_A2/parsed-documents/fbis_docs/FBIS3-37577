Taking part in the bill's elaboration were 19 lawyers -- members of the Russian parliament. The law lays down the rights, duties, and responsibilities of members of both chambers of the Russian parliament. It also stipulates the basic rights and guarantees of parliament members, proceeding from Chapter 2 of the Russian Constitution. Now the bill will have to be thrashed out in the committees and commissions of the two chambers of the Russian Federal Assembly (parliament), in the factions and parliamentary groups of the State Duma. Then, not later than March 10, their remarks and suggestions will be summed up by the State Duma's parliamentary committee for organisational affairs. After that, the bill will be submitted for second reading. The document consists of five chapters and 41 articles. It is worth noting that deputies of the two chambers of the parliament, as approved during the first reading, shall enjoy the right of immunity throughout their term of office. They cannot be detained, arrested, or searched, except in cases when they are caught red-handed. They cannot be subjected to personal examination, except cases envisaged by the federal law in order to ensure the safety of other people. The right of immunity covers also the homes and offices of parliament members, their correspondence, the means of communication they use, and also the documents belonging to them. The question of stripping an MP of immunity shall be decided by a corresponding chamber of the Federal Assembly at the request of the procurator-general of the Russian Federation. Members of the Council of the Federation and members of the State Duma are exempted from military service and military training sessions for their entire term of office. They are to furnish information on their incomes and property status to the state taxation service and corresponding bodies of the Council of the Federation and the State Duma (the two chambers of the Russian parliament). Members of the Council of the Federation and members of the State Duma shall have the right to interpellate the president and the government of the Russian Federation, the ministries, departments or any other executive agencies on questions within the competence of those bodies at any time they deem it necessary. It remains to be seen whether or not these provisions will remain in the final text of the law after the second reading.
