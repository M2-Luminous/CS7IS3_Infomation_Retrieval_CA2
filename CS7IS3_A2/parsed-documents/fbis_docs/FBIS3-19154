The resolution implies a timetable of three weeks by asking the UN secretary general to proceed with a longer report on the result of his efforts to finalize the agreement by the end of March. According to our New York correspondent Apostolis Zoumbanioti, UN circles expect that by the end of this month the talks in Nicosia will have made enough progress to make possible direct meetings between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas in New York. The same circles consider 29 March the most probable date for Mr. Kliridhis and Mr. Denktas to visit New York. The resolution further welcomes the fact that the intensive discussions made it possible for the UN secretary general's representatives to promote ideas which, it is noted, could facilitate the talks aimed at achieving agreement on the key issues for implementation of the CBM's. The resolution, which bears the number 902, stresses that the CBM's are neither an end in themselves nor a substitute for the broader political process. It also notes that the CBM's will offer significant advantages to both communities and will facilitate the political process for the achievement of an overall settlement. At the same time, the resolution reiterates the Security Council's position that the status quo in Cyprus is unacceptable. The resolution also notes that the Security Council will proceed with an extensive review of the issue on the basis of a relevant provision of Resolution 789 and on the basis of the report that the UN Secretary General will submit.
