He said in an interview published this morning that the Armed Forces acted to safeguard the interest of the nation. Justifying the operation that led to the destruction of Radio Liberte, the chief of the general crisis staff said that the Armed Forces could no longer accept to be the target of opposition party militiamen and that soldiers could no longer allow themselves to be killed by what he called fanatics and agent provocateurs. According to General Idriss Ngari, Radio-Tele Liberte has been broadcasting messages in all national languages calling for civil disobedience, hatred, revolt, and civil war for a month now.
