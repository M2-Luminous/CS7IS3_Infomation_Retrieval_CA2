What does an employer in Greenland look like? If one regards the Greenland Employers Association delegates who met in Nuuk last weekend as representative of the typical employer, one of the answers is that he is a Danish skilled worker who has built up his own firm from scratch since the 1960's and 1970's. Now he is in his fifties or sixties and has begun to look around for a successor. But that is easier said than done. The unfavorable times and the chronic lack of well-trained labor in Greenland have made it almost impossible to sell the small firms. One of the routes leading to the necessary changing of the guard may be increased cooperation among the individual owners of small firms along the coast. However this requires new thinking and flexibility on the part of the members of the Greenland Employers Association. Analysis And these were the very qualities the chairman of the association, director Erik Norskov of Qaqortoq, called for in his address to the delegates' meeting in Nuuk. Therefore the employers association has entered into a cooperative agreement with the home-rule-owned Greenland Base Company on an extensive industrial analysis that will chart all of Greenland's trade and industry. "The analysis is aimed at trying to create a clear picture of what the business sector really has at its disposal in the way of materiel, manpower, and economic resources in order to ensure Greenland firms the greatest possible participation when the very large construction projects that have been planned are realized in the years ahead," Norskov said. "The analysis will be a good tool for continued industrial development and therefore the Greenland Employers Association is disappointed that many firms are keeping their cards close to their chests. The analysis is trying to involve 450 firms in all branches, but at present only 120 firms have responded." At the meeting of delegates doubts were raised about the impartiality of the Greenland Base Company as a home-rule-owned enterprise when private firms lay all their cards on the table and talk about their innermost secrets. Norskov was not afraid to open up and talk about his firm's prospects and he urged the other members of the association to do the same. "If we are to participate in the big construction jobs, such as airplane runways on the coast, cooperation is an urgent necessity," he said. "Otherwise our members risk seeing the work go to outside consortia." Hands Off! "The economy is still weak in Greenland with record-high unemployment and declining exports," Norskov noted. Even so, restrained industrial policy optimism prevails in the employers association. The breakup of KNI [Greenland Trade Production, Transportation and Distribution] and the restructuring of the last of the old GTO [Greenland Technical Organization] organizations has made the economy clearer just as a market economic point of reference based on freer and more open competition has been created. "But we are still a long way from a totally free market economy," Norskov noted. "The political system still keeps the big state-owned firms under tight control. It is to a large extent the politicians who dominate company boards of directors and control the firms on the basis of political rather than sober business management considerations. This hampers a commercial firm that has to compete on the basis of efficiency and at the same time it hinders free and natural price formation, and in a number of situations the political influence can create competitive distortions. "Therefore the politicians should seriously consider following the market economy intentions all the way, withdrawing from direct firm management and leaving it to the professionals," said Erik Norskov, chairman of the Greenland Employers Association.
