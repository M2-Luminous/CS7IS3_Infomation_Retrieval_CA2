UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Kris Janowski said the convoy was due to leave Wednesday but that Serbs in Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters, said there were no officials there who could authorize the convoy. Janowski said the delay could be at least two or three days. The UNHCR has had repeated problems in Bosnia's 22-month-old in getting convoys into besieged zones. [sentence as received] Serb troops have intensified attacks on Maglaj over the past two weeks. The last convoy to Maglaj, where 16,000 people live, was in October, Janowski said. He has described conditions there as the worst in Bosnia. He said a report he received "a month ago said the people there look like skin and bones." In addition, a 12-truck Danish aid convoy remained blocked trying to get into Sarajevo. The convoy, which is stuck in Hadzici, 15 kilometres (nine miles) outside Sarajevo, was being blocked by Serb women demonstrating for their husbands to be released from a nearby Bosnian prison. The UNHCR moves from 20-30 land convoys a day in Bosnia and flies from 15-20 planes a day into Sarajevo airport. It feeds some three million people in central Bosnia. In addition, NATO planes carry out nightly air drops of food to areas like Maglaj where convoys are denied access.
