State Minister for Bougainville Michael Ogio says he denies suggestions by supporters in Sydney of Bougainville secessionists that security forces were undertaking a major military buildup in preparation to retake the Panguna copper mine. Mr. Ogio has described the claim as irrelevant, misleading, and totally out of context. He said he also denied claims by the Bougainville Freedom Movement that Australia-supplied Iroquois helicopters were being used as gunships. Mr. Ogio says the helicopters on Bougainville are being used for humanitarian purposes and the transportation of ground staff to inaccessible areas.
