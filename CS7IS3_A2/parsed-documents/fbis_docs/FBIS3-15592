Instead of Introduction The government formed by the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] has not yet worked a full year (the government program was approved by the Seimas [parliament] on 31 March 1993). Its activities could be most briefly characterized by the fact that the integral inflation rate has been 93 percent since the day the government began its work. Compared with former governments (the total sum of inflation rate over the three years exceeded 6,500 percent), this indicator implies the beginning of a stabilization of the economic crisis. If we also added the obvious facts that last year, the growth in pensions, social benefits, and salaries of employees at budget-financed offices exceeded the rate of inflation, that is, a real 12.7-percent increase in people's living standards occurred for the first time after the declaration of independence, the statements about stabilization, for which I am often criticized, would not be worth arguing. I understand those people, each separate person, with whom I meet in various regions, villages, and towns of Lithuania every week, that not all of them have felt a slight economic improvement. The condition of each community member does not depend on government policy alone. Their personal abilities are no less important. However, the government must see general tendencies and direct its policies along these lines. I have never refused to assist anyone, any countryman in trouble, certainly, within my possibilities. However, I cannot understand those who are violently attacking the formulation of stabilization -- is striving for stabilization useless for Lithuania? Can anyone offer something else instead? It is particularly difficult to understand those opponents who, being in the former legislature and government, ruined the country by ill-considered reform and failed to predict its effects. By the way, I suppose that radicalism is typical of the opponents also because the latter failed to understand the results. Having won the elections, the LDDP did not intend to "settle scores" with the former government. Last year, we limited ourselves to naming the "heroes and authors" of reform. However, their current desire to cast off historical responsibility for the nation, demagogy, and even the instigation of social conflicts force me to briefly return to the legacy we inherited. II. What Did the LDDP Government Inherit? A short reply would be the following: Enormous inflation, a budget deficit, great social problems, and state debts; as well as fake money, disrupted settlements among economic entities, an open gate to organized crime and corruption, and a demoralized Interior Ministry system. I will not expand on society's spiritual losses inflicted by the opposition policy of the former government. They cannot be measured in terms of percent. In the life of every family or individual this manifested itself not only as the shortage of heating or hot water, continuous price rises, the total devaluation of savings with trust in the promises of [former Prime Minister] G. Vagnorius, the chaos in agriculture, tenants' fear of being evicted from apartments, but also as false hopes and misleading illusions. The large credit of human trust in reform was wasted. I must speak about all this because the opposition cannot realize its true obligation and tries to blame the economic crisis on our government, at the same time ruining our attempts to stabilize the economic situation. Let us recall how during the elections people demanded punishment of the real destroyers of the economy. Certainly, if we launch the tradition of "squaring accounts" with former governments, we will never have concord or a natural change of power in Lithuania, as well as a normal state development. III. What Did We Manage To Accomplish In Less Than a Year? I think that the government will summarize the results of its activities and present them to the public after its full year in office. By doing this we, like the president, will establish a tradition of assessing the road covered and reporting back to the voters (we remember that this is what we lacked; this was also one of the key reasons for the collapse of the former policy). A constant self-critical assessment of one's policy alone can ensure progress and correct decisions. The LDDP government, like its former counterparts, has worked according to the program approved in the Seimas. Thus far, however, our government has been the first and the only one to prepare a plan of definite action for the implementation of the government program (it was approved at the government meeting on 30 June 1992 with the participation of chairmen from the Seimas committees). The government program would be left hanging in the air without such a plan, as was the case with former governments. As leader of the government, I maintain that the key goals of this plan have already been achieved, and part of the draft laws have already been submitted to the Seimas. We remember the successful introduction of the national currency, the essential breakthrough in liberalizing foreign trade, and the preparation of a national program for agriculture. I think that the draft law on land currently being debated in the Seimas should become another serious impulse for land reform, which has the most problems. The free ownership of land will not only make agriculture private but will also allow small farmers to cooperate and the successful ones to grow larger. In my opinion, we are often groundlessly criticized for the absence of concepts or plans. This is either poor information or a superficial attitude. Apart from the agricultural program, we have also drafted programs for the national systems of energy, transportation, and communications. Last week, the government approved the program of industrial restructuring, although this might have been slightly delayed. It is known, however, that our government did not take over any more serious achievements in this sphere from its predecessors. One could draw the conclusion that the government is aware of the perspective and knows what it wants, where it is going, and what the results of such activities can be. In short, the government has created a programmatic and conceptual basis for its activities in all industries and spheres of social life. The government has also submitted several draft laws on law enforcement to the Seimas. They should make our state management considerably more efficient and strengthen law and order, which are indispensable in any state's life. Since the very first days of our activities, we have focused on the execution of the budget. Having started the previous year with a 52-million litai [Lt] deficit, we finished it with a favorable balance of Lt65 million. This allowed the government to review (increase) wages and pensions nine times. The government assigned Lt343 million of budget revenues for this purpose, including Lt52 million for the indexation of inhabitants' savings, Lt96 million for self-governments, and so on. Certainly, it is necessary to upgrade the tax system, to impose more reasonable taxes on profitable businesses, and exact hidden taxes, which we partially managed to achieve last year (almost Lt100 million was exacted). It is very important that the Seimas adopted the 1994 budget at the end of the last year, that is, before the beginning of the fiscal year. This is also an indicator of a more stable functioning of the state and the economy. I would like to stress once again that the 1994 budget is much more socially oriented than all previous budgets since the declaration of independence. Both our social democrats and other opponents often claim incorrectly that the LDDP government allegedly does not pursue a social democratic policy. However, the larger part of the 1994 budget, that is, 59 percent have been earmarked for social security. This growth is particularly noticeable in such areas as, for example, science -- 208 percent, education -- 175 percent, health care -- 183 percent, and others. Thus, the facts are totally different -- the government policy is directed toward allaying the costs of reform for residents. This is being accomplished through monthly increases in social benefits and payments according to possibilities rather than through words or promises of a "bright" future. IV. "Debts," Investments, and Perspective There has been much talk about the "dimensions of the debt": Lithuania is head over heels in debt, its residents' "grandchildren will fail to repay these debts," and so on. What is the actual situation? Lithuania's average current debt is $160 per capita, $90 of which have already been used. The current government was forced to take out large loans for energy because it had inherited $86 million of debts and $25 million of fines for gas, to say nothing of the absence of any working capital in the energy system. I would like to stress as the same time that the pure hard currency reserve at the Lithuanian Bank has climbed by 2.8 times since March 1993 and is now $261 million, which is equivalent to the amount of utilized foreign credits. Thus, what debt are we talking about?! We must clearly understand that there cannot be any economic reform without investment and credit resources. It is only this that can help us achieve the vital breakthrough in the policy of economic restructuring. Incidentally, our agreements with the IMF were concluded for a period of 18 months. A program for another three years that is being drafted now projects five credit lines in restructuring different industries. These are agriculture, social programs, the restructuring of banks, and energy. It is evident that we must spend increasingly more credit reserves on expanding investments. This task has been put forward and its is being implemented in practice. In cooperation with various global financial organizations, we are preparing changes in the acquisition, utilization, and repayment of credits, and in the organization structure of accounts. This will allow a more rational utilization of credit resources. Moreover, the fact that an increasingly larger part of loans goes to investments through commercial banks is also very important. Large-scale credit resources and economic restructuring create more favorable conditions for promoting investments. Out of Lithuania's current 3,467 joint ventures, 768 work on foreign capital alone! The emergence of such ventures has become very dynamic recently. The total amount of investments in all joint ventures accounts for more than 85 percent. The current sum of investments is $200 million. As I have already mentioned, the system of acquiring and utilizing credits is being upgraded. A very important document, that will soon be submitted to the Seimas, is a new draft law on foreign investments. This law should be more efficient in promoting investments and introducing equal conditions for foreign and local investors. We have set up the Lithuanian Development Bank -- an important institution for receiving and promoting investments, and the Investment Agency. We hope that this year we will invest about $150-200 million or almost Lt600-800 million into the economy through various forms, state guarantees, the direct state debt, various commercial credits, and the joint effort of local investors. These investments and the general changes in the economic restructuring allow quite dynamic adjustments in the structure of exports and imports, although Russia remains our chief partner in purchasing resources. If we consider our exports to the West, however, in 1993 it accounted for almost 40 percent (against the meager 15 percent in 1991). It is extremely important that such economically powerful states as Germany, Belgium, and the Scandinavian countries become our principal partners. Certainly, these processes must be encouraged in every possible way, and this is what we are doing. V. Instead of Conclusion Certainly, it is impossible to study all aspects and problems of government's activities in one article. I expect to be able to do this later. The government, as well as I -- its prime minister and LDDP chairman, are concerned with the situation in culture, science, and education. We know that their condition is miserable, and we are holding numerous consultations and searching for resolutions. The management of the state is also a complicated problem. Unlike any other sphere, this one, probably, receives the largest amount of advice and recommendations -- from liberal and anarchist to stagnant conservative. I think that the time of the revolution is over, and our decisions must acquire a consistent evolutionary character. The officials' competence rather than number is important. In turn, the government must train its staff with the awareness of state interests and create relevant conditions for them. It is common knowledge that both before and after the elections, the LDDP spoke out for cooperation with all political forces. Thus far, we have failed to achieve this. All more influential parties, except a few personalities, refused to cooperate and are continuing the "policy of LDDP isolation" which, in my opinion, is fruitless and damaging to Lithuania. Meanwhile, Lithuania requires consolidation and political accord. The road to agreement or a consensus is not a one-sided effort. It requires overall tolerance, goodwill, and political wisdom. I believe that many oppositional parties understand today that the plans to isolate the LDDP have failed. Thus, let us look for agreement and common ground. The opposition should abandon the tone of ultimatums, actions which inspire conflicts, and demagogy in the first place. If we manage to rise above our party ambitions, Lithuania's political culture and democracy, that is, every individual, will gain from this.
