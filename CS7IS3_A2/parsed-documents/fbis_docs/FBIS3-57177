An official spokesman for the U.S. State Department has reportedly issued a statement making this appeal. Station commentator Vladimir Korolev writes on this: What on earth is this story about? The United States is insisting that the DPRK should dissolve the suspicion of its nuclear weapons development by allowing international inspections. Pyongyang and Washington have held talks on the nuclear issue. They reached a principled agreement [wonchikchok habui] on the nuclear issue through the two rounds of talks. Pyongyang is pointing out that the two military sites [kun taesang] of the DPRK cannot be included in the list of nuclear inspection targets. Western countries still entertain the suspicion that nuclear weapons are being developed in some nuclear sites of the DPRK. The United States is persistently saying that it will not continue talks with the DPRK unless international inspections of some nuclear sites are conducted. In the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, both sides' delegates should discuss improvement in relations between Washington and Pyongyang. The U.S. State Department spokesman has reportedly warned that UN sanctions against the DPRK may follow. A treaty on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was likely to be signed at every occasion, but the plan for it always went wrong. I think it is time to assume a more constructive [konsolchok] position in resolving the nuclear issue.
