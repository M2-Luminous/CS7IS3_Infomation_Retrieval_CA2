The rest would be swallowed by the servicing of debts -- the internal debt and the foreign ones. [Begin Pawlak recording] So if we want to compare budgets, then we could compare indices in the relative system within the proportions of the budget but also within the proportions of that part of the budget which is available for sharing out. And there is significantly less to be shared out than a year ago -- and practically the whole of the budget deficit at the moment goes on financing the internal debt. So if we look at it in this way, then the amounts for education and the health service are not so bad in comparison with last year. [end recording] The fact that on 1 January parishes took over only a part of the entire number of primary schools, means that the whole operation of schools being taken over by self-governments had been badly prepared by the previous government, said Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and the head of the Council of Ministers Office, Michal Strak. [Begin recording] [Pawlak] If one were to -- administratively -- bring about a situation in which the parishes were to take over the schools then probably today there would be not so much a row with the teachers as a row with the parishes -- which did not always have the possibility of financing these schools, especially in the case of smaller or weaker parishes. [Strak] May I just add one more comment regarding the pilot program: We decided that mayors would decide whether they were taking over schools or not. I have a set of figures here: There are 1,015 schools in the towns which were included in the pilot program, of which 580 have been taken over by the mayors. So this liberty in decisiontaking is successful -- for mayors and self-governments carried out investigations and consciously made up their minds. [end recording]
