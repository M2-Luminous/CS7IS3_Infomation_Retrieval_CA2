This happened on the basis of a carefully thought out and systematic course of action by the president of the Slovak Republic, who, by his address in the National Council of the Slovak Republic, initiated the process of destabilizing the Slovak political scene and a parliamentary crisis, whose outcome is the negation of the results of free and democratic elections. By this unprecedented action, which is without parallel in the history of European parliamentarianism, he exceeded the framework of his constitutional powers. As a result, the further development of our society is getting into the hands of political entities that did not vote for the Constitution and sovereignty and that were never favorably disposed toward the founding of an independent Slovak Republic. This development fills us with serious concern. We follow with the same concern the endeavor by the president of the Slovak Republic to call in question the will of citizens as expressed in their exercising the right of petition. While we acknowledge the undeniable contribution made by Michal Kovac, president of the Slovak Republic, to the founding of the Slovak Republic, we feel the moral obligation and justification, obtained by the law on the termination of the federation, to appeal to the president's conscience to consider whether his remaining in the post of president of the Slovak Republic is in conformity with the interests of the Slovak Republic.
