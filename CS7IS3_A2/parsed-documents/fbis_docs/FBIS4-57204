Last week the General Association of Farmers of Guatemala accused the guerrillas of making death threats against 213 farm owners and demanding a war tax in exchange for not destroying cattle ranches and coffee, banana, and sugar cane crops. The guerrillas issued a document in Mexico City arguing that in a country at war, these political-military operations are directed against the economic interests of one sector responsible for the continuation of the armed conflict. This measure only affects the properties and belongings of those farmers who refuse to pay the war tax and who have derived large profits from the sweat of a labor force resembling the colonial encomiendas, the URNG said. The URNG leadership warned that such operations will continue so long as the armed conflict continues and so long as it is not resolved by negotiations or political agreements between negotiating parties. Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez Morales made these comments to "Channel 7 News:" [Begin Enriquez recording] We are doing all we can to track down the individuals who are extorting money from farmers and those who favor [words indistinct] job opportunity in Guatemala. Guatemala's productive sector has been hit hard by the URNG. They are now demanding war taxes of up to 2 million quetzales. In general, they ask for 250,000, 150,000, or 100,000 quetzales in war taxes. Those who do not pay face the destruction of their farms. Workers from many farms -- we have confirmed this in areas we have patrolled -- [words indistinct] farmers are trying to collect money to pay and then disregard the workers. [Words indistinct] pay the extortion or that ill-named war tax and disregard their workers. I even spoke to producers in [words indistinct] and Escuintla. I asked if they wanted to form voluntary committees [words indistinct] I would do it. Why? Because the rebels are giving me a reason to do this, and the human rights agreement that was signed deals with this. [end recording]
