All major political forces in Ukraine, even Moscow-oriented ones, expressed their concern over Zhirinovskiy's victory. But this does not mean that no one in this country any longer looks to our Russian brethren. Probably both Kuchma and Grynyov are still counting on the Russian president, who was given enormous powers by the constitution which was approved on 12 December. It is even more probable, however, that Yeltsin will deliberately change his course in line with the results of the election: already, dissatisfaction with the Russia Choice presidential bloc has been heard from members of his inner circle. It is yet unclear how this change will affect the course toward the Interregional Reform Bloc set by the Kuchma-Grynyov duo, but it can be predicted with considerable certainty that the election in Russia took away Yeltsin's trump card: Russia's reformist image. The extreme right-wing forces in Ukraine, on the contrary, welcomed the news of Zhirinovskiy's victory. They projected the Liberal Democrats' victory onto the situation in Ukraine and decided that they would have a very good chance of winning the parliamentary election here. True, they do not take into account that in one-seat districts the Liberal Democrats did not win a large number of seats. This brings one to the conclusion that in Russia, it was not the Liberal Democrats but Zhirinovskiy's gift as a public speaker that won the day. In Ukraine, the extreme right has not yet produced demagogues of Zhirinovskiy's caliber. Moreover, the core part of Vladimir Volfovich's program, the Russian national idea, is accepted by an absolute majority of Russians, whereas the basic Ukrainian national idea--Ukraine for Ukrainians from the San to the Don--does not have a mass following here. Ukraine as a country will only gain from Zhirinovskiy's victory. Or, more precisely, it would win if it became more actively involved in Russia's domestic policy. First of all, Russia's autonomous entities are unhappy with both the new parliament, headed by Zhirinovskiy the unitarianist, and the new constitution, which lacks a clause on federalism. Their rights have been left up in the air, and it is easy to predict that the central government will try to curb them. It is doubtful that the republics will easily give back their powers to Moscow. On 12 December, three republics refused to take part in the election. The friction between regions and the center are growing, and Vladimir Volfovich could become bogged down in endless actions to restore order within Russia itself. Hard work in this field will force him to limit his demands for Ukrainian territory to oral statements. Second, despite Zhirinovskiy's victory, no one party won a majority in both chambers of parliament. A stable bloc of parties, which would have ensured a solid majority, would be very difficult to construct, given the ambitions of the Liberal Democrats' leader. A patchwork parliament would lose its way in squabbles and rivalries and would not be able to lead a well-functioning state. Lack of stable power in Russia would once again force it to spend more time on domestic troubles than on external expansion. Third, the artificial dependence on Russia of the Ukrainian economy (in energy, components, etc.) would have weakened regardless of the results of Russia's election. It had been known long before that since the start of the new year Russia would be selling us energy at world prices, so that it would make no difference for Ukraine where to buy it. And, the rise of prices for Russian output has already effectively made it more profitable to buy components from major foreign companies, where they are not much more expensive but of much better quality. This approach would only benefit Ukrainian producers who, in order to save a penny, are now willing to sacrifice the quality of output. Other arguments can be used to prove that there is nothing harmful for Ukraine in Zhirinovskiy's victory in the Russian election--if we have confidence in ourselves, of course. It now depends on ourselves what the victory of the Liberal Democrats will mean to us: victory or defeat.
