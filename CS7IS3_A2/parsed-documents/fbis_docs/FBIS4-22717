The failure of the decree to comply with Article 66 (Point 2) of the Federal Constitution, according to which a statute may only be approved by a legislative assembly, was grounds for taking this step. As is known, the oblast government tried to collect certain dividends. On 20 March a poll of the population on the draft statute was held. Although not legally binding, it made it possible for the government to enlist the support of residents of the oblast. A majority of the electorate--54 percent--approved the draft. How does this document square with the reform of local self-government? Our correspondent put that question to Anatoliy Sliva, chairman of a State Duma committee: "Thank God, the draft statute was not put up to a referendum, after all! In the greater scheme of things they do not have local self-government there at all. I believe that it is better to wait but to adopt such oblast laws as it actually needs. "The reform of local self-government should be implemented with regard to each city and inhabited locality. This is an all-Russian problem. First of all, reform of the budgetary system of the Russian Federation and a clear-cut separation of financial sources at all levels should be at issue. All cities should know ahead of time what funds they have at their disposal, and build their social policies around this. "Municipal property has yet to be generated. This problem has not yet been solved at this point. Ownership has not been codified by the relevant acts; property is being stolen. Privatization of municipal property frequently proceeds under programs confirmed in Moscow. This cannot be done. Programs should be regional or, better yet, local. "As far as the structures of local self-government go, the population is their object. However, the mechanism of local referendums has not been set in motion yet. We must definitely come to this. I think that the future statutes of cities should be ratified by the entire population after relevant preparation and discussion. "At present, the issue of a representative organ of local self-government is very acute. If there is no such organ, what discussion of local authorities can there be?! The number of deputies, representatives, or municipal counselors (call them what you please!) is not the point. That the population is tired and does not see a perspective is not the only reason for which the people do not turn out for elections at present. They do not believe that the representative organ will have a regular budget of its own."
