In his birthday speech to members of the Burmese opposition groups gathered at Manerplaw yesterday, General Saw Bo Mya reassured them the KNU will hold talks with the SLORC in accordance with the principles laid down by the Democratic Alliance of Burma [DAB]. Gen. Saw Bo Mya also stressed the need for continued unity in the opposition movement. Larry Jagan, in his report, noted the 12 students detained at Manerplaw were released in view of this desired unity. A report from the group leader of the All Burma Students' Democratic Front [ABSDF] and other sources claimed ABSDF leader Moe Thee Zun is now safe and secure. An opposition source at the Thai-Burma border noted the KNU released the 12 students detained on Sunday. The students also explained that the misunderstandings have now been cleared. According to yesterday's announcement of the National Council of the Union of Burma [NCUB], which includes the armed minority groups, students, and Dr. Sein Win's National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma [NCGUB] -- a Burmese opposition group, the students were not really detained but instead were holding talks with KNU leaders. An opposition source said the KNU is worried about students taking KNU-supplied arms out of KNU- controlled areas, which they agreed not to do from the very beginning. The NCUB announcement claimed no problems exists between the KNU and the student armed wing and other allied groups. An opposition source from the border explained the students are getting very worried about their position since all the opposition minority armed groups are holding peace talks with the SLORC military government. According to the source, Gen. Saw Bo Mya personally affirmed the students have nothing to worry about and that they are always welcome. Gen. Saw Bo Mya also guaranteed the safety of the students in KNU-controlled areas. There is no doubt differences in opinion existed between the students and the minority groups in connection with the cease-fire talks. At a meeting held in Manerplaw a few days ago, members of the NCUB emphatically stressed the need for unity in the entire opposition movement. At present, although some members still criticize and condemn the SLORC's peace talks with individual groups, they also want to prevent the disintegration of the opposition movement. All the member groups understand that if the opposition movement disintegrates, it will become favorable for the SLORC who desires to crush the opposition. The KNU leader, Gen. Saw Bo Mya, reiterated in his speech at his 66th birthday celebrations held at Manerplaw yesterday, that the KNU prefers all opposition groups to hold peace talks with SLORC together. Gen. Saw Bo Mya noted, although the KNU will hold peace talks, it will also discuss human rights issue, the freedom of all national races, and other political problems with the SLORC. He said the peace agreement reached separately with various minority groups does not guarantee a true peace in Burma. Next, Gen. Saw Bo Mya appealed to all other armed organizations to work for national reconciliation and urged them to participate in the roundtable peace negotiations with SLORC. A KNU spokesman said no date has yet been fixed for the first preliminary peace talks between the KNU and SLORC. Although the KNU leader has been insisting the peace talks be held in Bangkok, most observers expect the talks to be held in Yangon [Rangoon]. The Thai foreign minister, Prasong Sunsiri, said yesterday the Thai Government will consider accepting the peace talks proposal only when the SLORC government legally informs the Thai Government.
