Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference that it is "somewhat inadequate" to say Hata is responsible in overseeing the framework talks because three government ministries are in charge of three fields in the talks. But Hata will naturally fulfill his role as the foreign minister and deputy prime minister, Saito said. Saito said if subcabinet-level talks fail to reach accords by the time Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet on Friday, the Japanese negotiators may ask for Hata's judgment. But it is still unclear if Hata will directly take part in negotiations, he said. The U.S. Trade Representative's Office issued a statement Friday saying Hata is responsible for the bilateral negotiations and that Trade Representative Mickey Kantor will be in contact with Hata "on a daily basis" in the coming days. Japan and the United States remain at loggerheads over a U.S. demand that "objective criteria" be set to gauge foreign access to Japan's markets. The two sides will reopen subcabinet-level talks in Washington Monday in a last-ditch effort to wrap up the talks before Friday's summit in Washington. Tokyo and Washington are expected to draw up a progress report on the framework talks, initialed in July, in time for the summit.
