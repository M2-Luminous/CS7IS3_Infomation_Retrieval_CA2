The government, which has turned a deaf ear to all unpleasant comments, has not hidden its intention to continue to "reorganize" the Army which it suspects is "unfaithful" on several accounts. On 6 May at 1000, General Abdoulaye Coulibaly, former GATL commanding officer at the Abidjan Port-Bouet Air Base, handed over to Lieutenant Colonel Ettien Koffi, who was promoted to the rank of GATL commandant by President Henri Konan Bedie on 29 April. [passage omitted] "This promotion smells badly of tribalism," an officer who sought anonymity said. "Why didn't President Bedie chose Colonel Adama Dosso who, according to the hierarchy, is second to Gen. Coulibaly?" To substantiate his assertion, the officer gave the following explanation: "In case you do not know, in regard to hierarchy, after Gen. Coulibaly, there are Colonels Vassanoussi Bamba, Adama Dosso, Ettien Koya, and Leopold Guidi. Following them are Lieutenant Colonels Fofana Bourgoin and Boubacar Kouyate. All these officers come before Lt. Col. Ettien Koffi. It is not surprising for one to evoke tribalism when things are not done the right way. Frankly, although I agree that it was time for Gen. Coulibaly to leave after such a long time as GATL commandant -- although I think his dismissal was done in a gross manner -- I cannot accept the fact that the Army is being politicized with nominations that are not in line with military order and discipline. In my opinion, the Army should put itself above all political maneuvers for the security of the country." [passage omitted] These allegations are false, counterattacked "strategists" from the Presidential Palace who agreed to talk to us unofficially on the real reasons for the appointment by the head of state. They said, right after the appointment of the general, we were confronted with a regional problem that was threatening the security of the state. We absolutely agree with those who expressed their discontent, saying that Gen. Coulibaly is followed by Col. Vassanoussi Bamba and Col. Adama Dosso. However, what people pretend to ignore is that to giving the command of the GATL to one of these two would mean concentrating the command of two major units -- and we are talking about the Armed Forces here -- in the hands of two officers from the same region, namely Touba. Colonels Vassanoussi Bamba and Adama Dosso, like the commanding officer of the national Navy, are both from Touba. This fact could not be overlooked in a context such as ours." [passage omitted] All these real or supposed conflicts make the Armed Forces of Cote d'Ivoire a powder keg that could explode at any moment because of the deteriorating social structure. [Abidjan LA VOIE in French adds the following in its 9 June edition: "The news which was being kept secret has finally leaked out. Col. Faizan Bi Sehi has been dismissed from the command of the Paracommando Rapid Intervention Force. On reasons behind the dismissal, various versions have been advanced including a story on high interest loan repayments deducted at source from soldiers' pay by someone close to Col. Faizan Bi Sehi. In fact, this measure is nothing compared with rumors of forthcoming measures on the punitive transfer of officers, which are masterminded by the strategists and other advisors of President Bedie the self-proclaimed president of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.]
