The project has entailed a total investment of 20 billion yuan, has transformed 100 million mu of medium and low-yield fields, and has added 17.16 billion kg of grain over the past five years.... Nevertheless, many people do not have a good idea of what the project is, what goals it supposed to achieve, and how it is being carried out. Some confuse it with ordinary agricultural development, as we usually call it. For this reason, we called on Li Yanling, vice finance minister and director of the State Office for Comprehensive Agricultural Development. [RENMIN RIBAO] What is the distinction between "comprehensive development" of agriculture and ordinary development, as we usually call it? [Li Yanling] Comprehensive agricultural development is distinguished by its "comprehensiveness." Comprehensive agricultural development has a special meaning. It is a real engineering project with fixed sources of funds, clear principles of development, strict management methods, and special organizations for its organization. Its use of resources is comprehensive. It emphasizes the transformation of medium and low-yield fields while increasing the area of farmland at the same time. Its main contents are to increase production of grain, cotton, edible oils, meat, and sugar, and to carry out the comprehensive management and development of hills, water, level fields, afforestation, and road construction with high starting points and high standards. It carries out project management in development areas with reference to industrial management methods. The State Office for Comprehensive Agricultural Development coordinates planning, finance, and banking, as well as agriculture, forestry, and water works. It is specifically in charge of selecting and deciding on projects in various development areas and is in charge of project development, examination, and acceptance as well as the achievement of targets. Development funds are shared by the center, the local authorities, and the banks. The center's financial expenditures on this now comes to 2 billion yuan or so each year, while the province, prefecture, and county contribute one-third each and banks extend loans in keeping with the proportion of the center's financial appropriations. These funds, plus the deposits of vast numbers of peasants, form a huge development force. Over the past five years, we have invested a total of 20 billion yuan in various project areas and have obtained very obvious comprehensive efficiency. [RENMIN RIBAO] Such a large investment, with 20 billion yuan spent over five years on land development, is rare. Could you tell us what the main direction for development is? [Li] This large-scale, comprehensive agricultural development set up as a project by the state is an important measure by the state to increase agricultural investment and enhance the comprehensive productive capability of agriculture. Since the measure has integrated an appropriate scale of operation with the contract responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output, integrated the state's macroscopic regulation and control with the full utilization of incentives for peasants, and integrated an improvement of basic conditions for agricultural production with increasing peasants' incomes; this has produced remarkable achievements. Development areas have taken on a rural look where one can find tracts of fields, rows of trees, and networks of canals and roads are linked and bridges and dams are linked and matched. Conditions for production have improved, peasants' incomes have increased accordingly, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries are developing in an all-round way. Practice over the years shows that the investment direction is clear and the input-output ratio is very high, and that financially speaking, capital returns on comprehensive agricultural development are good as well. [RENMIN RIBAO] Where do you think the success of the "method of project management" adopted for comprehensive development lies as far as the procurement, use, and management of funds is concerned? [Li] Carrying out comprehensive agricultural development in line with project management is a World Bank-aided project carried out with reference to industrial management methods. It is also managed by employing these methods. The most distinctive characteristic of project management is that we invest funds right into these projects, rather than "scattering" them everywhere without a definite goal. With state investment taking the lead, all localities now have the incentive and can choose projects in their own areas according to the requirements of the projects. After deciding on these projects, and when the funds from the center arrive, they can attract the same amount of funds as supporting funds. Most of this portion of the funds is used to improve the conditions for agricultural production, while a small proportion is used to develop diverse economic sectors, thus stabilizing grain and cotton production and increasing incomes simultaneously. As for bank loans, a small proportion of them is used to improve production conditions and the main proportion is used to develop high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture and diverse economic sectors so as to ensure that peasants' incomes will increase after development. There is a regulatory mechanism which provides a very high incentive to all localities and ensures projects are done well. If your project proceeds well and is passed in keeping with requirements, then the center and the banks will continue to pump in funds. If it does not proceed well, then they will withdraw the funds. The better a project proceeds, the more funds will be pumped into it. These investments are directly made in the land of the localities and conform to local interests. The state has also achieved government control [zheng fu xing wei 2398 1650 5887 3634] over land development by means of macroscopic regulation and control. As for the use and management of funds, since development areas have various levels of responsibility systems or contractual restrictions for comprehensive agricultural development at all levels, the effective use of development funds is guaranteed. Zhejiang has done very well in the procurement of agricultural development funds. They have reached the financial ratio of 1.47:1, exceeding the ratio of 1:1 demanded by the center. In keeping with the principle that "whoever borrows the money repays it, whoever lends the money gets it back, and whoever profits assumes responsibility," repayment measures for the repayable funds are practical. Despite the fact that the amount of funds invested by the center is not very large at the present time, since 50 percent is used with compensation, it can form a revolving investment mechanism when this is retrieved. [RENMIN RIBAO] At present, some of the funds for comprehensive agricultural development must be repaid. Could you tell me what specific contents this has? [Li] This is also a question I wanted to talk about. In the course of establishing a socialist market economic structure, it is necessary to renew concepts, improve our understanding, and change the traditional idea that "the state finances while the peasants farm." The partially compensated use of the comprehensive agricultural development funds was confirmed right from the very beginning. The specific arrangements are: 50 percent of investment is made by the center in projects without compensation, while the other 50 percent must be repaid in due time. The funds retrieved can be reinvested for revolving investment purposes. The compensated use of agricultural development funds is a great reform in agricultural-support funds. On the one hand, it can enhance the sense of responsibility of the funds user and improve the efficiency of funds use. On the other hand, it is possible to gradually alleviate the long-standing shortage of agricultural funds through revolving use. [RENMIN RIBAO] In interviews, we mostly heard calls to initiate projects and ask for funds, and this shows the great appeal of comprehensive development to all localities. We would like you to talk about how the funds are invested in this area. [Li] Comprehensive development funds are divided into three parts, which I have mentioned previously. The main source of funds or the original main channel was agricultural development funds, which included proceeds taken out of budget regulating funds, farmland use tax, tax levied on special agricultural and forestry products, and others. Since the introduction of some reform measures, some of the original funds channels have disappeared and others channels have no funds coming in. Following the continuous development of comprehensive agricultural development, investment will surely be increased in the future. At present, the center directly makes provisions for these funds in its budget each year. Moreover, it is going to increase this year by year. The net land value-added tax portion of the property value-added tax recently levied by the state should be included in the investment plan for comprehensive agricultural development by all possible means. Moreover, the portion of tax levied excessively on special agricultural and forestry products in previous years should mostly be used for comprehensive agricultural development. Bank loans should be increased year by year on the present basis. The strategic consideration is that funds for comprehensive agricultural development should gradually tilt toward the central and western regions. On the whole, funds used for comprehensive agricultural development can only be increased, but not the other way round.
