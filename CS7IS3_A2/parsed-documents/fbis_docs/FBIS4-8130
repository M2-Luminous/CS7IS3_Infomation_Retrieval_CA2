It was addressed by most members of the "shadow cabinet," with Vladimir Meciar at the head. [passage omitted] Responding to the criticism of the so-called wild privatization in the last weeks and days of his government, Vladimir Meciar declared that, in this way, the government wanted to prevent the sellout of state property abroad and make it possible for the employees of the privatized companies to become their co-owners. [Former Minister of Culture] Dusan Slobodnik told the rally in this context that the fall of Meciar's government has been contributed to also by a certain sector of foreign capital, which supposedly needed a more pliant Slovak Government. The HZDS chairman spoke, furthermore, about various pressures to sell the Slovak gas industry. A certain Western financial group has supposedly offered our high-ranking officials a commission of 1.6 billion korunas for being helpful in this transaction. The HZDS Club of Deputies intends to disclose the details at a meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, where it also plans to expose other facts about the interest of some members of the present government in the privatization of specific companies, about attempts to restore Czechoslovakia, about the unlawful activities of the Presidential Office, and the like. The main speaker also criticized the provisional government's excessively accommodating attitude toward, in particular, the Czech Republic and Hungary, whereby it supposedly goes beyond the limits of Slovakia's state interests.
