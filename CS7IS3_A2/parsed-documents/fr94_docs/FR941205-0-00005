FR941205-0-00005 FR941205-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Immigration and Naturalization Service 8 CFR Parts 208, 236, 242, 274a, and 299 [INS No. 1651&hyph;93; AG Order No. 1937&hyph;94] RIN 1115&hyph;AD64 Rules and Procedures for Adjudication of Applications for Asylum or Withholding of Deportation and for Employment Authorization AGENCY: Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule streamlines the adjudication of asylum applications submitted to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Asylum officers who adjudicate the applications of persons who have no legal immigration status will no longer prepare detailed denials. Instead, in almost all cases, asylum officers will grant meritorious applications and refer applications that they do not grant to immigration judges, who will adjudicate the claims in either exclusion or deportation proceedings. The rule restricts employment authorization to applicants for asylum or withholding of deportation whose claims either have been granted or remain pending after more than 150 days, a period which would not run until the alien has filed a complete application and which would not include delays sought or caused by the applicant. This rule conforms existing regulations to the current practice of receiving applications for asylum and withholding of deportation at the four INS Service Centers. The rule also updates the regulations by removing references to the Asylum Policy and Review Unit. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective January 4, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Christine Davidson, Senior Policy Analyst, Asylum Division, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., ULLICO 3rd Floor, Washington, DC 20536, (202) 633&hyph;4389, or Gerald S. Hurwitz, Counsel to the Director, Executive Office for Immigration Review, 2400 Skyline Tower, 5107 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041, (703) 305&hyph;0470. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of Justice published a proposed rule on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14779) as part of a comprehensive initiative to streamline the process for adjudication of applications for asylum and withholding of deportation. Other aspects of this initiative have increased the government's ability to adjudicate such applications efficiently. The proposed rule was designed to streamline the asylum adjudications process by making several principal reforms. First, the role and functions of asylum officers would change to allow the officers to address a greater volume of applications and to concentrate their efforts on approving meritorious claims. Asylum officers would no longer deny applications from persons who are excludable or deportable, but instead would refer such cases directly to an immigration judge for adjudication. The original application also would be forwarded to the immigration judge to form part of the record of proceedings. Second, the proposed rule would have instituted a fee for filing asylum applications. Third, an asylum applicant would not be eligible to apply for employment authorization based on his or her asylum application until 150 days after the date on which the asylum application is filed. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) would strive to complete the adjudication of asylum applications, through the decision of an immigration judge, within this 150-day period. Persons granted asylum would become eligible immediately to apply for and receive employment authorization. Persons whose cases were not decided by an immigration judge within the 150-day period would be eligible to apply for employment authorization. The INS would have 30 days to adjudicate such applications. Persons denied asylum by an immigration judge either within the 150-day period or prior to the issuance of employment authorization by the INS would not be eligible to receive employment authorization. Beyond these principal reforms, the proposed rule would have: eliminated the requirement that asylum officers and immigration judges await the receipt of advisory opinions from the Department of State; curtailed the authority of asylum officers to grant or deny withholding of deportation under section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1253(h) (INA or Act); and specified that information provided in asylum applications could be used as a basis for an Order to Show Cause against the applicant under 8 CFR 242.1. The proposed rule also would have made several technical and conforming amendments. The Department of Justice received 345 comments in response to this proposed rule. Many were submitted as a result of consultations between various non-governmental organizations. The following sections summarize the comments, set forth the response of the Department of Justice, and explain the revisions adopted.
