FR940927-2-00104 FR940927-2-00072 Mr. John R. Jackson, represented by Mr. Hutchens as an expert witness, was retained by Mr. Hutchens to inspect the Ody-Costello vehicle. According to Mr. Jackson's report, a one-page letter, when he first inspected the Ody-Costello vehicle, the transmission was overfilled. In spite of this overfilled condition, when Mr. Jackson examined the underside of the vehicle and the area surrounding the transmission dipstick tube, he reported that there was no evidence that any oil had spilled or was spilling from the dipstick tube. With the transmission in the overfilled condition, the owner pulled the dipstick out, so that the opening of the dipstick tube was ``partially'' open. When the vehicle was brought to two sudden stops in this condition, transmission fluid reportedly spilled from the dipstick tube on both occasions and was ignited by the exhaust system. This test was repeated two more times, after the excess transmission fluid was removed (with the dipstick tube still partially open), with the same result. After the four previously described tests, a final test was conducted. According to Mr. Jackson's report, ``the dipstick was then properly installed and the test repeated.'' In the final test, there was no ignition, although Mr. Jackson did report that there were ``several spots of fluid along that path traveled by the decelerating vehicle. Mr. Jackson did not explain in his report, whether these spots could have come from residual oil that had possibly leaked during the four previous tests, when the dipstick tube was intentionally left partially open, nor did he indicate that the vehicle was inspected for the presence of any residual oil or that the area around and under the dipstick tube was cleaned after any of the previous tests. There was also no indication in the report that these spots were verified actually to be transmission fluid from Ms. Ody-Costello's vehicle. Ms. Ody-Costello also demonstrated the problem for Mr. David Horowitz, the host of a syndicated television show, that deals with consumer issues. During the test conducted for Mr. Horowitz, the transmission dipstick also was not seated into the transmission dipstick tube. This condition resulted in a partial opening of the dipstick tube, although this fact was not mentioned by Mr. Horowitz in his broadcast (Mr. Hutchens submitted a video tape of the segment of Mr. Horowitz's show dealing with the Ody-Costello vehicle). In an effort to better understand petitioner's allegations and particularly to verify Mr. Jackson's testing, ODI conducted an informal test program involving four 1993/1994 Mercury Cougar vehicles. All four vehicles were randomly selected from the inventory of two large metropolitan dealership. Two were new vehicles with less than 50 miles recorded on the odometer and two were used vehicles. The vehicles were first inspected both in the engine compartment and under the vehicle for any evidence of oil spillage from the transmission dipstick tube. None of the vehicles showed any signs of oil leakage or spillage and were clean and free from any oil residue in the area beneath and surrounding the transmission dipstick tube. All four vehicles were then driven for approximately 30 minutes to bring the transmission up to normal operating temperature. Each vehicle was then inspected and the transmission fluid levels checked according to the manufacturer's instructions from the vehicle owner's manual. The dipstick has a crosshatched area, not quite 3/4 inches long, near its lower extremity. The manufacturer recommends that the fluid level fall within this area when the transmission fluid is at operating temperature. The fluid level in all four vehicles fell within 1/8 inch of the uppermost limit of the crosshatched area of the dipstick. All were topped off as necessary to bring the fluid level to the top of the crosshatched area. It is also noted that there is a warning stamped into the dipstick immediately above the crosshatched area reading ``DON'T ADD.'' With the transmission dipsticks in place and seated into the dipstick tube according to the manufacturer's instructions, the uppermost area of the transmission dipstick tube, from 3 inches below the opening of the tube, was next loosely wrapped with paper toweling. This wrap extended above the top of the tube and around the handle portion of the dipstick above the cup containing the dipstick tube seal. The toweling was retained in position with masking tape.
