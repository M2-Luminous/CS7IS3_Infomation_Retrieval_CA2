G. Vishnevskiy, Yu. F. Vilesov, N. A. Groshenko, V. F. Lamekin, A. V. Yarygin; UDC 535.42;621.397] [Abstract]A description is given of a spatial-light modulator based on magneto-optical epitaxial films of iron-garnet with planar anisotropy. The impact which a dielectric mirror has on the intensity distribution in a spectral plane is also described. The dielectric mirror, which possesses polarization selecting properties, allows single pass magneto-optical diffraction to be achieved. 2 figures, 1 table and 10 references.
