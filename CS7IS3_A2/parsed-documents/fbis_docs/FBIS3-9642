Protection Force (UNPROFOR), which expires on March 31, grants only two of the numerous demands made by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman -- it renews UNPROFOR's mandate for an additional six months (instead of the one year recommended by Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali) and extends air support for UNPROFOR to include the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.). The first draft, a copy of which was submitted to TANJUG on Monday, retains the insistence on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the breakaway Yugoslav republics of Macedonia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina contained in Resolution 871 which renewed UNPROFOR's mandate six months ago, but leaves out the provision which calls for placing under Croatian authority the disputed 'pink zones' border areas between the R.S.K and Croatia. The draft also drops the original insistence on the integration of the U.N.-protected R.S.K. into Croatia, and instead calls for a generally acceptable negotiated solution. The R.S.K. has been proclaimed by the local Serbs in their ancestral lands within Croatia's communist-era arbitrary borders in response to Croatia's violent secession from the former federation and trampling on the local Serbs' rights. The territory was placed under U.N. protection in the spring of 1992 in order to end fighting between the Croatian Army and Krajina Serbs. The step has, however, failed to deter Croatia from launching four offensives against the R.S.K. since, in an effort to enforce its rule there. The draft also drops all reference to a demilitarisation of the U.N.-protected areas. Butrus-Ghali, reporting to the Security Council, pointed out difficulties inherent in such a demilitarisation, in view of Croatia's four offensives against the territory, and explained that UNPROFOR was unable to protect the Serb civilians. The draft resolution retains the controversial provision that a full normalisation of relations between the international community and the parties concerned would depend on their cooperation in the application of a peace plan and the relevant Security Council resolutions. This provision has been interpreted in various ways, with individual Security Council members insisting it means pegging the Krajina problem to sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro). The U.N. Security Council clamped sanctions on Yugoslavia in late May 1992 for the country's alleged aggression on neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, where in actual fact civil war has been raging for the past two years among the local Moslems, Serbs and Croats. The draft insists on a need for normalising communications and reopening the Adriatic oil pipeline, but makes no further reference to the Zagreb-Split railway or the reopening of the Zagreb-Belgrade highway, which is at present open only to U.N. troops. The first draft ignores Tudjman's demands for placing Udbina Airport and the Dzeletovci oilfield in eastern slavonija, R.S.K., under UNPROFOR control, for deploying foreign monitors along Croatia's 'internationally recognised' borders, and for posting international border guards along the R.S.K. borders. Although the haggling that follows is certain to be fierce before a final text is put to the vote on Thursday, it is already clear that Tudjman has been given far less than he had hoped for, at least in the first draw. The part of the resolution that relates to Bosnia-Herzegovina upholds the Bosnia peace process and the efforts to reopen Tuzla Airport for humanitarian needs. Bosnian Serbs have agreed to permit the reopening of the airport in that Moslem-held northeastern Bosnian town, on condition that Russian observers and Serb control be deployed there to safeguard against the Moslems using the airport as a conduit for arms and other military materiel. The latest draft endorses Butrus-Ghali's recent request for an additional 8,250 troops, monitors and civilian assistants to reinforce UNPROFOR, and instructs that the necessary funds should be mustered for the purpose.
