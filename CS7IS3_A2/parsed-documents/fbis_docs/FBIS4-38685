The committee's creation was agreed in Moscow on Thursday when the two nations' trade ministers signed a memorandum to that effect. Attending the meeting were Korean Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su and Russian Foreign Economic Relations Minister Oleg Davydov. Kim Chol-su is accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on his state visit to Russia. The ministers agreed to hold the committee's first meeting in Seoul this year to be headed by the two sides' assistant ministers. During the meeting, Russia promised to continue offering preferential tariffs for Korean goods that are half the most- favored-nation rate. In addition, Moscow said it will dispatch an evaluation team to Korea to designate six more safety-certifying agents for easier customs clearance of Korean goods bound to be shipped to Russia. They also agreed to set up a working-level committee to support construction of a Korea-Russia Trade Center at a site owned by Moscow University Campus. Minister Kim pointed out that there is still 755 million U.S. dollars receivable from Russia for Korean exports, saying this uncollected money resulted from a foreign currency freeze in December 1990 imposed by the former Soviet Union's External Economic Bank. With regard to Minister Kim's call for early settlement of Russia's outstanding receivables, Davydov proposed a meeting in Moscow to discuss terms of payment and creditor-confirmation procedures.
