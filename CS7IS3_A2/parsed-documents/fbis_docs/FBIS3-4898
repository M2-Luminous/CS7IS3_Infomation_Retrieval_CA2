Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told a National Assembly Committee that he would look into the matter, adding that the Ministry's director-general of the American Affairs Bureau was planning to call Hubbard, officials said. During a seminar held Feb. 25 at American University, Hubbard said South Korea and the United States differ on "how to respond on some regional and global issues." "And despite heartwarming success in establishing democracy and marked improvement on the human rights front--or perhaps because of them--the United States still wishes the Republic of Korea would repeal the National Security Law," Hubbard said. The remarks were deemed sensitive because Hubbard is the top U.S. representative at working-level talks with North Korea. Ministry officials were busy denying speculation that the remarks were somehow related to discussions between North Korea and the United States at their recent nuclear negotiations. The U.S. report on global human rights issued last Feb. 1 also cites South Korea's National Security Law, basically anti-communist in nature, for undermining personal freedoms. Ministry officials claim that the U.S. State Department must address the issue "off and on" to placate American human rights lobbyists, who reportedly receive "quite a few" petitions about the South Korean security law. "The matter has never been raised bilaterally by a diplomatic agency," one ranking official said.
