Russia, which is considered to be an ally and supporter of the Serbs, does not have a positive view on the recent NATO ultimatum and wanted this issue to be discussed by the Security Council. However, apparently the 30-minute telephone conversation between Clinton and Yeltsin has reduced the extent of the differences of opinion between the two sides on the West's decision and on the ultimatum. After the telephone conversation, Moscow stated that the United States and Russia have agreed on a division of tasks among the conflicting sides in Bosnia that will eventually help to overcome the Bosnian crisis. Before the Clinton-Yeltsin discussion, Russia's UN representative had called for an extraordinary Security Council session. However, after the telephone conversation, he rectified the objective behind such a session and stated that what Russia has in mind is the dispute over the disarmament of Sarajevo. The truth is that currently not only the Russian Government but the Russian opposition parties have adopted a negative stance on the ultimatum. Some political experts believe that even though Yeltsin's flexibility toward Clinton stems from his interest in Washington's support for Moscow, politically it will lead to the weakening of Yeltsin's position at home. Meanwhile, what Yeltsin attaches hopes to is what the rest of the world feels: the West's deceitful stance, which weakens the possibility of a NATO attack on the Serbs. The West's policy of double standards on international crises and differences in its acts and deeds on Bosnia have reached an intolerable point. In tandem with the West's warning to the Serbs and the setting of a deadline for the withdrawal of their heavy arms from around Sarajevo, the leader of the aggressive and criminal Serbs was able to gain UN agreement on forming an investigating commission to determine which side was responsible for the shocking massacre at Sarajevo market. The UN's agreement with this request is tantamount to the acquittal of the Serbs in this rare crime. Actually, the West has granted the Serbs a concession vis-a-vis the ultimatum against them. Meanwhile, with the mitigation of pressures on the Muslims with the evacuation of positions around Sarajevo, they have added military pressures on Muslims in other parts of Bosnia. For this reason, the Bosnian representative at the Geneva talks disagreed with efforts to separate the fate of the Bosnian capital from the fate of other regions and stated that he wants a comprehensive agreement on Bosnia. At a time when the European Community and its representatives in the Geneva talks, as well as the Croat and Serb sides, are seeking to dismember Bosnia, it is only the Bosnian Muslims who continue their jihad for preserving the integrity of the country.
