Levels of mutual suspicion are high, stray foreign policy pronouncements are magnified and the arena of diplomatic discourse appear to be shrinking. Missives from the White House and an apparent softness towards state sponsorship of terrorism by Pakistan make it difficult to take Washington's claim of being even-handed in South Asia at face value. There are other indications, although by no means definitive as yet, that the U.S. may be getting into a special relationship with Pakistan. It is not known what kind of sop was offered to Pakistan when the U.S persuaded it to withdraw the resolution on Kashmir in the UN General Assembly last year. If it was the withdrawal of the Pressler Amendment, as some observers believe, then clearly the U.S. has not been able to deliver. It remains to be seen where the US stands on Pakistan's resolution on Kashmir at the meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights at Geneva later this month. Pakistan seems adamant on moving the resolution to embarrass India. But it could be embarrassing for the U.S. also, if it were forced to abstain from voting on an issue apparently concerning human rights. If the U.S. persuades Pakistan to desist once again, then it will not be without Pakistan extracting a price. If, however, the U.S. votes with Pakistan, it can kiss goodbye to any hope of improving ties with India. For the time being, it appears that Indo-U.S. relations are being impelled by the momentum of daily reactions and counter-reactions to stray signals from Washington. While the Indian establishment seems to have been hijacked by media reaction, the Americans have become prisoners of their own verbiage on human rights. It is unrealistic to expect that a Democratic administration would give up its public stance on human rights in Kashmir especially when abuses continue to occur. But there are severe problems with the way this administration views Kashmir and its attempts at engaging India on human rights issues to the exclusion of other aspects of Indo-U.S. relations. For a start, arms of the U.S. foreign policy establishment are yet to understand the difference between annexation and accession when it comes to Kashmir, e.g. the U.S. Central Command Chief General Joseph P. Hoar's comments on how India "annexed" Kashmir in 1947. The Americans talk breathlessly about taking the, opinion of the "Kashmiri people" into account. But Pakistan has changed the demographic profile of the area occupied by it since 1947 to such an extent, that donkeys would decide about the future of horses if there were anything akin to a plebiscite. The U.S. also does not understand the consequences for the rest of India if Kashmir were to become independent. Given the existence of a large and scattered Muslim population, there could be a thousand Bosnias in India itself. Happenings in Europe and Central Asia should be warning enough against a blind faith in self-determination for nationalities. Kashmir and nuclear proliferation are no doubt important issues and must engage the attention of India. But day-to-day provocations have meant that the U.S. is either deliberately or by default letting Pakistan set the agenda for Indo-U.S. relations. On its part, lndia has also failed to project its foreign policy agenda in the U.S. beyond these issues. This either shows a lack of understanding of Washington or an inability to orchestrate its various arms. The U.S. foreign policy establishment is not a monolithic self-conscious entity. U.S. foreign policy is formed through a multiplicity of discourses. The range cannot be covered adequately by the blanket term "American point of view". The State Department, Commerce Department, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Pentagon, White House and Congress all have a say in foreign policy formulation. In addition, U.S. foreign policy is also influenced by powerful business lobbies, think-tanks and special interest groups including NGOs [Nongovernmental Organizations]. [passage ommitted] India is not very high in the priority list of the U.S. It hardly receives any aid and private investment is not coming to India out of charity. Nor is there any prospect of GIs landing in Kashmir at any future date. Indian diplomacy, inasmuch as there is a need to carry on an economic and political relationship, can attempt to work around the drum-beaters of Clinton's global agenda instead of hoping for a good chit from the U.S. like an eager schoolboy. *
