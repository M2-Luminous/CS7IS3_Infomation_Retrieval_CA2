They monitored movements of humanitarian cargoes, exchange of refugees and observance of human rights in that region in the framework of U.N. peace-keeping activities. "Such practice exists at all the U.N. missions in various countries when civil police work along with military observers," Aleksandra Zemskova, representative of the Interior Ministry personnel department, told journalists later in the day. Belgrade, Zagreb, Sarajevo and Tuzla are some of the places where Russian observers work. Their first group was dispatched to the Balkans in the spring of 1992. Russian Interior Ministry staff members have been regularly relieving one another since that time.
