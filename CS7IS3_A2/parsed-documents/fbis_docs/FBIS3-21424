"I am proud to be able to present to you the Czech Republic as a stable democratic State with a rapidly advancing market economy," Dr. Havel said at a banquet hosted in his honour, by his counterpart, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma. Among a variety of issues, Kashmir figured prominently during talks which the visiting dignitary held with the Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia. The first head of the Czech Republic to visit India, after Czechoslovakia was partitioned last year, Dr. Havel, during his six-day stay, will be conferred with the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development for 1993. Ideal solution for Kashmir issue: In the backdrop of India's refusal to the Pakistani bid for external intervention on Kashmir, Dr. Havel said it was "unnecessary for one side to internationalise the issue." Aware of what he described as a "complicated issue" (Czechoslovakia was a member of the UN Commission on India and Pakistan soon after its appointment), Dr. Havel said Kashmir's solution lay in a "peaceful bilateral dialogue." Citing a precedent which saw India and Pakistan signing an agreement, he advocated that an "ideal solution lay in a peaceful negotiation as was done before at Shimla." Hoping to see the Czech Republic supporting India's campaign to make the U.N. more representative, Mr. Bhatia discussed 'restructuring' the U.N. system with Dr. Havel. Expansion of the 15-nation Security Council is high on India's agenda. With Dr. Havel offering India better economic opportunities following market reforms by Prague, economic relations between the republics could well be on the upswing. Sharing Dr. Havel's optimism during talks this morning, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma hoped "the two countries will work together for mutual benefit in the fields of economic cooperation, commerce and trade." In the wake of this political nod, a meeting between industrialists with the Czech Minister of Finance, Mr. Ivan Kocarnic, yielded the possibility of India investing in the Czech republic in sectors including steel, heavy engineering, computer software, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, consumer goods, ceramics and textiles. Referring to the potential economic advantages, Mr. Kocarnic told Indian businessmen that nearly 60 per cent of the Czech industry was now in private hands. Apprising entrepreneurs that the former east bloc power house was not `Euro-centric', he said that nearly 60 per cent of exports to Western Europe finally ended in Asian markets. Before its partition, Czechoslovakia was also a supplier of key defence equipment for the Indian arsenal. Heavy vehicles and small arms were among a variety of equipment churned out by Czechoslovakian factories which ended up in Indian defence stores.
