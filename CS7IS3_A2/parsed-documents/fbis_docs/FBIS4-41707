A government commission headed by Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Mikhaylovich Shakhray is responsible for the distribution of the funds and the supervision of their use. During a news conference held as a part of his working visit to Magadan, he told of how this commission works: [Begin Shakhray recording] This is not a tourist trip -- this is the work of a government commission which has the powers to solve some of the problems on site. This is how the commission works: First, ministries represented by people empowered to make decisions -- usually by a deputy minister -- work here with the appropriate department of the administration. There are a lot of examples: For example, the MPS [Ministry of Railroads] in Krasnoyarsk Kray port solved several questions on the spot; several problems were directly solved in Surgut. This same applies to Magadan Oblast. This is not just an exchange of opinions and information; having discussed the volume of supply and financing, we are actually preparing a government document containing instructions on volumes, on what should shipped where, and how it should be done and implemented. In other words, this is not a familiarization tour and not a scientific and practical conference. Therefore, I hope -- no, I am certain -- that the situation will change after this visit, not in the least because we have squeezed out the first part of the financial aid of 55 billion rubles as part of the preparations for this visit. The head of the administration is now able to maneuver and make decisions which we are also discussing here. Therefore, this is practical work, and we will do everything to guarantee the minimum of functions necessary for the North to survive. This means Russia's wealth, and of course, people, specialists, and resources. But one should be honest and candid -- it has been mentioned that under the conditions of the budget financing for 1994, we will be forced to work under stressful conditions and will be able to provide only a minimum, or maybe even bordering on the minimum of what the North, in this case, Magadan Oblast, needs. I am referring to petroleum products, coal, and a supply of food reduced for the federal budget. [sentence as heard] Moreover, there are issues critical to the oblast which have to do with other kinds [of products]. We explored various ways of applying efforts. A new system of financing was employed this year -- instead of financial resources being scattered across many organizations, in the case of Magadan Oblast, practically all of it is deposited as a part of the budget in a special account available to the head of Magadan Oblast. His task is organizing the preagreement work, to check on suppliers and consumers and their transportation systems -- the selection is not very varied here -- so as to organize this work and to prevent the scattering of funds. We have allocated Magadan Oblast 50 billion rubles for this fund from the federal fund. It is a budget subsidy with an interest rate which is a little less than 70 percent of the interest rate charged by the central bank. So, in effect, these are preferential conditions for financing. We have allocated Magadan Oblast 50 billion rubles for this fund, and you can judge the demands for yourselves because according to the limited calculations of the oblast itself, it needs more than 300 billion rubles. This is the sum which, together with centralized credits amounting to about 35 billion rubles, would allow us to start work, and to start it by bringing cargoes in. We have decided on a protocol which would allow us to finance at least 70 percent of all the demand for cargoes brought in. When the icebreaker fleet starts working, or when Severo-Evenskiy Rayon, as a rayon of Magadan Oblast, closes completely during a time of limited incoming shipments, it will already be too late. Therefore, July is a key month, and in organizing the work itself, the Magadan Oblast Administration gives me hope that we will overcome this task through joint efforts. We must not turn the North into yet another source of Russian refugees -- not only from the South, as has been the case up until now, but from the North as well. However, you must understand that the people who remain in the North must be those who would be guaranteed work, and who would be able to live under conditions in which their children, family, and environment would be protected. Therefore, gold mining and other areas of development of Magadan Oblast... [pauses] we have examined the issue of the two hydroelectric power stations, and it is clear that there will be a redistribution of resources, that new work places will have to be looked for, and that there will be an exodus from Magadan Oblast. However, this exodus must be an organized and a planned one, and we have inspected the issue of the supply of containers, of compensation, and of the fulfillment of government edict No. 11-41 of last year on the payment of this compensation. I do not want these processes to become uncontrolled or unplanned, and it is desirable that even people leaving Magadan Oblast or moving from the northern part of the oblast to its south survive as the potential of the Far East and the Russian North.
