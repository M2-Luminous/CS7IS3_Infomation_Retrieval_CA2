Three electricity substations were set on fire, and according to Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission], sabotage cannot be ruled out. No one was injured in the explosion, and police will continue their investigations at daybreak. One of the fires was at Eskom's main substation and the assistance of nearby fire-stations was called in. Eskom officials are at the scene, and equipment has been ordered from Bloemfontein to restore the power supply. The police have cordoned off the area. Local telephone exchanges have also been damaged, and power is not expected to be restored to Schweizer-Reneke until tomorrow afternoon.
