After hearing Changtu County's report on spring sowing and economic work, he said that intensifying agriculture, being the foundation for maintaining economic development and social stability, must not be ignored in every minute. As a large agricultural county, Changtu should always put grain production in the primary position. Only when grain production is well developed will forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupation, and fishery be developed. To ensure an increase in grain production, we should mainly maintain grain sowing areas, increase per unit area yield, and achieve scientific farming. [passage omitted] After talking about the facts that Changtu is a large agricultural county but a small industrial county and that some county-run industrial enterprises in the county are confronted with difficulties, Gu Jinchi said: At the time of persistently taking agriculture as the foundation, we must exert great efforts to grasp industrial production and strive to enliven state-owned enterprises. First, we should enable enterprise leaders, staff members, and workers as well as responsible departments to realistically strengthen the idea of markets. This is a decisive factor for enterprises' development. It is necessary to achieve the readjustment of the product mix and the industrial structure according to market demands. Second, we should have the idea of high efficiency. To develop industries, we must stress efficiency. Each and every enterprise should have profit and tax targets, strive to reduce production costs and consumption, and try every possible means to increase the tax rate levels. Third, we should select good cadres, select the persons with managerial ability to run enterprises, link responsibility with right and power, and have outstanding skilled persons show their abilities and talents. [passage omitted] Fourth, we should mobilize office cadres to go deep to the grass roots, organize several inspection groups to help enterprises solve their practical problems, attend to weak links, and consolidate enterprises. Gu Jinchi said: We should persist in the principle of taking a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough in developing both agriculture and industry. It is necessary to achieve both spiritual civilization and party building, particularly the construction of leading bodies and leading organs. The leading cadres at various levels and the personnel of the leading organs should strictly be self-disciplined and do their work in a cautious and conscientious manner. After hearing the situation that the Changtu County grain bureau simplifies the administrative structure, Gu Jinchi said: This bureau has provided the organs across the province with experiences in simplifying the administrative structure. At present, some persons of some organs are busy day and night, some drift along aimlessly, and some act as commentators and indulge themselves in grumbling. Some units originally have to serve the consumers. By changing this kind of service into privilege, they always apportion expenses from those who ask them to handle affairs. All this is related to overstaffed organizations and bureaucracy. So, the administrative structure should resolutely be simplified even if there are great difficulties. The organs at various levels should maintain administrative honesty and high efficiency, deal with concrete work, and better serve the people. Tang Tiehan, secretary of the Tieling city party committee; and Li Shiwen, mayor of the city, accompanied Gu Jinchi to call on the family members of Bo Renshi, a model town and township cadre and late secretary of the party committee of Baoli Town of Changtu County.
