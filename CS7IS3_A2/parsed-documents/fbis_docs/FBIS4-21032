A report by the Centre for Health Economics at York University suggests that the cost-effectiveness of drug enforcement has been deteriorating since 1985. It argues there is a lack of accountability among enforcement agencies. In their study, Trends on the Cost Effectiveness of Enforcement Activity, Professor Alan Maynard and research fellow Matthew Sutton say the annual publication of the amount of illicit drugs seized by Customs and police is traditionally accompanied by concern pressed about the growing problem. The authors argue there is no basis for claims that drug traffickers are being successfully tackled. Customs and Excise have traditionally suggested that they seize roughly 10 per cent of all drugs imported and possibly as much as 20 per cent. The survey disagrees: "Based on annual figures, Customs rarely achieved the 10 per cent rate." In 1987 and 1988, the study suggests that a more accurate figure would be 4 per cent. The estimates are possible for heroin because there are Home Office figures on heroin use but not for other drugs. The budget of approximately £335 million in the last financial year is divided equally between police and Customs. The level of spending increased by 74 per cent for the police and 38 per cent for Customs over the period 1979-89 but, says the study, were not matched by equivalent increases in impact on the heroin market. The study adds: "The light grip which the police had on the domestic heroin market declined after 1985." The authors suggest that there is an overall picture of decreasing cost-effectiveness. "The lack of accountability for the significant increases in public funding enjoyed by drug enforcement agencies during the 1980s is surprising, particularly in a period when the dominant political rhetoric emphasised `value for money.'"
