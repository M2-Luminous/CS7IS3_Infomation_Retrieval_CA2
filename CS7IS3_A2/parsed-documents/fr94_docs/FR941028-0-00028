FR941028-0-00028 FR941028-0-00009 Paragraph (a) of §773.22 imposes a duty upon a regulatory authority to review the information provided in the permit application, pursuant to 30 CFR 778.13(c) and 778.13(d), to determine whether the information provided, including the identification of the operator and all owners and controllers of the operator, is complete and accurate. In making such determination, the regulatory authority is required to compare information provided in the application with information contained in manual and automated data sources. Manual sources for review include the regulatory authority's own enforcement and inspection records and State corporation commission or tax records, to the extent they contain information concerning ownership or control links. Automated data sources include the regulatory authority's own computer systems, if any, and the AVS. Paragraph (b) of §773.22 provides that, if it appears from information provided in the application pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of §778.13 that none of the persons identified in the application has had any previous mining experience, the regulatory authority has to inquire of the applicant and investigate whether anyone other than those persons identified in the application will own or control the mining operation as either an operator or as another type of owner or controller. Paragraph (c) of §773.22 provides that if, after conducting the information review described above, the regulatory authority identifies any potential omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency in the ownership or control information provided in the application, it must contact the applicant prior to making a final determination with respect to the application. The applicant is then required to resolve the potential omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency through submission of an amendment to the application or a satisfactory explanation which includes credible information sufficient to demonstrate that no actual omission, inaccuracy, or inconsistency exists. The regulation also contains a reference to required action by the regulatory authority in accordance with §843.23, sanctions for knowing omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control and violation information, or the State program equivalent, where appropriate. As will be described more fully below, OSM is deferring action at this time with respect to proposed §843.23. Such proposed section will be considered as part of a subsequent rulemaking. OSM has, however, retained the reference to proposed §843.23 in final §773.22 in the event that proposed §843.23 is ultimately adopted. Nevertheless, OSM has made no decision with respect to the adoption of proposed §843.23 and the retention of such reference does not mean that OSM will ultimately adopt proposed §843.23 as a final rule. Paragraph (d) of §773.22 requires that, upon completion of the information review mandated by §773.22, the regulatory authority promptly enter into or update all ownership or control information on AVS. Section 773.23 is a new section which delineates the regulatory authority's review obligations with respect to a permit application after the regulatory authority has completed the process of verifying ownership or control application information as described in proposed §773.22. Paragraph (a) of §773.23 requires the regulatory authority to review all reasonably available information concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant to determine whether the application can be approved under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b). With respect to ownership or control links involving the applicant, such information includes all information obtained under proposed §773.22 and 30 CFR 778.13. With respect to violation notices, such information includes all information obtained under §778.14, information obtained from OSM, including information shown in the AVS, and information obtained from the regulatory authority's own records concerning violation notices. In substance, the regulation assures that the regulatory authority considers complete ownership, control, and violation information in making the decision required by 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) with respect to a permit application.
