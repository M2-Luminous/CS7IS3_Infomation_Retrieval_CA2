These criminal actions fit within the framework of the campaign woven by Jonas Savimbi's organizations to undermine peace efforts made by the Angolan Government and the international community in Lusaka. Accordingly, UNITA seeks to protract the suffering of the Angolan people unnecessarily, and to worsen the tragic situation faced by the residents of Bie Province, who are once again deprived of international humanitarian assistance. It is significant to note that whenever alleged progress is reported at the peace talks, UNITA invents (?attempts), reports military offensives that have not taken place, and, as is the case now, resorts to the force of arms to gain new positions on the battle front. The Government of the Republic of Angola urges all the Angolan people to be vigilant against UNITA's maneuvers, and expects the international community, particularly the United Nations to keep up their diplomatic pressure, including sanctions against that organization to make it desist of its warmongering stance, and to make it to negotiate a just and lasting peace within the spirit of national reconciliation. The military adventure that has been undertaken will have no effect at the negotiating table. The Angolan Government will not give in to absurd demands that UNITA might make in contravention of the constitutional and democratic order that has been established in the country since the September 1992 elections. The Government of the Republic of Angola remains committed to gaining peace through negotiations, and to searching for ways to resume humanitarian assistance to Cuito. Yet, it cannot remain indifferent to yet another offensive or else it would put at stake the survival of the affected residents and the protection of state institutions.
