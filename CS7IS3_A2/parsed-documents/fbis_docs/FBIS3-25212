Contacts with Somali delegations are already under way in an effort to secure the release of the two hostages, and Mario Scialoia, the Italian ambassador in Mogadishu, has taken steps to solve the problem. Meanwhile, in a meeting with Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Carmelo Azzara, interim Somali President Ali Mahdi has asked for the Italian contingent to remain in Somalia, or at the very least for it to be "the last to leave the country."
