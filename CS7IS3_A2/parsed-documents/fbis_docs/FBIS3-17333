Let us defend it from desecration and disparagement, from crime, greed, and the excessive license of groupings and individuals who are demeaning our sacred Don land," states an appeal from the "Cossack team" of city Duma deputies to the inhabitants of the city of Novocherkassk. The appeal stresses that, with the connivance of the city leadership and administrative organs, mass registration of foreign citizens is underway, land, industrial and other premises, and real estate are being bought up, and "leaders of the `black' economy, traders, and criminals are infiltrating the area and settling permanently." The group of Cossack candidate deputies, considering the residence of foreign citizens on oblast and city territory to be illegal, is calling for their expulsion.
