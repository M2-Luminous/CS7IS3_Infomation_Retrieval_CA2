Cochairman Istvan Csurka summarized the program by saying: The MIEP is a resolute force.... The deputies accepted the party's election program, according to which the corporate tax would be reduced and, at the same time, the tax authorities would be given powers of investigation, and a secret police of economic crimes would be set up. In place of the discredited enemy image, they plan to set up a rank order of risks regarding our neighboring countries. "We have to see that, according to the plans, the suit of power [as published] is to be put on the alliance between the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. However, to make this suit look good, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], that has by now collapsed, would also get a duffle coat and the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ] would get a jacket!" [sentence as published] This is how Istvan Csurka summed up the future of Hungarian domestic politics in his speech setting the program. According to him, the real change of the regime has to be started, therefore, the power must not be left in the hands of those who have, up to now, been the rulers. This change of the regime would only actually affect 5,000 to 6,000 subordinates, and the army of 50,000 to 60,000 servants lined up behind them would immediately adjust to the new situation. Through this, those people who are ready to sell out Hungary without any principles at any minute would be removed from power straight away. Csurka did not leave any doubt in his audience as to the fact that the MIEP wishes to totally upset the current "pseudo-order" because the time for "real order" has come. The simple thesis that everything is based on lies in Hungary is the basis for this grand development of society. For this reason, the party declared fundamental changes in the order established by the [former Prime Minister] Antall era, and this might even mean that they will again start to fight against communism. "What else could be meant by the apportioning in the left wing but the fact that they share out the fat jobs and the well- functioning economic areas between themselves. However, in the past four years, they have been doing the same, namely they have been distributing the areas that make them rich," Csurka said, and he set the direction of the MIEP's program as follows: "We want to break with the state administration of [former Finance Ministers] Lajos Faluvegi, Laszlo Bekesi, and [Finance Minister] Ivan Szabo, and with the foreign policies of [former Foreign Ministers] Frigyes Puja, Gyula Horn, and [Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky, which destroy the nation. We are different from the other Hungarian political parties in the sense that, in addition to criticizing the disorders of domestic conditions, we actually do something against them. Therefore, our election program helps us to get into power, and the power is only a means for us to help implement our program that will improve the situation of the Hungarians! We can confidently say that we are the resolute force that will implement the real change of the regime." Csurka said the following in conclusion: I have to end my speech with the slogan of officers of the so- often cursed [former governor] Horthy 's army: Ladies and Gentlemen, victory or Siberia! The first contribution was made by Lajos Posze, the sacked chairman and director general of the Szerencsejatek Rt. [gambling enterprise], and he suggested, among other things, that the state should take gambling under its own authority for at least five years, because it is an untenable situation that 50 to 70 billion forints a year go into the pockets of the mafia people operating one-armed bandits while, lately, families have been brutally murdered for the income from gambling machines. According to Co- Chairman Lajos Horvath, quite a few of the high-ranking military leaders still continue to lead a double life. He summed up the future of Hungary's foreign policy as follows: We have been here for a thousand years and we want to stay for at least another thousand years. Therefore, it is an unnecessary and irreparable decision to sacrifice the Hungarian minorities for a hoped-for European Community membership. Foreign Minister Jeszenszky is still working against the Hungarians living beyond our border who are desperately seeking autonomy! Horvath said that we must be clear about the current geopolitical situation, therefore, in place of the outdated and discredited enemy image, he suggested that responsible Hungarian politicians grade Hungary's neighbors according to risk. Finally, let us read a section from the MIEP's election program. "The chaos of the Antall era, with its quagmire and pact, appears to prove that it is impossible to create order because the group of leaders from the past period are stronger and will prevent this. Thank God, this is not true, either! "This will was lacking in the Antall leadership. "If the democratically elected political power has the will to create order then, with the support of the majority of people, the foundations of an order based on justice can be established in a short period of time. "Where should this be started? "People coming from the soft or hard one-party system dictatorships are weak and vulnerable, and only have the strength to empower someone through secret voting, in the privacy of the voting booths, to represent their interests, but have no time themselves to create the institutions, organizations, and constitutions of their just order. "Therefore, the democratically elected new power and new government will have to create a new state whose primary goal is to put the disadvantaged strata of the Kadar-Aczel [former party chief and cultural minister] period into a good position, and to solidly represent their interests, at the cost, if necessary, of squeezing out the favored people of the former period. In the Antall period, exactly the opposite happened. Therefore, our program essentially contains the methods of implementing these tasks. "This is why the nation-building state is the focus of our ideas."
