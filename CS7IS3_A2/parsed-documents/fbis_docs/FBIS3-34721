This capability has been earned at great technical economic and political cost. As time passes, Pakistan will be subjected to even stronger pressures to compromise on the nuclear issue and roll back or even abandon its nuclear programme. National interest demands that we retain our nuclear option as long as India does as it may take India a considerable time before it agrees to subscribe to the Non- Proliferation Regime for Sough Asia as has been proposed by Pakistan. During this period Pakistan has to maintain its nuclear capability. The question is now can we sustain our nuclear option. Realistically speaking, pressures on Pakistan will mount and not decrease with time. The US commitment to non-proliferation is toughening and not receding. World public opinion is turning against nuclear weapons even in the hands of nuclear powers and certainly more and more against the so-called near-nuclear weapons states such as India, Pakistan and Israel. There is hardly any difference of views among the nuclear-haves that further proliferation has to be contained. So we will have very few or no allies to back us up. We may even be on our own. The assumption that once a country acquires nuclear capability it cannot be eroded or taken away is rather naive and an illusion. While it takes considerable technical skill and political determination to achieve this, in the first place it needs even greater effort to retain it later on. France was a nuclear rebel until the 1980s but the changed international situation and pressures from its partners in Europe and across the Atlantic compelled it to conform to the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] South Africa was able to build a small nuclear arsenal by defying international embargoes over a long time, but found it politically impossible to hold on to it and had to surrender 8 or 10 nuclear bombs it had built. Ukraine, with its 1,600 nuclear warheads, ranks as the third nuclear power in the world and has sophisticated long-range missiles to deliver them to any part of the world. Yet it cannot even service this arsenal. Its economic and security compulsions have forced it to give up this formidable capability. Even the UK finds it harder and harder to hold on to its modest stockpile of nuclear weapons in spite of its imperial longings. It appears that its is relatively less difficult to climb the nuclear ladder but much harder to hang on after getting there. We should not underestimate the challenges we will face in sustaining our nuclear option and must prepare ourselves to do all that it takes to keep it. While it will become increasingly hard for us to retain our nuclear option it is relatively easy to lose it. The quickest way to do this would be to increase our nuclear rhetoric to win greater public applause at home. This nuclear jingoism which our politicians and technologists have engaged in to win cheap popularity has been extremely costly to the nation. It has sent completely wrong signals abroad and played into the hands of our opponents. It also provides a ready excuse to India to continue with its massive nuclear programme. It is, therefore very important that both the government and the opposition and all responsible leaders of various parties exercise restraint when talking about the nuclear issue. This is needed particularly at a time when the US Congress has started debating a revision of the Foreign Assistance Act which could hopefully dilute the Pressler Amendment and provide an opening for the US President to resume US Pakistan cooperation in the economic and defence fields. Even if the Pressler Amendment is somehow miraculously withdrawn or circumvented it will only be a temporary relief. The nuclear issue between the US and Pakistan will not be resolved as the US will continue to pursue its objectives through other means. India will persist in strengthening its nuclear muscle and reach posing a growing threat to our securing. The stakes will get higher and higher. The strategy we should develop must be one which enables us to keep the nuclear option open for a long time. This means we should take immediate steps to reduce our vulnerability to outside pressures and build up the strength and stamina to resist coercion. Politically we need a renewed commitment to our nuclear programme and to maintain the nuclear consensus. The Government and Opposition have to speak with one voice so that there is no rollback and no unilateral compromise. This demands a measure of political maturity on all sides. We have to take the nuclear issue out of the political areas so that it is above petty politics. Economically, Pakistan is extremely vulnerable. Our dependence on foreign economic and financial aid has to be reduced. We have to put our economic house in order. This requires making tough and unpopular economic decisions which is not an easy matter for any political government. But we can not expect the aid donors to underpin our economy so that we enjoy the luxury of wasting funds at home and continue to postpone economic reforms. Without a strong economy no country can ever maintain a nuclear option. In the defence field, we are highly dependent on foreign military supplies equipment and hardware. India meets 80 per cent of its defence needs through indigenous production while we are critically dependent on imports. We have to build our own defence industry. It will require a bold new approach to mobilise our internal technical and human resources, involve the private enterprise and establish the essential infrastructure for our defence industry which we have neglected so far.
