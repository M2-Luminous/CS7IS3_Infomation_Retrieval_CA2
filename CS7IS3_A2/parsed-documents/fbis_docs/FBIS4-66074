It might just lead to downright anxiety of the government. A forecast is hardly possible three weeks before voting day," Professor Fritz Karmasin, who is regarded as a serious opinion researcher, says in summarizing the views of the nation based on a representative poll carried out on a particularly large scale (2,000 personal interviews). At first glance, however, the race seems to be clearly decided. In informal interviews in the middle of May, 50 percent of all interviewed Austrians voted "for Europe" and were fully convinced they would vote "yes." In the latest -- representative -- Gallup poll, only 38 percent say "no." At present, only 13 percent of Austrians say officially that they do not yet know how they will vote. In an additional wave of interviews, however, Gallup analyzed in detail the certainty of Austrians about the vote. And what do you know? Suddenly, only 57 percent of Austrians have firmly decided on how they will vote on 12 June. Literally to the very last minute, the decision of 41 percent is open -- which is indicated in plain language: -- At present, only 32 percent of the total population will "certainly" vote yes. -- They are facing 25 percent who are firmly determined to say no. -- Between them, the government and the opposition have to struggle for 41 percent who are more or less undecided (plus 2 percent of the people who refused to give an answer). In absolute figures: 2.3 million of 5.6 million people entitled to vote still have to be convinced. Particularly noteworthy is that almost two-thirds of the undecided -- 27 percent of the total population --want to decide "on the vote at the last moment." [passage omitted]
