The reasons we believe Mr. Ion Iliescu should be suspended from office are as follows: De facto: During a recent visit to the town of Satu Mare, President Ion Iliescu made public statements concerning the issue of nationalized dwellings. President Ion Iliescu asserted that, through the court rulings that admitted the claims of the people whose dwellings had been nationalized -- to the effect that their properties have been restored and the tenants have been evacuated -- "justice has outlawed itself." President Ion Iliescu displayed revolt against the rapidity with which certain courts ruled in favor of the owners in such litigations, adding that the courts should wait until the new bill [on the legal status of nationalized dwellings] is passed by Parliament and promulgated. At the same time, President Ion Iliescu also asserted that such court rulings should not be carried out. De jure: The statements made by President Ion Iliescu are extremely grave because they flagrantly violate several stipulations of the Constitution and a number of laws that ensure the proper functioning of the law-governed state. These stipulations are the following: 1. Article 41 and 42 of Romania's Constitution refers to the right to private property and the right to inherit such property. 2. Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees free access to justice. 3. Article 16, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution, cumulated with Article 21, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution, stipulates that no law may obstruct the right to address justice, in which case President Ion Iliescu situated himself above the law. 4. Article 3 of the Civil Code, which terms as culpable all judges who deny restoring justice by refusing to administer justice, claiming that the law does not stipulate anything, or it is blurred, or insufficient. 5. Article 123, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution and Article 3 of Law No. 92/1992 on the Organization of Justice Courts stipulates that judges are independent and are to submit solely to law. 6. Article 127, Paragraph 1 of the Penal Code, which punishes the infraction of not submitting to justice court rulings, with the application of Article 25 of the Penal Code, which defines the way in which instigators participate, and Article 27 of the Penal Code, which stipulates that instigators are to be punished according to the law to the extent of real culprits. The significance of the president's deeds: 1. Article 95, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution stipulates that the Romanian president may be ordered solely if his deeds are of a grave nature. The public statements made by President Ion Iliescu are of such a nature, as we will prove further. By his statements, President Ion Iliescu: 1. Disregarded two fundamental rights stipulated and guaranteed by the Constitution: The right to private property (Article 41) and the right to inherit such property (Article 42), as well as regulations of the Civil Code stipulating the methods in which those rights can be exerted. 2. Disregarded the citizens' right to free access to justice, as stipulated in Article 21 of the Constitution. 3. By asserting that justice has outlawed itself, he situated himself above the law, which is prohibited by Article 16, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution. 4. By making the aforementioned assertion, he impeded upon the independence of the judges, which is guaranteed by Article 123, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution and by Article 3 of Law No. 92/1992 on the Organization of the Justice Courts, despite the fact that Article 3 of the Civil Code terms as culpable all judges who deny restoring justice by refusing to administer justice in the cases assigned to them, claiming that the law does not stipulate anything, or it is blurred, or insufficient. The aforementioned assertions of President Ion Iliescu are able to negatively influence the proper functioning of courts and they are an attempt to intimidate and influence the judges. 5. By asserting that such court rulings should not be carried out, President Ion Iliescu called for the court rulings to be disregarded, which is an infraction according to Article 25 cumulated with Article 271 of the Penal Code, in which case Article 27 of the Penal Code is to be applied. 6. President Ion Iliescu's assertions are of an extreme concern because they contradict fundamental constitutional values, as well as the essential attributions of one of the three principal state authorities. Such assertions made by the head of the state endanger the proper functioning of the law-governed state and they represent a dictatorial act and an attempt upon the independence of the judges. Thus, President Ion Iliescu has also violated Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution, which stipulates that Romania is a law-governed, democratic, and social state, in which the rights and liberties of the citizens are supreme values, which are guaranteed. Therefore the continuation of the office of President Ion Iliescu represents a grave danger for the strengthening of the law-governed state and for Romania's democratic evolution.
