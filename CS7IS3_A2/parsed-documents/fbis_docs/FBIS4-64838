After Rome, he made a stopover in Paris and then Bonn. He will be in Brussels today. This shows the importance of this visit which is aimed at preparing for the G-7 summit due to be held in Naples 8-10 July. Mr. Hata wants to defend Tokyo's diplomatic position in discussing the trade disputes which Japan has with the European Union [EU] and the United States. In Paris, he had lunch on Wednesday [4 May] with President Mitterrand and he had talks with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. He also met with Jacques Chirac. During his brief visit, Mr. Hata granted an exclusive interview to LE FIGARO. [passage omitted] [Jacquet-Francillon] Your first official overseas visit as the head of the Japanese Government is to Europe. Why this interest? [Hata] In January of this year, my predecessor as prime minister was due to visit Europe. But, because of his parliamentary obligations, he was not able to carry out that visit at the time which had been stipulated. But allow me also to tell you this, from a personal viewpoint: Around 17 years ago, we set up a parliamentary association of friendship between Japan and the European Community. As general secretary of this parliamentary league, I did my best to ensure that we got to know each other better. I now chair that parliamentary association. I would like to give you one of the many examples which show the results of our activities to promote friendship between Japan and the EU. This example is the establishment of a Japanese high school in Alsace, just near Colmar. I personally sought the location for that educational establishment. I personally had discussions with the inhabitants of the region, and we thus succeeded in founding that high school, which is called Seijo. I am a former pupil of the Japanese counterpart. With the establishment of a Japanese high school in Alsace, we also see many Japanese businesses becoming active in France: Sony, Seiko, Yamaha, and so forth. That is merely one example of the success of the activities of this parliamentary association. If I had not been involved in the activities of this association, that high school would not be there now. My own son studied there for two years. But let us return to the subject of your question. In the aftermath of the Cold War period, Japan thinks that it is necessary to have a global view of its foreign affairs. That is why we think it is necessary for ties between Japan and Europe to be strengthened, especially because Europe is a region which has very close relations with East Europe, Central Europe, Russia, Ukraine, the African countries as well as the Middle East and Far East countries. We think that the strengthening of these ties with Europe is crucial for Japanese foreign policy. Of course, bilateral ties, discussions relating to bilateral problems, are very important, but the aim of my visit to Europe is not limited to that. We must also discuss global and international problems to try to find out to what extent the sphere of cooperation can be expanded. And so, with a view to the Naples (G-7) summit, I wanted to have discussions with the leaders of the countries which will participate in that summit and establish personal relations with them. [Jacquet-Francillon] In particular, what is your assessment of the talks you have just had in Paris? [Hata] I have had a meeting with President Mitterrand, with Prime Minister Balladur, and with Foreign Minister Juppe with whom I had already met in Tokyo. I have also had talks with Foreign Trade Minister Longuet. We discussed bilateral problems of course, but what I regard as very important is that we took time to discuss problems relating to world peace, the need for cooperation to promote the development of various regions of the world, including ties relating to cultural activities. [Jacquet-Francillon] The United States, probably even more than the EU, criticizes Japan for an attitude which is described as protectionist, to put it mildly. Do you think you will shortly reach a trade agreement with Washington? [Hata] The new government is determined to maintain good relations with the United States. There are economic ties, on the one hand, but there are also broader ties of friendship. We also have a security treaty with the United States. So, in many spheres, bilateral relations with the United States are very satisfactory. But, it is true that, in the United States there is some anxiety regarding the nature of the Japanese market which it sees as closed. It is true that, to improve the quality of Japanese life, it is important to open the Japanese market more to imported foreign products and services whose quality must satisfy Japanese consumers. Also, with the opening of the market, we would like to see more foreign capital invested in Japan. We have taken a series of fiscal and monetary measures on several occasions to try to achieve this goal by stimulating internal demand. With regard to the the current Japanese surplus, our aim is to significantly reduce it in the medium term. It is true that, with regard to sector-based negotiations with the United States, we are currently in a period of reflection. We are convinced that these negotiations are necessary and we would like to reopen them before the Naples summit. Having said that, the doors are wide open for the resumption of the negotiations on both sides. We are attentive to any opportunity which arises to reopen these discussions. On 29 March, we made a decision relating to the measures which should be taken to achieve that goal. And they include deregulation which must be specifically decided before the end of June. I ask you to understand that any result from negotiations with the United States would not just concern products benefiting the United States. On the basis of the most-favored-nation principle, any result from our agreements with the United States would also favor third countries, including the EU member countries. [Jacquet-Francillon] Here in Paris two years ago, in an exclusive interview granted to our newspaper, one of your very recent predecessors, Prime Minister Miyazawa, insisted on the fact that Japan henceforth intended to play a greater part in building the new world order. Since then, it is true, Japan has played a considerable role in UN operations in Cambodia and everybody also knows that the UN secretary general's personal representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina is a Japanese citizen, Mr. Akashi. Do you not think that, at a time when Japan is legitimately claiming a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, that it would be logical for Mr. Akashi to have a contingent of Japanese blue helmets at his side? [Hata] It is true that Japan is trying to play an important role on the world stage with the aim of contributing to peace and world prosperity. A series of examples indicates this. This is true of the provisional administration in Cambodia. In that country, there are also members of the Japanese defense force, and civilians who have taken part in these UN activities. We have also organized a conference in Tokyo on the rebuilding of Cambodia. We have therefore been involved in the process of establishing stability and, at the same time, in rebuilding. With regard to the former Yugoslavia, we have provided humanitarian aid through international organizations, like the UN High Commission for Refugees, and through the World Food Plan, in which our total contribution amounted to $97 million. We are going to release a sum equivalent to $20 million for Albania. There is therefore a whole series of ways of in which Japan is being useful: the dispatch of human resources for rebuilding; the supply of necessary technology; participation in the peace process, and financial aid. We are convinced that, to be useful in maintaining and promoting peace, there is a series of measures which Japan can take, and that, by taking these measures, we can be useful. Japan is now undertaking these activities. [Jacquet-Francillon] Is it conceivable that, once a peace agreement is achieved in Bosnia, members of the Japanese defense force will be sent to the area to verify the implementation of that agreement? [Hata] Five conditions must be satisfied for peacekeeping operations. But whatever happens, once peace is established, people should be sent to verify the situation, to rebuild the region. That is something which can be done. [Jacquet-Francillon] Is Japan prepared to side fully with its allies, particularly the United States, if there is a confrontation imposed by North Korea's plans to equip itself with nuclear weapons? If it is a question of implementing an embargo on Korea tomorrow, in the framework of a UN Security Council resolution, would Japan be prepared to allow the United States unrestricted use of its military bases on Japanese territory? Do you think that Japan could play a mediation role with China to persuade it to use its influence to keep North Korea on the path of moderation? [Hata] The international community is currently trying to find, through dialogue, a negotiated solution to the problem presented by the suspicions hanging over the possible development of nuclear weapons in North Korea. Because the question of economic sanctions has not been discussed in the UN Security Council, you will allow me to make no comment on any practical arrangements Japan might make should the need arise. However, from a general viewpoint, it is obvious that if the Security Council decided to take certain measures, our country would adopt a responsible attitude compatible with the terms of its Constitution. In addition, because the PRC is currently the country which maintains the friendliest relations with North Korea, our government thinks that China's role in the solution of this problem is particularly important. [Jacquet-Francillon] The economy of most of the developed countries seems to be on the road to recovery. Japan -- like France -- seems a little behind compared with its partners. How do you explain that? Should Japan not contribute more to world economic recovery by developing domestic consumption, especially through fiscal measures? [Hata] The Japanese economy is currently going through a process of adjustment, the essential cause of which lies in the cyclical development of the economy. It is also suffering the indirect consequence of what is known as the financial bubble. If you add to that the sudden increase in the value of the yen last year and the particularly cold temperatures in our country in summer 1993, you will see that our country suffered a series of unfavorable phenomena. However, the upward trend of public and property investments is continuing to strengthen, and household consumption seems to be showing some signs of improvement too. All these factors allow us to think that the economic situation is, at least partly, on the road to recovery. Our country's economy is starting to show signs of recovery, and the Japanese Government knows the extent to which it is important to help it to firmly take this course in fiscal 1994. That is why a comprehensive program of economic measures, worth around 15,000 billion yen [Y] -- the central point of which is a reduction in income tax of Y6,000 billion -- was adopted last February, on top of many provisions already taken in the financial sphere. In addition, a series of reforms aimed at improving economic relations with foreign countries was presented in March. The three essential points on which this plan is based are the strengthening of market mechanisms, the improvement of access to our internal market (secured, in particular, thanks to deregulation), and the establishment of economic management likely to boost domestic demand. Moreover, we have the firm intention of making as much effort as possible to ensure that a fiscal reform, including a reduction in income tax, is produced in the course of this year. With the implementation of a broad range of measures already announced, I think that our country's economy will be poised for a sustained recovery and thus make a greater contribution to the economic recovery of the whole international community.
