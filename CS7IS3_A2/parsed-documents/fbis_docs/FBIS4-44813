Scientists, politicians and representatives from British industry discussed at a technical meeting this spring in London the options already available today for effectively countering the continuing increase of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere. The experts agreed that one country alone cannot solve this problem [which affects] the entire earth. Almost unnoticed by the German public, England is actively involved in environmental protection. The country orients itself very closely around the guidelines of the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21. Government and industry have recognized that there is also money to be made in environmental protection, whether with ecologically compatible, economically manufactured products or with the application of the science of management to gain control over environmental problems [facing] Britain and Europe. In England, federal institutions and authorities perform more of a monitoring and advisory function, while industry itself -- without comparably strict laws or regulations as in Germany -- takes action on its own initiative. As Sir John Mason from the Manchester Institute of Science and Technology explained at the meeting, the signs are increasing that the feared severe climatic changes brought about by the constant increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide will not lead to such rapid changes in average temperatures as had so far been predicted by computer simulations. Mason, who has been involved with the questions of global climate for nearly 20 years, is one of Britain's top meteorologists. Mason bases his statements on improved computer simulations. The great depths of the earth's oceans had until now not been taken into consideration in the calculations, because we had no knowledge of how great the bonding power of carbon dioxide at various water depths really is. It has meanwhile become known that there are powerful deep currents between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans which could bring about a comparatively fast distribution of the carbon dioxide picked up from the atmosphere. Rough calculations suggest that contrary to earlier assumptions the oceans can absorb almost twice as much industrially released carbon dioxide. In the end, this observation is in fact not comforting, but it does push the time period for global warming far into the next century. Thus, more time remains for the industrialized nations to substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Great Britain sees Germany's packaging regulations in particular as a warning example. They have led to increased waste export and not to actual waste reduction. In the United Kingdom, they are pursuing another way to encourage and support industry in developing and offering environmentally friendlier products and services. Funds are being made available for this purpose in the 1994 British budget. Clive Brewer, the British government's Director for Environmental Protection, refers to the growing world market for environmental protection technologies which for 1992 is estimated at about $210 billion. In 1992, Great Britain exported about $800 million worth of products in this market alone. Brewer expects that this share will show high growth rates in the coming years. In the meantime, British industry has already started to switch over to products and production processes to minimize carbon dioxide emissions and other environmental pollution within Great Britain, [something] which is also occurring in the other countries in the European Community. London emphasized, however, that this is happening first and foremost on a voluntary basis and that the government itself hardly needs to reach for specific laws or regulations. Dr. Arun Watts, Technical Director of the ICI [Imperial Chemical Industries] Plastics Division, offers as an example the production of plastic foam from polyurethanes using newer methods of production. A non-volatile isocyanate is used as well as new catalysts which undergo polymerization at low temperatures. Analyses of the environmental influences in production, manufacturing and reprocessing were done before coming up with an ecologically defensible product. This led to a reduction in all environmental pollution of about 30 percent. It is hoped that a reduction of around 50 percent can be reached by 1995. It was taken into consideration that plastic foam can be reprocessed by means of a chemical conversion. A high quality polyalcohol is recovered which can be used for the production of a plastic foam with hard plasticity. This plastic foam can then be used for thermal insulation in buildings or in refrigerators or freezers. Since the energy content of the new polyurethane corresponds approximately to that of coal, ICI thinks it makes more sense to burn the material when it is no longer of use than to dispose of it [as waste in a landfill]. According to studies by Dr. Norman Grant, Director of Earth Observation and Science at British Aerospace, Space Division, the measurement data necessary for active environmental protection can be obtained using modern methods of spectroscopy combined with radar and other millimeter wavelength frequency ranges. British Aerospace could make its extensive experience in this area available and thereby substantially ease the accumulation of precise measurement data. This is also true for moisture measurements and the determination of various gases, which are necessary before industrial methods of production can be changed over to more ecological methods. This can extend to being able to make an immediate determination of the precise moisture and water content of foods: no determination process with this level of precision and operating in real time has been available until now, as Grant said. For example, radiometric microwave analyses can be made without touching or destroying [the object of measurement] in the range between 100 to 200 ppm in the frequency range between 140 to 250 gigahertz and up to 30 ppb in the frequencies between 22 and 140 gigahertz. This space flight technology of measurement is tested and, according to Grant, ready to be put into use in industry at a feasible cost. Additional know-how comes from the English atomic industry: within the framework of privatization and restructuring of the AEA (Atomic Energy Authority), a (semi-private) National Environmental Technology Center in Cullham was established and a group of experts particularly experienced in planning work and monitoring technology was gathered. In addition to clients from industry, the center primarily advises the EU Commission on environmental protection with regard to the RDT (research, technology, development) activities which are a part of the Maastricht Treaty. Part of these managerial functions are thus paid for by Brussels out of the comprehensive 12 billion ECU budget for 1994 to 1998. Computerized monitoring systems recording [data for] all of England come from military observations which are prepared and offered for environmental work by Hunting Engineering in Reddingswood/Bedford. The firm supposedly has at its disposal an extremely precise set of maps. It was put together after 1984 together with meteorological data and stations for measuring radiation. It is organized in such a manner that government offices and the public can be kept continually informed about all changes in radioactive readings, Kevan F. Daykin, Director of Information Systems, emphasized. Unfortunately, there is at this time no possibility of connecting the German government's monitoring network. Waste Management International Services, Ltd., works with the broad range of methods and techniques for environmental protection and with the clean-up of the soil and the waters. The company helps businesses and governmental operations to choose what is most suitable from all that is available in various environmental techniques. [Waste Management] has a great deal of experience in cleaning up contaminated soil and advised Exxon, among others, in the removal of the destructive oil [spillage] after the Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska. [Waste Management] is one example that practical environmental protection can also be a profitable business of international proportions.
