[Iglesias] The situation remained stable at a 4-percent growth rate, and a recovery in the past few years. However, the most important issue is the approval of the "Uruguay Round" of GATT talks which has finally ended, and which I believe represents a very important step forward for the future of international trade. I think that the importance of this round of talks is not the achievement of the goals we wanted, but the achievements obtained since the talks began in 1986 in Punta del Este. I think the situation is much better, although not as good as we would have wished, especially for the developing countries. It is very difficult to make progress in this field. The important thing is that we currently have a much stronger GATT organization in comparison with what it was in the past, and consequently we now have an authority controlling trade processes. Issues that had been excluded from international talks are now part of the negotiations. Progress has been made with the incorporation of subjects like agriculture, textiles, and services, which constitutes historic progress. I think the round of talks has resulted in considerable progress which implies historic change in international trade procedures, bringing good perspectives for us. In the agricultural field I do not think things are as we wished they would be, but there has been considerable improvement in any case regarding raw materials. I can see encouraging international trade perspectives due to the situation in industrialized countries. The United States is clearly undergoing a period of recovery, but this is not the case in Europe and Japan, the other two great trade engines. In general terms the perspectives for international trade are that it will continue to improve over the next few years. [EL PAIS] To what extent have your expectations of 1986, when you helped the GATT talks begin in Punta del Este, been met with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round? [Iglesias] It is clear that the objectives we then established were very ambitious, and they gave us much harder work than we thought. It is also true that had it not been for those ambitious goals, we would have not been able to find a balance through gains and concessions that allowed us to find a negotiating point. Seven years after the talks began it has been demonstrated that international trade negotiations are complicated, but it is possible to make progress in them. The important issues of the Uruguay Round were two subjects: On the one hand we have given a clear signal to restrict the extension of protectionism, while on the other hand, at a moment when the international situation is slow and full of crisis, the news of the GATT results was a good revitalizing shock even in some developed countries. [EL PAIS] When do you think that the industrialized countries will recognize the rights of the countries that produce food and raw materials with efficiency, like the members of the Cairns Group, including Uruguay? [Iglesias] That is very hard to predict. A step forward has been taken which some think is very modest, while others do not think so. The momentum to review the issue has begun, but I cannot predict anything. [EL PAIS] What are the differences between the progress attained in the Tokyo Round of talks (1970) and the Uruguay Round? [Iglesias] The important thing is that the customs tariffs have dropped further. But more important than that is the inclusion of new subjects in GATT, and the strengthening of the institutional structure of international trade. I think these are the most important and original results, although there are other subjects such as the mechanisms to solve controversies. [EL PAIS] Although it may seem early to make this question, do you think that a new round of negotiations within GATT must take place at some point? [Iglesias] I seriously doubt that a new round of talks should have to take place in the future. I do not dare to think that another round of talks of this kind might take place for many years. Some permanent negotiation mechanisms may turn up within the new organization that will allow problems to be solved, instead of holding these round of talks which imply an enormous and unimaginable political effort such as the one made over the past seven years. I think that solutions may perhaps be sought through some kind of negotiations within the organization that will be created, taking into consideration sectors, problems, or products. [EL PAIS] What negotiation possibilities will developing countries have within this new organization? [Iglesias] For some developing countries, especially those that produce food, the results may be harsh, because food prices will tend to increase according to this structure. I think that countries like ours must continue negotiating. I think the Cairns Group has played an important role, as demonstrated by the facts. I simply think we must continue struggling in favor of international laws in this kind of negotiation. [EL PAIS] What do you think of the economic situation in Uruguay? [Iglesias] The country is making necessary economic changes. I think that the macroeconomic situation has been wisely conducted, and if the international situation does not become negative, our prospects for the future, within the current terms, are of prudent optimism. [EL PAIS] Uruguayan exporters feel affected by policy maladjustments implemented in our country, leading to a drop in exports. To what extent do you think the eventual loss of competitiveness of our exports and the closing of international markets is important? [Iglesias] Our problems have become worse due to the drop in prices of some goods, making it more difficult to compete abroad, but I think that if we want to be part of an open club it is absolutely necessary to go through the stage of adjusting ourselves to becoming more competitive. This implies some inevitable costs, which must be understood, and we must try in as many ways as we can to overcome them. However, if we thought all sectors should make profits we would not be recognizing the mechanism of the integration process. It is inevitable that some sectors should lose while others make a profit. The important thing will be that at the end of the road we will all be in better shape, and I think we will accomplish that once the Common Market of the South [Mercosur] is strengthened. [EL PAIS] What is the situation of the IDB now, during your second term as head of the bank? [Iglesias] We have gradually gained the trust of countries in the north as well as the trust of Latin American countries. We have extended our sphere of action. We have improved the dialogue with governments and civilian societies. We think the bank has a very special characteristic. Latin Americans think of it as something of their own, and they are right. This has opened up different possibilities that are not covered by other institutions, precisely because of that special relation we have with governments, the public, and the private sector in general. I envision the future with optimism because, in one way or another, the region is beginning to show a reaction. We are giving priority to areas we think will be important in the near future. I can mention two essential areas: support to social areas of the economy, something vital in this era when reform processes demand renewed action in social programs; and support to the private sector. We think it is very important for the bank to continue assisting the private sector. We are granting this assistance through investment corporations, modestly, but with very good results, such as in Uruguay. We want to go a step forward, and the board of directors is studying the possibility of loaning directly to the private sector, without government guarantees, particularly for projects of infrastructure. That would give us a new window to work on. It is early to anticipate a result, but there are good possibilities. Finally I would say that the big issue worrying me is how to support small- and medium-sized enterprises which generally do not have access to international financial sources. For me it is an objective with a very high priority. [EL PAIS] Has Uruguay efficiently used the resources provided by the bank? [Iglesias] I think it has used our support efficiently and in a variety of ways. I am very happy with our image in Uruguay. In 30 years the bank has loaned $1.2 billion to the country, which in current values must be around $2 billion. We have financed programs worth much more than that, because bank contributions are only a part of the total program. This strong bank presence has centered in very concrete and specific areas, going from physical infrastructure to support for economic reform programs. It has covered economic areas such as milk or rice production and social areas such as education, health, and housing. I think this coverage will continue in the future if the bank can expand its capital base, as we all think it will. [EL PAIS] What are the possibilities for obtaining assistance for the Plan III of Municipal Works that was presented by Juan C. Raffo, transport and public works minister, and National Mayors Congress President Sergio Chiesa in Washington last October? [Iglesias] The bank has financed many sanitary and drinking water programs in Uruguay over the past 30 years. We think our assistance to Montevideo is very important, because Montevideo has half the population of the entire country. It is a joint effort by the national government and City Hall. We have done very well with Sanitary Plans I and II, which are currently being implemented. I do not foresee any problems for Plan III, or even Plan IV, which will complete the entire network of Montevideo's sanitary infrastructure. With the implementation of all these plans I think Montevideo can rightfully aspire to becoming one of the most decontaminated cities in Latin America. [EL PAIS] What importance will the regional and subregional groups -- such as Mercosur, NAFTA (Mexico, the United States, and Canada), and those that have been reached in Central America and the Caribbean -- have? [Iglesias] I am in favor of those groups. I think it is a new form of integration in Latin America. This is an open and competitive integration. We are not resorting to the kinds of closed mechanisms we had in other times. I think we must say that the new Latin American philosophy of integration is not achieved in sacrificing the overall relationship, but on the contrary, by strengthening it through a general improvement of efficiency in the countries. I believe that with that pragmatic and open idea the subregional treaties have demonstrated that they are developing. I am very impressed with the progress achieved by Colombia and Venezuela, the latest developments within Mercosur, the new frontiers that are being opened in Central America. It is important to continue along that line. The agreement among Mexico, the United States, and Canada is a historic event in hemispheric relations, and I think it has strengthened these regional mechanisms, which have become more necessary than ever. I think this because somehow, in negotiating possible membership in NAFTA, the fact that we are participating as a group of countries facilitates negotiations, and makes the agreement more feasible. NAFTA opens a new opportunity to the hemisphere, and beginning from there it strengthens the very subregional integration schemes on which we must insist. [EL PAIS] How do you view the development of Mercosur after some of the difficulties that have emerged, and which have not been fully overcome, in 1993? [Iglesias] I think the structural problems prompted by these integration schemes emerge when the countries are not yet in the same situation. These differences in the macroeconomic situations prompt difficulties and problems such as that of the common import tariff. But I would dare to say that in many aspects these difficulties were avoidable. The political will is very strong, and I can see it everywhere, and that is essential. [EL PAIS] How long does Mr. Iglesias believe he will remain as president of the IDB? [Iglesias] It depends first on the contract I have with the bank, which expires in four years. It will also depend on whether the governments want me to continue to head this institution, and of course it depends also on the will of God, who has something to do with this business. [EL PAIS] Have you considered any other future activity once you conclude your term in office? [Iglesias] No. My desire is to return to Uruguay, but by no means have I thought what to do during that "century ahead," which means the next four years in the life in which we're living. [EL PAIS] Would you be a minister again in a Uruguayan government? [Iglesias] Look, I have no answer to that question. All the options of my life are open, but for the time being my only concern is basically to try to fulfill the objectives I have set to see to it that, with the help of God, I might complete a decade in the bank to do what I have proposed to do. [EL PAIS] The planned economies have fallen, while neoliberalism prevails. It is said that no alternative has been found to this doctrine. What do you think? [Iglesias] Look, I think it would take a long time to answer that question. Each person interprets neoliberalism very differently, so the first thing I would ask is how do you define neoliberalism, and then I would offer my understanding of it. I think the experience of the past few years has demonstrated that there are important limits to state voluntarism, and that there are limits to be imposed on the people, starting from above. Therefore, if we understand neoliberalism in this manner, I agree with it. Now, if what we understand by neoliberalism is simply that the forces of the market can play without any type of state presence or control as guardian of public interests, or that the responsibilities inherent to an appropriate function are not assumed, I would say that I do not agree with it.
