The present article summarizes a thorough research into the financial reform in Mainland China, carried out since the end of last year by the Chih Ts'e Company. We hope it will assist readers in getting to know and fully understand the financial reform on the mainland. Following the Third Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and having set the establishment of the socialist market economy system as general objective, the Chinese Government formulated a series of reform plans. One of their most important components is the reform of the financial system. The following major items are included in the scheduled financial reform plan: The People's Bank is to become a Central Bank; commercial finance is to be separated from the state's policy-directed finance; the present specialized banks shall be converted into commercial banks, and appropriate banks shall be established for the state's policy-directed finance; various kinds of financial institutions of a nonbank character and securities markets shall be developed; banks with new and different ownership systems shall be established; the financial markets shall be gradually and to a limited extent opened to the outside world. These reform plans of the Chinese Government have attracted general attention in Chinese as well as foreign financial circles, and have raised great hopes of financial reform in 1994. Contrary to this optimistic anticipation, the Chinese Government, since the beginning of 1994, has been adopting an ever more cautious attitude toward financial reform. The present article summarizes the thorough research of financial reform in Mainland China carried out since the second half of last year by the Chih Ts'e Company. We hope it will assist readers in getting to know and fully understand the financial reform on the mainland. Two Kinds of Interests, Two Kinds of Objectives One of the major special characteristics in the 15-year history of the reform has been that implementation of whichever item of mainland reform has always been the result of continuous back-and-forth adjustments and negotiations between the central government and the local governments. Not one item of the reform has been implemented according to the predetermined plan and timetable of the central government. The financial reform will reflect this basic characteristic even more intensely. As far as the central government is concerned, its fundamental objective in the financial reform is establishment of a new system of macroregulation and control, suited to the conditions of market economy, to replace the former administrative method and to realize the developmental objectives of the central government. In the immediate future and for a medium range of time, the policy of strengthening macroregulation and control actually means strengthening the central government's control of the economy and reducing the ability of local governments to interfere. The central government is particularly interested in having the People's Bank as quickly as possible assume the various functions of a central bank and to have it designated as policy-setting bank. Converting the specialized banks into commercial banks is being viewed as even more important, in that it will enable the branch agencies of specialized banks to free themselves of the influences exerted by local governments and to raise the efficiency of their credits, and, furthermore, to be able to continue maintaining control over the scope of credits. As far as the local governments are concerned, the fundamental objective of the financial reform is to reduce as far as possible the central government's financial control in one's territory, to increase sources of funds for one's locality, and to provide for all local enterprises and for local economic development a financial environment that is less exposed to influences emanating from the economic condition of the overall entity. The local governments will therefore attach greater importance to the development of all kinds of direct methods of financing and of banking institutions of a local nature, including the development of local banks. They also hope that it will be possible in the course of the commercialization of the specialized banks to gain greater freedom from the central authorities' centralized control and restraints on their, the local governments', scale of operations. No doubt, these two reform objectives do not agree with each other, and that reveals a very serious contradiction. This disparity is bound to constitute a substantial impediment in the financial reform and in the commercialization of the specialized banks. Fundamental Obstructions Impeding Financial Reform The financial reform on the mainland is up against three most fundamental obstructions: 1) The enterprise system. The most basic characteristic of mainland enterprises, whether they are state-run or collective-run, is that they take responsibility for profits but not for losses. As long as they have attained a certain proportion and employ a certain number of staff and workers, enterprises under most circumstances simply cannot go bankrupt and cannot be closed down. To a very large extent this is due to the fact that mainland enterprises also function to a very large part as a social security system. Once an enterprise would go bankrupt, workers would lose their jobs, and this would endanger social stability. Neither the central government nor the local governments will wish this to happen. Under these circumstances, the enterprise-bank relationship cannot possibly be a completely economic relationship, banks also cannot possibly grant loans completely according to economic principles, and it is then also quite impossible for banks to enforce repayment of loans when enterprises find themselves unable to repay bank loans. In most instances nowadays, banks will grant credits to enterprises that incur serious losses or whose assets do not cover their liabilities just to have them keep up production or to ensure by their loans that the workers will be paid their basic wages. What has to be emphasized here is that in any case the reform of the enterprise system will be a very slow and gradual process. Before having truly established an enterprise bankruptcy system and a social security system, and before these systems are really functional, no great progress is possible in the commercialization of the specialized banks on the mainland. 2) Macro-economic control. After the very thorough reform of the planning system, finance, especially the system of specialized banks, has at the present stage become the central government's major means of exercising macroeconomic control and the major means of realizing the objectives of its industrial policy. Prior to having established a new form of macroeconomic regulation and control, the commercialization of the specialized banks would soon result in detaching these banks from the economic interests of the central government and allowing them to adopt an attitude of noncompliance with state policy, where such conflicts with the banks' own interests. This would undoubtedly weaken the ability of the central government to control economic activities. Even if, as a matter of priority, special banks are established for the state's policy-directed financial affairs, having all credit business operated along commercial principles would then still make it impossible for the central government to realize a large part of its macroeconomic policy objectives, because the credit operations of the specialized banks would be of so large a scale as to be decisive within the total amount of credit operations. This would apply to the areas of controlling the overall scope of credits, the direction of credit investments, assurance of employment, etc. For these reasons, the central government is adopting a most cautious stand in the question of commercialization of the specialized banks. 3) Local interests. For a variety of reasons, setting up branch agencies of the specialized banks all over the country would make these branches, to a certain extent, banks of the local governments. To achieve their local economic objectives, the local governments would use every means to have the specialized banks grant credits according to their, the local governments', demands. If the basic-level bank branches would not be able to freely decide on the granting of loans, it would hardly be possible for any real commercialization to be truly materialized. It has to be emphasized, therefore, that even if it would be possible to keep organizational and staff matters free from the influence of the local governments, the local branches would, in all their business operations, still be subject to the dispositions and directions of the local governments. The significance of the above-stated three difficulties is perhaps: Apart from the experts, there is nobody in Mainland China who truly hopes for an early commercialization of the specialized banks. A Reform Characterized by Peripheral Reforms The central government is fully aware of the complexity of such problems as the commercialization of the specialized banks and the overall reform of the financial system. It is, therefore, adopting a very cautious attitude toward these reforms. Even though the "Resolution of the Third Plenary Session" and related documents emphasize the importance of financial reform and the commercialization of the specialized banks, in actual implementation greater importance is placed on stability and feasibility of the reform process. Key points in the reform for the immediate and medium-range future are to strengthen, as a matter or priority, the functions of the Central Bank and the establishment of banks for the state's policy-directed financial affairs, so as to achieve the separation of ordinary finance from the state's policy-directed finance. In matters of commercialization of the specialized banks, the stand taken is one of steadiness and soundness. Early this year, at the All-China Financial Work Conference, the presidents of the four specialized banks did not emphasize commercialization as a key task, but merely mentioned, in general terms, the intention to advance in that direction. Thereafter, the complexity of the entire macroeconomic situation and the increasing pressure of the commodity price increases, had the central government and the relevant agencies become even more cautious in the matter of promoting financial reforms. In reviewing the past experiences in the reform, we believe the financial reform and commercialization of the specialized banks will possibly show more or less the following characteristic developments: 1) In overall progress and dispositions, matters will on the whole follow the basic course of past reform activities on the mainland. At first, a relevant reform plan will be formulated, and an appropriate locality will then be selected where the project will be launched as an experiment on a small scale to gain necessary experiences. On the basis of the collective experiences, the project will then be gradually expanded. Completion of the relevant reform plan could be expected within a year. 2) As to its specific forms, the reform may be conducted in a variety of forms in parallel. In the area of securities markets (securities to comprise stocks and bonds), as to non-bank financial institutions, as to the commercialization of specialized banks, as to various forms of local banks, as to banks on the shareholding cooperative system, as to the limited opening up of the domestic financial market and of business in people's currency [RMB], experiments in various forms will be conducted simultaneously. 3) Stimulating the process of commercialization of the specialized banks by other types of financial reforms. This comprises two basic aspects: First, most speedy development and promotion of various forms of direct financing. Second, most speedy development of banks other than the specialized banks. Because every type of direct financing and banks other than the specialized banks are much closer to the development of the regional economy, and are much easier influenced by local governments, these financial activities and reforms will receive much more support from the local governments. We may therefore see in the coming few years a rapid development of these financial reforms, and there will also be a substantial impetus from the basic level toward the upper levels in the core concern of the financial reform, namely in the commercialization of the specialized banks. Opportunities Brought by the Financial Reform As far as foreign investors are concerned, the financial reform in Mainland China, regardless of its speed, will provide a series of new investment opportunities, and will also be of assistance to foreign investments already in place on the mainland. Speaking only of the reforms that have already taken place, these opportunities exist on the whole in the following areas: 1) Foreign-Financed Banks. At present, the Chinese Government already allows foreign capital to set up fully or partly foreign-financed banks in the special economic zones [SEZs]. In Shanghai, there are already over 80 foreign-financed banks and financial institutions, and such also exist in other SEZs. 2)Opening up trade in RMB. At present, Shanghai has already decided to open up, tentatively and within limits, trade in RMB to foreign financial institutions within the year. With this as starting point, all SEZs will gradually engage in similar experiments. Even though this type of business activity is restricted to the SEZs, the fact that each SEZ has the position of financial center will have the effect that these experiments will have widespread influence and will penetrate into the other areas of Mainland China. 3)Non-Bank Financial Institutions Chinese Government regulations on foreign capital entering into securities and funds are very relaxed. In the next few years, these areas will experience very rapid development. At present, as many as 600 funds of various types are awaiting approval. After the People's Bank will have promulgated its regulations on the administration of funds, mainland funds will develop very rapidly. Overall, the fact that financial reform and financial activities on the mainland are drawing closer to international practices will induce the government to gradually relax financial controls. It will, furthermore, adopt a series of new forms of financial activities and provide new opportunities for financial investments, and foreign investors will gain much benefit in the course of these developments.
