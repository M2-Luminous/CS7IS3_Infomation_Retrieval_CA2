Mr. Prime Minister, it has been exactly four months since the program for the economic recovery of the country was implemented. What do you think of the results? [Marjanovic] They are impressive. What happened over the last four months? The exchange rate of the dinar has been maintained and stabilized -- that is, the dinar is stable. There is hardly any inflation; it has been reduced to zero. Production has increased by almost 14 percent, prices have been reduced, and they are now 0.6 lower in comparison with prices before the implementation of the program, since January. The further upward trend in production has been successful. [sentence as heard] Therefore, these are the basic elements that speak in favor of the fact that the implementation of the program over the first four months has been very successful. The most important thing is how the future implementation of the program will proceed in the third and fourth quarters. I am an optimist. Considering what I have seen during my visit to the Krusevac basin, I am even more of an optimist. [Petrovic] What are you impressions after what you have seen and heard from the Krusevac economists? [Marjanovic] The results that have been achieved over the first four months of the implementation of this program are such that they give us more optimism concerning the future realization of this program. Why? First, because production in general in the Krusevac region is on the increase. Second, because the profit of the companies is also on the rise. Salaries are increasing, prices are stable, and there are no indications that would suggest that prices could go up. The program that certain companies are applying now is such that companies are finding ways of reprogramming their production because of the sanctions since not all production will work. Products have to have a market, they have to have further solutions. [sentence as heard] The solution is not in mere production while amassing stocks. Seeing these positive tendencies in production in the Krusevac basin, I am really an optimist, since the Krusevac basin is one of the most important segments in the future development of the Serbian economy.
