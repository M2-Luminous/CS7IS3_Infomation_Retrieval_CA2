According to a report broadcast by Radio Lebanon, the U.S. diplomat today met with Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz in his office and told him that Christopher would make additional efforts to bridge differences between Syria and Israel over the future of Golan Heights. The foreign minister told local reporters that his meeting with the U.S. charge d'affaires concentrated on the last round of talks Christopher held with Syrian leaders in Damascus and with Israeli officials in Tel Aviv. He expected that another round of talks would be held (by the U.S. secretary of state) before the parties concerned are invited to resume their negotiations. He pointed out the talks between Syria, Israel and the United States, despite their seriousness, are still far away from reaching an agreement among them. "So it is necessary to make more endeavors and efforts in order to achieve this purpose," the foreign minister said.
