The windows of our old Moscow house looked out onto the streets and in the intervals between the thunder and squealing of the tram wheels turning the sharp corner at the church of Metropolitan Filipp, at number 2 Meshchanskaya Street, I could clearly hear this "whoosh," which I still remember, coming from the yardwoman's ancient broom. These sounds began at around 0500-0600 hours, that is when it was still dark in the winter, but when early in the morning the Moscow working people or we primary school children emerged from our homes the sidewalks were "scraped clean" and swept and in the summer were washed with water from a black hosepipe and in winter after snowfalls neat piles of snow rose up at the roadsides and were later taken away into the yards in huge plywood crates with the most vigorous support from us small boys. Today many people are inclined to idealize the order maintained on the streets and in the yards and doorways and to present it as a model of the "socialist way of life." Most of us probably remember how Moscow was ordered to be a model communist city and consequently the world's cleanest city. With the adroitness of communist propaganda and the vitality of Soviet myths this illusion of outward order fools many people. And there is nothing surprising in the fact that the party of the "communist broom" was very successful at the Federal Assembly elections. The Communist Party and the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] as though in collusion both put forward the introduction of order as virtually their main election slogans while not, it is true, specifying how this would be achieved in reality: through rebukes from the "parteigenosse" at party meetings, with the aid of a radical GULAG or, even more radical, by means of a war against their own people, on which subject the leaders of the All-Russian Communist Party of Bolsheviks-CPSU have nothing to learn from anyone: They surpassed everyone in practice, beginning with the suppression of the Kronshtadt and Tambov uprisings. Here the communist and national-socialist agitators "forget" to tell the population that order, legality, and cleanliness have existed in the majority of European cities for several centuries. That is, long before Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler tried to grace Russia and Germany with the theory and practice of social and racial cleansing. Law and order are the product of mature democracy and legal and everyday standards, not ideology. How to explain the popularity of slogans of order for Russia or the interest displayed by the public in the idea of a "clean Russia," if we are speaking of its more workaday transformation? Probably by the fact that alongside civil rights, rights to education, medical services, freedom of religion, and others there is, without being described in law, citizens' right to order. If you talk of simple and clear elements in the people's life then the concepts of democracy and freedom as reflected in daily life are implemented through the order, calm, and cleanliness of urban and rural life. Cleanliness and order in the country begin with cleanliness in your own doorway, on your own threshold. It is only in our politically unsettled times that we have to go to the polling stations several times a year. In countries with a stable democracy such an expensive "pleasure" is permitted only once every several years. It is we, concerned with repelling the ideologists and leaders of the communo-fascists, who are prepared to go to the barricades or meetings at the first call to defend our fragile democracy. In old Europe meetings and demonstrations take place with the strict observance of established regulations and under police guard. In our country abuse and obscenities against the president and government are considered virtually to be in good taste for the newspapers which flaunt their new independence. A real democratic press knows how to say unpleasant things and even to cut into the flesh with the expertise of a skilled surgeon. During Watergate Richard Nixon was brought to political death not by the newspapers' unbridled statements but by professional journalists' painstaking work. In a healthy society politics and the population do not notice each other, in the good sense of the word. The assembly bell should ring in exceptional cases and only when the people do indeed need to be pushed to accomplish something extraordinary. One of the underlying reasons for the democrats' failure at the elections is the fact that neither the parties nor their leaders have the stomach or the ability to perform routine work for the sake of the genuine values of the state and the people. The aim of the election campaign was not to put forward ideas which could normalize Russia but to obtain deputies' seats and to win a successful percentage. Not a single one of the election blocs' programs essentially even mentioned how nationwide problems, as opposed to narrow party or group problems, would be resolved. The Agrarian Party of Russia quite frankly preached the conservation of the collective and state farm system in the interests of "soviet landowners" -- the directors and chairmen of the state and collective farms. The "Civic Union" interpreted the interests of the "red directors." "Women of Russia" introduced its own "feminine" note to the chorus of demands made on the government. The communist party, having repealed the dictatorship of the proletariat for reasons of expediency, traded wholesale and retail in the specters of an equalizing social happiness. The very concept of the "social state" stuck in the new Constitution sounds like the echo of communist ideology and essentially reflects the same party division in the face of the general and indivisible interests of all Russia and the entire people. It is merely through the inertia of Soviet thinking that it preserves the illusion of the possibility of preserving social peace by issuing unbacked loaves. Yet the lack of uniting national-strategic political parameters that are clear to the people is extremely dangerous. The Federal Assembly, recruited on the basis of the party and leader [vozhdevoy] principle, by virtue of this face alone is already programed for political and personal disputes. It is hard to believe that, counter to the Russians' hopes, it will be able to given an account of itself as the expresser and defender of the people's life. Russia's national, underlying interests could again be beyond the Federal Assembly's purview. It could happen that a truly broad movement of the population for national normalization will be formed around a nonparliamentary figure and outside the Federal Assembly walls. Examples of such phenomena are known to history. There has been Gandhi and Gandhism in India, Tolstoy and Tolstoyism in Russia, and the movement around Martin Luther King in the United States. There is the O. Palme phenomenon in the Scandinavian countries. A. Sakharov could have been such a figure in our country were it not for his untimely end. Without underestimating the country's economic difficulties I should like to express the opinion that the main barrier complicating Russia's emergence onto a strategic expanse is the lack of a clearly formulated national goal brought to the awareness of every family and citizen. The absence of, if you like, a "Russian idea," a Russian goal and dream. And it is obvious that this aim is outside short-term politics and even outside the economy. One reason for the democrats' defeat at the elections was that masses of the population did not want to identify themselves with any of the democratic parties or with any bloc. And it is not that the leaders or promises were bad but because not a single party was able to clearly disclose a uniting strategy. Our new politicians argue intelligently about a collective approach [sobornost] and its benefits to the Russian man and state. They forget that for the overwhelming majority of peasants, workers, and housewives whom they want to tempt with a collective approach and great powerdom these words sound as absurd and incomprehensible as "Snickers" or the "Maastricht Treaty." A person will understand that matters in our country have finally turned toward order not because he is given a correct explanation of how and why the White House was burned down and why a trial was needed of the State Committee for the State of Emergency and totalitarian ideology but only if his wife, daughter, and grandchildren are no longer afraid to leave the house after dark. Millions of people who suffered from the tyranny of the CPSU will only believe that the suppressed rebellion has saved us from the threat of a communist restoration if the lovers of red-brown sauce, sickles, hammers, and swastikas are firmly and clearly shown their place in society. But if in our country punch-ups, drunkenness, car thefts, and fighting between racketeers continue on the streets even after the October events, if a month after the rebellion's leaders entered Lefortovo their lawyers are beginning shamelessly to demand that the president stand trial, if several weeks after the president's supporters were almost hanged on the Kremlin trees, the inflammatory newspaper DEN is again starting to be sold in Moscow, if after all that we learned of the National Salvation Front and of Anpilov and Anpilov's supporters and they have the impudence to apply to picket the new parliament... then that person, whom they want to lead by collective and great-power means toward democracy with a Russian face may quite justifiably send the democrats and democracy packing and demand a real dictator. Which in part is what happened 12 December. The new parliament will probably be able to become a testing ground for running in and calibrating statesmen. For all the shortcomings already discerned in it, that will be its useful mission. Here they must not only be clearly aware that politicians' personal accounts far from always coincide with the nation's aspirations. Being a politician is always a profession with all its transient, often pleasant but, alas, short-lived attributes and gifts. In connection with the possibility of the Federal Assembly's "self-disillusionment" in the very first months of its work, particular importance attaches to the Constitution which has been adopted. The development of the Constitution is of strategic importance to Russia. It reveals the democratic future of a single and indivisible Russia as the aim of national policy. In other words, for the first time in our state's history a general national uniting task has been set before Russia's people. But the new Constitution, with enormous internal creative energy, is nonetheless a sleeping Ilya Muromets. This hero still has to be awoken and taught to walk and act. It would be naive to suppose that after 12 December there will be a miracle of Russian transformation. The great American constitution was adopted 200 years ago yet the American economic boom began only after World War II and without any direct link with the constitution. The constitution is only a "great promise." And perhaps the most important thing which we must all understand is that the new Russian Constitution is not the truth, it is a path. With the coordinated collaboration of the state and the democratic parties that path can be shortened. But only the united people themselves can plow the deep furrow of their own fate and implement it on the basis of the ideals of the Constitution. I have already written about the idea of the "Clean Russia" movement. About the extra-party people's movement which would be based on Russia's nationwide aims. Of course it is not a case of revising the democratic idea of pluralism. The parties in a democratic society perform an essential role, ensuring the generation of competing ideas and the necessary level of critical control over the activity of the government, president, and other parties. But the actual principle of party-mindedness contains the idea of people's division on the basis of their interests: class, professional, corporate, social, and property interests. In addition the party is always a vehicle for moving toward power. And whether the leaders of the parties want it or not, even the most sincere of them are obliged, especially under crisis conditions, to subordinate their actions to the imperatives of the struggle for political survival. National aims proclaimed in the party programs are most often camouflage for the road leading not to the temple but to power. The "Clean Russia" movement would not set itself power goals. It does not need deputies' seats or government posts. Its strength would lie in the moral solidarity of the entire population around a few goals determining the health of the nation and the unity of the country. The instrument of the "Clean Russia" movement would be not violence but the voluntary donation of a small part of one's labor, a modest contribution, physical or moral participation. It would not be a movement of likeminded people. But people adhering to different views could unite for joint actions for Russia's benefit. I could cite as an example one of these nationwide goals. The collapse of the USSR generated major migration movements. The Russian-speaking population is flowing out of nearly all the former USSR republics. In each specific case, for each family obliged to move away from their home and go out into the unknown it is a drama, often a tragedy. Of course, one can see this problem in a political and propaganda focus. One can demand sanctions against the states which expel the Russians. One can push the Russians to resist. One can ultimately achieve certain concessions through the use of certain means. In the short term this policy and these tactics can bring short-term dividends for a party or leader who has declared himself the defender of the oppressed. But as a result of reciprocal national violence there can arise such a complex knot of contradictions and hatred that it cannot be unravelled without bloodshed. There is another path. A nationwide program, based on all-Russian solidarity, for the Russians' return, to draw them inside Russian borders. We have tens and hundreds of cities and villages which were once declared "unpromising" and escheated. Yet Russian people lived for centuries in these cities and villages. They lived and worked, augmenting the country's wealth. Today these lands lie empty and the cities are going to ruin, degenerating demographically. Russia has spent too generously on "developing" adjacent lands, exerting itself immoderately, tearing its own umbilical cord. Dozens of cities, plants, factories, and airfields constructed by the genius of the Russian mind and the skill of Russian hands, when union property was shared out made us the hostages of alien intentions, the victims of national improvidence. We are already being blackmailed with the technological and cultural munificence we ourselves bestowed. Russia gave primers to many peoples who did not even have their own written language and now they are trying to teach us, the heirs of Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Dostoyevskiy, they are trying to teach us "human rights" on the basis of these primers. Russia does not need other people's resources. But we must distribute our own resources in the manner which is customary in a healthy family: first to our own children, elderly parents, and our own orphans, and then (if the granaries are not empty) to close and remote neighbors. The "Clean Russia" ideas are based not on racism but on a normal and healthy feeling of national egotism. Someone who does not know how to provide a sufficiency in his own home is useless to his neighbors. We must equip and sweep clean our own house and only then speak of the concepts of humanism for all mankind. Here the Russian people, the Russians must pose least of all in the guise of some kind of ideal and model and least of all surrender to the messianic temptations of the "third Rome" ideology. We have no grounds for this. We must simply reach the level of other peoples who have learned to live normal human lives under the conditions of democracy. For this discipline is needed. The discipline of the nation and of each person. We must rid ourselves of laxity in work and daily life. We must introduce normal models of labor discipline and conduct into society. So that it is clear to everyone where the permissible limit of "naughtiness" ends and where hooliganism begins, where there is normal festive drinking and where it turns into drunkenness, boorishness, and lack of labor discipline. Today these borderlines are eroded in our country. In our country people can ridicule a teetotaller, a man who speaks in a literary Russian language, an educated man, and softheartedly take pity on a drunkard and idler known to everyone in the apartment block. A dangerous distortion of the concepts of good and bad has occurred in society. A foul-mouthed idler drinking with the foreman at the plant in our country often passes as a "great guy." An overt criminal passes for a resourceful businessman. We have become accustomed to the shameful filth of our doorways, muck on the streets, and bureaucrats' bribe-taking and arrogance. We have gotten out of the habit of walking normally and dressing normally. Often not even because of poverty but because of the primitive nature of our taste and education. And at the same time these are Russian citizens or ethnic Russians [russkiye ili rossiyanye]. The task of the "Clean Russia" movement is to return to them their human dignity or at least not to allow them to defile the lives of their own children. We do not need much money for that. We need powerful and coordinated work by all the mass media interested in the country's upsurge. I do not remember whose idea it was that to encourage a people to rise up they must be aware of the degree to which they have fallen. In my opinion we are close to that. Today many people in our country are speaking and writing about patriotism. The false monopoly of the Communists and national socialists on love for the Fatherland is being broken. Democratic writers and journalists are speaking seriously and profoundly about patriotism. Patriotic impulses are emanating from the Russian president. But today it is important to take the next step. To switch from agitation and competition in patriotism to action. It is important to transfer the concept and expression of patriotism to the plane of routine, daily life. It is not every day and every year (fortunately) that society requires lofty sacrificial patriotism, examples of which were given to us by the Great Patriotic War. Patriotism and love for the Fatherland in everyday life can most often be displayed in the unremarkable actions about which no one will write in the newspapers. If instead of being in the habit of cursing the Moscow city hall for badly cleaned streets several apartment block residents were to go out onto their own doorway with brooms and shovels after a heavy snowfall that would be a small step toward a "Clean Russia" (someone would probably ridicule it to start with). If in a small provincial city a few intellectual and educated people were to organize lectures on linguistic standards that would be a small exploit in the name of Russian culture. If through our collective protests (not political protests, with no banners or raised fists, but through peaceful civic means) we were to get television to observe a ban on the advertising of alcohol and tobacco, that would mean that the "Clean Russia" movement had begun to exist in reality. If together with the church we were to ensure that it is not the funeral mafia which runs the cemeteries but that normal, honest people work there, that would be a small step toward returning the nation's dignity. "Clean Russia" is not a fantasy, not mythmaking. It is a feasible reality precisely because it calls people not to exploits, not to sacrifice, but to the display of humaneness and discipline in the simplest circumstances of daily life. If there are millions of us, Russia will be transformed.
