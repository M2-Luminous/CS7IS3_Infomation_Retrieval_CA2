FR940617-1-00109 FR940617-1-00012 (2) To validate the assay, compare, at each sampling interval, changes from baseline counts obtained with the test material to changes obtained with the control materials. (c) Effects on microbial flora. The agency notes that, if there is some reasonable scientific indication that the activity of an ingredient will affect the microbial flora, and thereby cause a shift in the composition of this flora, e.g., an increase in the fungus or virus level that might result in greater harm, then further safety and effectiveness testing will be required. (d) Test modifications. The formulation or mode of administration of certain products may require modifications of the testing procedures in this section. In addition, alternative assay methods (including automated procedures) employing the same basic chemistry and microbiology as the methods included in this section may be used. Any proposed modification or alternative assay method shall be submitted as a petition under the rules established in ยง10.30 of this chapter. The petition should contain data to support the modification or data demonstrating that an alternative assay method provides results of equivalent accuracy. All information submitted will be subject to the disclosure rules in part 20 of this chapter. PART 369_INTERPRETATIVE STATEMENTS RE WARNINGS ON DRUGS AND DEVICES FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER SALE 3.
