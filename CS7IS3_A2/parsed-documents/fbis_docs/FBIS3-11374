The classification of banks by source of capital has also been abolished. This move, which is already the subject of intense controversy, is ultimately designed to reduce interest rates and the cost of financial services in general. We should indicate, first of all, that a law has been amended by decree, a by now all too common occurrence that has become one of the most striking maladies of the institutional system. In essence, though, it represents a unilateral opening of the Argentine economy, in keeping with the decision about foreign trade. Indeed, the series of decisions that cut tariffs substantially and abolished other restrictions on imports of all sorts of merchandise were equally unilateral. A different approach in both instances would have been to seek reciprocity from other nations. But the feeling was that unilateral liberalization was indispensable to promote competition and enhance the productivity of the Argentine economy. Since a liberalization negotiated on condition of reciprocity would have taken years perhaps, with no guarantee of success, the decision was made unilaterally, to further the country's own interests. At the same time, though, a cut in Argentine tariffs, with reciprocity, was negotiated during the Uruguay Round of GATT. Once the negotiations are approved, these tariffs cannot exceed 35 percent. This means that our country can raise them to that "ceiling" if it ever considers such a move appropriate. In the case of banks we are talking about services, not goods. This sphere of economic activity is rapidly becoming part of international commerce, as has just been acknowledged during the negotiations in the Uruguay Round of GATT, which created an institutional framework parallel to trade in goods. In this case tariffs cannot be applied. Liberalization means the right to do business and to receive the same treatment accorded the services delivered by domestic firms. This is precisely what the decree in question is about. The administration has thus chosen to apply to banking the same principle of unilateral liberalization that it decided to apply at the time to trade in goods. The goal of the economic authorities is to stimulate competition among banks, as a result of which it expects a drop in interest rates and in the cost of financial services in general, which has been a constant demand of agriculture, industry, and in particular, small and mid-sized businesses in the interior. The principle of reciprocity is very common in the legislation of major nations. In Argentina's case, however, it has not yielded significant results, to judge by the delays and inaction on various requests by Argentine banks to open branches in major financial centers. The primary explanation of this is our country's relatively minor financial bargaining power in the world. Other, more powerful nations have a better chance of success in applying this principle, for example the United States in its trade dispute with Japan. The economic authorities have no doubt observed the difficulties of reciprocity and, as a result, chose the potential advantages of financial competition. The opening of the local market to foreign banks is largely a political issue. In past decades this would have been unthinkable, as was foreign involvement in other areas of the economy, especially those regarded as "strategic," such as energy, petroleum, gas, and railways. Current political, economic, and technological developments show that many economic and financial borders are being erased. Foreign firms already have a major presence in the banking sector. So the liberalization will probably mean, above all, the opening of more branches of the foreign banks that are already here, which until now have been restricted from doing so. The decision does not give free rein to establish all kinds of banks and branches, as this will in any event remain subject to the regulations and approval of the Central Bank. A very important facet of the debate has to do with how much this decision will help to lower interest rates. A likely result is that competition will improve the productivity and efficiency of banks, regardless of how many domestic, foreign, and state-run banks are already in operation. It is doubtful, however, whether the wide spread between bank interest rates on loans and on deposits is due mainly to the lack of competition. There are other, major factors, such as large reserve requirements, the many burdensome regulations and activities that the banks must endure by government mandate, and also, to some extent, the tax on financial transactions, which pays for the costly, bureaucratic system of social benefits for the sector, or labor legislation. Action will also have to be taken on this front in order to truly lower interest rates so that they cease to represent a drag on the competitiveness of Argentine producers.
