Galindo said efforts are being made in Panama to cooperate in the antidrug-trafficking struggle, and the United States has exaggerated in saying the contrary. "We are all intent on ending drug trafficking and money laundering once and for all in our country because it is difficult to say it will end, but it is incorrect to say nothing has been done," he said. The presidential candidate said there are authorities who are trying to fight narcotrafficking, but he added there are groups of criminals who attempt to evade the security system because Panama is a country with long coastlines on both oceans, which makes it even more difficult to control. Galindo also mentioned the charges against the former government. He said Panamanians cannot live permanently in the past but must learn from experiences from the past and look to the future; otherwise, "we will be living in the past, and the future will be the one that is lost."
