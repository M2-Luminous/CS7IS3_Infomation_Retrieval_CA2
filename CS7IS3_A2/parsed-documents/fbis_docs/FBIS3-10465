Many people believe that Brazil's new economic plan will help reduce the economic differences between that country and Argentina. The economic plan which Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso launched had been "continuously discussed" with the Argentine economic team due to the excellent relations between the two administrations. Government officials and businessmen who are attending the Seminar on Business Opportunities in Argentina and the Mercosur which will end today in Madrid informally evaluated the repercussions of Brazil's new economic plan. Carlos Sanchez, Argentine Economy Ministry secretary for investments and foreign trade, stated that the implementation of measures which will put an end to the indexing of Brazilian economy and will reduce public deficit is very positive. Sanchez added that concrete effects of these measures will be perceived starting next year and Argentina will benefit from them. The Argentine economic team believes that the measures Cardoso has proposed will increase the value of Brazilian currency and Argentina will benefit from the exchange rate. It is well-known that Argentina has a large deficit in its trade with Brazil. Carlos Leone, chairman of the Argentine Steel Comany Inc. said: "Brazil's program is positive because the exchange rate will be more favorable to Argentina. Leone emphasized that Brazil's decision to curb its fiscal deficit is praiseworthy. Angel Perversi, vice chairman of the Bunge and Born Company stated: "This plan is an improvement over what they now have," but he chose to be cautious. "Let us wait for results," he said. In any case, Perversi's advice was that Brazil's changes should not lull us to sleep. "We should focus on retrofitting and the changes we can make ourselves," he told LA NACION. Argentine Industrial Union President Jorge Blanco Villegas stated: "Trade with Brazil will improve as soon as Brazil improves." He added: "We hope that Brazil will succeed, although it is a very complex plan." Villegas emphasized that "there have been many other programs, all of which have failed." The truth is that most businessmen who came to Madrid are still waiting for a change in the economic situation of the main Mercosur partner. Further negotiations for the establishment of a common market are fraught with uncertainties which could be cleared gradually if the new plan works out. The somewhat lukewarm enthusiasm of government officials and businessmen moved President Carlos Menem to forecast: "Mercosur will be beneficial to all American countries, including the United States." Everyone is wholeheartedly praying that this is not just another episode in the comings and goings of regional integration.
