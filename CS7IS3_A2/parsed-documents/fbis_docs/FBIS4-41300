Yeltsin spoke at a dinner given in honor of heads of countries of the European Union and the Russian president by the Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. "We have been led to an agreement which will be signed tomorrow, by a sense of responsibility for the future of Europe and a great desire to give our children a more peaceful, more stable and free continent," he said. "This document opens new possibilities for the construction of genuinely integral, prosperous and safe Europe which plays an important positive role in the world of the 21st Century," Yeltsin said. "The main task now is to realise the agreement as soon as possible and with the maximum result," the Russian president said. "It is in the interests of both Russia and the European Union - two largest political and economic centers of Europe, two powerful trade and economic partners. We shall imminently have to resolve problems which we have failed to resolve until now," he pointed out. Speaking about concrete tasks which will have to be resolved in the near future, Yeltsin noted that it will be necessary to give Russia an access to the European Investment Bank and begin to unconditionally apply GATT norms and rules in mutual trade. It is necessary to facilitate visa regime for Russian citizens in EC countries, he added. According to the Russian president, lifting restrictions on Russian goods in the EC market is of tremendous importance for the success of democratic transformations and market reforms in Russia. In his opinion, "the agreement lays a good basis for this." Yeltsin expressed confidence that the development of large-scale cooperation with Russia will give considerable advantages to states of the European Union. "This is a way to stepping up economic activities, the solution of social problems and primarily, the problem of unemployment," the Russian president said.
