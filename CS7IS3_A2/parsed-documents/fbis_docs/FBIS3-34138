It has been learned that in internal consultations with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq commented on the need for "creating a wall to block 'Arafat, an impregnable iron wall wrapped in cotton." The chief of staff, Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq, Head of IDF Intelligence Uri Sagi and other senior defense establishment personnel have leveled sharp criticism at the way in which negotiations with the PLO are being conducted and maintain that Israel's positions are being undermined. At the same time it is necessary to emphasize that the top IDF echelon is not opposed to the agreement with the PLO. This morning the prime minister will consult with the chief of staff, the deputy chief of staff, the head of IDF intelligence, and senior security officials on the negotiations with the PLO. Next Monday [7 February], after the foreign minister's return from abroad, Rabin will hold an extensive consultations in anticipation of Shim'on Peres' departure for Cairo to meet with Yasir 'Arafat. It has been learned that in the internal discussions, Peres derided "the almost obsessive occupation" with details by the defense establishment. Peres said that a year from now nobody will remember the details that the IDF is demanding to include in the agreement with the PLO. Contrary to Peres, the top IDF echelon believes the agreement with the PLO must include as many details as possible in order to ensure the success of the agreement in the field. The position expressed to the prime minister by the IDF echelon was as follows: "The stage of constructive ambiguity and brilliant formulations is over. We have reached the implementation stage. It is impossible to settle for principles while skimping on details. The day after the agreement is implemented we will have to give platoon commanders and Palestinian policemen accurate instructions to follow. We are dealing here with thousands of people, and the Israeli public must also be informed." [passage omitted]
