MPLA Information Secretary Joao Lourenco says Savimbi men's proposals are absurd. There will be no power sharing. [Begin recording] [Lourenco] UNITA proposals are completely absurd. It is going too far. As a party which lost the elections and afterward seriously violated the law by taking up arms and setting the country alight, it cannot make the demands it is making in Lusaka today. [Unidentified correspondent] How far is your statement true? Are you not saying this just to calm down your voters? [Lourenco] No, this is not just aimed at calming down our electorate. We think it is a serious issue which must receive due importance. We think it would be a bad precedent not only for future elections in our country but also in other African countries, particularly southern African countries. What UNITA should do is to try to win a future election, and it will be able to head the sectors it has mentioned. If this does not happen, it cannot make such demands. There is no international body which can force us to accept UNITA's demands because we won the elections. [end recording]
