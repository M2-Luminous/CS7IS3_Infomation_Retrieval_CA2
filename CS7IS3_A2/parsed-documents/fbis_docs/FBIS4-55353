The Croatian delegation was led by Dr. Zarko Domljan and the Slovene by Zoran Thaler. Nadja Pengov reports: [Begin Pengov recording] The topics of today's talks, which were assessed as good, covered more or less three issues: The position of both countries in Europe, mutual relations, and dangerous signals that have recently been coming from Italy. Regarding the first, both states share similar goals, they are merely in different positions, the position of Slovenia being better today due to objective circumstances. What about mutual relations? We did not hide the fact that some problems exist, it was stated, however, these are not such as to damage the otherwise good relations between the countries. The delegations concluded that the work of the commissions for borders and the agreement on border cooperation should be accelerated. The Slovene side particularly singled out problems connected to property. This agreement is already prepared, however, Croatia is making it conditional on the resolution of issues concerning the nuclear power plant and the debts of Ljubljanska Banka. During the talks they also touched on the speculation that Dr. Zarko Domljan was negotiating a Slovene-Croatian-Bosnia-Herzegovina federation with an unidentified Slovene politician. It was established that this was a hoax. Dr. Domljan explained his vision about future relations between the countries by saying that Slovenia is a priority for Croatia, that the countries must link up solely on the basis of interests, into a sort of a customs, monetary, or some other type of union. [passage omitted] Relations with Italy. The degree of consensus between Slovenia and Croatia is most important here. There will be no alteration of borders and this is out of the question. The agreements must be observed. There will be no new negotiations about the prevailing agreements. The question of compensation for the former property of exiles [optanti] has been solved and the countries will not negotiate this here either. The governments of both countries should agree as soon as possible on the amount of compensation that Slovenia and Croatia should pay. Once this is done, they will, because of Italy's [word indistinct] which does not provide an account number to which the debt could be paid, do this themselves and inform the Italian side where its money is. Dr. Zarko Domljan here stressed the importance of Slovenia and Croatia having a joint action strategy on these issues. [end recording]
