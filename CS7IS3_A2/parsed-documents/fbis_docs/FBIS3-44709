Over the last several decades, it has successively invested several billion yuan in building, renovating, and expanding a number of prison facilities, enabling each inmate to occupy an average of more than 5 square meters in cell floor space. The food allowance of inmates across the country has increased step by step, approaching the average living standards of local residents. Despite the limited food allowance, Shanghai prison prepares nutritious food for inmates and ensures enough good food for them. Furthermore, prisons in various localities have Muslim kitchens for Islamic inmates. In China's prisons today, the inmates enjoy not only the basic right of subsistence but also the right to education. The reform- through-labor institutions educate inmates, with courses ranging from literacy classes to junior middle school education. To date, the reform-through-labor institutions across the country have run more than 12,000 educational classes. Some 1.15 million inmates have graduated from those classes and received diplomas. The institutions have also run job skill training classes so that inmates can earn their own living after leaving prison and return to society. So far, 810,000 inmates have received job skill certificates. A nationwide election for new leading bodies at county and township levels was held in 1993. On 25 December, some 1,200 inmates in Wuhan city, Hubei, who have not been deprived of political rights cast their votes according to the law during those elections.
