Hanna-Rnate Laurien, president of the Berlin City's parliament, made these remarks at a reception hosted by her in honor of Qiao Shi, who is here on an eight-day official goodwill visit to Germany. She said she was very pleased that Qiao's visit is paid following the China visits respectively by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl last year and mayor of Berlin City Eberhatd Diepgen in 1988. Laurien hailed the sound growth of bilateral ties in economy, science and culture. She said Germany's investment in China ranks the sixth in the world, adding that there is a sign that such position will be moved forward. Qiao said Berlin, the largest city in Germany, has great influence on the world. With the German Federal Government and parliament to be moved to Berlin before the end of this century, the city will play more important roles in the country's politics, economy and cultural life, he said. "We are particularly pleased to note that Berlin and China have shared very close relationship," he added. Their links in every aspect are daily increasing and areas for cooperation become wider, he said. Qiao hoped that "such relationship will be further developed with fruitful results," Qiao said. Among those present were Qiao Shi's wife Yu Wen and Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee, who are accompanying Qiao on the visit. Before the reception, Qiao met and had a friendly talk with Laurien here.
