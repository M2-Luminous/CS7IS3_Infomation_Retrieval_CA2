ITAR-TASS reports that Eduard Shevardnadze has agreed to Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's proposal to immediately implement the peacekeeping action of the Russian Armed Forces in Abkhazia. [Omelchenko] At the meetings with Eduard Shevardnadze, head of the Georgian state, and the republic's Defense Minister Vardiko Nadibaidze, it was decided to determine the status of Russian bases in Georgia prior to 1 August and to agree the peacekeeping mission of the Russian troops on the line of disengagement between the Georgian and Abkhaz troop units along the Inguri River. There will be three Russian military bases on Georgian territory: in Vaziani not far from Tbilisi, in Akhalkalaki in the southwest of the republic, and in Batumi. [Grachev] The main question will now be examined--namely stepping up peacekeeping along the disengagement line in this conflict. We will discuss the latest details with Eduard Amvrosiyevich [Shevardnadze] and then we will get down to tackling the practical stages of performing peacekeeping with the military leadership of the group of forces, the commander, and the defense minister. [Omelchenko] The paratrooper regiment in Gudauta is virtually ready to carry out its peacekeeping mission on Abkhaz territory.
