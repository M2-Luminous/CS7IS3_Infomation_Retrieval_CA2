According to the sources, the post of the economic adviser may be instituted in the near future and it is not ruled out that Boris Yeltsin may offer it to Fedorov. The post envisages work in the government as an expert or an observer. The necessity of introducing the post and possible candidates to fill it in may also be discussed at the planned meeting, the source said. However, it is also possible that Yeltsin would prefer to keep Fedorov in the State Duma where the reformer can work on anti-inflation decisions. As a presidential aide, Fedorov will have to give up his parliamentary mandate.
