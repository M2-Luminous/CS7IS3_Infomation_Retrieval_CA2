ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: In accordance with section 202 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), with the cooperation of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for Rangeland Reform '94. BLM and the Forest Service are proposing to change policies and regulations within their Federal rangeland management programs. These actions are intended to improve and restore a significant portion of rangeland ecosystems and to improve and maintain biodiversity, while providing for sustainable development on lands administered by the two agencies. The two agencies are also proposing to revise the formula used to determine fees charged for grazing livestock on Federal lands in the 17 western states. By this notice, the public is informed that the draft EIS is available and that interested individuals may obtain copies by request. DATES: Written comments on the draft EIS must be postmarked no later than August 11, 1994. Comments received after this date may not be considered in preparation of the final EIS. Oral and/or written comments may also be presented at public hearings to be held in the West during the public comment period. Dates and locations of public hearings on the draft EIS will be announced separately from this notice of availability. ADDRESSES: Comments on the draft EIS should be sent to: Rangeland Reform '94, P.O. Box 66300, Washington, DC 20035&hyph;6300. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Write to the above address or call Jim Fox, Bureau of Land Management, (202) 452&hyph;7740, or Jerry McCormick, Forest Service, (202) 205&hyph;1457. To obtain a copy of the draft EIS, please call or visit your nearest BLM Resource Area office or Forest Service Forest office. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The last major revisions to 43 CFR part 4100, including establishment of the current fee formula in regulations, occurred in 1988. Since then, new information on range practices and conditions has been generated by various studies and General Accounting Office audits. In response, the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture have initiated a proposal for rangeland reform, including specific regulatory language. The draft EIS addresses several areas of rangeland management reform, including, but not limited to: the Federal formula for calculating grazing fees, subleasing, unauthorized use (trespass), public participation, suspended and extended nonuse, appeals, disqualification, issuing grazing preference and permits, prohibited acts, permit or lease tenure, BLM grazing advisory boards, range improvement ownership, establishment of an ecosystem framework for rangeland management, and the establishment of standards and guidelines for grazing. The draft EIS is a national-level, programmatic EIS. It documents the ecological, economic, and social impacts that would result from alternative fee formulas and from reforming, or not reforming, other elements of the federal rangeland management program. Five management alternatives are considered in detail: Current Management (No Action), BLM-Forest Service Proposed Action, Livestock Production, Environmental Enhancement, and No Grazing. Seven grazing fee formula alternatives are also analyzed: Current Public Rangeland Improvement Act (PRIA) (No Action), Modified PRIA, BLM-Forest Service Proposed Action, Regional Fees, Federal Forage Fee, PRIA with Surcharges, and Competitive Bidding. Management Alternative 1, Current Management (No Action) would continue existing policies, regulations, and management practices within both BLM's and the Forest Service's rangeland management programs. Management Alternative 2, the BLM-Forest Service Proposed Action, would change many elements of the agencies' current rangeland policies, regulations, and management practices. The Proposed Action includes national requirements that provide the basis for developing state or regional standards and guidelines for managing livestock grazing in rangeland ecosystems administered by BLM. The Forest Service would continue to formulate standards and guidelines for rangeland management while it prepares national forest land and resource management plans. BLM would replace grazing advisory boards with resource advisory councils, which would address a broader range of concerns, while still ensuring local participation in rangeland management decisions. Both agencies would implement policies to manage rangeland resources using an ecosystem approach. The Proposed Action would also establish consistent BLM and Forest Service programs to improve ecological conditions while maintaining opportunities for long-term sustainable development. Management Alternative 3, Livestock Production, would place more control of rangeland management in local communities. Although BLM and the Forest Service would not give up their responsibilities under laws and regulations, local community involvement in grazing advisory boards would play a lead role in making decisions about public rangelands management planning, implementation, and evaluation. Under this alternative, both agencies would have grazing advisory boards. BLM standards and guidelines would be developed at the local level by grazing advisory boards, while the Forest Service would continue to formulate standards and guidelines when it prepares national forest land and resource management plans. Goals and objectives for rangeland ecosystems would be set at the local level through consultation with grazing advisory boards. As under other alternatives, regulation changes would make BLM and Forest Service program administration more efficient and consistent. Management Alternative 4, Environmental Enhancement, would authorize livestock grazing only in areas where enough data shows resource condition standards and goals are being met. This alternative places greater emphasis on managing all uses, including livestock grazing, to sustain ecosystem biodiversity and ecological processes. Some areas would be closed to grazing: wilderness, designated critical habitat for threatened and endangered species, developed recreation sites, and areas of unacceptable rangeland health. Under this alternative, BLM and the Forest Service would adopt and implement national standards and guidelines aimed at maintaining ecosystem health. Joint BLM-Forest Service advisory councils would be set up on an ecoregion basis. As under other alternatives, regulation changes would make BLM and Forest Service program administration more efficient and consistent. Management Alternative 5, No Grazing, would eliminate grazing on public lands over a 3-year phase-out period. BLM and the Forest Service would continue developing policies and procedures for promoting ecosystem management. Where needed, the agencies could use livestock to manage vegetation to achieve resource objectives. None of the other livestock grazing management measures considered in the other four alternatives would be needed. Fee Alternative 1, Current PRIA (No Action), consists of a base value of $1.23 per animal unit month (AUM) that is updated annually using three indexes: change in forage value, change in beef cattle prices, and prices paid for selected items purchased by permittees. The annual fee would not differ by more than 25 percent from the fee charged in the previous year. Fee Alternative 2, Modified PRIA, would use the same base as PRIA, $1.23, but would differ in using an index for all production costs rather than selected production costs. The annual fee would not differ by more than 25 percent from the fee charged in the previous year.
