ACTION: Correction to final rules. SUMMARY: NMFS issues a correction to the effective date section of final rules published on August 24, 1994 and September 6, 1994. Portions of these final rules related to the limited access management of Federal fisheries in and off of Alaska. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Lepore, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59375), NMFS published a final rule to implement Amendment 15 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area (BSAI), Amendment 20 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), and a regulatory amendment affecting the fishery for Pacific halibut in and off the State of Alaska. These regulations established an individual fishing quota limited-access system in fixed gear fisheries for Pacific halibut and sablefish in and off Alaska. In addition, this action implemented a Western Alaska Community Development Quota program for halibut and sablefish fixed gear fisheries. The effective date for the final rule was December 9, 1993, except §§676.20 (a) through (e) and (g) and 676.21, which became effective on January 1, 1994, and §§676.13 (a) and (b), 676.14, 676.16, 676.17, 676.20 introductory text and paragraph (f), and 676.22, 676.23, and 676.24, which will become effective on January 1, 1995. On August 24, 1994, NMFS issued a final rule implementing Amendment 30 to the BSAI FMP and Amendment 34 to the GOA FMP and a regulatory amendment affecting Pacific halibut and sablefish fisheries in and off the State of Alaska. This final rule was effective September 23, 1994, but inadvertently amended §676.24, which will not be in effect until January 1, 1995. On September 6, 1994, NMFS issued a final rule to implement the North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan for the GOA groundfish fishery, BSAI management area groundfish fishery, BSAI king and Tanner crab fisheries, and Pacific halibut fishery in convention waters off Alaska. The final rule was effective October 6, 1994. In that rule §§676.13 and 676.16, which will be effective January 1, 1995, were inadvertently amended. Correction of Publications Accordingly, the publication on August 24, 1994 (59 FR 43502) and September 6, 1994 (59 FR 46126), which were the subject of FR Doc. 94&hyph;20820 and FR Doc. 94&hyph;21711, respectively, are corrected as follows: The EFFECTIVE DATE caption of the final rule published on August 24, 1994, page 43502, the third column, is corrected to read as follows: EFFECTIVE DATE: September 23, 1994, except the amendments to §676.24, which will become effective January 1, 1995. The EFFECTIVE DATE caption of the final rule published on September 6, 1994, page 46126, the first column, is corrected to read as follows: EFFECTIVE DATE: October 6, 1994, except the amendments to §§676.13 and 676.16, which will become effective January 1, 1995. Dated: October 5, 1994. Gary Matlock, Program Management Officer, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25282 Filed 10&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
