At the meeting and during lunch, Mayor Huang Ju talked a lot about Shanghai's tremendous changes in the last two years and its situation of economic development in 1993. He said: In 1993, Shanghai met the requirements Deng Xiaoping set forth at the beginning of the year. Shanghai has been advancing steadily by braving winds and waves and overcoming difficulties, and has moved onto a higher development stage. Huang Ju said: An advantage Shanghai enjoys is that its leaders can directly talk by telephone with the central leaders of the older generation and the incumbent central leaders of the third generation, so Shanghai is well-informed. Anyhow, Shanghai's development should still mainly rely on its own efforts, the efforts of the Shanghai people. He said: A major change in Shanghai last year found expression in the establishment of large markets. Now, there are 11 state- level large markets in Shanghai, and the total yearly business turnover reached 1 trillion yuan. A loan market covering the whole Chang Jiang valley and the Chang Jiang delta area has taken form. While China's financial management center is located in Beijing, the transaction center is located in Shanghai. Huang Ju said: Last year, the amount of foreign funds used by Shanghai doubled that in the previous year, reaching $7 billion. The rate of fund use [zi jin jin du dai wei lu 6327 6855 6651 1653 0451 0143 3764] reached 99.5 percent. Twenty-six of the 100 largest transnational enterprises in the world have opened offices in Shanghai. They mainly come from Europe and America. In terms of the fund sources, Hong Kong and Macao rank first among other places. Therefore, we attach great importance to Hong Kong. Hong Kong and Shanghai have their respective advantages, so they should complement each other and seek common prosperity. China has only one Hong Kong, and that is not enough. Hong Kong has a very good foundation. It is believed that it will better play a role as a window in the 1990's. Huang Ju said: The year 1994 is a decisive year for meeting Deng Xiaoping's requirement of "making changes every year, and making substantial changes every three years," and for maintaining the momentum of healthy economic growth. This year, the target is to increase GNP by 12 percent, and we shall strive to achieve the growth rate of 15 percent, thus laying a solid foundation for Shanghai's economic development and comprehensive strength. Huang Ju said: "We are facing a good opportunity and also enjoy favorable natural, geographical, and social conditions, so it is absolutely possible for Shanghai to maintain the favorable momentum of economic growth in the new year." Attending the meeting and luncheon also were Chen Zhili, deputy secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee; Jin Binghua, member of the Standing Committee of the municipal party committee and director of the Municipal Propaganda Department; Cai Laixing, deptuy secretary general of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government;, and Jia Shumu, deputy director of the Municipal Propaganda Department and director of the Municipal Information Office. The WEN WEI PO delegation, composed of Director Wang Guohua, Editor-in-Chief Zeng Decheng, and General Manager Feng Zhongliang, left Shanghai for Hangzhou this afternoon. During their visit to Shanghai, they arranged an interview of Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee, and visited Shanghai's subway, bridge, and Bund reconstruction projects.
