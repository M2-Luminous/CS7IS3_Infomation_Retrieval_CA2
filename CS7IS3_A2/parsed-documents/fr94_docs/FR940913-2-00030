FR940913-2-00030 FR940913-2-00022 3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103&hyph;82 with the exception of sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures: (ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 to Appendix N as follows: 3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. The following paragraph is in lieu of the requirement specified in section 9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103&hyph;82. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-), unless: (1) the furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay, (t-), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within # 0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. (iii) With the exception of the modifications set forth above, Evcon Industries, Inc. shall comply in all respects with the test procedures specified in Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B. (3) The Waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of this Order until DOE prescribes final test procedures appropriate to the AGU, BGU, and BGD series gas furnaces manufactured by Evcon Industries, Inc. (4) This Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations, and documentary materials submitted by the petitioner. This Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the petition is incorrect. (5) Effective September 7, 1994, this Waiver supersedes the Interim Waiver granted the Evcon Industries, Inc. on July 9, 1994. 59 FR 35916, July 14, 1994 (Case No. F&hyph;072). Issued In Washington, DC, on September 7, 1994. Christine A. Ervin, Assistant Secretary, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
