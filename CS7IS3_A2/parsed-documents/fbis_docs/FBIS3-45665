According to information recently released by the State Statistics Bureau, even though the nation's total sown acreage in 1993 was smaller than that of a year before, the nation's total grain output in 1993 reached 456.4 billion kg, topping the previous record by 10.2 billion kg, and the average per-mu yield increased by eight kg. The substantial per-unit increase was unusual in recent years. Last year, to provide stronger leadership over agriculture and rural affairs, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council called a series of meetings to promulgate grain production and marketing policies, to promote grain sales, to examine development of township and town enterprises in central and western China, and to review the situation of cotton production and rural affairs. They also put forth many effective measures for encouraging grain and cotton production, reducing peasants' burdens, and making sure "IOU's" were not issued in lieu of cash payments for agricultural purchases. Following the central authorities' guidelines, all local governments strove to do everything possible to reduce peasants' burdens; to increase agricultural investment in terms of capital, supplies, and technical expertise; and to strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy. Their efforts as well as the good weather facilitated the bumper harvests and the sustained economic growth in rural areas. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, except for the output of cotton and sugar, which registered a decline, the output of all other agricultural goods and nonstaple foods continued to increase last year: The total output of oil-bearing crops reached 17.61 million tonnes, topping the previous record by 1.2 million tonnes; and people's greater demands for nonstaple foods were ensured with the increased supply of meat, dairy goods, eggs, and acquatic products, the total output of which were expected to top that of the year before by 5.5, 6.4, 7.0, and 10.0 percent respectively. As the pillar of the rural economy, township and town enterprises, in addition to maintaining their strong developmental momentum, registered growth in both output and returns last year. It is expected that the sales of the nation's township and town enterprises would reach 2.6 trillion [wan yi 8001 0310] yuan, the total profit taxes they paid reached 255 billion yuan, and the total output reached 2.9 trillion yuan last year, or a 40 percent growth from those of the year before in all three cases. What is even more eye-catching is the fact that the total value of export goods which township and town enterprises had delivered reached 190 billion yuan, topping that of the year before by 60 percent, or approximately 45 percent of the goods which the nation purchased for export. Owing to the boom in all rural sectors and broader channels for peasants' production, peasants' net per capita income last year was expected to reach 880 yuan. Allowing for inflation, the increase will be about two percent over that of the year before. The features of agricultural production in various parts of the country last year were greater efforts for restructuring the agricultural pattern to accommodate market needs, as well as the noticeable high output of products of good quality and high returns. Last year was the first year in which all sectors of the nation's agricultural production moved toward the market, and the hundreds of millions of peasants planned their production according to market needs instead of following the state's mandatory plans as before. In addition to expanding the acreage for economic crops, peasants in various parts of the country also readjusted the varieties of cereal crops, and expanded the acreage of crops which yielded higher returns and had promising market prospects. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, in 1993 the acreage of early nonglutinous rice of poor quality was downsized by more than 12 million mu and the acreage of rice of good quality was expanded to more than 100 million mu, or over 30 percent of the total rice acreage; the acreage of quality wheat was expanded to more than 16 million mu, or over three million mu more than the year before; and the acreage of soybean and other minor miscellaneous cereal crops was expanded by 20 percent, exceeding 34 million mu. Meanwhile, the breeding of well-known, special, quality, new, and rare products developed quickly. An official of the Ministry of Agriculture said that certain factors, which should not be ignored, are still obstructing China's agricultural and economic development. The most conspicuous problems are: Low returns from agricultural production, especially grain and cotton production, widening gap between yields from industrial and agricultural goods, and sluggish increase in peasants' income; incompatibility between the development and popularization of agricultural techniques on the one hand and the requirement for faster agricultural growth on the other; growing needs for jobs as a result of the annual increase of over 10 million able-bodied individuals in rural areas; and the state's imperfect macroeconomic regulation and control over agriculture, undeveloped rural systems of economic information, and the lack of a fast and efficient market guidance for agricultural production. To expedite development of the market economy in rural areas, the vast number of cadres and masses are now looking for solutions to these problems while deepening reform.
