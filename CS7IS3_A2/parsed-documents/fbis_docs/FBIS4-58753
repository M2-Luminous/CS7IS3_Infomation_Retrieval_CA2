Why does the government monopolize these media and prevent the opposition from using them? These media are the property of the Egyptian people. They established them and are paying for them. It is the right of all the political and social forces in the country to use these media to air their programs and expound their views without any discrimination. How can the government deprive the opposition of the right to use these media on the pretext that it possesses newspapers that express its views? The opposition papers, no matter how great their capabilities may be, are only a small fraction of the government-owned press. If we add to this the fact that the government also owns seven radio stations and seven television channels that transmit day and night, we realize the enormous monopoly that the government has on the media and can discover easily the major things that are paralyzing political activity in Egypt and are weakening the parties' ability to appeal to the broad masses of the people. It is not true that the parties in Egypt are weak. What is true is that the ruling regime does not want strong parties and that it is devoting all its efforts to prevent these parties from reaching the people. The regime achieves this through its control of the major information media and the minds of millions through beamed programs and distorted news. We do not need proof about the extent of the daily propaganda and money used by the government media. It is sufficient to note that the Information Ministry's budget is considered the largest in the Third World. No one has exceeded us in this area except the regime of Kim Il-song, who spends a quarter of North Korea's budget on propaganda for itself and the celebration of his birthday. We are tired of repeating these facts. There is no other way but to find the means to enable the political forces to bring down this media wall and correct the defect that is affecting the freedom of expression and publication and shrinking the ability of the opposition to undertake effective political action. The first solution is for the government to give up its monopoly on the media and allocate equal time for all the political parties to air their programs and views. This is a basic right demanded by democracy and repeatedly advocated by the parties, but to no avail. The second solution is for the government to allow the parties and the political forces to establish radio and television stations at their expense. [passage omitted] If the government rejects the two solutions, the political opposition will have no alternative but to rent satellite television channels or transmission hours to air their programs, even if they have to transmit from outside the country. There are no technological barriers to prevent this. [passage omitted]
