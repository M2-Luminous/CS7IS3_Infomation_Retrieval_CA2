FR940126-2-00090 FR940126-2-00050 [Docket No. 50&hyph;413] Duke Power Co.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;35 issued to Duke Power Company (the licensee) for operation of the Catawba Nuclear Station, Unit 1, located in York County, South Carolina. The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.2.5.3 which currently requires the determination of the reactor coolant system (RCS) flow rate by precision heat balance measurement at least once per 18 months. The precision heat balance measurement is used to calculate RCS flow based on gross steam generator thermal output and measurements of RCS hot and cold leg temperatures. Once the RCS flow is determined by this method, the cold leg elbow tap flow coefficients are adjusted to reproduce the RCS flow indication determined by the calorimetrics. Recently, the precision heat balance has been adversely affected by the hot leg temperature streaming effect and has been the cause of unsubstantiated RCS flow measurement decreases. Changes in the calorimetrics result from changes in core exit temperature and/or flow distributions that can significantly affect the average T-hot as measured by the hot leg RTDs. Elbow tap delta-Ps and analytical prediction of flow do not confirm the RCS flow rates determined by the periodic calorimetrics. It is proposed that the current requirements of TS 4.2.5.3 be changed to require that the RCS flow rate be determined by measurements at least once per 18 months. By replacing the phrase ``precision heat balance measurement'' with ``measurement,'' this will allow RCS flow determination by elbow tap delta-P measurement. The licensee states that the elbow tap delta-P method of flow determination was initially used at McGuire Nuclear Station and was dropped in favor of a precision calorimetric each cycle. At the time, November 1982, McGuire was having difficulty meeting the TS flow limit and the precision calorimetric was considered more accurate and allowed substantial margin gain. With the advent of more severe temperature and flow gradients in the hot legs, the precision calorimetrics were affected and resulted in nonphysical indicated flow decreases in the RCS. The elbow tap delta-P indications will provide an indication of flow which is not dependent on future changes in hot leg temperature measurement and, therefore, will provide an improvement in flow surveillance accuracy. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: (1) This amendment will not significantly increase the probability or consequence of any accident previously evaluated. No component modification, system realignment, or change in operating procedure will occur which could affect the probability of any accident or transient. The change in method of flow measurement will not change the probability of actuation of any Engineered Safeguard Feature or other device. The actual flow rate will not change. The consequences of previously-analyzed accidents will not change as a result of the new method of flow measurement. (2) This amendment will not create the possibility of any new or different accidents not previously evaluated. No component modification or system realignment will occur which could create the possibility of a new event not previously considered. The elbow taps are already in place, and are used to monitor flow for the Reactor Protection System. They will not initiate any new events. (3) This amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As described in [the licensee's application], the change in method of RCS flow measurement will provide a more accurate indication of the flow. The actual flow rate will not be affected. The revised setpoints for low reactor coolant flow are driven by changes to statistical allowances and do not represent substantive, or less conservative, changes. There is no significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
