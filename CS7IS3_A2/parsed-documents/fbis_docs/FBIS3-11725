Details of executive branch activities, ministry by ministry, were delivered to the legislators today; that document forms part of this message. It is with great satisfaction that I once again confirm the full enforcement of the Constitution and the state of law, as well as the full enjoyment and exercise of the people's rights. This is the fourth and last time during this administration that the executive branch appears before legislators, who are the direct representatives of the people's sovereignty. This message has a special significance because, although this administration has almost one more year in power, our institutional rules do not establish a further appearance before the legislative branch, apart from that in March of each year. We reaffirm here what has been said many times: The government administration is a five-year term and although national elections are held during the fifth year, we hope it will also be a year of important achievements to show, among other things, that the health and strength of the democratic system not only relies on electoral events, but in the effective exercise of the constitutional rights of government in the search for solutions to national problems. Honorable legislators: We believe it is necessary to deliver on this occasion -- the last established by the Constitution -- a balance of the government administration to date so that the people will understand what has been done over the year and learn about the real operation of the political system which they authorized through their votes. Before getting down to details, it is necessary to recall the conditions under which government actions have been developed during this period. Prior to the elections, we who were elected to hold government functions through the votes of our fellow countrymen prepared a clearly defined line of action, both the objectives and the means to implement them. We believe it is very important to recall this point because we believe the people need a clear understanding of why government action is required to strengthen the democratic system. Honorable legislators, we were clear in our government proposal and we have tried to be consistent in fulfilling our promises. The relationship among the forces that emerged from the elections should also be recalled. The results approved by the Electoral Court determined that within Congress no single party had the majority. This was known beforehand, it came as no surprise due to the relatively equal strength of the political forces. Being aware of this situation, we emphasized before and after the elections the need to reach political agreement to allow operational congressional majorities in order to have an effective government administration. It is known that our country chose the law as the main government instrument. Our registries have about 17,000 laws. The most important issues, as well as those of lesser importance, have been resolved through the approval of legal rules, therefore their reform require decisions of equal juridical level. This is why the congressional majority is extremely important for us because while the executive branch is exclusively responsible for promulgating decrees, this is not as significant as in other countries. This situation justifies the attempt to organize a political coalition, except in the case of a party that wants to obtain an absolute majority in both houses. Large sectors of society seek to amend the Constitution in an attempt to facilitate or even force political parties to achieve solutions by consensus and thus make political action more fluent and efficient. The current Constitution does not forbid this, given that an agreement among parties or party sectors is enough to approve far-reaching laws. This is what we sought at the beginning of this administration, but we did not obtain the results we expected. Perhaps future governments should ask why -- and the answer probably is not in the Constitution -- we need to adopt congressional coalitions as a political practice. This is envisaged in our Constitution and leads to the formation of congressional blocs which in turn create relative participation in the cabinet. We thought such coalitions would be even more feasible in light of the coincidences over the diagnosis and government solutions which the large political parties announced. Unfortunately this was not the case. This is the reason behind the delay in approving some laws designed to bring about changes and the rejection of others. Relations between the executive and legislative branches developed within the framework of institutional normalcy and mutual respect which, notwithstanding the harshness we use when exerting our freedom of opinion, constitute a national characteristic. During this congressional term the executive branch has sent 414 draft bills to Congress. As stated before, not all bills were equally important. Their quantity does not thus allow us to measure the degree of efficiency of our relations. During this speech I will mention the ones I consider most important. Congress has exerted its constitutional wisdom as comptroller -- as established in Articles 118 and 119 of the Constitution. Congress requested many reports and summoned ministers on 17 occasions. The number of times executive branch officials were called to participate in congressional committee sessions increased considerably, almost to weekly summons, which prompted an intense relationship between the two branches and allowed congressmen to become fully acquainted with the opinion of the executive branch in many fields. The executive branch exerted its right to veto 11 times, thus using the last resort of its institutional relationship with Congress. Of the 11 vetoes, six were withdrawn to solve differences of criteria on the matters involved. We must point out the occasions on which the executive and legislative branches agreed on a subject allowed the approval of important and probably beneficial and necessary laws to attain national objectives. Among these we can mention the approval of the Treaty of Asuncion [creating the Common Market of the South, Mercosur]; the reform of the port system; the much needed fiscal adjustment; the public employees law; the creation of investment banks; the relative deregulation of the insurance market; the public enterprises law, which was later partially annulled through a plebiscite; the new financial intermediation law; and the creation of the Ministry of Housing, Territorial Order, and Environment, among others. Since the beginning, the executive branch has established economic and social objectives whose partial or total accomplishment must be explained during this speech. I will now expand on our goals and achievements in the economic field. The executive branch set for itself the goal of creating -- as much as a government can -- a framework of conditions permitting and favoring stability and sustained growth within the economy. For this it was necessary to face great difficulties, some of them long entrenched. We had to face economic stagnation, low investment levels, and a protracted high inflation rate that threatened to run out of control. Our economy was still very closed and bore the burden of a large foreign debt and a costly and inefficient state apparatus, the financing of which had generated a strong fiscal deficit and negatively affected the public financial system. It was necessary to attack many problems simultaneously and in some cases urgently. This administration decided to face our fiscal deficit problem with determination. We are convinced that balanced public accounts are indispensable for economic stability and essential for achieving sustained growth. When we assumed power on 1 March 1990, our public accounts showed a deficit of 8.7 percent of the GDP. This represented a 6.7 percent deficit existing in December 1989 plus an additional 2 percent that resulted from the constitutional reform on pensions adjustment. With the help of the fiscal adjustment law, mentioned above, the government reduced that deficit to 1 percent of the GDP. Here we must note the rigidity of some budget items. The contribution of the General Revenue to the social security system clearly stands out. This assistance totalled $19.4 million in 1990, $96.8 million in 1991, $171.2 million in 1992, and $282 million in 1993. Just to mention these figures shows the unpostponable need to radically modify the national social security system, not only to strengthen it, but also to see that the burden is not so heavy on workers, the national productive apparatus, and the Treasury. If this were the case we could liberate resources to invest in other programs which would undoubtedly benefit the entire community. The balance of public accounts, as well as the implementation of reliable and appropriate monetary and foreign exchange policies have contributed to a gradual drop in inflation, which is a scourge that affects our entire society but which hurts particularly those without fixed incomes. At the start of this administration inflation was moving upward, with a hyperinflation trend. Following the implementation of some difficult measures inflation began to slow down and then to drop. Today, and without feeling self-satisfied, we can point out that inflation has dropped below an annual rate of 50 percent. In 1990 it was 129 percent. Our economic stabilization was accompanied by a deepening of the economic opening that had been implemented during previous years, seeking a more efficient allocation of resources. This consisted of simultaneously implementing a double opening process: regional integration within the Mercosur process and unilateral global opening through a gradual reduction of tariffs and custom barriers. It is important to note that these measures were announced ahead of time so as to create confidence among economic agents at the time of making decisions. This economic opening, together with the stabilization process, has favored investments and growth, a process of productive reconversion, and a general modernization of the country. One indication of these factors is that productivity has increased. The importation of capital goods, which was encouraged by the government through tariff and tax reductions, doubled between 1989 and 1993 -- rising from $156 million in 1989 to nearly $350 million in 1993. Our entire transport system has been renovated, including buses, trucks, and automobiles. The importation of machinery and equipment rose from $138 million in 1989 to nearly $300 million in 1993. This modernization process also affected other areas. The use of computers and telecommunications equipment increased. Even in our homes there was a process of renewal and equipping with durable goods that is unprecedented in our recent history. The importation of durable consumer goods went from $78 million in 1989 to over $250 million in 1993. The balance of trade, which was negative due to this import boom, and the negative effects of the low prices of some of our national primary export did not hide a continuous increase in nontraditional exports, which together grew by 20.5 [not further specified] between 1989 and 1993, despite a modest increase in 1993. The balance of payment is favorable and our external front, which is in line with the other macroeconomic variables, registers very positive indexes. We are talking about a positive balance in our balance of payments as a result of the entry of capital and tourism, which -- duly stimulated -- continues to grow. We must also refer to what our country owes and what it used to owe. Our net public debt during this past term dropped considerably. It must be recalled that in 1989 it represented 28.2 percent of the GDP. By the end of 1993 it had dropped to 13.9 percent as result of refinancing, the increase in our international reserves, and the drop in demand for funds by public organs thanks to their streamlining. Net international banking system reserves -- including the Central Bank, the Bank of the Republic, and private banks -- amount to $2.962 billion. This is well up on the $1.768 billion registered at the end of 1989. The net foreign reserves at the Central Bank are now balanced, compared with a $915 million deficit found in February 1990. Financial streamlining, stabilization, economic opening, investment promotion, and all the objectives to encourage economic growth -- which are indispensable for our society and transformation -- require the transformation of the state. Under the heading of state reform, this administration promised to substantially modify that ancient institution. This field can be subdivided: it can either be changed either through a law or through an executive branch decree. The choice determines a different degree of importance within national life. In the field of state participation, since the beginning of the century state industrial and commercial activities have been organized under their own clear, unique, profile, because that is how those who governed the country understood things. It is wrong to now criticize solutions which past governors applied as necessary and beneficial for the common good. It must nonetheless be said that despite the solutions implemented in the past, most political forces recognize this situation is a problem that must be solved. Soon after the beginning of my mandate, this administration sent a draft bill to Congress attempting to coordinate practically all public activities by proposing a deep transformation. It was fully analyzed by Congress, which even sought outside opinions and counseling on different aspects. The first result of the work of Congress was the separation of one of the aspects the law wanted to reform: port activities. Congress turned it into a completely different entity. The central theme was approved by Congress and became part of the Public Enterprises Law. The draft bill established in one of its chapters gives general norms for all public enterprises, introducing the gradual changes in them. Another chapter refers to other specific subjects like the public telecommunications company, the airline, and the fishing enterprise. The public debate before and after the approval of the law resulted in a plebiscite as a definite solution to the problem. This initiative, by will of the people was centered on partial aspects of the law which were abrogated by the end of 1992 by decision of the people. Where validity was maintained, given that the subjects were not included in the plebiscite, the executive branch proceeded to liquidate the ILPE [State Seal and Fishing Industry] and to implement a mechanism to draw private capital into PLUNA [Uruguayan National Airlines]. The executive branch suggested that the funds raised from the implementation of the mentioned law should be invested in health, education, housing, or the capitalization of the Social Security Bank. This was done and the funds raised from the liquidation of ILPE -- which were small in face of the needs of the country -- were invested in education, implementing a real transformation in state patrimony. National assets were reassigned to more productive social objectives. The Port System Reform Law passed by Congress and which was not subjected to the plebiscite, is currently fully enforced and the results of its application are evidently satisfactory. It must be pointed out that an important activity like the exploitation of our ports, has rendered the following results: -- Productivity in cargo handling increased according -- based on the time the cargo spends on the dock -- by 300 percent for cargo, 200 percent for bulk cargo, and 88 percent for containers; -- The average time a ship remains in the port of Montevideo has dropped from 12 hours in the roadstead to 0 hours [as published], and the time they remain in port has dropped from 78 hours to 34 hours; -- The volume of cargo moved in the Port of Montevideo in relation to the number of ANP [National Ports Administration] workers rose from 360 metric tons "per head" in 1990 to 1,100 metric tons in 1993; -- Port tariffs dropped 26 percent on imports, 33 percent on transshipment and traffic, and 10 percent on exports; -- The number of ANP employees dropped from 4,400 to 2,400; -- The total cost of stopping in Montevideo is 50 percent less for shipowners than any other nearby port; -- The time ships remained docked has dropped by 40 percent; -- The traffic of ships continues to increase by 2.5 percent per year: the number of containers has increased by 12 percent. These details reveal the benefits of a reform like this for the entire community. Its prospects are even more promising if one considers there are more than 40 authorized trading enterprises [empresas de prestacion de servicios de mercaderia] in Montevideo and ports in the interior, most of which entail national capital. We have thus achieved the diversification of the market and encouraged national enterprises to participate. The reduction of port employees through incentives and the natural reduction process was carried out without hardship to the workers involved. Another significant chapter in this state reform was the approval of the law that eliminated insurance company monopolies. This law broadens the consumers' alternatives for a service as important as insurance. It will be fully in force by next May, according to Decree No. 530/93 The post of insurance superintendent will be created soon. It will handle this important activity of modern times. But the impact of state activities on daily developments does not end with the great productive fields. Many times this impact is also felt in regulations and bureaucratic procedures that hinder and obstruct the activities of private individuals or enterprises. To free citizens of useless regulations and rules, the executive branch is creating the Plan to Deregulate Foreign Trade and Investments [Plan de Desregulacion del Comercio Exterior y las Inversiones] (Plades) and the Pronade [National Debureaucratization Program]. Without going into details, it should be pointed out that by eliminating superfluous red tape, useless forms, unnecessary signatures, and purposeless sworn statements, Plades and Pronade -- whose implementation has demanded a minimum investment -- will save thousands of dollars, without mentioning the saving in time and energy. We also mention the great changes in the state purchasing system as well as the changes in administrative procedures through Decree No. 500, which was approved in December 1991. There is still a lot to be done but there are many successful examples. A more efficient and cheaper port is a good example. An efficient ground service at Carrasco airport is another good example. We can also mention the importance of the elimination of inefficient activities such El Espinillar, ILPE, the National Printing Shop, and the personnel cuts in all public enterprises. The results can be calculated in many ways. Everyone is aware of the impact of tariffs on our economy. It should be pointed out that between 1989 and 1993 the price of diesel fuel has dropped in real terms by 44.3 percent, fuel oil by 36 percent, and electricity by 17.2 percent. In the case of phone tariffs, the real reduction averages 40 percent. There is still a lot to be done in the state reform field and all political parties are aware of this. Messrs. legislators: The results of the measures taken in the economic field are numerous, yet they represent a single result. In last year's message I pointed out that the government did not have enough power to drive society towards certain purposes; but it did and does have the power to create the necessary conditions for economic agents to grow. We should all feel proud, without running the risk of being complacent, that the country has confronted the great difficulties and the deep-rooted changes a greater commercial opening demands, not only dodging the threat of economic recession like that currently affecting many countries, but resuming the path of growth. Our output grew by almost 1 percent in 1990; by 2.9 percent in 1991; and by 7.4 percent in 1992. We estimate the percentage duly adjusted for last year amounts to 2.5 percent. The same goes for investments: They grew by 22.3 percent in 1991; by 9.9 percent in 1992, and by about 20 percent in 1993. This tendency, according to the behavior of some indicators, continues. Unemployment indicators also show a positive tendency with historically low levels. Real salaries and family incomes have also increased. Salaries in the private sector grew, in real terms, by 3.3 percent last year, while public salaries grew almost by 8 percent. The real family income grew in Montevideo: If it stood at 100 points in 1989 it reached 115.2 points in 1993.
