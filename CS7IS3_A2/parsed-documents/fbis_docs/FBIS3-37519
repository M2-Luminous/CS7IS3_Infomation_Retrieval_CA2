"I will also seek to make the Crimea an open republic that will not secede from anyone. I am a man of well-considered views, and I think that politics must serve the people rather than making things difficult for them," Saburov said. Under Ukrainian legislation, Saburov cannot be appointed to a state post because he is a Russian citizen. Answering a question from the UNIAN correspondent about his possibly obtaining Ukrainian citizenship, the Crimea's future deputy prime minister said he had not seen any relevant documents that would make it enforceable. This, in his words, is up to Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov, who proposed that he should form and lead the republican government. "I accepted his proposal, so the Crimean president--as a lawyer--must put it into practice. Of course, one can recall similar precedents in Estonia and Armenia where other states' citizens head government structures," Saburov noted. The wish of those concerned with their country, in his view, is to attract professionals to manage the economy. On the subject of the Crimea's purely economic problems--in particular, introducing the parallel use of the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian karbovanets on the Crimean peninsula and the possible self-financing of this autonomous republic--Saburov added: "Telling representatives of the Russian mass media about agreeing with Kiev on the issue of the Crimea's `rublization', I quoted Yuriy Meshkov as saying this on his visit to Moscow. This step would be beneficial both to the Crimea and Ukraine. As for self-financing of the autonomy, this question is still to be studied. Everything depends on the taxation basis and budgetary regulation."
