The weeklies TEMPO, EDITOR and DETIK were banned after running articles sharply critical of a close associate of Suharto. Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation chairman Adnan Buyung Nasution said, "I would say (US) President Bill Clinton should say something and drop his plans to come to Indonesia" in November for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meet. Saying he was "very angry" and calling the action an "abuse of power" he also said Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating should call off his visit next week. Keating is due to arrive for the biggest Australian promotion ever in Jakarta called "Australia Today." "I hope he (Keating) also understands the feelings of the people here and announces that he will not come to Indonesia," he said. Political Sciences professor Arief Budiman said he hoped that Indonesia's main creditors would let Jakarta know how they felt. "I hope there will be an intervention from abroad," he told AFP. The Consultative Group on Indonesia, chaired by the World Bank, is due to hold its annual meeting on financial aid to Indonesia July 7-8 in Paris. By far the largest donation comes from Japan, followed by France and the United States.
