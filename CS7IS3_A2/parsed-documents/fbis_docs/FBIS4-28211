Major General Orlando Soriano, chief of southern military forces, said the victims included Father Cirilo Nacorda, his driver, and 13 male schoolteachers, who were part of a group kidnapped earlier Wednesday in Basilan island. Their bullet-riddled bodies were fetched by a military truck from where they were slain and brought to funeral parlors in Basilan's capital Isabela, 850 kilometres (531 miles) south of Manila as night fell. "This is a very inhuman act. They killed them like pigs," Soriano told AFP, saying the victims were hogtied before they were lined up and gunned down. He said he had asked Basilan provincial governor Gerry Salapuddin "to do something about this" and help "get the perpetrators in a few days." In Manila, President Fidel Ramos issued an order to military commanders to "launch an all-out offensive" against the killers. But he also emphasized that the safe recovery of the remaining teachers still being held, was to "be considered paramount," a palace statement said. The palace also said that "the civilian population should be safeguarded." Soriano last week ordered an offensive against the Abu Sayyaf, an Islamic fundamentalist group blamed for a spate of anti-Christian bombings and ransom kidnappings, and originally based in Basilan. At least 30 Abu Sayyaf men were killed in the assault on their stronghold in Jolo island southeast of Basilan. Their main camp fell to the military Monday in one of the military's biggest offensives this year. Soriano said said the kidnapping and execution of the captives could be in retaliation for the Jolo attack since the abductors are believed to be allies of the Abu Sayyaf group. It could also have been aimed to divert the army's attention from the Jolo offensive, he added. Soriano said the Moslem gunmen flagged down a convoy of vehicles en route to Maluso town near Isabela early Wednesday and seized 59 persons. Thirty-seven were released and one escaped, leaving 21 in their hands. The gunmen separated 15 male hostages, tied their hands, lined them up and opened fire. The fate of the six female hostages was not yet known. Nacorda is parish priest of Matarling town in Basilan and a member of the Claretian religious order. His predecessor, Spanish priest Father Bernardo Blanco, kidnapped for ransom by the Abu Sayyaf last year but escaped. Soriano said two battalions of marines have been deployed to cordon off the massacre site, but said there will be no full-scale operation immediately because this might endanger the lives of the remaining hostages. Meanwhile, a woman was killed and 28 people were injured in a bomb explosion Wednesday night in General Santos city west of Basilan and Jolo in the latest wave of violence in the region. Police told AFP by telephone the bomb, believed to be a home-made device, exploded outside a department store, destroying the facade, killing one woman and injuring at least 28 people although more may have been hurt. There were no immediate suspects in the bombing. The Abu Sayyaf is an extremist offshoot of the Moro National Liberation Front, which waged a bloody war for Moslem independence in the 1970s but is now negotiating for political autonomy with the Ramos government.
