Moscow has allocated the republic credit worth 120 billion rubles [R]. The objective is to get the republic's economy, brought to its knees by civil war, up and running and to avert the real threat of famine. During recent months, and after Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan switched to their own currencies, Tajikistan has been buried in an avalanche of Soviet money. By hook or by crook, this money worked its way into the Pamirs where it was used to buy cars, houses, carpets, and valuable items. The rapid increase in inflation cast practically the entire republic beyond the pale of poverty. Especially as the average wage here used not to exceed R20,000. However, the Russian ruble does not promise Tajikistan an immediate solution to all its problems. The government has taken extremely unpopular measures in order to ensure that the credit it has received will last six months, whereupon Dushanbe will probably switch to its own national currency anyway. And so the old money cannot be exchanged for Russian money. Only half of January's pay will be issued in Russian money; the rest will be paid into special accounts. The population can place old money on deposit, but it is unclear when this will be unfrozen. The confiscatory nature of the money reform is also emphasized by the fact that a ceiling of R64,000 has been imposed on wages. This is motivated by the fear that "spare" money will flood into Russia, washing away goods and whipping up inflation -- which was what happened before. The introduction of the ruble, unfortunately, has hit "our people" hardest -- those looking to resettle in Russia. Under a government directive, only R20,000 per family member may now be taken out of the republic. But what is to be done with the money that was paid out for apartments, houses, dachas, cars, and other property?
