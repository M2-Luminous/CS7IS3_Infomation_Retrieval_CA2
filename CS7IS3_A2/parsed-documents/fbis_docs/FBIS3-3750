During the 13-day session, deputies from various parts of the country spoke freely in discussing state affairs, they offered advice and made suggestions on reform, and they exercised their sacred rights. When the deputies left the Great Hall of the People, what were they thinking about? These reporters interviewed more than 10 deputies at the hall's eastern exit. "Realism Is the Biggest Characteristic of This Session; We Will Take the Realistic Spirit to Our Work" Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju told these reporters: This NPC session was a success, and deputies fully expressed their views while discussing state affairs. Their abilities in participating in and discussing government affairs were greatly improved. I feel the biggest characteristic of this session was realism. When we return to our posts, we will take this realistic spirit to our work. Shanghai is small in area. We must take a conscientious and realistic approach and try in every possible way to improve our efficiency. Pudong should complete its basic development tasks two years ahead of schedule and then continue to accelerate its development in a down-to-earth manner. We should build more new- and high-technology projects in Pudong. What will Guangdong, as the country's comprehensive experimental area in reform and opening up, do next? Deputy Zhu Senlin, governor of Guangdong Province, said: We are fully confident of the future. At the same time, we also clearly see contradictions and problems ahead, and we should keep a clear head and foster a sense of being prepared for hardships. Upon return to Guangdong, we will carefully organize people to implement reform measures on the one hand and vigorously arouse and encourage the masses to undertake construction with one heart and one mind on the other. We will work hard in a down-to-earth way and strive to basically build the framework of the socialist market economic structure in five years. "Opportunity Shows No Favoritism to Anyone, and the Key Is To Seize It" Liaoning Governor Yue Qifeng said: Liaoning is the oldest industrial base built by the state during the planned economy period, and it is also the last to get off the orbit of planned economy. Reforms are being carried out across the country in an all-round way this year, and market forces are playing an increasingly important role. This has created a golden opportunity for Liaoning. Liaoning people should firmly seize this opportunity and vigorously start undertakings. We should adapt ourselves as soon as possible to the needs of the socialist market economy in concept, management, and operation. While reforming or transforming large and medium state-owned enterprises, we should accelerate the development of new- and high-technology industries; village and town enterprises; individual and private enterprises; neighborhood collective enterprises; tertiary industries; and high-yield, high- efficiency, and high-quality agriculture and strive to revitalize Liaoning as an industrial base. Qinghai Governor Tian Chengping from the vast northwest of the country said: This NPC session paid close attention to economic development in the central west of the country. This year, the state will implement a plan for helping people free themselves from poverty. Society is concerned about and supports our less developed areas. More importantly, the market economy has provided us with favorable conditions for "exploiting our natural resources, freeing ourselves from poverty, and becoming prosperous." It can be said that we in the central west of the country have even a greater opportunity for development. The key to seizing this opportunity lies in our acting according to reality, deepening reform, and working hard to start enterprises, in addition to assistance from the state. "Good Policies and Measures Should Be Implemented to the Letter" Deputy Li Yuxiang, of the Yi nationality from Sichuan, said: Before liberation, I begged for food when I was seven years old. I have been excited by attending the NPC session in Beijing as a deputy. Both the general secretary and premier stressed agriculture. This is very good for us farmers. I hope that the state will substantially increase investment in agriculture. After I return to Sichuan, I will mobilize people to carry out capital construction on farmland. Our village will build three ponds to store water this year. Meanwhile, we will plant trees in a big way for the purpose of water and soil conservation. As a NPC deputy, I must accomplish something. Deputy Feng Jie, Zhangjiapu village committee director of Wangjiadian Township in Huangzhou city, Hubei Province, said: I felt warmed while attending the 13-day NPC session. The central authorities said every possible effort would be made to increase farmers' incomes this year, which really warmed our hearts. The price scissors between industrial and agricultural products have become bigger and bigger these years. If this goes on, who still wants to do farming. Then, how can rice sacks be filled? This time, the state decided to readjust the prices of grain, chemical fertilizers, diesel oil for agricultural use, and pesticides, which is good news to us. I just hope that the government will implement its agricultural policy to the letter.
