Preparations started in October 1993, and the chain went into trial operation last February in this capital city of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Preparations are underway to move the headquarters of the chain from Yinchuan to Beijing. Meanwhile, the Beijing Asian and Pacific Auto Market Town is expected to open May 26. The first meeting of members of the chain is to be held in June. Guo Jiyuan, director of the Preparatory Committee for the auto market chain, said that its establishment is aimed at building an auto sales network nationwide. Guo said efforts will be made to build wholesale centers in major auto manufacturing and distributing areas, and to bring along a retail sales network in the surrounding areas. So far, more than 1,000 auto manufacturers, salesmen and customers have showed their willingness to join the market chain, and 110 have already signed up. With the improvement of the people's living standards there has been a growing demand for automobiles in China. Statistics show that China's automobile market is as large as one million units a year, with 80 percent domestically produced and 20 percent imported. Annual sales of autos will reach two million by the year 2000, Guo predicted. In the beginning of this year the Ministry of Machine Industry announced 1994's plan for the auto industry, saying 1.3 million automobiles will be produced. The auto industry, as one of the backbone industries in China, has registered high growth in recent years. In 1993 China produced 1.18 million automobiles, an increase of 20 percent over 1992.
