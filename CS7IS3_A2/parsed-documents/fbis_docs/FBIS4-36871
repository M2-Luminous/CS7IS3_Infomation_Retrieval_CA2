Despite his criticism of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and the basic agreement with Israel concluded in September, 'Abd-al- Shafi advocates the success of autonomy for reasons of state. [Szyszkowitz] How paradoxical: The Palestinians are given an autonomous territory and are not even able to pay the salaries of their police. Who is responsible for this disorder? ['Abd-al-Shafi] I cannot defend the behavior of the Palestinians. 'Arafat has only now nominated the provisional government! He should have planned much further ahead, which would have been possible. Another thing is the money, which cannot be distributed because there are no structures. The Palestinians themselves are to blame for this chaos. Of course, the Israelis are not exactly making things easier for us. We cannot move freely, the autonomous territories are closed off. And we can, of course, not accept that Israel continues to try to keep Jerusalem out of the debate. [Szyszkowitz] From the very beginning you have been against the agreement. Does this not harm the national cause? ['Abd-al-Shafi] This autonomy agreement is bad. The Israelis still control everything. In Gaza they still keep almost 40 percent of the territory occupied. Yet, despite the shortcomings of the agreements, things are starting to change. This is why I am appealing to all Palestinians to cooperate in implementing the autonomy agreement as long as we do not forget to point to the problems. [Szyszkowitz] What deficiencies can you spot in 'Arafat's leadership style? ['Abd-al-Shafi] There is still not enough democracy. Our people are tired of permanently getting orders from above. 'Arafat must strengthen and enhance the democratic structures. Officials should not be nominated only on the basis of personal considerations. [Szyszkowitz] Still, the list of nominated ministers includes the longest-serving PLO leaders: men such as Faysal al-Husayni from East Jerusalem or Economics Minister Abu Ala, who worked out the agreement with Israel in Oslo. ['Abd-al-Shafi] Oh well, there are many more excellent people. It is not so much a question of whether these people come from the inner circle or from the outside, but whether they are qualified for their job. With all respect for the problems within the Fatah movement, the building of institutions requires competence and not personal loyalties. [Szyszkowitz] The preparations for the first elections of the autonomy government are dragging on somewhat. Is this 'Arafat's intention? ['Abd-al-Shafi] First of all, we would need a neutral commission to prepare these elections. And then the polls have to be held as soon as possible. Everything we can do has to be done soon, there is no reason to put things off. [Szyszkowitz] So what is the reason that all these preparations have not been made? Is it only because 'Arafat is not sufficiently organized? ['Abd-al-Shafi] To put it bluntly: 'Arafat has all the strings in his hand and does not want to let loose a single one. At any rate we must insist in close monitoring of the election, like in South Africa. We need all guarantees because we cannot afford to fail. [Szyszkowitz] It looks as if even 'Arafat's severest critics were slowly getting ready to make a truce. Even parts of the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] leadership have recently made relatively liberal statements. ['Abd-al-Shafi] I welcome this change by Hamas, of course. Nevertheless, I do not think that it will participate in the election to the autonomy government, but I would regard it as good if Hamas were to found a political party. The Islamists will never win a majority here, anyway. [Szyszkowitz] Not even if the Palestinians here in Gaza were to lose faith in the current leadership? ['Abd-al-Shafi] At the moment, we first have to establish the structures. Then we will see. However, we all must try hard to act quickly. After all, the position of the Israelis is clear: They will go ahead with extending autonomy to the West Bank only if everything works here. This is why any delays that are our fault are excellent excuses for the Israelis. That way they can say: You see, they cannot even establish peace in Gaza. This is why it is so important for the Palestinians to concentrate all forces on implementing this agreement. I only hope that the PLO has understood that, too.
