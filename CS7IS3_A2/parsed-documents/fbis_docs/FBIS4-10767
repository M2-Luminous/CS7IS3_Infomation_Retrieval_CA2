This is the preliminary estimate of the cost of the campaign this year -- the first one in which the law will allow donations from companies and individuals. From the stamps on the letters to voters to opinion polls, shows, small jet expenses, and television programs, everything must be accounted for by the political parties and converted into electoral bonds that will be issued by the national Treasury. According to TSE [Superior Electoral Court] Director General Alysson Mitraut, without having received the official campaign budgets from the parties yet, the TSE has suggested that the Finance Ministry print 20 million electoral bonds with values in UFIR's [reference fiscal unit] and real cruzeiros ranging from the equivalent of $100 to $100,000. Despite the high value of the bond issuance, the members of Congress who approved the law last September admit that part of the campaign money will not be controlled by the TSE. The TSE cost estimate has shocked Finance Ministry experts. The proposal sent to Treasury Secretary Murilo Portugal coincides with an unofficial scale that circulates in Brasilia on the election costs. According to the scale, a deputy can be elected for approximately $500,000. A campaign for governor costs between $10 million and $15 million. And the election of the president of the Republic might cost something between $50 million and $100 million. At the end of the campaign, if the law is fully obeyed, the TSE will have identified the financing sources of each candidate. Without testing the law's efficiency, the TSE is certain of one thing: The expenses that will be officially declared will be much higher than those in 1989. For example, during the last presidential elections, the coalition that took former President Collor to power declared having spent $850,000 in the two election rounds -- nearly 100 times less than the average cost estimated for the presidential campaigns this year. [Workers Party presidential candidate Luiz Inacio] Lula [da Silva] said he has spent $365,000, which would only pay for three hours of television programs. "Everything used to be registered in a double accounting in the past," admitted Deputy Eraldo Tinoco (PFL-BA) [Liberal Front Party- Bahia], responsible for the financial guidance of the PFL candidates. "There was a lot of hypocrisy in the past," Senator Marco Maciel (PFL-PE) [Pernambuco] summarized. During the times of the CPI [Congressional Investigative Committee] on PC [Paulo Cesar Farias], Maciel suggested that campaigns be financed by the government like in Germany -- the only way, he says, to put an end to double accounting by companies, the diversion of funds from the national budget, or the reception of funds from the illegal numbers lottery. "We will be very careful with the campaign money," said former Mayor Pimenta da Veiga, one of the coordinators for Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy. PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] Secretary General Sergio Motta thinks Cardoso's campaign will cost something between $50 million and $70 million. "It is absurd to speak of hundreds of thousands of dollars," Motta said. The campaign committee of PT [Workers Party] candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva believes Lula should spend more than what he spent in 1989 but not spend very much. According to PT members, transportation expenditures will be the highest but this will be compensated for by the low cost of television programs because the law demands that they be filmed in studios. Electoral bonds are an innovation in Brazil. They were designed while the electoral laws were being amended, and their objective is to make transparent the relations between candidates and their financial agents. They operate as an electoral "currency," with receipts issued as in a legal financial operation. The existing law sets forth that they will be printed by the mint as bearer bonds, numbered and valued in reference fiscal units (UFIR). The law also sets forth that they will be issued for a total equivalent to the overall expenses estimated by the parties for each election, at all levels. Parties will have to operate with those bonds and will identify recipients -- the enterprises and individuals who make donations for the campaign, for example, this year, for the candidates for the presidency, state governorships, Senate, Chamber of Deputies, and legislative assemblies. Financial supporters are entitled to an income tax reduction. For their part, parties must keep a list of donors, identifying each delivered bond, for five years. It is expected that the bonds' creation will break the "underground" connection between candidates and entrepreneurs, especially contractors, avoiding in the future the repayment of investments made during the campaign in exchange for projects, favors, and budget amendments to satisfy the interest of electoral "donors." Supreme Electoral Tribunal President Sepulveda Pertence fears that despite the issuance of bonds, irregular donations to campaigns will continue. In fact, the electoral courts will have a very short time -- less than one month -- to analyze party accounts before the elected officials take over their posts.
