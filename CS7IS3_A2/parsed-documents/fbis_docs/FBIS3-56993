Otherwise the world will continue watching the tragedy unfold, said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin. In his exclusive interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent upon his return from Geneva on Saturday evening, where another round of talks between the sides involved in the Bosnian conflict had taken place, Churkin said that with every unsuccessful round it was becoming more difficult to hope for success of the talks on the Bosnia settlement. Churkin said that the last round was unsuccessful. He noted that it was at the previous round of talks in Brussels last December that another opportunity to achieve accord was missed. At that moment the international community lacked determination to bring the matter to a logical end, and now it is lacking even more. The deputy foreign minister believes that in essence, the participants of the talks are now going round in circles, that is to say that this time they did not touch upon the problems that appeared to be the main and final problems at the last round of talks. They discussed some other, completely different questions. For instance, if last time it seemed that the questions on the Muslim republic's access to the sea and the Sava river, that is to say, the questions connected with its life support system, were the first and most important obstacles for achieving the final settlement this time, these questions were not mentioned at all. New problems have appeared and one could have the impression that the previous fifth and sixth rounds of negotiations did not exist at all. Churkin said that this situation confirms the anxiety of the Russian side that if the clear position is not taken and if the sides are not encouraged to sign the agreement, disputes about the various aspects of this agreement may continue indefinitely. What worries me most of all, said Churkin, is that it looks like the world community, to say nothing of the participants of the talks, has lost its bearings, and that a certain confusion, bordering on panic, has emerged in respect of the idea that nothing can be achieved, and important but secondary issues are being brought to the forefront. He underlined that: It is my deep belief that without a political settlement the humanitarian issue, no matter how hard it is pursued, will continue to find itself in a tragic state because while the war continues -- when each side goes on thinking about a military victory -- it will not be possible to satisfy the humanitarian requirements of the population. At present, one has the situation, the deputy minister continued, where the political side of the matter has been somewhat forgotten and very important though still secondary humanitarian issues including even individual episodes of the general humanitarian situation are being brought to the forefront. Churkin said the Serb side, the Bosnian Serbs, had assured him, in particular, that there will be no problem with relieving the Canadian battalion by a Dutch unit in Srebrenica. He was also assured (by Dr. Karadzic and President Milosevic) that when the plan for monitoring the airport in Tuzla to ensure its non-military use is drawn up, the Serb side will consider it. This is a fundamentally different position, Churkin said. If, in the past the Serbs would simply refuse to consider the issue, this time they agreed. There are three landing strips in Tuzla and a comprehensive monitoring plan should be drawn up in order to fully guarantee that none of the strips is used for delivering military cargoes. In brief, he said, all these issues could be resolved but, if there is no political settlement, the world will watch a continuing tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As far as the question of air strikes in Bosnia are concerned, Churkin pointed to the corresponding UNSC [UN Security Council] resolutions that refer to the possibility of such actions within the framework of assistance to the UN peace-keeping forces in Bosnia- Herzegovina and assistance to the humanitarian measures of the world community. Speaking about the position of the Russian side on this question, it cannot be said that Russia is a priori, opposed to any air strikes, he went on. If a situation suddenly arises where the UN troops indeed become the target of a direct attack by any of the conflicting sides, Churkin said, explaining his personal view, then I would recommend (and I am sure that a political solution will be adopted) that this measure be supported. Or take another instance: a malicious act might be carried out and one of the sides refuses to allow humanitarian aid to reach the dying. In these cases, he stressed, the toughest measures may well be taken. But when there is talk of inflicting air strikes virtually straight away in order to help the operation to replace the battalions (the replacement is actually scheduled for mid-February, there is an accord on enabling this replacement in Srebrenica), then in Churkin's opinion, such proposals are aimed at diverting attention from the real problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is hard to imagine, he went on, how air strikes would help to open the airport in Tuzla or serve to carry out the replacement of the Canadian battalion with a Dutch one. It is entirely clear that if air strikes are inflicted in the Srebrenica area, there will be no replacement -- combat activity will continue and any sort of humanitarian aid will be absolutely out of the question. As for the dissatisfaction with Lord Owen's activities over a Bosnian settlement that certain circles and people have been voicing recently, Churkin believes that the replacement or resignation of one of the co-chairmen of the London international conference on a settlement in former Yugoslavia would now be a serious mistake. Lord Owen, Churkin said, is the only person who has been dealing with the issues regarding the settlement from the very start: He has concentrated all the threads of the negotiations in his hands and if he were now to be replaced, then: Those from any of the three sides in Bosnia who do not want an accord could simply take advantage of this circumstance in order to continue to deceive everyone, raise more and more fresh issues, or return to old ones and so on and so forth. Churkin recalled that Lord Owen at one time adopted a very tough stance -- an anti-Serbian one -- calling for air strikes against individual targets, and: Now, when this is no longer the case, we start hearing calls for Lord Owen to be replaced. The Russian Deputy Foreign Minister believes that it is now very difficult to find a worthy replacement for Lord Owen, and without losing the tempo of the talks process, simply impossible. This would, in effect, mean, he said, that the world community would be resigning itself to its own powerlessness and it would then be a question of a completely new long round of political efforts with obscure prospects for success. The next round, Churkin said in conclusion, has been arranged for 10 February in Geneva. That meeting has been set more modest tasks, and it will be attended by fewer participants. Representatives of the Bosnian sides [as received] will gather to discuss confidence measures, so it will be a meeting with limited goals.
