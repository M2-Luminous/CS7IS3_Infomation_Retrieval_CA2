In statements he made today, he said that the PLO asked that 110 PNC members be allowed to enter the self-rule areas but Israel agreed to allow only 83 members and refused to let the others enter these areas. Commenting on the report issued by the Israeli commission that investigated the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which laid the blame fully on the Jewish settler, Subayh said: There is nothing odd in having such a report that explains the massacre, which claimed the lives of more than 70 worshipers last Ramadan, as an individual act. He added that the Palestinian people is used to such reports and positions on massacres perpetrated by Israeli soldiers. Muhammad Subayh went on to say: Israeli soldiers and police should have been tried and the committee investigating the al-Ibrahimi Mosque should have recommended the expulsion of settlers from the Palestinian urban area and the disarmament of Jewish settlers. The Palestinian envoy stressed that security during the transitional period in the Palestinian self-rule areas following the agreements reached in Oslo and Cairo has become the responsibility of the Palestinian police. He noted that the Israeli Government is hesitant and not taking a firm stand against the extremist elements in the Israeli army.
