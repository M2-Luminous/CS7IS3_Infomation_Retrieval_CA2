DPR&hyph;42 and DPR&hyph;60 for the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, located in Goodhue County, Minnesota.

However, by letter dated July 5, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed changes. For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated July 13, 1992, and the licensee's letter dated July 5, 1994, which withdrew the application for license amendment.
