FR940603-2-00123 FR940603-2-00080 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34129 ; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;91&hyph;31] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Addition of Options Series at 21/2 Point Strike Price Intervals for Major Market Index Options May 27, 1994. On November 27, 1991, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to alter its strike price policy in order to introduce near-the-money 3 options series on the XMI at 21/2-point strike (exercise) price intervals. 4 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 The Amex amended its proposal to define ``near-the-money'' as a strike price within 10 points above or below the current value of the Major Market Index (``XMI'' or ``Index''). Thus, if the XMI is at 310, the proposal would allow the Exchange to list 21/2 point strikes between the range of 290 to 310. See Letter from Ellen T. Kander, Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Yvonne Fraticelli, Staff Attorney, Options Branch, Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated March 4, 1993 (``March 4, 1993 Letter''). 4 On December 8, 1992, the Amex amended its filing to include a memorandum from Charles H. Faurot, Amex, to Howard Baker, Amex, dated December 2, 1992, which discusses the ability of the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') and market information vendors to accommodate the additional strike prices provided for under the proposal (``OPRA Capacity Statement''). See Letter from Ellen Kander, Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Thomas Gira, Branch Chief, Options Regulation, Division, Commission, dated December 8, 1992. Notice of the proposal was published for comment and appeared in the Federal Register on January 15, 1993. 5 No Comments were received on the proposed rule change. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31710 (January 8, 1993), 58 FR 4720. In 1983, when the Exchange began trading index options, options series were introduced in 5-point strike price intervals for index values up to 200 and 10-point increments for index values above 200. Subsequently, the Exchange obtained Commission approval to list index options with 5-point strike price intervals when the value of the relevant index is above 200. 6 The Amex continues to follow this policy for all of the Exchange's index options with expirations up to one year; for longer-term index options, the Exchange may have strike price intervals as wide as 25 or 50 points. 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21644 (January 9, 1985), 50 FR 2360 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;84&hyph;31). The Amex proposes to amend its strike price policy to allow the Exchange to list near-the-money options on the XMI at 21/2-point strike price intervals. The Amex has found that the current policy of 5-point strike intervals frequently results in in-the-money options that are often ``too costly'' and out-of-the money options that yield too little premium to attract uncovered or covered writers. The Amex believes that the proposal to narrow strike price intervals by increasing the number of available near-the-money strike prices will enable customers to more finely tailor their options positions to achieve their intended investment objectives. In addition, the Amex believes that providing customers with greater opportunities and flexibility will further enhance the depth and liquidity of the Amex's index options markets. The Amex also believes, in connection with the reduction of the XMI to one-half its previous value, 7 that the addition of 21/2-point strike intervals for near-the-money options will satisfy requests by investors to maintain the pre-split ``Index-to-strike price ratio'' ( e.g., from a 640 Index value with 5-point strike price intervals to a 320 Index value with 21/2-point strike price intervals). 7 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29798 (October 8, 1991), 56 FR 51976 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;91&hyph;18). The Amex believes that the proposal will not result in a proliferation of strike prices since the 21/2-point intervals will only be added to surround the XMI's current Index value. For this purpose, 21/2 point strikes would only be added 10 points above or below the current Index value. 8 In addition, the Amex represents that listing near-the-money XMI options series at 21/2 point price intervals will not adversely impact the capacity of OPRA or market information vendors. In this regard, the Amex notes that the OPRA system was upgraded in early November 1992 to accommodate up to 300 messages per second (``MPS''). The Exchange believes that this capacity is more than sufficient to accommodate the requirements of all OPRA participants, including the proposed 21/2 point strike prices for the XMI, since the recent peaks in message traffic for all OPRA participants combined have been in the range of 100&hyph;125 MPS. In addition, the Amex believes that the additional options series necessitated by the proposed 21/2 point strike prices for the XMI will have no impact on the ability of vendors to receive and process data. 9 8 See March 4, 1993 Letter, supra note 3. 9 See OPRA Capacity Statement, supra note 4. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5). 10 Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed listing of 21/2 point strike price intervals for near-the-money XMI options will provide investors with more flexibility in the trading of XMI options, thereby protecting investors and furthering the public interest by allowing investors to establish XMI options positions that are better tailored to meet their investment objectives. 10 15 U.S.C. 78f(6)(5) (1982). The Commission also believes that the Amex's proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the Exchange's need to accommodate the needs of investors and the need to avoid the excessive proliferation of options series. Specifically, the Commission believes that by limiting the number of additional strikes to within 10 points above or below the current Index value, the Amex's proposal permits a fairly small absolute increase in the number of XMI strikes that may be outstanding at any one time. Further, the Commission notes that the proposal sets the maximum permissible number of additional 21/2 point strikes; the Amex retains discretion to list fewer strike prices than allowed.
