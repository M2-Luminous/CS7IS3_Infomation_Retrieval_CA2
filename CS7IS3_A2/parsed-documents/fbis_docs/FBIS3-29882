The Japanese also voiced concern about the depletion of fishing stocks and disputes over accidents between vessels from the two countries, Foreign Ministry officials said. Seoul and Tokyo sat down Tuesday and Wednesday for mid-level negotiations on renewing the self-regulation fishing agreement that expires at the end of this year. The two sides focused on South Korean vessels' illegal fishing activities despite governmental agreement on self-regulation, disputes and compensation from accidents, and formal mechanisms to protect marine resources. The talks' key point is whether the two countries should overhaul the 1965 basic fishing accord as demanded by Tokyo, or just institute supplementary measures as insisted by Seoul, according to the officials. South Korea established various regulations covering Japanese fishing in its waters in the 1965 agreement, while Japan virtually opened all its waters beyond 12 nautical miles. The action came at a time when South Korean fishing vessels were too small and too few to compete with the Japanese. In 1987 the two countries adopted self-regulation, limiting the number of vessels, fishing period and size of boats, but the Japanese Government continued to protest at illegal activities carried out by South Korean fishermen despite government regulation. Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa personally raised the issue at a summit with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam last November. Seoul and Tokyo will need seven to eight more rounds of talks to settle the pending issues and plan to meet again sometime in April.
