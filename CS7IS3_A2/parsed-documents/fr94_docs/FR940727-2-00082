FR940727-2-00082 FR940727-2-00045 9. Echo Bay Minerals Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;34&hyph;M] Echo Bay Minerals Company, P.O. Box 1658, Battle Mountain, Nevada 89820 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 56.6309(b) (fuel oil requirements for ANFO) to its McCoy/Cove Mine (I.D. No. 26&hyph;01925) located in Lander County, Nevada. The petitioner proposes to blend recycled, used petroleum-based oil from equipment operating at its mine with diesel fuel to create a blasting agent. The petitioner asserts that this oil would not contain any hazardous material listed in 40 CFR 261 and that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 10. Independent Aggregates [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;35&hyph;M] Independent Aggregates, P.O. Box 519, Inglis, Florida 34449 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 56.7055 (intersecting holes) to its I.A.C. Mine (I.D. No. 08&hyph;01035) located in Citrus County, Florida. The petitioner propose to load each hole as soon as it has been drilled, then move to the next hole, continue until the end of the shift, and then continue loading on subsequent shifts until the pattern is completed. Then, the round would be wired and shot as soon as possible. The petitioner states that returning to the collapsed holes to redrill would cause hazardous conditions. In addition, the petitioner states that the proposed alternate method would prevent a diminution of safety. Request for Comments Persons interested in these petitions may furnish written comments.
