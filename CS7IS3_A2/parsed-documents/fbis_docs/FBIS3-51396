Today's Straight Talk topic will be interesting. We always choose interesting topics, but there are times when we broach issues that truly worry the people. Today's topic will be one of those: The banking policy and how it can contribute to improved domestic finances. To broach this topic, I have invited JUVENTUD REBELDE reporters Osvaldo Rodriguez and Jose Alejandro Rodriguez. Are you brothers? [Osvaldo Rodriguez] We are brothers, we are brothers but we are not related. However, we do have the same patronymic and matronymic. Yes Juan Carlos, I do believe this is an interesting topic. The implementation of a single measures will not solve the domestic finance problems. Budget control, taxes, and banking policies, on their own, will not solve the problem. The problem will be solved by implementing a group of measures. These measures must be aimed at gathering the excess currency and maintaining a balance after this is done. It would be useless to gather the excess currency and face the same situation later. Financial stability is important from the banking viewpoint. [Roque Garcia] And that is what we want to talk about. First, let us think about something. Of the approximately 11 billion [currency not specified] in excess currency, half of that is in the banks. If much of what is still on the streets were in the bank, the problem would not be that big. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] We must find a solution to those problems. I believe that one of these problems is our current banking policy, or, if not implemented correctly, the banking policy we will have once the new measures are implemented. We must immobilize as much currency as possible. Money in the bank is immobilized money. Money that is immobilized does not circulate on the black market. Money that does not circulate on the black market is money that will not devaluate our currency. Therefore, I believe it would be logical to immobilize as much of that excess currency as possible. [Roque Garcia] Pepe [nickname for Jose], do you agree with this? [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Yes, I do. However, Juan Carlos, I believe that to solve this problem, to search for the different ways to solve it -- we must launch a frontal attack and hit them from every side -- we must first change the way the bank deals with the people. That is the most important thing. The bank must begin by encouraging the people to put their money in the bank. For example, interest rates. Something must be done about this. I also believe that we must study some of the measures that have been suggested. Some of the measures suggested are a bit too drastic. I have heard people say.... [Roque Garcia, interrupts] Measures proposed. [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Yes, proposed. [Roque Garcia] That is correct, that is correct. [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] I have people say: No, no, I can have a certain amount of money. I believe this must be handled in an economic manner. Everything has a bit of political lacing, but we must also remember that if we are promoting a savings policy, we cannot create measures that will discourage what we are trying to get the people to do, which is to save. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] What we must determine is who has the money. How they earned that money. [Roque Garcia] That is correct. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] How they got that much money and how they got to save that amount of money. [Roque Garcia] But that is not the bank's problem. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] No, it is not. It is what Pepe was talking about. We cannot change the cause to ensure a final objective. The bank's objective is to immobilize the money. What the police and investigation groups must do is find out where this person got all that money from. [Roque Garcia] The so-called hoarders, for example. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] The so-called hoarders. Here in Cuba we have many hoarders who earned their money in a very honest manner. Perhaps, but mistake were made, or there was excess profit, or there were state-made mistakes -- they made much money, but it was honestly earned. Therefore, we must differentiate in the way we handle these people, or these comrades. But it is not the bank's duty to do this. The man who made his money illegally does not put his money in the bank. That man is afraid of putting his money in the bank. [Roque Garcia] We are looking for coinciding points of view between what we are discussing here and what is being said on the streets. There were things broached during the first part of the program which I am not very clear on. What do you think, Jose Alejandro? [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] I was very surprised by a.... [Roque Garcia, interrupts] A term he used. [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] That is correct. I believe that many people must be thinking about this. He used two words: hoarders and honest. Some people may be thinking that these two words do not go hand in hand. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] What you say is true, and I believe it needs further explanation. We say that anyone who has a lot of money is a hoarder. There are many people in Cuba who have made a lot of money in an honest way: for example, the farmers. There are farmers who have hundreds of thousands of pesos and who earned this money honestly. Is there a more honest way of making money than by working the land? [Roque Garcia] I agree. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] There also are hundreds of craftsmen who have earned hundreds of thousands of pesos honestly. They were able to earn this money because of the price of handicrafts, because of the policies established for these products, and because these products are not taxed. The other day we were talking about taxes. Were these farmers taxed on what they do, perhaps they would not have been able to accumulate the hundreds of thousands of pesos they have today. However, there are others who have hundreds of thousands of pesos and have no way of showing how they got that money. They have not worked a day in their lives and have no way of showing how they got that money. But there is another problem, you mentioned the banks. That is a mistake; banks do not exist to find out where the money is coming from. Banks are there to receive and keep the money I deposit. Even though one topic leads to the other, this is not the issue we are discussing today. So let us go back to today's topic: A banking policy to ensure that our domestic finances will return to normal. As Pepe said, that policy should encourage the people to save as much as possible. The bank should have good interest rates that will encourage the people. I want to earn something on what I save. A good interest rate must be established so that the people will go and deposit their money in the banks. The people must trust the banks. [Roque Garcia] I do believe that people trust banks. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Yes, but as Pepe Alejandro said, the banks must not be made into a coercive instrument. A bank is there to receive the money that is deposited. If today I were to take 2 million pesos to the People's Bank and tell them that I want to keep my money there, they cannot go around finding out where it came from. [Roque Garcia] I would have you investigated immediately. [laughter] [Osvaldo Rodriguez] But that is not what a bank is for. [Roque Garcia] I agree. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] The bank must accept my 2 million pesos and pay me the established interest rates. Today's interest rates are too low. [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] It is only 2 or 3 percent. Sometimes not even that. It is 2 percent per annum. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Why should we be afraid of someone being able to live off the interest he is getting from his savings? If a worker has been working for 25 and 30 years and he has saved money in the bank in the hope that when he retires he can have some extra money to live off, then why not? It can happen. [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Osvaldo, there are other problems. The banks have a thousand and one ways to encourage people to save. For example, at this moment when there is such a big difference between the excess currency on the street and the lack of goods to be purchased, we can encourage the people to save by establishing a plan by which after they have saved for a specific period of time they can buy certain products that cannot be purchased on the market. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Durable goods. [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] That is correct, durable goods. For example, if you have saved quite a bit of money, after two years you can purchase a television set or a refrigerator. This would be an incentive. This could be a way of encouraging the people to put their money in the bank. [Roque Garcia] These are strategies that must be considered. We must keep these ideas in mind, especially today when we are trying to improve our domestic finances. [Roque Garcia] We are here today with JUVENTUD REBELDE reporters Osvaldo Rodriguez and Jose Alejandro Rodriguez. We are talking about a banking policy that could contribute to improving domestic finances. The bank cannot utilize coercive methods. We are clear on that. However, there are rumors. What can we expect? [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Juan Carlos, you know Cubans. We are always talking about things, about everything. And boy, can we smell things! People see things changing, and they talk about it. [Roque Garcia] That is the people for you. [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] That is correct. However, there are some who want the banks to assume a repressive role. They want the banks to handle social phenomena that must be solved by other means. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] That is why I said a while ago that we must have trust in the banks. [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Bank policies are policies that have been around for hundreds of years. This is worldwide. These are policies that cannot be ignored. The relationship between the bank and the client must be one of trust and flexibility. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] They must be very careful about how they treat people. The client should not be kept waiting. [Roque Garcia] There are times when you get to the bank and you have to wait in line for a long time because it takes forever to complete a transaction. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Going back to what you and Pepe were saying: I believe that banks cannot, under any circumstance, put conditions on my money. The bank is there to hold my money. That is it. When I want to withdraw my money, even if I want to withdraw every single peso I have deposited, even 100,000 pesos, the bank has to give me my 100,000 pesos plus the interest accrued. The bank uses that money. The bank uses the money I deposit. The bank uses my money, your money, and everyone's money for its own operations. Therefore, the bank cannot condition my deposits. The people would lose all trust in banks if they begin imposing coercive measures. I believe that those who are suggesting that the banks implement coercive measures are mistaken. Banks must protect the trust the people have in them. [Roque Garcia] I agree with you. I believe that this is the correct path. We have only expressed our opinions. We are not judges and the banks are not in the dock. We are not specialists. All we are doing is analyzing the problem. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] We are only observing the situation. [Roque Garcia] As Osvaldo just said, we are observing the situation and we cannot ignore what the people are saying. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] There is something else that the banks could implement, which I believe would be good. I am talking about time deposits. All foreign banks do this. It is similar to something that we are doing here. [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] The fixed fund account [cuenta de fondo fijo]. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] No, creation of the fund [formacion de fondo]. [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Creation of the fund. [Osvaldo Rodriguez] This fund is a payroll-deductible account. You set aside a certain amount for a specific time; in other words, you freeze that money. After a specific amount of time, you get your money back with interest. Time deposits are similar to this. The only difference is that you deposit a specific amount in a lump sum and decide how long you want to keep it in the bank, be it six or 12 months, or the time established by the bank. This provides much higher interest, and keeps that money immobilized. These are options that the banks must analyze at this time when we are looking for ways to improve our domestic finances. [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] We must establish a balance, and for this to be possible, it is important to have a good rapport between the banks and the people. This rapport must not be tainted by any type of repressive or restraining measures.
