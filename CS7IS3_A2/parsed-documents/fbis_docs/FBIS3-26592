NATO said in a statement the strikes would take place 10 days from 2400 GMT Thursday if the ultimatum was not met. Earlier, the United Nations said that the three warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina had reached a ceasefire agreement in and around Sarajevo through the mediation of U.N. representatives. The Serbs pledged to withdraw their artillery from around the city and put the guns under U.N. monitoring. It is reported that NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner had immediately informed U.N. chief Butrus Butrus-Ghali of the decision made at a meeting of the NATO ambassadors today. Butrus-Ghali had asked NATO to get prepared for air strikes following a mortar shelling against an open-market in Sarajevo last Saturday that killed 68 people and wounded nearly 200 others. The NATO statement said the ultimatum was given in close cooperation with the U.N. chief.
