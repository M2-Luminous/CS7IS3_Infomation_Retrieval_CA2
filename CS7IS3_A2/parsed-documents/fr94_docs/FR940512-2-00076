FR940512-2-00076 FR940512-2-00052 3. Defendant shall provide branded ATM network access pursuant to a nondiscriminatory price schedule applicable at least to depository institutions located in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Defendant's provision of branded ATM network access in States other than Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, pursuant to a nondiscriminatory price schedule in one State, shall not be deemed to be discriminatory by reason of the use of a different price schedule in another State. H. Defendant shall not restrict in any manner the ability of a depository institution to obtain branded ATM network access through qualified third party processors or through their own intercept processor facilities to multiple providers of branded ATM network access. Defendant shall not condition its provision of branded ATM network access on a depository institution's not obtaining branded ATM network access from any other person. Defendant shall not sell or contract to sell access to, membership in, or switching of transactions by any branded ATM network controlled by defendant, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the purchaser thereof shall not use or purchase branded ATM network access from any other person, or establish a price for, discount from, or rebate upon access to, membership in, or switching of transactions by the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the purchaser thereof shall not use or purchase branded ATM network access from any other person. Defendant shall in no manner restrict any depository institution ATM deployer that chooses to be affiliated with multiple ATM networks from displaying multiple ATM network logos on its ATMs. Defendant shall not prohibit any depository institution ATM card issuer located in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana or Ohio that chooses to be affiliated with multiple ATM networks from issuing cards that display multiple ATM network logos. Notwithstanding the preceding, Defendant may require that its ATM network logo be displayed on ATMs and ATM cards in equal frequency and prominence as the logos of any other ATM networks and may restrict the branding of access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value function. Defendant shall in no manner restrict any depository institution ATM deployer from enabling ATMs to function in multiple ATM networks. I. Notwithstanding the preceding, defendant is not enjoined from entering into an agreement, not inconsistent with the terms of this Final Judgment, for the provision of ATM processing or authorization processing to any depository institution to which defendant has provided actual notice of, and a true copy of, this Final Judgment. Any such agreement shall be severable from any agreement to provide branded ATM network access to the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant. J. The injunctions specified in Sections IV.A through IV.E of this Final Judgment shall become effective as provided by the terms of this paragraph: 1. Defendant shall commence certification of third party processors not later than January 1, 1995, except that defendant shall commence certification of processors in the MAC Midwest Platform not later than October 1, 1994. 2. Each third party processor who seeks certification shall be allowed to complete certification in a reasonably prompt manner and within the range of time common in the industry, and shall not be denied such resources under the control of defendant (e.g., test time) as are necessary for certification. Upon a third party processor's completion of certification, such processor shall be permitted to act as a qualified third party processor in the MAC network, except that defendant is not required by this paragraph IV.J.2, prior to January 1, 1995, to permit a third party processor that completes certification in the MAC Midwest Platform to act as a qualified third party processor for depository institutions not located in the States of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, West Virginia or Ohio, or depository institutions located in the State of West Virginia but not served by defendant through the MAC Midwest Platform as of the date of commencement of this action. 3. Sections IV.A through IV.E of this Final Judgment shall be effective and in force, as to any third party processor and the depository institution customers of such processor, as of the date upon which such third party processor becomes a qualified third part processor. 4. Sections IV.A through IV.E of this Final Judgment shall be effective and in force as of the date of entry of this Final Judgment in any portion of the MAC or any successor ATM network controlled by defendant in which depository institutions had the option of using third party multi-bank ATM processors as of January 1, 1993. Defendant shall not renounce or deny any right that it previously granted to depository institutions to obtain ATM processing or authorization processing from third party processors. 5. Defendant shall not take steps to prevent or discontinue any existing arrangements whereby third party processors provide ATM processing or authorization processing in connection with branded ATM network access as of January 1, 1993. V Sanctions Nothing in this Final Judgment shall bar the United States from seeking, or the Court from imposing, against any defendant or person any relief available under any applicable provision of law. VI Plaintiff Access A. To determine or secure compliance with this Final Judgment and for no other purpose, duly authorized representatives of the plaintiff shall, upon written request of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, and on reasonable notice to the defendant, be permitted: 1. access during the defendant's office hours to inspect and copy all records and documents in its possession or control relating to any matters contained in this Final Judgment; and 2. to interview the defendant's officers, employees, trustees, or agents, who may have counsel present, regarding such matters. The interviews shall be subject to the defendant's reasonable convenience and without restraint or interference from defendant. B. Upon the written request of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division, a defendant shall submit such written reports, under oath if requested, relating to any of the matters contained in this Final Judgment as may be reasonably requested.
