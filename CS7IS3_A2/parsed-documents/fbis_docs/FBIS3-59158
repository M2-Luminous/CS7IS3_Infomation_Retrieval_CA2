Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today said the letter is being prepared and must be sent by tomorrow. President Kliridhis informed the National Council of its content yesterday. In light of developments, the political party leaders outlined their positions in statements to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation. DISI [Democratic Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis said our side should turn toward discussing the substance of the Cyprus issue. He also said that the security issue should come at the beginning, which Rauf Denktas raised in his letter to the secretary general. Using the issue of security, Matsis said, we should turn toward international organizations and Europe and undertake initiatives and promote them at international decisionmaking centers. AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] General Secretary Dhimitrios Khristofias said his party would be happy if in the end, our side's handling of policy results in disengagement from the discussion on the confidence-building measures with no political cost. Khristofias criticized our side, saying its handling of policy has led to many impasses and wasted time. Answering a question, he said he does not believe the secretary general will propose to return to a discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue following the receipt of Kliridhis' letter. This, he said, should have been done a few months ago to achieve a specific result. DIKO [Democratic Party] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou said that as things stand today, the only way out is to begin a dialogue on the substance of the Cyprus issue, putting forward issues relating to security and demilitarization. He also said he is optimistic for the long term on condition that we follow the correct policy and struggle in the right way. He added that this is subject to full cooperation with Athens. Kiprianou said that now is the time to hold a conference in Athens and added that he will raise the issue of a trip to Athens, even if it is only for the members of the National Council. Socialist EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis noted that with is stance since Kliridhis accepted the confidence-building measures and his recent letter suggesting that every measure be included in an overall discussion of the Cyprus issue, Denktas had offered a golden opportunity. Let us grasp what Denktas says and let us ask, finally, for a discussion of the substance of the Cyprus issue, Lissaridhis said. He added that he does not believe the secretary general or any country will say that our demand to discuss the substance of the Cyprus issue is illogical. Konstandinos Themistokleous, vice president of the Democratic Socialist Renewal Movement [ADISOK], said our side should reaffirm its position that it accepts no regulation that would imply recognition of the pseudostate and will discuss all the other issues connected with the three documents [on the confidence-building measures]. Themistokleous said we cannot appear to be negative in our effort to discuss the confidence-building measures, because the United Nations considers that both sides now accept the measures in principle. He also said that the confidence-building measures are valid as a single package and cannot be implemented in stages. Free Democrats Movement Chairman Yeoryios Vasiliou said the procedure being formulated now is dangerous. He said Turkey aims to maintain the status quo and if we enter a continuing dialogue on what Denktas does and does not mean, Turkey will be very happy. He said we cannot overcome the impasse by retreating or give the impression that we are retreating, because it will lead us into conflict with the United Nations and create a negative picture of our side for the world.
