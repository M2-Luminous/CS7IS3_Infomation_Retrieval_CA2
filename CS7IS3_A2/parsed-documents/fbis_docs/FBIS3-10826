For example, in San Juan de Rioseco, Cundinamarca Department, two FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] members died during a clash; three other subversives died during clashes in (Matanza), Santander Department. The president of the Barranca de Upia Council, Meta Department, was killed, and several buses were attacked in Barrancabermeja. The most complicated situation is still in Carcasi, where more than 30 people are still being held hostage. The guerrillas have not allowed the elections to start in (Santa Rita de Iro) and Condoto, Choco Department. Voting officers have not yet shown up in Montecristo, Achi Municipality, Bolivar Department; their whereabouts are unknown. Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda is here. Mr. Minister, despite these public disorder incidents, do you think the elections are taking place normally in the country? [Pardo] You reported on actions directly related to public order; that is, on clashes with the subversives and criminal acts. They are unrelated to the electoral process. As for things concerning the electoral process, I could specifically mention the situation in Carcasi, where the voting officers were kidnapped on 12 March. Carcasi has three voting tables and a little more than 1,000 registered identification cards. A small armed group has tried to prevent the people from voting in Condoto, which has fewer than three voting tables. In Montecristo, a corregimiento of Achi, Bolivar Department, the voting officers failed to show up at 0800 to comply with their duty and start the voting; that is, there are problems at less than 10 voting tables out of 45,000 or a little more than 45,000 voting tables. [Canal] Could we assume the voting officers in Montecristo were also kidnapped? [Pardo] We have no information in this regard.
