GAZ Will Not Raise Its Hand"] [Text] The serious passions seething in Nizhniy Novgorod regarding the change in the procedure for privatization of the GAZ Automotive Plant could possibly open up new chapters in the Russian transition to the market. The collective has protested the "anti-plant" decision of the State Committee for Administration of State Property of the Russian Federation--to give the state a controlling 20-percent block of shares while the plant workers have to be satisfied with 15 percent. Yuriy Kulemin, chairman of the trade union committee, explains the position of the workers: "We were simply deceived, because, according to the previously approved privatization plan, the state structures were to have owned only one out of 10 shares. Therefore before the adoption of the unfortunate decision, 120,000 of our engineers, specialists, and workers were quite satisfied with the role of being in charge with the right to a decisive vote. Now all of them intend to defend their constitutional right to manage their own property. As a first step we have appealed to the court." It is clear that GAZ has become a desired object of privatization for many structures that intend to divide the single giant into parts. Now 430 modern Volgas come from the conveyor each day instead of 280. Last year alone the production of motor vehicles increased by 27,000. They are increasing the output of diesel trucks, children's bicycles, washing machines, and other industrial products and they have filled orders for various kinds of military equipment. They have received 319 billion rubles [R] in net profit, which remains at the disposal at the enterprise, of which R189 billion has been invested in further development of production and the social sphere. Including about R60 billion which has been assimilated in the form of capital investments in modernization and reconstruction of production and preparation for series production of the high-class diesel 1.5-tonne GAZ-3302. The automotive plant workers intend to transform their "automotive state" into a joint-stock company in the form of a powerful transnational corporation called GAZ which functions aggressively on domestic and foreign automotive markets. And the structure of the joint-stock portfolio, which balances the interests of the state and the producers, has given evidence to the birth of almost the first financial-industrial group in Russia. Effective the middle of 1994 on its basis in Nizhniy Novgorod there should arise a seat of stability and confident economic growth. After all, automotive construction means dozens of industrial enterprises, trade, transportation, service, banks, VUZ's [higher educational institutions], science, and many other things all bound together into a single unit. The main guarantee of the feasibility of such plans, let us recall, was that the association could retain the controlling block of shares. But frequent examples of "seizure," whereby maneuvers with the transfer of blocks of securities from state into private hands have led to a loss of independence by large Russian enterprises, have forced the automotive plant workers to take defensive measures. The Nizhniy Novgorod automotive giant organized a brilliant and instantaneous financial operation through its subsidiary firm GAZinvest. It organized the purchase of vouchers with money from the privatization fund for workers and pensioners, and the checks were turned over the GAZinvest. Waiting until, in keeping with Russian laws, the state put up 50 percent of the plant's shares for sale through auction, GAZinvest participated in the auction in keeping with the interests of the workers of the collective and the board of directors functioned smoothly as well. Numerous partners from Moscow, St. Petersburg, and some of the other largest industrial centers of Russia helped the automotive plant to hold out. Now it would be impossible to sell out the flourishing plant no matter what happens. And this is where it all began. The first round of artillery fire was directed at the plant by the State Committee for the Administration of State Property, which issued its January decision to establish a controlling 20-percent share for the state. The governor of Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast, Boris Nemtsov, sent the government of the Russian Federation a letter concerning violations of existing legislation when conducting the check auction for sale of shares in the GAZ Joint-Stock Company. As a result there appeared a directive from the government to declare the check auction for the sale of shares in the GAZ Joint-Stock Company null and void. Additionally, the government directive ordered all stockholders to "raise their hands" when voting for removal of the general director of the GAZ Joint-Stock Company, Boris Vidyayev, from the position he held. As is customary in such cases, the procuracy was given the corresponding instructions. In brief, thunder clouds hung over the automotive plant at the end of March. It was almost impossible to get a call through to Vidyayev himself. He was busy with the production: conference calls, planning sessions, business meetings, visits to the shops...finally the general director picked up the receiver. He commented briefly on the situation: "The accusations that were made are contrived and irresponsible. Any unprejudiced audit or legal investigation will confirm the legality of our actions, which were aimed at preventing the plant from being bought up by unwanted masters. The workers simply will not stand for such a turn of events. They are the ones who are now the owners of the joint-stock capital, which makes it possible for all of us to look confidently to the future with the hope of the rebirth of Russia." Boris Vidyayev says that he anticipated such a turn of events and accusations of personal financial transgressions. Because he will have to take the first blow personally. In the bookkeeping office, in his words, everything is crystal clear and he himself is blameless before his workers and Russia. But his enemies have still decided to find criminal activity elsewhere. The plant, they say, has spent money on acquiring vouchers while the enterprise was late with its payments to the budget. Well, so what? If the deferment was permitted, it was permitted. The money went into the budget, but money likes to circulate. We must judge not those for whom the ruble is working, but those for whom it is a dead weight. So far the Ministry of Industry of the Russian Federation has refused to comment on the situation, referring to the need to fulfill government directives. One of the workers, who asked that his name be withheld, said there were no charges against the current leadership of the Nizhniy Novgorod automotive plant and added that in Russia today enterprising and resourceful directors should be rewarded and not punished. Otherwise, there will be no rebirth. In all probability subsequent events will take the most unexpected turn for all parties. Only the State Committee for Administration of State Property and the Nizhniy Novgorod governor's office have had their say in this story. Then the story went into the press with one-sided criminal overtones. Until the judicial investigation is over, the workers have sensibly decided not to raise an unnecessary fuss and to return to the shops. I think they share the initial goals of privatization: To help the reborn Russia and not to destroy production that is already prospering and not to divide it into juicy morsels to be swallowed up by the sharks of international business. So far nobody has heard the true voice of the collective of 120,000, the real owners. According to existing evidence the permanent body of workers and engineers intend to defend firmly and without compromise their right to be truly and not just apparently in charge. So far this is the only positive result of privatization and, possibly, new chapters in its history. When it is the working people who are interested in the preservation, growth, and flourishing of their property. * * * P.S. After this article was already prepared for the press we received the following report. On 25 March the High Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation adopted an affirmative decision regarding the complaint of the GAZ Joint-Stock Company: "On declaring the directive of the State Committee for Administration of State Property of the Russian Federation of 19 January 1994, No. 121-R, to be not in keeping with legislation and violating the rights and interests of the GAZ Joint-Stock Company which are protected by law." As they say, the factories--to the workers, the land--to the peasants, and the law--to the people. On this we stand.
