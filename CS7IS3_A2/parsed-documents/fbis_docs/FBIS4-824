But what it contains -- a list of changes to government structures that have to be made in terms of the constitution -- is a task so mammoth that if Mr Valli Moosa and his fellow ANC members do nothing else in their first year in office, they will have achieved much. But, simultaneously, the ANC will want to begin implementing its reconstruction and development programme. It will also have to deal with a secessionist KwaZulu government and a rebellious right wing. Almost impossible challenges await the new government, but somebody has to formulate plans to meet them. As the ANC is the only party that seriously believes it will win the election, that task has fallen to a small sub-committee of its senior members headed by president Nelson Mandela. Others on the task group are ANC chairman Thabo Mbeki, secretary- general Cyril Ramaphosa and national working committee members. Mohammed Valli Moosa, Cheryl Carolus and Zola Skweyiya. The plans prepared by the group can be divided roughly into three categories: - Changes that have to be made at national level; - Changes that have to be made at provincial level; and - The appointment of the various statutory bodies provided for in the constitution. The constitution states that President F.W. de Klerk and his cabinet will continue to run the country after the elections until the new president is inaugurated. If, as expected, Mr Mandela wins the election, Mr de Klerk will consult him before taking any action. On May 6, the 400 members of the new National Assembly will meet in Cape Town to elect the president. As the rules that governed the functioning of Parliament no longer apply, the Assembly will have to draw up its own set of rules. In the meantime, a temporary set of rules has had to be drawn up in conjunction with the Secretary of Parliament. On May 10, the new president will be inaugurated at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. The arrangements are being overseen by a committee under the chairmanship of Chief Justice Corbett. The president will appoint his cabinet the following day. The task group has clearly given much thought to possible cabinet appointments, but as these appointments are ultimately the prerogative of the new president, Mr Valli Moosa would not comment on this matter. However, interviewed in his Shell House office, he did offer some thoughts on how the ANC believed the cabinet should be structured. He said cabinet committees would oversee the reconstruction and development programme and the promotion of gender equality. Rather than have a Law and Order Ministry, control of the police should fall under the Home Affairs Department, he added. The Department of Environment should be given much stronger powers than at present, and a Ministry of Science and Technology should be created. The committee has clearly also given much thought to candidates who could fill the post of director-general in each department. However, Mr Valli Moosa would only say that the matter was being discussed within ANC departments. At a lower level, there will have to be seismic changes in the civil services and these will also have an impact on the new provincial governments. Under the new dispensation, the number of civil services in South Africa will be reduced from the current 15 to 10. The restructuring of the civil services will be arduous task which could necessitate uprooting many people's lives. For example, the area that is now Bophuthatswana will fall into the Northern Cape, the North West and the Orange Free State. Civil servants will be transferred to the new provincial governments. Some functions, such as foreign affairs and defence, will be taken over by the central government, and senior military officers could be required to move to Pretoria. The constitution stipulates that a range of functions will have to be transferred from central to provincial government. Civil servants working for the central government in Pretoria may accordingly have to be transferred. Millions of people will be affected by these changes, which will be dealt with by the president in consultation with the nine provincial premiers, the Public Service Commission (which has to be appointed as soon as practically possible after the election) and the Commission on Provincial Government. The third broad category of constitution requirements facing Mr Valli Moosa and the task force -- the appointment of a range of new statutory bodies -- includes the appointment of a constitutional court, a public prosecutor, a Judicial Services Commission and a Human Rights Commission. Not least of the task force's difficulties will be the appointment of the right person for the right job. More complicated than most will be the task of appointing the constitution court judges. The president will appoint the head of the constitutional court. The fact that top ANC legal experts Arthur Chaskalson and Albie Sachs are not standing for the election suggests they could be in line for this post. Four serving judges will be appointed by the president in consultation with the cabinet and the Chief Justice. The remaining six judges will be chosen from a list of 10 submitted by the Judicial Services Commission. But that commission has yet to be set up and there are even more elaborate procedures for appointing its members. For example, the constitution states that the attorneys' profession has to appoint two members. There is no single body representing attorneys. The constitutional court has to be established as soon as possible after the election. It will hear any case involving a possible violation of a fundamental right entrenched in the constitution. Given the complexities of the task awaiting the new government, it is no wonder Mr Valli Moosa speaks rather wistfully of the U.S. where a new president is given three months to prepare to govern and appoint members of his administration. South Africa's new president will be afforded no such luxuries.
