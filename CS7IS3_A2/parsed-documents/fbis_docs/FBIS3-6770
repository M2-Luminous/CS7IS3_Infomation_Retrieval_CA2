Over the past thirty years more than 2,500 local industrial factories have made their appearance throughout the country and their modernisation level improved considerably. Foodstuff, textile, garment, paper-making and other local industrial factories, over twenty on an average, have been built in cities and counties which had only a few ones thirty years ago. The Sakju foodstuff factory with a plottage of more than 24,000 square metres has all its production processes streamlined. The local industrial factories in Anju city now produce consumer goods of more than 1,420 kinds, or twice as many as turned out in South Pyongan Province in the initial period of the local industrial development. The local industrial factories throughout the country now fully meet the material needs of the population by firmly relying upon the raw materials available in local areas. There are more than 42,500 hectares of raw (?materiel cultivation) bases across the country, which produce over 8,000 kinds of consumer goods.
