Kravchuk by UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Editor in Chief Valeriy Zholdak; held in the office of the president of Ukraine on 9 December 1993; published under the rubric "UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Projects: Real Contenders for the Office of President of Ukraine, Elections For Which Have Been Scheduled for 26 June 1994": "`Ukraine Will Be Great and Strong.' UKRAYINSKA HAZETA Editor in Chief Holds Conversation With President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk on the Most Burning Problems in Domestic and Foreign Policy of Ukraine, the Leading Cadres of the State, the Family, Rumors, and the Woes of the People"--for first two installments see Ukrainian National Affairs Section of Central Eurasia Daily Report of 28 Dec 93 p 30, 11 Jan 94 p 52] [Text] The President Goes All the Way on Nonnuclear Status and Makes a New Statement Through UKRAYINSKA HAZETA [Zholdak] Did you talk to Clinton from here, from your working office? [Kravchuk] This is the telephone I used to conduct the conversation with Mr. Clinton. [Zholdak] How did he talk to you? Politely or as a dictator? [Kravchuk] He is generally very polite. There has not been a case yet in which presidents have talked to each other impolitely. It is our politicians that frequently try to outdo one another in impoliteness. Clinton is a very polite man. I have communicated with him on the phone three times: first, when I congratulated him on his election as President; the second time he called me, when I was at the dacha, during the period of strikes in summer; and now for a third time. [Zholdak] Did you talk in the morning or in the evening? [Kravchuk] In the evening. [Zholdak] You sat.... Did you know that he would be calling? [Kravchuk] Certainly. I had been notified. [Zholdak] In what language did you talk to him--English or Ukrainian? [Kravchuk] I talked in Ukrainian and he talked in English. Both he and I had our own interpreters. [Zholdak] And, you say, very politely.... [Kravchuk] He expressed the most respectful attitude toward both me and Ukraine. He always stresses the same thing: that America is interested in the existence of an independent Ukraine, and that it is in favor of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and he assures me that he wishes Ukraine well. He starts with this every time. [Zholdak] Is it true that a secret joint meeting of the representatives of the Security Councils of America and Russia was held in Moscow? Did they get together and discuss something against Ukraine? [Kravchuk] No. [Zholdak] Is this just talk? [Kravchuk] Just talk. Recently there was a meeting of the Russian Security Council separately. This was reported in the press. However, not only Ukrainian issues were discussed there but also issues of overall security in the world. [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, the Armed Forces of Ukraine means defense, the existence of an independent Ukraine. When Kuchma was prime minister, he stated that he did not know what Morozov, our minister of defense at the time, was doing. Do you remember this phrase? [Kravchuk] What about it? [Zholdak] The Supreme Council does not resolve issues of effectiveness of the military mechanism either because it is a collective organ. Tell me please, Mr. President, who among the first, supreme officials of the state works on problems of the Armed Forces personally, systematically, and I would stress, responsibly? [Kravchuk] The president. [Zholdak] Does everything really devolve on you directly? [Kravchuk] Everything that concerns the Armed Forces is reported in its entirety solely to the president. The president is commander in chief. [Zholdak] Are you a colonel or...? [Kravchuk] A colonel. [Zholdak] It is good that at least you do not promote yourself to the rank of marshal, as our Communist leaders once did. [Kravchuk] Rank is not the issue. The main point is to prevent war and bloodshed in the state. [Zholdak] On this, Mr. President, we will give you due credit: During the two years of your "reign" certain, putting it mildly, unfriendly forces have not succeeded in getting the Ukrainian people involved in ruinous conflicts. [Kravchuk] I repeat that the president is responsible for the security of our people to the greatest extent. And if you, Mr. Editor in Chief, do not have any more questions about nuclear weapons, and it appears that we have discussed this in a quite detailed and popular way.... [Zholdak] Yes, you sorted it all out in a popular way. [Kravchuk] I will declare yet again: No matter who clamors or votes in favor of nuclear armaments, Ukraine must get rid of nuclear weapons. This is due to military-political, technical, ecological, and other circumstances. However, this should be done proceeding from the interests of the people. [Zholdak] UKRAYINSKA HAZETA will concur with you on this, Mr. President, if crafty Russia, or whoever else together with it, pays all bills to us for all weapons, both tactical and strategic. [Kravchuk] I will ensure this. [Zholdak] Russia is demanding debts from us, whereas it itself is an even greater debtor of ours. Let its present leaders first return to us 16 percent of the USSR reserves of valuables--diamonds, gold, and other valuables. They have the gall to put pressure on you.... Do not yield to them, and the people will support you, Leonid Makarovych. However, at present the state of the mood of the popular masses is highly volcanic. I mean our current poor material situation. The people, most of the people, are concerned about what they are going to eat tomorrow. Everything is expensive, everything is beyond reach.... Undoubtedly, you know this as well as I do. [Kravchuk] Indeed, our economic difficulties have reached a critical high point. [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, here is the main question which at present alarms Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. We have received an interesting letter. Its author quotes your well-known pronouncement that is particularly fashionable coming from the lips of various leaders who care about Ukrainian independence only in a manner of speaking. You came up with it: "We have what we have." Our reader is indignant about these words, and he specifies, to my mind correctly, their message with regard to the situation that has developed in the state. He maintains: "We have what we have allowed." Indisputably, this arrow was aimed at you, Leonid Makarovych.... Therefore, here is the following question for you: How could it be that after prices for foodstuffs, to say nothing of manufactured consumer goods, were raised sharply by the Cabinet of Ministers, which you lead, the Ukrainian people became paupers overnight, and at the same time very malicious toward the leaders of its state, and toward you in particular? Why did this happen? Be so kind as to explain it in a simple and popular manner, without "scientific" substantiation, if you would. [Kravchuk] In a popular way, here it is. If we had real borders with all states of the world, I repeat--real borders rather than loopholes, as is the case now, just a belt with all the attributes of a border, if we had customs checkpoints likewise with all the attributes, we could establish within the country prices that are in line with our economic potential. This is the first point. Second.... [Zholdak] Pardon me, Mr. President, so, is the permeability of our borders, i.e. the absence of real borders in our country, the first reason for the growth of prices? [Kravchuk] No, no, I will explain. I will return to the main.... [Zholdak] It is just that I want to understand so that we will not go far.... [Kravchuk] We will not go far. At present, with our permeable borders, prices in a neighboring state automatically influence our situation. For example, we have lower prices, and Russia has higher prices. They export products to Russia, sell them for rubles, convert the rubles into dollars, get coupons again.... [Zholdak] They clip coupons! [Kravchuk] Yes, they do! And the process of exports goes on. [Zholdak] This is clear. [Kravchuk] So, the second point. Prices should be in line with costs. Our prices are not yet in line with costs. High prices are not even the issue. Do you understand? The issue is for wages to correspond to prices. [Zholdak] Our political commentator, Academician Ihor Rafayilovich Yuknovskyy, has always maintained this. [Kravchuk] I know. We should bring compensation for labor into line with prices, and then the standard of living of the people will grow. For example, the price may be one kopek, and the wage two kopeks. You will buy two things with two kopeks. [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, you said "we should bring," but when will this "should" become a reality? How will this happen? Are you already developing some kind of mechanism, or what? Are you and your cabinet just thinking about it? [Kravchuk] Why thinking? We are working. [Zholdak] However, the shops are now barren. How much longer will their beggarly appearance oppress our souls and our consciousness? [Kravchuk] Why are they barren? Because everything has been removed from them. [Zholdak] By whom? Where to? Did they simultaneously remove everything from all shops? [Kravchuk] They exported half the products beyond the borders of Ukraine. Collective farms do not sell at such prices.... [Zholdak] So, are they removing it from warehouses? Who is? [Kravchuk] Look, you do not understand. At present, kolkhozes cannot sell products at low prices. These products should be subsidized, or else they will sell the products with their costs included. It cannot be otherwise. We gave 5 trillion in subsidies.... I think the subsidy came to 5 trillion in 1.5 months! So, if we have the budget, these 5 trillion should be given to collective farms, and they will sell to you at low prices. Or else they will say: Defray my costs, I cannot maintain expanded reproduction. [Zholdak] So, are the reasons for price raises yesterday and today to be found in permeable borders and prices that are not in line with costs? [Kravchuk] The costs are the main reason. We need to either subsidize or decontrol prices. There is no other way. [Zholdak] And you decontrolled them! [Kravchuk] We decontrolled. The subsidies accomplished nothing. I associate loopholes in the borders with the fact that when subsidies exist, products are exported to where prices are higher. That is, the borders are not the main point, they do not rank first. However, all things are linked among themselves. I will repeat that prices are low in the environment of subsidies. Borders have to be under lock and key because of the subsidies so that products will not be exported to where prices are higher. Do you understand? [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, say more precisely, so that both I and the people who will read our interview will understand, when exactly changes for the better will occur, and when our impoverishment will stop. If only you could see how many old grannies have now appeared in front of bakeries. They stand there (may they forgive me) as if homeless, hungry four-legged creatures.... They are asking for a slice of a roll because they have nothing to buy it with. [Kravchuk] I will repeat--when we bring wages into line with prices. [Zholdak] When will this happen? Tomorrow, a month from now, 10 years or 100 years from now? [Kravchuk] When we finally determine what energy resources we will have and how much they will cost. Russia has recently raised prices for energy resources three times. Three times. [Zholdak] So, it will raise prices continuously, and we will never.... [Kravchuk] No, no. There is the world price. [Zholdak] What is it? [Kravchuk] At present, we do not yet have this world price. [Zholdak] Why do we not? When will we? [Kravchuk] In January of next year (1994--UKRAYINSKA HAZETA editorial note). [Zholdak] It will be set in January and then what-- stabilization occurs? [Kravchuk] Than we will, for our part, establish the upper scale of prices. [Zholdak] Yes. [Kravchuk] We will establish the scale of wages and retirement benefits, and everything will depend on labor productivity. For example, if we increase production, prices will fall. If we reduce production, prices will grow. This is legitimate. It cannot be otherwise. I will give you a simple example. You have 100 kilograms of bread. [Zholdak] Yes. [Kravchuk] And you also have 100 people. You can give one kilogram to everyone regardless of how much money you pay to all of them. If you pay them more money they will buy the same 100 kilograms with more money. That is to say, this is about increasing the number of kilograms. If we increase it, the price falls. At present, everybody is reducing it. Industry is cutting back production, there is less meat and less milk. There is less of everything. So, prices grow. [Zholdak] However, wages do not grow accordingly. What is your salary as president? [Kravchuk] Six hundred thousand, it seems. [Zholdak] Six hundred thousand net? [Kravchuk] Well, no, this is the entire salary. [Zholdak] The entire salary? And nothing on top of it? No bonuses or extra pay? Nothing? [Kravchuk] Yes. [Zholdak] It is not only too much but even terribly little for the president. How can the president be valued like that? [Kravchuk] What is there to say when everybody gets low wages now. Some get a lot.... The issue now is how to equalize the ratios of costs, prices, and wages. This is the main issue for each state. Here, a multitude of problems are superimposed in this area-- technology, costs, world prices.... [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA has started a new rubric: "Are People Cogs? People Are Pincers!" One of your fellow natives of Rivne responded to it. Ivan Ivanovych Podranetskyy wrote to us.... I will not quote the entire text because we will publish it separately. It was about the state, and you as its head, bringing about a situation where the people who before the price increases had savings that were considerable as of that time either at home or in savings banks, immediately became poor, destitute. What once was a few thousand karbovantsy has lost value and become simple pieces of paper. At first it was announced that a certain small amount of deposits would be increased by 200 percent. However, pardon me, this is too little, too late. What is to be done so that people will have what they had? Mr. President, this adage of yours is particularly appropriate in this instance. [Kravchuk] If memory serves, the people in our country had 90 billion rubles [R] in passbook accounts. If we appraise it using this coefficient, it will now come to trillions, tens of trillions. [Zholdak] Well. [Kravchuk] So, we announce, for example, that you have a trillion. Can you buy anything with this trillion? This is not the issue.... You see? We may now be kind and announce to all: The state is paying you back, the state is giving to you. We live so that the state is supposed to give. [Zholdak] What it must give.... [Kravchuk] Yes. The state must give what is fair. However, where is the state to get this? What is the state? Does the president have money in his pocket? If collectives do not give this money, if the people who work do not give this money, where is it to be had? I met today with the director of a Yugoslav factory. It was an interesting meeting, lasting five minutes. I asked her: "How do you operate under the conditions of a war going on?" She answered: "All our workers there understood that they might only live if they worked. There is no other way." Further on, I asked: "What kind of taxes do you pay to the state?" She answered: "For each dinar, two dinars." I was astonished: "Then how do you live?" She said: "This is how we live, such is the situation." [Zholdak] I understand what you are driving at. We should work, work, work.... [Kravchuk] Wait. [Zholdak] This is correct, Leonid Makarovych, but on one condition: Those who organize this "working" process should be able and willing to implement such an appeal to work. Directors, a majority of directors, do nothing but "cry": "We do not have this, all of our relations have been broken...." [Kravchuk] I did not finish my thought. Please understand.... I would like to explain it to you in a popular manner. When we proclaimed our state, what did we begin with? Reduce the work day as much as possible. Provide as many social programs as possible. Provide as much social protection as possible. Provide! Provide! Provide! Everybody said that we were rich enough to be able to provide for and give everything to everyone. Here it is, take it! We forgot one thing: All this can only be created through work. You may put an angel in this office.... If people do not understand one simple thing, that a way out should be sought through work, through manufacturing high-quality products, through sales, and that foreign exchange has to be earned, we will always be poor. There is no other way out. Nobody will give us either oil or gas for free. Everybody lives by world prices. Why can Ukraine not follow them? [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, you have been saying all along that we "must work." In this case, the directors themselves "must" be first forced to work and hustle. [Kravchuk] Why "forced?" Then let us return to that regime, to the former owners of this office who engaged in this. [Zholdak] No. [Kravchuk] What do you mean by no? Down with democracy! Down with laws! What does "force" mean? [Zholdak] Calling them to order, so as to make them accountable.... [Kravchuk] In what way? [Zholdak] If a director works poorly, does not want to handle the enterprise or does not know how, or is incapable of handling the enterprise, why should such a manager be retained? [Kravchuk] However, you wrote yourself at one time--let the collectives elect the directors. [Zholdak] This was wrong. [Kravchuk] Here we are, wrong. I also say it is wrong. Everybody made a mistake, and now they want to find a scapegoat. Yes, I say: we must, we must, we must. After all, I cannot proclaim that I will issue an edict tomorrow, and that everyone will have to work under the whip. Down with the laws we have passed?... The people should understand this themselves. I repeat that there is no other way out. [Zholdak] Still, what are we to do about the letter from your fellow native of Rivne? So that the karbovantsy will become valuable. [Kravchuk] First, you must know that a decision on indexation was made by the Supreme Council, and that the value of savings will be included when the budget is approved. However, to the full extent.... My thinking is that, second, people should be told the truth: We are crediting everything for you to a special account and we will pay it back when we become rich. [Zholdak] Can you announce this to the people? [Kravchuk] I can. We will prepare proposals and calculations, and we will announce. [Zholdak] Someone must become urgently concerned about the common people, the "cogs." The "pincers" will hack out, wrest, yank, and take theirs from the state. Let us promise that people will be compensated even in 10 years.... [Kravchuk] We will definitely pay them back. [Zholdak] After all, we will not be poor all the time, will we? I do not believe this. [Kravchuk] Neither do I. [Zholdak] Is Ukraine in the abyss now or not? What do you think? [Kravchuk] Why in the abyss? In the abyss means being dead already. [Zholdak] Why? One can still live in the abyss. Hetman Kalnyshevskyy lived to be 100 years in a "sack of stone." [Kravchuk] This is not an abyss. [Zholdak] More terrifying than an abyss. [Kravchuk] If a man falls into an abyss it means certain death. [Zholdak] So, we are not yet in a precipice, Mr. President? [Kravchuk]) We may overcome this situation. [Zholdak] What is the situation in Ukraine at present, to your mind? [Kravchuk]) An extremely difficult economic situation. However, having this kind of resources, we may realistically bring about normal life in Ukraine. [Zholdak] Thus, the situation is difficult, is it not? [Kravchuk]) Extremely! [Zholdak] Extremely! In this case, tell us who specifically brought this about? Who among the highly placed leaders? What do you think? Someone should finally be held accountable for the suffering of a great people, instead of fleeing abroad to diplomatic and commercial positions, as they are now saying about the civil servant, currently the "Frenchman" Mr. Lobov, say, the former minister of power generation and already the "American" Mr. Sklyarov, and, say, an "active fighter" against the state structures of the mafia, the former deputy prime minister and likewise the "American" Mr. Yoffe.... [Kravchuk] Well, this is a "witch" hunt. This is understandable. [Zholdak] However, Leonid Makarovych, someone should be responsible for everything. Or would you like to, pardon me, have to take the rap for everything? I do not want to blame you alone for the country experiencing such a collapse and destitution.... [Kravchuk] No, I may say so.... I do not want to.... You would understand that you are asking me a difficult question. As president, the highest individual in the state, am I supposed to shift the blame to someone else? I may only blame myself. This is it. I cannot shift it to anyone, and I will not. In principle, I am against a search for enemies and those responsible for this or that. Everybody.... Now let us deliberate this way. Was I the only one to whom the idea, for example, to follow the path we have opted for occurred? No. The people of Ukraine decided that. We opted for this path, we voted in favor of it. [Zholdak] Do you mean the path of independence? As it were, Kuchma stated when he was prime minister that he did not know what needed to be built and what path needed to be followed. [Kravchuk] Why does he not know? I think that he said that in the heat of the moment. [Zholdak] Apparently, for this reason he already wants to become president of Ukraine now that he has been removed from the position of the head of government. Perhaps he believes that from the height of this state position he will see the landmarks toward which to proceed. Mr. President, we are building an independent, happy Ukraine. [Kravchuk] Absolutely! And we know that this entails sacrifices. We know that this inevitably entails devastation. Because.... You will understand.... We are building a state out of a piece. We import 80 percent of everything from Russia and other states. We are now saying: Look for it internally. We look, and we find. We have found it somewhere. We should also be aware of favorable processes in this. Where and when.... Recently I went to Tunisia. They have been building that state for 37 years now. Thirty-seven years! To this day they have a great many difficulties. However, there is progress. We started to build the state only two years ago and want things to get better right away. We were taken in by an illusion--as soon as we proclaimed independence, we decided that things would get easier right away, everything would be cheap, cheap sausage would become cheaper still, and we would not even work.... Do you know what the length of the work day is in South Korea at present? [Zholdak] Six hours? [Kravchuk] Fourteen hours! [Zholdak] In the South Korea which, I think, has all it can desire? [Kravchuk] Yes, this is one of the richest countries of the world. And they get about nine or 12 days of leave--I do not remember exactly. Nobody raises the issue of having leave for all right away and the shortest work day in the world. The state must be built up, a new economy must be built up, wealth must be created first, and then these things should be discussed. [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, I may be mistaken, but so far it is not apparent that you personally, as president, have achieved even a small success in anything--I mean primarily in "creating wealth." [Kravchuk] I do not see this either. Look at this.... I submit the issue of commodity bonds. They block me. I submit the issue, I was prepared and am prepared now to proceed to sell the old fleet which Ukraine does not need. They block me. I submit.... [Zholdak] However, you up and sold the fleet to Russia.... [Kravchuk] I did not sell it to anyone.... [Zholdak] In September you signed an agreement with Yeltsin in Massandra.... You wanted to sell.... [Kravchuk] We merely signed an intent. [Zholdak] All the same, why sign even an intent? [Kravchuk] I am convinced even now that we must sell. [Zholdak] However, sell rather than give or transfer to Russia for some kind of astronomical debts invented by them. In general, if they are allowed into Sevastopol with all of its infrastructures, they will altogether evict us from there. [Kravchuk] Can you drive them out of Sevastopol? [Zholdak] No. We are not capable of doing this at present. [Kravchuk] Then why the idle talk when it is necessary to agree with Russia on normal principles of cooperation in the region? If the issue of "driving them out" is raised, this means war. I am convinced that Ukraine will be an independent state only on the condition that it establishes a partnership, good-neighbor relations with Russia. Anyone who has not grasped this understands nothing about politics.
