Szekeres and Balint Magyar, head of the election campaign team of the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, were speaking about the probable future Hungarian coalition government of Socialists and Liberals. They stressed that they ascribe priority significance to the settlement of relations with Slovakia. The coalition government will look after the fate of ethnic Hungarians in neighboring countries, but in a style different from that of the present government--without interfering in the internal affairs of neighboring countries, pragmatically, so that these relations with the minorities become a factor of enhancement of trust. Imre Szekeres was received yesterday by Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik. The Hungarian politician informed him that the new Hungarian prime minister, who will probably submit the new government's policy statement to parliament toward the end of this month, will wish to meet him within the shortest possible time. He also said that talks on the drafting of a basic treaty on relations between Slovakia and Hungary, which would contain guarantees of present borders and of the rights of ethnic minorities in both states, should start as soon as possible. Szekeres also held talks with Peter Weiss, deputy chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic and chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], with whom he discussed, among other issues, the possibilities of future cooperation between the SDL and the MSZP. The Hungarian politician also met with Jaroslav Volf, chairman of the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia.
