The paper notes the hollow claim made by the United States that Iran supports terrorism, adding: The United States forced Iraq to fight against Iran for eight years. Was this not an act of terrorism? Was this act not motivated by the wish to alter the balance of forces to the advantage of the regime occupying Jerusalem? However, now, when Iran is trying to rebuild its army after eight years of war, the United States has asked various countries to refrain from defense cooperation with Iran. THE MUSLIM concludes by saying: The United States' confrontation with Iran is continuing and this has, in fact, resulted in Iran being strengthened.
