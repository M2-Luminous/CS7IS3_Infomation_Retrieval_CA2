"A Gerashchenko-Fedorov tandem is something that cannot exist in the Russian economy today," Chubays, who also heads the State Property Committee, said at a conference in Moscow on Thursday. But he said it was essential that Fedorov should stay in the government, because "losing him would be a heavy blow to the reforms and the Russian financial policy." The government's composition will most likely be approved on January 21, Chubays said. He said that, as long as the government was headed by Chernomyrdin, the basic privatization principles would not be changed. "Too much has already been done in the field of privatization, and the State Duma, even if anti-government sentiments get the upper hand in it, will have to realize it. If I remain in the government in my present capacity, no alignment of forces will be able to stop privatization," he said. To date between 45 and 50 percent of the state property has been privatized, Chubays said. This includes 70 percent of service industry enterprises with staffs of under 200. Of the 14,500 large industrial enterprises subject to denationalization, 11,000 have already been privatized. Over 110 Mn Russians have already used their privatization checks, half of which have been exchanged for shares in state enterprises, Chubays said.
