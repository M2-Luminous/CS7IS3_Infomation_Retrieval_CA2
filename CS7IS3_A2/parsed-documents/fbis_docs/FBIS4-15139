After such a resolution is adopted, all accusations against Estonia concerning the country's law on aliens and citizenship law would have no more sense, Aasmae said in an interview. He said chances were high that such a resolution would be passed in the United Nations in a simple majority vote if Estonia's policy before that was active enough. The opposition politician says Estonia must hurry with its efforts toward the adoption of the resolution, because the country will be left with one good argument less in support of its campaign after the Russian troops have left. Aasmae predicted support for Estonia's move from a number of Islamic countries, who are interested in positively resolving the issue of the West Bank territories occupied by Israel. "It is quite probable that support for us will also come from Japan, who has interest in resolving the problem of the annexed South Kurils, as well as from many countries who are interested in the unity of Cyprus. Also the overwhelming majority of European countries and the United States would find it difficult to vote against that resolution, since they have mostly always denounced occupation and annexation," Aasmae said.
