The greatest confidence is enjoyed by Mayor Eberhard Diepgen (CDU) [Christian Democratic Union]. Fifty-three percent of the Berliners rate his performance as "good," 39 percent as "more poor than good." This is the result of a representative poll that the "infas" public opinion institute was commissioned to take by the BERLINER ZEITUNG. "Notable in this case," the pollsters say, "is that the mayor gets predominantly good ratings not only within his own camp, but from supporters of the coalition partner SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] as well." In second place on the popularity list is Senator for Juvenile Affairs Thomas Krueger (SPD): 38 percent rate him positively, while one in four views his image as negative. Almost identical ratings are given to Senator for Women's Affairs Christine Bergmann and Senator for Social Affairs Ingrid Stahmer (both SPD): 36 percent of those polled rate them as "good," 27 percent as "poor." Cultural Affairs Senator Ulrich Roloff-Momin (unaffiliated) is the recipient of more criticism than favor (27 to 37 percent), and things look even worse for the rest of the team. Approximately half the population gives a predominantly poor rating to Construction Senator Wolfgang Nagel (SPD) and to his colleague, Urban Development Senator Volker Hassemer (CDU), with whom he is currently locked in a violent dispute over the construction plan for Alexanderplatz. The same is true for CDU Senators Elmar Pieroth (Finance), Dieter Heckelnmann (Internal Security), and Herwig Haase, who is responsible for bus lanes, the 30-kilometer speed limit, and the "right turn on red" system. Most Berliners either cannot, or do not want to, give their opinion on the other senate members. If the election were held now in Berlin, the CDU would suffer significant losses (see table below). Eight percent fewer than four years ago would vote for the Christian Democrats. The SPD would be unable to profit from this. It would get 30 percent of the votes, so that the two governing parties would be locked in a neck-to-neck race. Considering the distribution of the balance of the votes, a continuation of the grand coalition would appear likely. The FDP [Free Democratic Party], which at the moment is waging its struggles for power in unadorned fashion, would no longer be represented in the House of Deputies. The Alliance 90/Greens would receive 12 percent. The undisputed winner--and third-strongest caucus--would be the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] with 15 percent. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Elections to the House of Deputies(in percentage of votes received) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Voter Preference in Feb 1|Election Results on 2 De-| | |994 |c 1990 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |CDU |32 |40.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |SPD |30 |30.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |FDP |4 |7.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Alliance 90/Greens |12 |9.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |PDS |15 |9.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Republikaner |4 |3.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Others |3 |0.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: infas Berlin | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
