It reads as follows: Dear Sir: In connection with your government's decision to deny further hospitality to the citizens of the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, we wish to draw your attention to the fact that its literal implementation could do a great injustice to certain members of our nation. Namely, this decision also applies to Muslim refugees from Sandzak who, as your excellency knows all too well, have been the target of brutal repression by the Belgrade regime. Those from Sandzak had to flee their homes due to open police terror and also because they refused to be mobilized by the Serbian army and to be forced to commit crimes against the Croats and later against their brethren in Bosnia. To our knowledge, most of these people in Germany today hail from the municipalities of Novi Pazar, Sjenica, Tutin, Rozaje, Bijelo Polje, Berane, Prijepolje, Priboj, Nova Varos, Plevlja, and Plav. I am pleading with you, Sir, to exempt these unfortunate people from the decision on deportation, because they simply have nowhere to return. They would be sent to prison or, worse, to the front in Bosnia or Croatia the minute they crossed the border, President Izetbegovic wrote in his letter to Klaus Kinkel.
