FR941012-2-00202 FR941012-2-00119 The fourth modification, new supplemental guidance on generation and use of airport revenue, is being proposed to reflect the statutory mandate of section 112 of the Authorization Act to define certain practices as impermissible revenue diversion. While DOT/FAA consider these changes to the guidance on generation and use of airport revenue to be consistent with section 112 of the 1994 Authorization Act, they are not intended to be the sole response to section 112. Additional policy guidance or regulations implementing section 112 will be published. Finally, the mandate of 1994 Authorization Act to adopt procedural regulations is being addressed in separate rulemaking proceedings. Accordingly, DOT/FAA revise the proposal published at 59 FR 29874 as follows: 1. Proposed paragraphs 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 are deleted and the following paragraphs are proposed instead. ``1.2.1 In the case of rates, charges and fees imposed on one or more air carriers or foreign air carriers, DOT will issue a determination on the reasonableness of the rate or charge upon the filing of a written request for a determination by the airport proprietor or the filing of a complaint by one or more air carriers, if DOT determines that a significant dispute exists, in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 47129, and implementing regulations. 1.2.2 In the case of rates, charges or fees imposed on other aeronautical users, DOD/FAA will first offer its good offices to facilitate parties' reaching a successful outcome in a timely manner. Prompt resolution of these disputes is always desirable since extensive delay can lead to uncertainty for the public and a hardening of the parties' positions. 1.2.3. In the case of rates, charges or fees imposed on other aeronautical users, where negotiations between the parties are unsuccessful and a complaint is filed alleging that airport rates and charges violate an airport proprietor's federal grant obligations, DOT/FAA will, where warranted, exercise the broad statutory authority to investigate and review the legality of those rates and charges and to issue such determinations and take such actions as are appropriate based on that review. DOT/FAA will remain available to assist in the negotiated resolution of a dispute even after the filing of a complaint.'' 2. A new paragraph 4.1.1 as set forth below is added to the proposed policy statement: ``4.1.1 Airport proprietors are encouraged, when entering into new or revised agreements or otherwise establishing rates, charges, and fees, to undertake reasonable efforts to make their particular airports as self-sustaining as possible in the circumstances existing at such airports.'' 3. A new paragraph 5.2 as set forth below is added to the proposed policy statement. The current paragraph 5.2 is renumbered as paragraph 5.2.1, and paragraph 5.3 is renumbered as paragraph 5.2.2. Paragraphs 5.4 and 5.5 are renumbered as paragraphs 5.3 and 5.4, respectively. ``5.2 In establishing new fees, rates and charges, and generating revenues from all sources, airport owners and operators should not seek to create revenue surpluses that exceed the amounts to be used for airport system purposes and for other purposes for which airport revenues may be spent under 49 U.S.C. 47107(b)(1), including reasonable reserves and other funds to facilitate financing and cover contingencies.'' 4. A new paragraph 5.6, as set forth below, is added to the proposed policy statement: ``5.6 Subject to the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 47107(b)(2), the DOT/FAA consider the following practices to be impermissible uses of airport revenue: (a) Direct payments or indirect payments, other than payments reflecting the value of services and facilities provided to the airport; (b) Use of airport revenues for general economic development, marketing, and promotional activities unrelated to airports or airport systems; (c) Payments in lieu of taxes or other assessments that exceed the value of services provided; or (d) Payments to compensate nonsponsoring governmental bodies for lost tax revenues exceeding stated tax rates.'' Issued in Washington, DC, on October 4, 1994. Federico Pe√±a, Secretary of Transportation. David R. Hinson, Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration.
