Although the plots of ground concerned often constitute prime inner-city sites, the local authorities usually seek investors in vain. The risk of acquiring a plot that conceals an old dump is much too great. The ensuing costs would be incalculable. This dilemma is particularly great in the new federal laender. Local authorities are under enormous pressure to attract investors to create jobs and raise tax revenue. However, as the derelict sites are unsalable, business areas are springing up all over the place in green belts. As a result, the landscape is being unnecessarily spoiled, despite the fact that areas with full infrastructure facilities are already available. Special Attention For this reason, the derelict site issue is receiving special attention, particularly in the new federal laender. The local and land-level authorities are pressing on with both the identification and hazard assessment of likely areas and their reclamation. For instance, Thuringia has had a law on waste management and derelict sites since as early as 1991. It is also expected that the law on investment incentives and residential building land, which came into force on 1 May 1993, will also give a major boost. Operators of dump reclamation facilities can hope for simpler, speedier licensing procedures. Indeed, the last few months have seen a boom in the establishment of new stationary soil conditioning facilities, particularly in the new federal laender. Simplified Licensing According to Hamburg-based Nordac, which examined the consequences of the law on investment incentives at a symposium held in November 1993, there are currently over 150 facilities with annual capacities ranging from 3,000 to 200,000 tonnes at the planning or licensing stage, under construction, or already in operation. The law on mobile polluted site conditioning plants is making a particularly strong impact. Although these plants were subject to just as comprehensive a licensing procedure as the stationary facilities before the law was amended, they are now exempt from licensing if they are operated for less than 12 months on the same site. The specialists hope that the simplified licensing procedure will bring an increase in the number of reclamations completed. At the very least, there ought to be a move away from containment toward decontamination measures. However, fears are being voiced in the skeptics' camp that the mobile plant market will become increasingly crowded with suppliers whose systems are less than state-of-the-art. It was expected that increasing competition would lower prices, but as high-performance systems would necessarily cost more than, for instance, plants with a lower conditioning capacity and/or minimum air and effluent treatment functions, overall quality would fall. Air exhaust and effluent conditioning systems often accounted for two-thirds of stationary plants, explained a Nordac spokesman at the symposium. The state of the art and the degree to which it has been adopted vary in Germany. Soil conditioning plants, 15 of which are currently operating throughout the Federal Republic, present an advanced level of development, but the situation with thermal plants is quite different: To date, there is only one trial plant running in the whole of Germany. Other countries are further ahead in this field, the Netherlands, for instance, having several plants in operation. As numerous licenses for thermal plants are currently pending, experts assume that this technology will soon be available in Germany as well. The state of the art for biological processes is well defined, particularly for on-site processes, although disillusionment is spreading as to on-site reclamation strategies -- those not involving the removal of soil -- say insiders. The scope for using these processes is proving limited. Clearly Defined Ceilings Called For Even more than simplified licensing procedures for reclamation plants, clearly defined ceilings for soil contaminants are being called for. The lack of certainty as to how far a reclamation project has to go is a major factor in discouraging many people from even considering a project of this type. The regulations on soil conservation are currently scattered over several areas of legislation (e.g. laws on water, air, and waste disposal). In addition, some laender have their own statutory regulations on polluted sites. Great hopes are being vested in the soil conservation bill currently being drafted, the purpose of which will be to conserve the soil in its multiplicity of functions, to safeguard it against hazardous modifications, to remedy damage that has already been done, and to prevent such damage from affecting mankind and the environment. A comprehensive range of procedures for conditioning polluted sites is also envisaged. Basis for Technical Directive on Soil However, the primary purpose of the law is to create the prerequisites for incorporating soil conservation requirements into statutory orders and administrative provisions. In particular, the law will form the basis for the Technical Directive on Soil, in which binding values will be laid down for the soil, with regulations on prevention and hazard aversion to the fore. Today's large number of lists of soil ceiling values will thus be replaced by a single, nationwide system of rules. An inventory of various assessment aids and recommendations for treating contaminated soils has been commissioned by a Laender Waste Management Association working party. It emerges from this inventory that recommended soil values are currently largely set with reference to the purposes for which the land is used and the resources to be preserved. Based on significance and function, experts from the Ruhr District's Institute of Hygiene in Gelsenkirchen differentiate between: -- Background values: Generally widespread or typical regional pollutant concentrations in soils outside actual or suspected polluted sites; -- Test values: Concentration values in excess of which further investigations are required, but below which the hazard risk may be regarded as negligible; -- Critical values: Maximum concentrations that must not be exceeded, as individual cases may present an intolerable level of risk in particular circumstances; in the event of these values being exceeded, the type and extent of salvage measures and reclamation methods must be decided without delay; -- Reclamation target values: Maximum concentrations for soils to be achieved on site using salvage and reclamation measures, and wherever possible to be further reduced; -- Incorporation values: Quality criteria/maximum concentrations for soils to be incorporated or reincorporated into multiple-use areas. In addition to drawing up the actual values, great emphasis is placed on clearly defining the concepts and on implementing the recommended values (specifications for sampling and analysis procedures, for instance). There is still a considerable need for coordination in establishing the figures for various types of ground use. Far-Reaching Ideas It emerged clearly from the "Environmental Conservation Forum," which the Rhineland Technical Monitoring Board organized in Cologne at the beginning of October 1993, that this is not all that the representatives of the laender expect of the law on soil conservation. Dr. Hans-Joachim Pietrzeniuk, representing the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia, stressed the need to create a full range of facilities for assessing and treating polluted soil; a soil information system, soil pollution maps, and areas scheduled for long-term monitoring should all be considered. The laender's main hope is that financing mechanisms will be introduced at federal level for measures for which specific responsibility cannot be apportioned. In view of the federal and land governments' empty coffers, this could give rise to a dispute that will be difficult to settle in the near future. However, if areas are to be made rapidly available for investors, particularly in the new federal laender, solutions for financing the requisite reclamation work must be found at an early date.
