Mr Uthai made the comment yesterday after meeting with the chairman of Iran's Government Trading Cooperative, Mahmoud Ardakani. Iran proposed to buy the rice on credit from the Thai Government with delivery scheduled for March but Mr Uthai said the authority to do that now rests with the Rice Policy Committee chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan. Mr Uthai said does not want to intervene in the private-sector rice market. He said the Government has not entirely ruled out government-to-government sales but he believes the private sector should have the first opportunity to make deals. [passage omitted]
