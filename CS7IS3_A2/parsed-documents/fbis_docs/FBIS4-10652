To achieve this, he planned to gain access to large shipments of beef earmarked for Israel in order to poison them with a powerful toxic substance. This warning was announced by the Israeli intelligence service soon after it informed the Paraguayan National Police that Ahmad al-Maqdaf, a fundamentalist Shiite, had arrived here a month ago. Police Superintendent Enrique de Jesus Martinetti, director of the National Police Intelligence Department, confirmed this report and noted that the information was provided by the Israeli secret service. The terrorist had to locate meat-packing plants that export meat to Israel, find a way to gain access to the products, and then poison them with a deadly toxic substance. The consequences would have been devastating. The objective was to kill hundreds of Israelis in important cities in their country. The name of the meat-packing plants are "Frigobeef," located in Capitan Lombardo close to Artigas, and "San Antonio" in the city of the same name. Intelligence Department personnel went to those meat-packing plants and warned the managers to take the necessary precautions by not allowing strangers on their premises, thereby foiling any sabotage attempts. Martinetti noted that the meat was imported by a private -- not government-owned -- Israeli meat-packing plant. He said: "We were alerted by the Israelis and are now conducting inquiries. We have been informed that this Shiite, Ahmad al-Maqdaf, intended to poison a large shipment of beef that was going to Israel. We have apparently foiled this attempt with the help of the Israelis. Al-Maqdaf has been already seen in Lebanon." [passage omitted]
