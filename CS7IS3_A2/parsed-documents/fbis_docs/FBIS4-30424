A relevant Foreign Ministry official said that "the reprocessing process that generates plutonium is inevitable if North Korea permanently stores extracted nuclear fuel rods." He added that "in the event that North Korea attempts to merely store fuel rods without reprocessing them, there is the danger of explosion and of radioactivity leakage."
