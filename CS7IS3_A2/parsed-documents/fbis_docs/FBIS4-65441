While SPD chairman Rudolf Scharping criticized the German Confederation of Trade and Industry's [DIHT] "biased support" for the ruling government coalition, the Association of German Industry [BDI] criticized the SPD's government plans, claiming that they are geared to a redistribution of funds. Industry's criticism of the SPD program coincides with the publication of the results of new surveys showing that more people think Helmut Kohl will win the October elections than they did a few weeks ago. SPD general manager Guenter Verheugen said that the SPD leadership rejects the industrial criticism, based on false assumptions, as a "massive biased interference" on Kohl's behalf. Vorheugen "urgently" called on the industrial associations to be more restrained and "not interfere in the election campaign in such a way." Scharping revealed a five-page letter he had written to DIHT Chairman Hans Peter Stihl, rejecting the criticism Stihl had expressed one week ago and asking him "for the sake of future cooperation to be so kind as to restrict his criticism of SPD resolutions to those resolutions which the SPD has actually adopted." Among other things, Stihl had said that Scharping's appointment as chancellor would have a negative effect on economic development and employment, as illustrated by the SPD's plans for taxation and energy policy. In his letter to Stihl, Scharping reminded him that during mutual talks, the SPD leadership and the DIHT had agreed that the only way to solve the economic difficulties was gradually to overcome the problem of unemployment. The SPD, said Scharping, has recognized this need and drawn clear conclusions. For instance, it has resolved that taxation cannot exceed the level planned for 1995. All the expenditures foreseen in the SPD program are strictly dependent on the size of funds, said Scharping, who also promised that the SPD would attach priority to a reduction in wage-related costs on account of the competitiveness of enterprises. Further in this letter to Stihl, Scharping dismissed Stihl's opinion that the SPD's plan to impose greater tax on family firms and increase capital gains tax would lead to the liquidation of entire businesses. He also rejected the claim that the SPD was trying to impose the costs of German unity on one-fifth of the population. Apart from the DIHT, BDI General Manager Ludolf Georg von Wartenberg and employers' confederation chief Klaus Murmann also criticized the SPD plans. Wartenberg said the SPD was too concerned about a redistribution of funds, and Murmann charged the SPD with failing to explain how it intended to finance its expenditures.
