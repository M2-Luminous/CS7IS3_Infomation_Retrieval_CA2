The members of the AFPCDM consider that the Gagauz issue can be solved by adopting a regulation, which would represent the interests of national minorities. "Such a law exists: It was adopted by the former parliament and was named the Law on National Minorities," mentioned Rosca, adding that decentralization of state power would contribute to a faster settlement of the dispute with the Southern districts. Rosca also declared that the adoption of a special juridical status for the Southern districts will mark the beginning of the federalization of the republic. "The AFPCDM will oppose this draft bill," declared Rosca.
