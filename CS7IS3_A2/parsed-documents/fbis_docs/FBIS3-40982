The report says: 1) The British Defense Ministry conveyed to the British Prime Minister's Office its concern over `Japan being forced to abandon its non-nuclear stance'; 2) a document submitted in January to the joint Intelligence Committee, the British Government's main security body, notes Japan has all the equipment and technology necessary for an early deployment of nuclear weapons; and 3) an expert who read the document said `Japan could have already acquired its own nuclear bombs, and all they would need to do is to select adequate amounts of plutonium.'"
