[passage omitted] Our correspondent Nicolas Poincare has been accompanying the RPF troops for several days as they advance on Kigali. He sends his first report this evening on the particularly tragic situation in Rwanda: [Poincare] [passage omitted] The RPF, scenting victory, will not hear of a cease-fire, nor of the arrival of fresh UN troops. Dr Emile Roua Massirabo, deputy chairman of the RPF, explains that the arrival of UN troops would mean the preservation of the status quo, and hence continuing massacres in the areas held by the regular army. He said so yesterday in his headquarters in Kibungo: [Begin Massirabo recording] When they ask for such an intervention force, we have the feeling that on the one hand, they are telling us to stop pursuing the killers, and on the other, they (?will not) be able to stop the massacres, and they will be given a free hand to continue their vile work. [end recording] [Poincare] The UN troops can only look on impotently at this success. They cannot even use the airport any more. Nicolas Poincare, France Inter, Kibungo, Rwanda.
