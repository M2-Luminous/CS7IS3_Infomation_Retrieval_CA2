I did expect to be given lectures from Sarajevo... because this poor woman has seen the horrors of that war. She is wonderful and has done a great favor to the entire world and I do not reproach her for being angry, Clinton said at the end of his 90-minute confrontation with CNN reporters in Sarajevo, Jerusalem, Seoul, Johannesburg, and the Carter Center in Atlanta with some eminent journalists from all over the world. Clinton left a medium impression: His speech was full of cliches, two studios remarked that he dealt insufficiently with specific and concrete issues, he was humorous twice, made no major gaffes (Wolf Blitzer of CNN), and was better with domestic topics such as trade with Japan or Latin America than with Bosnia (Ralph Baker of CNN). The U.S. President showed that U.S. foreign policy has been torn apart into various sides, that it begins much but completes little, and that it does not use same criteria for similar crises in the world. Clinton pointed out the three priorities of U.S. foreign policy: security, economic progress, and democracy. Haiti was exhausted as the first topic of the program and then came Bosnia. Belgrade Television Journalist Miodrag Ilic, who popped up from somewhere, wanted to know whether the United States will change its strategy toward Bosnia and treat the warring sides equally instead of "satanizing the Serbs through the media" and when the sanctions on Serbia will be lifted. Unlike the generalized answers that he gave to the majority of other questions, Clinton was surprisingly concrete. The short answer was as follows: "No," the U.S. President said, "at least as long as the negotiations are under way." He openly said that the embargo on weapons for former Yugoslavia had become a joke, as it gave a huge strategic advantage to the Serbs and their heavy artillery and made ethnic cleansing easier. With her questions, Christiane Amanpour was beating Clinton down. She asked why he, as the leader of the free world, needed so long to articulate his policy toward Bosnia, why the West and the United States were hostages to those with a clear policy (the Bosnian Serbs), why he, with his vacillating policy, was setting a dangerous precedent that may make Kim Il-song and similar potentates take him less seriously than he would like. A frustrated Clinton provided a nervous and weak reply, but he nevertheless managed somehow to smoothe out the dispute with Christiane. In an extensive excuse for vacillating about Bosnian problem, Clinton said something that could be of interest to Croatia as well. In the case of Bosnia, we have no control over the situation, we only have influence, the U.S. President said. During his speech Clinton mentioned Croatia only once and that was only in passing, while speaking about Bosnia. However, it is important to be aware of the part about control in this case too. Namely, somebody who controls a certain territory has control and the U.S. influence can, albeit does not have to, be a weight that will help him extend his control to those territories that he temporarily loses. This is important so that one can bring down to earth the people who thought that if things get even worse, the U.S. cavalry will invariably ride in to help. It might come in the form of strong diplomatic or military support, but not to aid the weak, but to help the strong. Another link with Croatia can be discerned in Clinton's reply to a Palestinian journalist's question concerning help for the Palestinians in the occupied territories. Two billion dollars have already been waiting and the U.S. Administration will prompt Jewish and Arab lobbies in the United States to invest private capital the moment they see the peace is being respected. The message to Croatia would read as follows: Consistent respect for the Washington Agreement and Croatia's curbing the Herzeg-Bosnian practice of "hitting the brakes" will start opening the door to foreign capital and touch off the magic suggestion by the U.S. Administration to emigre and other capital in the United States: Croatia is no longer a region of risk. Final peace and agreement on the status of the occupied territories will let Croatia into the world. Until then, there will be that small consolation in the form of the recent first installment of the $10-million U.S. loan to Croatia, which was really meant to stimulate U.S. cotton producers to sell their surplus to Croatia. And there is a third, albeit not the least important matter. Where were the Croatian journalists in Atlanta? Was somebody from Croatian Radio and Television [HRT] there, but not invited to speak? Or was nobody there because they were not invited? Or were they invited, but did not accept? Only CNN and HRT know the answer. Only it has happened again that journalists sent into the world Serbian deceptions without a Croatian reply.
