Abonosimova from Vladivostok; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] The administration in Maritime Kray considers it necessary to introduce direct presidential rule on the region's territory. Asking for privileged economic conditions in taxation, customs duties, subsidies, and compensation for two to three years, the governor Ye. Nazdratenko believes that it is necessary to introduce a state of emergency on the territory of the Maritime region in order to fight gangsterism and crime. Discipline and a tough executive authority are needed. Insofar as the kray's economy and management cannot be separated, the head of administration believes that it would be very appropriate for the kray to switch to direct state rule, at the same time as a resolution on the special economic situation of the kray is signed in September after the arrival here of Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. A system for the compulsary implementation of presidential decrees has been drafted. He had the following to say about this. [Nazdratenko] The government should take action on all of these matters. Maybe even, in many cases, without the agreement of parliament because of the inefficiency of the enterprises on the territory of our country. [Abonosimova] Sure of the support of the president and the tendency of parliament to put a brake on matters, Nazdratenko, asked who would make the decision to introduce emergency rule, said: [Nazdratenko] The Federation Council, of course -- that would be the ideal choice.
