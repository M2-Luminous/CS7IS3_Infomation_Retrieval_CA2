The dramatic escalation of the crisis with the bombing of Serbian targets by U.S. aircraft comes at a time when Athens is passing through a delicate and difficult phase in the handling of big national issues: The Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] issue is at its most crucial climax since our country has been faced with the prospect of international recognition of that southern former Yugoslav republic. At the same time, we see the greatest tension since the March 1987 crisis prevailing in Greek-Turkish relations, while the attack against the Albanian border post and, rather suspiciously, the provocative statement by Sali Berisha highlight the fragile character of the relevant tranquility that has prevailed for the past few months in Greek-Albanian relations. It is clear that whatever turn they take--an escalation of clashes or a return to the negotiating table--the developments in Bosnia will intensify the already oppressive pressure on Athens that began after the imposition of the trade blockade against Skopje. The need for that country's stability will become an urgent priority so that the United States and our European partners will not be faced with a new area of conflict in the south of the former Yugoslavia. That is, the new turn in the Bosnian conflict and the further U.S. involvement in the Balkans pose a scenario in which our national issues might be regarded as annoying pending issues that must be cleared up as soon as possible. Of course it is obvious to us that, in the shadow of the threat of a more general Balkan crisis, simultaneous pressure for a solution to the Skopje issue and for a compromise formula that at least "freezes" the tension in Greek-Turkish relations would result in a most unfavorable situation for our country. It is obvious that now, almost three years after the outbreak of the Yugoslav conflict when there is a danger of uncontrolled escalation there, our country is unable to make its weight felt because its involvement in the Skopjean issue has made it to a great extent part of the crisis.
