Shushkevich is Filled by a Militia General"] [Text] Late in the evening on 26 January 1994 in the Oval Hall of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus, among a small group of like-thinkers from the former party nomenklatura the power of the Communists was finally restored. As a result of a secret vote (in booths), the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, S. Shushkevich--the only "new face" on the republic's political Olympus--was recalled. Most of the people took what happened calmly; there were no heated rallies on the squares. What happened was no surprise to the people because they knew their parliament. The parliament of Belarus is a unique phenomenon of modern times. It is the largest in the world (in terms of the number of members of parliament per capita) and the last on the territory of the former USSR to be elected under the leadership of the CPSU. Only in the Belarusian parliament are there people who got there through quotas of public organizations and, naturally, the Communist Party. The revival of the relic could have occurred at any time--all that were needed were favorable conditions. The occasion was the arrest in Minsk of two ideological soulmates from Lithuania--Burokjavicius and Ermalavicius. Everyone knew that the former leaders of the Communist Party of the neighboring republic were living in Belarus. They were hidden, as it turned out, quite professionally, with the help of Belarusian Communists, who were constantly moving from one conspirator's apartment to another's. Having isolated itself from the people for a week, the Belarusian parliament expressed its international solidarity with the two like-thinkers, demanded their return to Belarus, and at the same time demanded the firing of the internal affairs minister and the KGB chairman. Certainly not because they committed certain procedural transgressions when arresting and exiling the Lithuanians. The procurator general named a more serious blunder: He had verbally sanctioned the arrest (which he admitted, although not immediately). But parliament scolded him and let him stay in his post. And the generals who were fired were paying for the fact that two months earlier they had had the audacity to write an open letter to the Supreme Soviet in which they protested the Council of Ministers' usurpation of the military and militia structures. In the Supreme Soviet's justification for recalling Shushkevich the phrase "lack of control" of the activity of the aforementioned generals slipped through. But that was not the only reason for such a radical decision. An additional, populist wording was also generated: "manifestation of personal indiscretion." This was suggested by the chairman of the temporary commission of the Supreme Soviet "on corruption," a people's deputy and sovkhoz director, Aleksandr Lukashenko--a rank-and-file participant in the political action to remove Shushkevich. The farmers' newspaper NOVAYA ZEMLYA conferred on Lukashenko the title "person of the week." His report on corruption presented a mixture of generally known facts, slander, rural hatred of another's good fortune, and ideological garbage. The sovkhoz director dug up inaccuracies in the documents of the repair and construction administration of the Council of Ministers, which had repaired Shushkevich's apartment and dacha and had placed a marker on his mother's grave. Not considering it necessary to hear the accused out, the parliamentary relic rejoiced: Get that mafia chieftain out of our ranks! By the loutish fist of Lukashenko the party and state nomenklatura, united by ideology and corruption, eliminated from parliament the foreign element--Shushkevich. To make the fist more deadly, troops obedient to the Council of Ministers were brought to the Supreme Soviet twice (illegally). But the Communists still would not have dared to remove Shushkevich (there were no clear-cut reasons and his ratings with the public were high) if external conditions had not been favorable--Russia. It is a clear pattern: When there is a political storm in Russia, there is political calm in Belarus. Here people are waiting to see how things end there. And then they will act accordingly. It is possible to see Russian processes in Belarus without a magnifying glass. So the Minsk version of the restoration of communism is quite plausible in Moscow. The success of the Russian Communists in the elections and the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov--these were animating factors in the revival of the Belarusian Communist relic. It never was an independent organism. Having gained sovereignty, it lost its head and froze in inaction. The structural rearrangement of the national economy in Belarus was never begun. The reforms were merely declared. The land is "public." The gigantic plants imposed on the republic by imperial division of labor are standing idle without raw material, batching items, or wages. The "rabbit" is rapidly growing thin. The population is becoming impoverished: Belarus has the lowest per capita income in the CIS and the most expensive meat. The main point in the government "program" has remained unchanged for several years: "to restore economic ties with Russia." That is, to restore everything to the way it was before. "Economic alliance," "unification of monetary systems"--in the minds of Belarusian strategists these are steps on the way to political unification, to a "new federation" (the main slogans of the pro-Council of Ministers People's Movement of Belarus). Shushkevich was an overt (and covert) counterbalance to the communist forces of the two countries--Russia and Belarus--who hate him because of the "Belovezha conspiracy" and are nurturing plans for the restoration of the USSR. As soon as Shushkevich was sent away, Council of Ministers Chairman V. Kebich, making no secret of it, said that he saw a "closer" association behind the economic union with Russia. And he expressed joy over the absence of Gaydar and Fedorov, who will not get in the way now. And he immediately announced his idea of reorganizing the entire system of propaganda and agitation: "We will take command of the mass media." He did not take such liberties under Shushkevich--was he embarrassed or something? S. Shushkevich is an undoubted loss to Belarusian democracy and national revival. With all of his shortcomings (inconsistency, gentleness), he was the guarantor of an intelligent and civilized parliament. Shushkevich's departure from the political Olympus signifies a decline of its moral-ethical level. The youth in parliament distinguished themselves by special cruelty during the process of the assault on Shushkevich. The "public" elders passed the communist baton on to them. The nomenklatura generated an organic particle of itself to replace Shushkevich. Comrade general. It should not have been otherwise. It was predictable that the nomenklatura would rely on trouser stripes and shoulder boards--on force. Mechyslaw Hryb was elected chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus (by a secret vote, in booths). He is 57 years old. He is a militiaman by education and career. He rose to be chief of the internal affairs administration of Vitebsk Oblast. He headed up the permanent commission of the Supreme Soviet on questions of national security, defense, and fighting crime. M. Hryb is a completely unknown, lackluster personality in Belarus. He is a person without a program of his own. He stated that the program had already been developed by the Supreme Soviet and is being implemented by the government, which he supports. He has stated that the foreign policy of Belarus will remain the same. But there will be adjustments: a) Belarus will ratify the Treaty on Collective Security Within the CIS (Shushkevich put forth reservations); b) Belarus will no longer talk about pure neutrality since such a concept does not exist; c) Belarus is in favor of the speediest and closest union with Russia (Shushkevich spoke more about an equal economic partnership)... The people are trying to guess which he will be called: MeCHYslaw or MecheSLAW. Announcers use both versions.
