Over the past few days, it has repeatedly been recalled how the last presidential election that was held here in Berlin in the Reichstag building took place in March 1969. Many of you may not know it, but, at that time, my wife and I were citizens of West Berlin and we saw how the GDR Government closed the roads leading into Berlin for a few hours, even though no one knew how long it would really take at that time. We never considered it possible that we would live to see an event like this again. It is a miracle. It is a miracle that we are experiencing, and we -- I above all -- are very grateful to you, to those who voted for me and to those who were unable to vote for me, that this has become possible. I deliberately address those who refused to vote for me for their own good reasons. I will try to conduct my office in such a way that in the end, they will regret not having voted for me. [laughter, applause] Let me say a few words to my fellow candidates. For many months, there were four of us and we were in constant contact with each other. We had a good relationship. I do not claim that I did not want to receive the majority, but I would not have been envious of any of the three others -- and this is not just an attitude; I really mean it. I also thank them for the way in which we dealt with each other over the past few months. I believe that what we did was a good piece of democracy, and it is never wrong if, in a state like ours, things go this way. My cordial thanks and respect to all of you. I will do everything -- even though this is only a formula, as you know -- to be the president of all Germans. [applause] In our state and in our society, there are many borders that run through us -- borders of conviction, borders of origin, borders of historical experience, borders also of economic interest, but, ladies and gentlemen, there are innumerable things that we all have in common, which does not always become clear in the controversy of the parties and in the controversy of the large associations, but which must be clear so that this state and this liberal society continue to exist and are able to act. I will do everything to stress these unifying things, these things that unite us all here in this hall and those who are represented by us. Our path into the future is more uncertain than it was five or 10 years ago. The future that we are moving into is difficult. It is not predictable without any problems as it used to be for some decades in the past. However, ladies and gentlemen, we Germans have the strength, we Europeans have the strength to find this way and to follow it. We should never doubt that, and we should never hide this fact. It is part of our life. If we did not have this hope, we would not be able to follow the path that we are facing. I say this in particular referring to the irritations that arise today from the difficulties in the wake of German reunification. I address the citizens of the former FRG, who now must make many sacrifices. Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot spare telling you again and again: This is the compensation for an injustice of international history, which was committed by coincidence at the Elbe border. [applause] On this side and the other side of the old Wall there lived Germans. On this side and the other side of the old Wall, there lived industrious, imaginative, and creative people -- and the ones progressed more quickly, and the others did not. The ones did so because the Americans helped them, which we do not want to forget in this hour [applause] and, therefore, ladies and gentlemen, because they had a political system that promoted the fruits of their industriousness and did not again and again ruin them and hinder them. This was an injustice of history, and those who were favored by this injustice have the moral duty now to create a balance. I also want to address the people in the new laender. They must understand that they are not a burden for us but an enrichment. [applause] They are contributing incredible things -- in terms of experiences, which we in the West did not have. They lived in a completely different world, in which many things were more humane than in our world, in which many things were completely different. They contribute experiences from their professions. Treasures are lying fallow there, which must be dug out again and on which these people can rely. We must be happy -- and I am happy -- that they are with us again. [applause] Madame President, ladies and gentlemen, over the next five years, I want to represent Germany as it really is -- peace-loving; freedom-living; capable; trying, at least, for justice; ready for solidarity; tolerant; open to the world; and, which almost seems to be the most important thing for me, ladies and gentlemen, easygoing. [applause] We Germans have not always been easygoing. One certainly cannot claim that. We have managed relatively well to eliminate this tenseness of the late nation. It is my greatest concern today that this tenseness might return, and we must counter this, perhaps also by some elegant formulations, by some casual words. This Germany must play its role in the world, but it must be easygoing and must not show its teeth. This is the most important thing that we have to do over the next few decades. [applause] Just as I began with a personal reminiscence, I would like to close with a personal reminiscence, ladies and gentlemen. I began my career almost 30 years ago in this city in West Berlin, as it was called at that time. Then I moved around for 25 years. Your vote has now brought me back to this city, which I have never stopped loving. I thank you. Berlin, I am back again. [applause]
