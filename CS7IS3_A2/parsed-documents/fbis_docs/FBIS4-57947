Since the enforcement of Resolution 917 of the UN Security Council, consisting of a total embargo, which has already been imposed on our country, we in the FRDH -- jointly with four other people's organizations -- cannot remain indifferent toward the suffering of the Haitian people. This is the reason we are again asking Gen. Cedras to show goodwill by standing behind his signature.
