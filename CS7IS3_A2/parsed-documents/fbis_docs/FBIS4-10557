Its purpose is to explore business possibilities, and it hopes to find opportunities for Brazil not only to expand its investments and trade with that country--currently totaling around $300 million--but also to sound out the markets in neighboring countries. The Odebrecht Group, for example, which is part of the expedition, has become accustomed in recent years to participating in bidding and sounding out opportunities not only in South Africa, where it has an office in Johannesburg, but also in neighboring countries that are considered promising, such as Swaziland and Tanzania, as well as Angola and Mozambique, where the group has been active in the past. "This is an exploratory trip," editor Fatima Belchior was told yesterday by Jose Coutinho, vice president of Braspetro. That Petrobras subsidiary explored the possibility of building oil tanks in the country last year, but was unable to sign any exploratory risk contracts. Even the approaching date for the first elections and the uncertainties regarding the first government of national integration's chances for economic and political stability are not diminishing the optimism of the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning the prospects for increased business with that country. The head of the Trade Promotion Department, Minister Celso Marcos Vieira de Souza, says that even though 47 percent of South Africa's manpower is unemployed, that fact is offset by other, positive indicators: a recent revival of the economy, with the gross domestic product expected to grow by 3 percent this year; inflation of around 9 percent per year; and the willingness of the South Africans to encourage investments in the form of joint ventures both locally and in third countries. This will allow Brazilian businessmen to open new business fronts in the neighboring countries. The mission chief's schedule includes a meeting with Nelson Mandela's economic team. The Trade Promotion Department of the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is making arrangements for a similar mission to Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaysia in April. That delegation will include, among other companies, construction firms such the Odebrecht Group (which is already active in Singapore), the Maxion farm implement firm, and Petrobras, which will sound out the opportunities for offshore risk contracts in the region. Braspetro's Coutinho is not ruling out the possibility that the firm will operate under the risk contract system in Vietnam, although he feels it is too early to make any definite statements. "Vietnam needs everything" is how Vieira de Souza sums it up. During that same visit, the Brazilian Government is scheduled to pick the residence where it will install its embassy in Hanoi.
