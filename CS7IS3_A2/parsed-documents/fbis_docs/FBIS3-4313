Si Jiuyi said: The drug problem is still very serious in Yunnan, as the temptation of money has encouraged large numbers of offenders to take the risk. The incidence of drug trafficking is showing an upward trend, and the following new developments have been observed. An increase in major drug trafficking cases. After making some money, drug traffickers tend to try making colossal profits by engaging in transactions involving 100 kg, 200 kg, or even larger quantities of narcotics. -- A steady growth in armed drug trafficking. Because they are aware of the consequences they will face after being arrested, drug traffickers often fiercely resist the armed police. Last year, Yunnan police seized a total of 33 military firearms, 13 other firearms, and 50 hand grenades. -- Progressively better organized means of trafficking. Drug trafficking using cars and motorcycles is no longer a novelty. Criminals use mobile phones and walkie-talkies to communicate with one another and transport drugs through such methods as relaying or sending traffickers and drugs separately. -- The increase in sources of drugs. Drugs used to only come from Burma's Golden Triangle, but now they are infiltrating into China from Laos and Vietnam. Last year, Yunnan's border towns Honghe and Wenshan cracked over 200 drug cases originating from Laos and Vietnam. The increase of drug traffickers from other provinces. Last year, Yunnan police arrested nearly 900 drug traffickers from other provinces, and the scope of areas they came from increased from 22 provinces and autonomous regions in the previous year to 27 provinces and autonomous regions. Most active were drug traffickers from Sichuan, Zhejiang, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, and Xinjiang. Senior Colonel Si Jiuyi explained that the antinarcotic work is currently in a very difficult stage. As Yunnan borders on Vietnam, Burma, and Laos, the residents in the border areas share customs and languages with those three countries, and the border markers are not very clear, thus posing enormous difficulty for antinarcotic operations. Drug traffickers tend to be desperadoes. They even have such slogans as "You can execute me, but my future generations will benefit" or "I may stay in jail for a while, but I will enjoy prosperity for the rest of my life." Criminal organizations give pensions to the families of arrested or executed drug traffickers. Another problem is that antinarcotic operations are short of funds and manpower and suffer from backward equipment. In one case, a drug-fighting unit leader had to chase a criminal by bicycle. In the end, the criminal got away in a car. Si Jiuyi said: Drugs from Yunnan harm not only Yunnan, but also the entire country. The antinarcotic work is of vital importance. No matter how difficult it is, we must not let drugs and firearms flow inland. By adopting the tactic of blocking on the first front, investigating on the second front, and intercepting on the third front and by relying on the support of the masses, Yunnan armed police forces have been able to conduct a stern crackdown on drug crimes and can bring about a steady increase in the number of cases cracked over the years. Many armed policemen have proved themselves to be valiant fighters, have rendered meritorious services, and have received awards. Two of China's 10 Young People of the Year are antinarcotic heroes from Yunnan. Si Jiuyi also revealed that over 20 soldiers from the Yunnan armed police forces laid down their lives in antinarcotic battles over the past few years.
