FR941027-0-00015 FR941027-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Bureau of Prisons 28 CFR Part 570 [BOP&hyph;1005&hyph;F] RIN 1120&hyph;AA10 Furloughs; Transportation Costs AGENCY: Bureau of Prisons, Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this document the Bureau of Prisons is amending its rule on furloughs. Section 570.33(c) contained provisions governing the choice of transportation for transfers to community corrections centers. As revised, these provisions have been simplified to indicate that an inmate may choose the means of transportation if all transportation costs are to be borne by the inmate. The intended effect of the amendment is to reduce costs to the Bureau. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, HOLC Room 754, 320 First Street, NW., Washington, DC 20534. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roy Nanovic, Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, phone (202) 514&hyph;6655. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on furloughs. A final rule on this subject was published in the Federal Register July 1, 1981 (46 FR 34552) and was amended September 30, 1983 (48 FR 45051) and January 21, 1994 (59 FR 3510). A proposed rule was published in the Federal Register January 21, 1994 (59 FR 3512) for the purpose of amending the provisions in ยง570.33(c) which state that the Warden may allow an inmate scheduled for transfer to a community corrections center (CCC) to choose the means of transportation to the CCC. Under these provisions, the inmate paid all costs when the distance travelled was not over 150 miles, but the inmate merely paid the difference in cost when the distance was over 150 miles and the inmate preferred to travel by plane rather than by public ground transportation. As proposed for revision, paragraph (c) was simplified to indicate that an inmate may choose the means of transportation if all transportation costs are to be borne by the inmate. The comment period closed on March 22, 1994. The Bureau received no comment on this rulemaking, and the Bureau is therefore adopting the proposed amendment as a final rule without change. The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866, and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 570 Prisoners. Kathleen M. Hawk, Director, Bureau of Prisons.
