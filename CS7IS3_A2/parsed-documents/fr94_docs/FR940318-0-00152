Stirling cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to refrigerated transport using CFC&hyph;12, R&hyph;500, or R&hyph;502. Stirling cycle systems have been in use for many years in this end-use. For further information, see the discussion on the Stirling cycle under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers. (g) Nitrogen direct gas expansion. Nitrogen direct gas expansion is acceptable as an alternative technology to refrigerated transport using CFC&hyph;12, R&hyph;500, or R&hyph;502. Nitrogen is expanded within a refrigerated transport unit to absorb heat. The cycle is open; the nitrogen is released to the atmosphere after absorbing heat from the container. Nitrogen is a common gas that is nontoxic and nonflammable. It has been used successfully for many years in this end-use. (20) CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 Retail Food Refrigeration, Retrofit.
