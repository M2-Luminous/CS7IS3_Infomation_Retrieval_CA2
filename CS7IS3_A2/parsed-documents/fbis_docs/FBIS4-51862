Secretary general of the Central Committee of the Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] Party Feliciano Salomao Gundana said when he received the Korean ambassador to his country on April 20 that he hoped that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula would be solved peacefully through talks between the DPRK and the U.S. The Korean people, he said, will win certainly in their struggle for a solution of the nuclear issue under the wise guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. The Zimbabwe-Korea Solidarity and Friendship Association and the Zimbabwean National Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea in a joint statement April 7 urged the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency to give up their schemings to stifle the DPRK under the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear development" by the DPRK. The statement said if the forces hostile to the DPRK try to fish in troubled waters after aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula on purpose, it is a miscalculation. A letter adopted at the annual meeting of the Ghana-DPRK Friendship Association which was held in Ghana on April 7 said the U.S. hostile policy of stifling the DPRK will end in failure, and urged the United States and the South Korean authorities to immediately stop their war provocation moves.
