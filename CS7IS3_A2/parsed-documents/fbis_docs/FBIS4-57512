The Romanian premier was welcomed at the airport by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. The visit started with an interview between the Romanian premier and the Paraguayan president. Virtually, there is no tradition of Romanian-Paraguayan relations. Diplomatic relations were established only in 1992. The Romanian party considers that actions should be started soon, to secure a development of these relations. Priorities are the realization of adequate diplomatic representation in the two capitals, the conclusion of the first inter-government agreements, the development of trade. The Paraguayan party has already shown interest in the domain of economic cooperation, in the building of a Romanian car assembly line, the building of cotton spinning mills, of electricity transport lines, oil and mining units. Trade and economic cooperation agreements and an agreement on mutual promotion and protection of investments are expected to be signed during Premier Vacaroiu's visit.
