The circular stresses: Property rights trading activities organized by provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal governments must be submitted to the State Council for examination and approval. Trading activities must cease immediately, and formalities for examination and approval must be carried out if such formalities have not been carried out. City governments below the prefectural level are not permitted to organize property rights trading activities of state-owned enterprises. Property rights of state-owned enterprises belong to the state. The transfer of property rights of locally managed state-owned enterprises is subject to the examination and approval of people's governments of cities above the prefectural level. The transfer of property rights of state-owned enterprises managed by central authorities is subject to the examination and approval of relevant State Council departments. The transfer of property rights of all exceptionally large, and large state-owned enterprises (including those locally managed), should be submitted to the State Council for examination and approval. The circular points out: Before transferring their property rights, state-owned enterprises must, in accordance with the stipulations of the "Procedures for Managing the Appraisal of State Property," earnestly evaluate their assets, including land-use rights, and complete formalities concerning changes in property rights and the cancellation of registration in accordance with relevant state stipulations. Proceeds from the transfer of property rights of state-owned enterprises must be used, first of all, to repay bank debts and make proper arrangements for employees' maintenance. The balance of proceeds can then be specially used by local governments to support structural readjustment or to supplement the capital of other state-owned enterprises that are in need. However, the proceeds must not be used for regular expenditures or to offset budgetary deficits or to pay wages and bonuses. Departments managing state-owned property must strengthen their supervision over the use of proceeds from the transfer of property rights by state-owned enterprises. Splitting shares of or selling property rights of state-owned enterprises at low prices, as well as distributing such rights free of charge to individuals, are strictly banned. The transfer of property rights or shares of state-owned enterprises on credit is prohibited. Enterprises must undertake corrective measures if they have already done these things. When transferring property rights of state-owned enterprises, it is necessary to take specific measures to properly provide jobs and social security for workers, while doing a good job of handling ideological work among workers (including retired workers) to maintain social stability. The circular asks that activities of the property rights market and trading organizations be temporarily halted, and that relevant State Council departments promptly formulate new procedures for governing property rights trading of state-owned enterprises so as to establish the standardized and legalized management of property rights trading of state-owned enterprises and its proceeds. Provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal governments and relevant State Council departments must earnestly implement the stipulations of this circular as well as realistically strengthen their supervision and management over the state property of enterprises. Concerned parties and principal administrative leaders shall be investigated for their responsibility for violating state stipulations and causing the loss of state property.
