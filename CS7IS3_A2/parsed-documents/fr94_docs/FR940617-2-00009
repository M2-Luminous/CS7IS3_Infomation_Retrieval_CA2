Preliminary Determination: We preliminarily determine that silicomanganese from Brazil is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on December 2, 1993 (58 FR 64553, December 8, 1993), the following events have occurred. On December 27, 1993, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary determination in this case (see USITC Publication 2714, December, 1993). We issued the antidumping questionnaire on January 18, 1994, to Companhia Paulista de Ferro-Ligas and Sibra-Eletroside≈ïurgica Brasileira S/A (collectively, ``Paulista''). On January 24, 1994, representatives of the Department of Commerce (the Department) met with Paulista officials in Brazil to provide further explanation of the antidumping questionnaire and to answer outstanding technical and procedural questions. Responses to the questionnaire were received on February 4, 1994, and March 7, 1994. Petitioners in this investigation, Elkem Metals Company and the Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers, Local 3&hyph;639, submitted comments regarding deficiencies in Paulista's questionnaire responses on March 17 and 18, 1994. A supplemental questionnaire was issued on March 28, 1994. Paulista submitted responses to this questionnaire in April and May, 1994. On February 2 and 8, 1994, Paulista asked the Department to amend the product matching criteria included in Appendix V of its questionnaire. Petitioners submitted comments on Paulista's request on February 7 and 9, 1994. On February 10, 1994, we amended Appendix V with respect to the silicon content and sieve size categories (see letter from Gary Taverman to Dorsey & Whitney, dated February 10, 1994, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce). At the request of petitioners, on March 30, 1994, the Department postponed its preliminary determination until no later than June 10, 1994 (59 FR 16177, April 6, 1994).
