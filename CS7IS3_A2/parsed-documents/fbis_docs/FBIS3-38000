Following is the full text of the memorandum of accord. "Memorandum of Accord "Realising the complexity of the political and economic situation in our society and the need to take urgent and constructive measures to ensure Russia's safe exit from the crisis situation on the basis of the consolidation of all power structures and political forces, we adopt this memorandum. "Despite the diversity of our political and economic views, we have reached an understanding on the following goals: "To establish genuine democracy on the basis of the strict observance of constitutional norms and laws of the Russian Federation, to increase the responsibility of all levels of bodies of power for the state of law and order and for ensuring the safety of the individual, society and the state. "To provide for economic growth of the country on the basis of the development of all forms of ownership, regulated market relations, state support for the national economy, increasing economic independence of regions and manufacturers, reducing federal expenditures. "To ensure an even distribution of the burden of the crisis between regions and social groups, support for socially vulnerable groups of the population as necessary conditions for society's agreement with the proposed pace and direction of reform. "To reverse moral degradation of society, restore the prestige of honest labour, create conditions for the development of the individual and respect for the rights and freedoms of the human being. "We are convinced of the inadmissibility of destabilisation in a country which possesses huge arsenals of weapons, including weapons of mass destruction, the loss of control over which may have catastrophic consequences for mankind. Considering this, we believe it imperative to conduct a political struggle within a legal framework, without resorting to or calling for any form of violence, national hatred or persecution of dissidents. "In order to reach civil accord, we believe it necessary for the bodies of executive and legislative power to jointly consider the entire set of problems faced by political, economic and social reforms in society. "We suggest that the government of the Russian Federation in cooperation with the committees, factions and deputy groups of the State Duma and the Federation Council, with the president of the Russian Federation acting as coordinator, work out within the next two to three months a package of concerted measures to resolve the crisis with the participation of the country's specialists, politicians and public figures. "As far as regional policy is concerned, we agree to refrain from separatist approaches and insist on settling disputable issues through conciliatory procedures within the framework of the integral federation. "As concerning relations with the states -- republics of the former Soviet Union, we consider it important for Russia to abide by a policy aimed at strengthening inter-state relations and mutually advantageous economic ties, excluding actions aimed at provoking conflicts. "Amnesty for people who are currently under investigation or custody in connection with the events of August 19-21, 1991, May 1, 1993 and September 21 -- October 4, 1993, as well as amnesty for a number of people who have been sentenced for crimes in the economic sphere could become an integral part of the drive aimed at reaching national accord by the people of Russia. "We are convinced that only if all the constructive forces of society promptly develop coordinated measures on the basis of goals and principles proposed by this memorandum will ensure the country be ensured of a safe exit from the current crisis.
