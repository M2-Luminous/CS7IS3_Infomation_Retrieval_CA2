FR940526-0-00019 FR940526-0-00008 The major expense item is $11,500 for the manager's salary. The actual salary will be $10,781.50, based on nine months full-time work and three months at three-quarter time. An additional $718.50 was budgeted to have available and will only be spent if the workload necessitates full-time work. The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.02 per hundredweight, the same as last season. This rate, when applied to anticipated potato shipments of 1,476,750 hundredweight, will yield $29,535 in assessment income, which is adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period, estimated at $31,113, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of two fiscal periods' expenses. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the fiscal period begins on July 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal period apply to all assessable potatoes handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other budget actions issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.
