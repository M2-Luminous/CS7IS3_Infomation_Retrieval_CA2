In an exclusive interview to INTERFAX Ukranian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy said that 18.3 percent of the Fleet, or 164 warships and other vessels, are to be handed over to Ukraine. Radetskyy said that he had reported to President Kravchuk about the decision and the Ukrainian president backed it. Radetskyy said that Russia was ready to pay for the Ukrainian part of the fleet after it was divided 50-50. However, it is up to the governments to decide how payment should be effected, he said. Radetskyy also said that Russia decided on which ships it needed proceeding from the tasks faced by the Black Sea Fleet. The remaining vessels will be written-off or sold, he said. Earlier, spokesman for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, Aleksandr Kluban, told reporters that the split up would affect 833 warships on active duty and 61 reserve ships. Out of this number 18.3 percent or 164 ships will belong to Ukraine. The remaining 31.7 percent of ships out of Ukraine's 50 percent are to be sold to Russia, in line with the earlier agreements. Ukraine, said the spokesman, proposes that the matter should be settled by the signing of an agreement. The draft agreement is ready and will possibly be signed on 22 April. Radetskyy said that still unresolved is the issue of bases for the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian naval force. He said that both Ukraine and Russia have proposals on that score. He believes that the delegations should not leave Sevastopol without solving the problem. Meanwhile, Kluban said that there are difficulties in discussing the issue. Russia proposes to base its fleet at all Crimean bases (Sevastopol, Balaklava, Kerch, Donuzlav and Feodosiya). Moscow is flatly against the deployment of the Ukrainian naval force in the Crimea, said the spokesman. This is unacceptable for us, he said. The spokesman also said that the Ukrainian leadership will elevate the cash allowance for seamen of the Ukrainian fleet to be equal to that of the Black Sea Fleet officers. Kluban said that the problems associated with naval aviation were not discussed. An Interfax correspondent reports from Sevastopol that on Friday, later in the day, the Russian and Ukrainian defense ministers, Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy, are to sign an agreement which will fix parameters for the fleet's division. Experts who are drafting the document doubt that the delegations in Sevastopol will manage to solve the issue surrounding bases for the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian naval force.
