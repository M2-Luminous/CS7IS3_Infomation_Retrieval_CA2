The first unofficial declaration was presented in Vienna by Bekic, our ambassador to the CSCE, and it consisted of one sentence. The second declaration was made by Foreign Minister Granic, and it was a little more elaborate, but was again just a signal. The third declaration, this time official and unambiguous, was sent from the session of the Presidential Council for Defense and National Security. It is worth quoting again because of that, but also because it is a complex task for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "The Council has adopted the proposal to join the NATO program `PFP' and supports the intention of the Republic of Croatia to take part in the process. With regard to that, the Ministry has been entrusted with preparing the final proposal and taking steps to that effect." The final proposal, therefore, is to be drafted by the Foreign Ministry and presented to the appropriate state bodies and other political factors to be finally reshaped. Coordinated Admission Form The report makes it clear that the basic views of the president of the republic, key state bodies (whose leaders sit on the council), and of the leadership of the Croatian Democratic Community have been coordinated. Thus coordinated admission to the PFP process does not need to go through parliament, for example, or be reviewed and discussed with other parliamentary parties. Only the agreement between Croatia and NATO worequire this, and even then it would probably boil down to mere formal acceptance. As yet, no one has declared himself against NATO or for nonpartnership with NATO. However, if drafting the final proposal is a routine part of the job given to the Foreign Ministry, preparing "concrete steps for it" is an incredibly complex part of the job. Moreover, it cannot be implemented without the participation of the Ministry of Defense, the main repository of all future implementation plans, then also of expert groups from other departments, as well as strong public support. It is definitely not easy to predict what lies ahead for the Croatian delegation on the way to being registered on the list of candidates for membership of the PFP. Croatia is not in the position to have all the doors automatically open for it, but it will not have any doors slammed in its face either, although it does fall into the "high-risk group." The doors are closed to Serbia, for example, as it is involved in a three-year war against everything and everybody, but also because, from the standpoint of international law, it is a nonexistent country. The doors are wide open for Poland, for example, among other things, because it is doing a good job of meeting the political requirements, but also because its territory is strategically extremely important. First the Center and Then South If Croatia manages to refute accusations of intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina, only the fact that it is still in a state of war will stand in the way of becoming a member of the PFP. But that can be "patched up" with a promise to integrate the occupied territory into the state system in a peaceful manner, provided that the obligation is accepted and guaranteed by both sides. Until Croatia meets that condition, it could get into trouble walking both ways toward the PFP. On one hand, it would be met by those NATO members which think that a country in a state of war expects something that the PFP does not offer, and on the other, by those who accept Croatia but -- because of the principle of unanimous decisionmaking -- would hold back until Croatia's domestic problems were solved. All this has resulted in Croatia officially committing itself to the PFP so late and has made it decide to leave some time for the Foreign Ministry to prepare the proposal and decide on concrete steps. In the meantime, more and more East European and European nonaligned countries are being admitted to the PFP. Perhaps NATO headquarters is waiting to fill the quota for those countries first and then they will start seriously considering the admission of countries from the territory of former Yugoslavia. In other words, only when the problem of strategically the most important part of Europe -- its central plain -- is solved, will they deal with the south of Europe and with the European Mediterranean front. Security Problems The assumption is that there will be no serious problems with Slovenia at that point, but that it will also start demanding safety guarantees in case the Balkan powder keg explodes. There could be some problems with Croatia's admission and a loud demand for mutual guarantees for a peaceful solution to the problem of occupied territory. But this would only be for those countries that already have such security problems or could be predicted as having some in the future, and thus would want to delay giving such guarantees to another country. This variant (and there are other, easier ones) of political problems which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is facing and the fact that it is walking in both directions is an organizational and working "piece of cake" compared with problems that the ministry will have to deal with once it chooses how to get into the PFP. The expert group for admission to the PFP, which will mostly consist of members of the upper echelons of the Defense Ministry, will have to have many members, and to be very mobile, diverse in specialities, abundantly financed, and authorized to participate in implementing foreign policy and defense strategy. If the group does not have the above characteristics, it will not be able to represent Croatia as a member of the PFP, whose demands reach far into Croatian state policy. That is also evident from the concept of the PFP and its inner mechanism of operation, which has only recently been publicly represented in some detail. [Box, p 2] To Mons -- Brigadier Since the idea of the PFP being the best way to move eastward as evolved last summer in Washington, after the NATO summit in January organization preparations for functioning of PFP institutions and procedures were expedited. The recently established Board of Directors of the PFP, directly supervised by the NATO Council, will be in charge of accepting signed admissions, members, and coordinating activities. According to Undersecretary Wisner, one of the first and most important tasks of PFP candidates is to draw up a "Presentation Document." Croatia will use such a document to present to the Board of Directors those activities that it wants to engage in within this cooperation, and the forces and means it will place at the disposal of the PFP; Croatia will present the main goals of defense planning and plans for reaching common goals. In those activities, the Croatian Army can expect to be assisted by NATO experts, for that is the key document in which they will together determine the goals, the momentum, and the extent of the Republic of Croatia's participation in NATO activities. The Board of Directors coordinates the work on a series of such "Presentation Documents," plans common activities of all PFP members, and assesses the progress of the PFP program according to political and military integration. Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), whose seat is in Mons (Belgium), is entrusted with drawing up military plans. It is already planning the joint exercise, and the command and staff exercise is to come first toward the end of spring, while units would practise various common procedures in autumn. It was required that small-scale exercises be held in some East European countries. Some rules have been established regarding planning common activities. It is expected that high-level political representatives will be accredited to NATO at its seat in Brussels, while military representatives holding the rank of brigadier will be accredited to SHAPE in Mons. With regard to that, an additional administrative network is being formed that will comprise a number of functions, from diplomatic to legal. [Box, p 3] Three Main Goals Regarding the concept of the PFP, it is emphasized that the PFP has three main goals. The first is described as another step toward a safer Europe, as it spreads democracy to new areas and transfers strategic stability to the east of Europe. The second goal is developing NATO's capacity to respond to challenges that were hitherto outside the domain of the collective defense of NATO members. The third goal is to open the doors for new members. Realizing that the first goal is politically extremely important and will bring extremely difficult problems. Primarily because the cooperation with the Russian Federation, according to Clinton, is first on the list of priority matters of national security. Fortunately, European strategists and realistic politicians are placing more and more confidence in "the artfulness of history," that is in the belief that overcoming the Russian obstacle (complicated by the Zhirinovskiy factor) can easily be compensated. In this way, other items from the priority list are to be realized more quickly and completely, and the first item is to be left for later. Realizing the second goal would be done by means of a very tangible method. It concerns adapting to ways of cooperation among NATO members on the military level and beginning such cooperation this year on operations that are being opened up in the post-Cold-War period. For the Croatian Army, for instance, this would mean that it will have to get standard NATO weapons and equipment, or at least compatible ones, and that it will develop systems of education, training, exercises, communications, etc. totally compatible with NATO systems. Apart from that "hardware," the Croatian Army will have to single out units, make plans and define joint missions together with members of NATO and the PFP. It is planned that those will originally only be search and rescue missions, help in areas devastated by natural catastrophes, ecological treatment of areas contaminated by war, or basing military forces, and, on a higher level of cooperation, peacekeeping missions in crisis areas in Europe and elsewhere. The gradual implementation of the third goal, according to F. Wisner, political under secretary of the U.S. secretary of state for defense, has been globally determined for the next five years. During that period, some countries will gradually be admitted and guarantees will be given that there will be no new borders dividing Europe's east and west, but this will also be a period for the United States to assess the stability or irretrievablity of the democratization process in Russia. During that period, very few members of the PFP can count on being admitted to NATO as full members. Paragraph 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which guarantees the total security of NATO members, will extend to those countries and their security problems only formally. In spite of formal refusals to comment on what would happen with urgent admissions to NATO if "the Zhirinovskiy factor" or some other factor goes mad in Russia, it is predicted that countries thus imperiled will have to be admitted rapidly and almost indiscriminately.
