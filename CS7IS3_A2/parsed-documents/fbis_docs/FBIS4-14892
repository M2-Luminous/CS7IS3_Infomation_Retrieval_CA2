FBIS4-14892 "drsov065_p_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-065 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 CAUCASUS Armenia Events on 30-31 Mar; NKR Disputes Azerbaijani Claims Events on 30-31 Mar; NKR Disputes Azerbaijani Claims NC0404191694 Yerevan Radio Yerevan in Azeri 1330 GMT 4 Apr 94 NC0404191694 Yerevan Radio Yerevan Azeri BFN [Text] The situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] has been relatively peaceful during the past few days. The Armenian Defense Army headquarters has revealed that the disputing sides have refrained from intensive combat operations. But the Armenian defense positions in Askeranskiy Rayon were fired on from military bases in Egerli and Kemerli in Agdamskiy Rayon with large-caliber machine guns in the morning of 31 March. Firing resumed at about 1500 on the same day. Ashagy Akhmedli in Fizulinskiy Rayon and Matavis and Magavus in Mardakertskiy Rayon were also fired on on 31 March. No one was hurt. NKR military experts have linked the lessening tension in NKR's front line with recent defeats suffered by the Azerbaijani Armed Forces in several areas. The NKR Defense Army headquarters has refuted a disclosure by the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry that the Azerbaijani military forces have placed new positions under their control in Agdamskiy Rayon. A high-ranking NKR military official has described the disclosure as an effort to divert attention from the failure of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces' large-scale onslaught in the eastern front line and the large number of casualties they have suffered. That is quite true. The Azerbaijani military forces have lost many men and a large quantity of military equipment from December 1993 to April 1994. Dozens of enemy officers and men have been captured, over 10,000 Azerbaijani troops have been killed, and some 30,000 men have been wounded. The Armenian Defense Ministry Information Center has reported that the situation on Armenia's border was relatively peaceful on the night of 30 March and on 31 March.
