[Krzaklewski] It was the government that came up with the notion that the current strikes are of a political nature. What the government is saying is false; we have not put forward any political demands. It is possible that the coalition fears that, if it does not manage to act on the compromise, the consequences will be very bad. It is worth recalling that "S" demands the implementation of solutions that were agreed upon a long time ago. The strikes are legal because we are in collective bargaining with the government concerning the following: compensation for increased maintenance costs and nonimplementation of the "Pact on Enterprise." The new governing elite is arrogant, displaying democratic-hegemonic tendencies. Minister Pol says that he will not yield to any pressure because the government has a definite majority in the parliament that was elected in parliamentary elections. He forgets that the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party were supported by 20 percent of the people. All the same, he speaks of a majority. He is delaying the implementation of the "Pact on Enterprise" because he does not want clear rules of the game with the union, he does not want to have a strong partner. The introduction of the principle of the representatives of the unions would prove that, for most enterprises, the representative union is "S" and not the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement. The government is violating the law; it does not want to admit that the union is right because such an admission would be an "S" success, which is not a desirable thing for the government. The coalition accepted the doctrine of a fight with the union; it says "Let them bleed until the end." I know about direct pressure by the prime minister and the ministers, who insisted that such and not other information on the union's activities and on the strikes be broadcast on television and radio. A few days ago, an interview with me was not aired on the first program of the Polish Radio Network. [Adamowicz] It seemed that you were understood by Prime Minister Pawlak. [Krzaklewski] I am wondering whether Prime Minister Pawlak is playing a game or if he is unable to implement certain solutions because of the opposition of the ministers and the SLD. When we are talking, the prime minister declares understanding, he states that he accepts our demands. Experts' committees work on the schedule of the implementation of the demands. It must only be approved by the government, which delays things. However, I do not speak with the prime minister in a cafe, but in the Office of the Council of Ministers. Then we sign a joint communique. Therefore, I am wondering whether the prime minister is playing a game or the SLD and the ministers are forcing him to give up his promises. This would mean that his position is weak. A day before the strike at Belchatow, I spoke with the prime minister. I said that, if the government submitted ways of resolving the demands, the strike might be expected to be suspended at the rally. Then the prime minister signed a very general letter, which was hooted. [Adamowicz] Do you predict a black scenario? [Krzaklewski] We are ready for a compromise! We are waiting for the reply until 2000 on Thursday [28 April]. The Council of Ministers is convening; let them say what the scenario of our further demands will be like. The government cannot say that we are placing it on the wall! It has known our demands since November. "S" has displayed its ability to reach a compromise by increasing coal supplies to the power plant. When the Council of Ministers gives a specific answer on the schedule, a mixed government-union commission may convene that will work out the details and the demands of the branches. [Adamowicz] However, a compromise requires both sides to make concessions. [Krzaklewski] So far, the government has not proved that the implementation of some demands is impossible because of the economic capabilities of the state. If it proves this, we will accept it. We can speak about deferring the implementation of some of the demands. However, we will not give up the priorities: curbing the decrease in families' incomes--that is, lowering the energy prices, introducing a profamily tax system, and abandoning the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases]. We will still demand immediate implementation of the "Pact on Enterprise" and the giving of ownership rights to citizens. Because the government is speaking about a strong coalition, because the new popiwek law was adopted within a half-hour, it may take the coalition 48 hours to adopt the "Pact," which was prepared a long time ago. [Adamowicz] In the meantime, the new popiwek law has gone to the senate. [Krzaklewski] If the senate adopts this law, it will limit the room for compromise. "S" will turn to the Constitutional Tribunal because the law will be violated. The law cannot be retroactive; the unions were not consulted on the bill; it is also contrary to Article 68 of the Constitution, which pertains to the relationship between the wage level and the quantity and quality of work, where the principles of social justice should be taken into account. We will also ask the president not to sign this law. The president seems to be seeking closer relations with the union. Therefore, he will have a chance to show his attitude toward the problems of employees and "S." [Adamowicz] Unless the government submits the schedule, "S" threatens a general strike. Opinion polls suggest that the popular acceptance of strikes is poor. Even the greatest radicals, such as Maciej Jankowski, stated two weeks ago that "there is no atmosphere for strikes." [Krzaklewski] A general strike is possible when the authorities start shooting at people. It will be a strike of the nationwide union organization. We conducted referendums in several thousand enterprises, and our action is legal. The active strike will be joined by the enterprises of the metallurgical, arms, and cement-and-lime industry, as well as mines and railways. I am not saying that the action will be unlimited because, if the government does not submit a clear schedule of the implementation of our demands, it will mean that it is a fight for months or even years.
