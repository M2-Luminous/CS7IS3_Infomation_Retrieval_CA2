[Yi In-chun] Hello. [Chong] On 13 June, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Secretariat's creation of a grave situation [omjunghan sataerul chosongsikin kotkwa kwallyonhaeso] that poses great threats to our people's dignity and our country's safety by following the U.S. policy of crushing Korea. We are going to discuss this matter in today's program. [Yi] Yes, let us do so. As has been reported in the statement, our country's Foreign Ministry spokesman sternly denounced [chunyorhi kyutan] the United States, which is opposed to our people, and the IAEA Board of Governors, which follows the United States, for adopting an unreasonable resolution [chonman pudanghan kyorui] against us, and strictly declared that we will immediately withdraw from the IAEA to defend the nation's dignity and sovereignty. The spokesman also declared that we can no longer allow the inspections for guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards which we have accepted in our special capacity, and strongly reaffirmed our position that UN sanctions will be regarded immediately as a declaration of war. This is our due self-defense measure [ungdanghan chawijok chochi] that was inevitably taken because our peaceful nuclear activities hit a bigger snag [uriui pyonghwajok haekhwaltongi kumankum changaeman patke toegi ttaemune] due to the abnormal situation [pijongsangjogin satae] created by anti-Republic maneuvers of the United States and some officials [kyechung] of the IAEA that follows the United States. It is also our Republic's revolutionary response to the wrong acts [kuruttoen chosa] of the U.S. imperialist aggressors and some officials of the IAEA Secretariat. [Chong] Yes, it is. [Yi] Our people are now actively supporting the decision of the Republic's government to withdraw from the IAEA, regarding it as a just measure to defend the nation's dignity and the country's sovereignty. [Chong] Yes, they are. Our Republic's declaration to withdraw from the IAEA is a just measure to cope with the insidious maneuvers [pulsunhan chaektonge chudongjoguro taechohagiwihan chongdanghan chochi] by the U.S. imperialists and some officials of the agency's Secretariat to crush [apsal] our socialist system. [Yi] Surely it is. [Chong] As everyone knows, the world recognizes that even in our special status, we have made all possible, well-intended, efforts to prove the transparency of our nuclear activities. However, the more we accepted inspections by the agency, the more the pressure on us has increased and the more things have become complicated, so that the security and sovereignty of our Republic are being threatened at every moment. This is an intolerable, serious matter. [Yi] Yes, it really is. [Chong] Frankly speaking, human patience has its limits, doesn't it? [Yi] Yes, it does. Some officials of the IAEA Secretariat have escalated the anti-Republic crushing maneuver [pangonghwaguk apsal chaektongul kyedansiguro hwaktaehae watko], ignoring all our good intentions and tolerance [sonuiwa aryang]. On 10 June, the IAEA Board of Governors adopted an unreasonable resolution on suspension of the agency's assistance for our country while demanding the opening of our military sites [kunsa taesangdul] over the nuclear issue. This is the agency's sanction against us and, in essence, a prelude to UN sanctions. In this, the United States and the agency's Secretariat openly revealed their attempt to infringe upon our sovereignty and crush us by using the inspection lever [sachal konggan]. [Chong] You are right. The IAEA Secretariat's forcible demand that we allow overall inspection [chonmyon sachal] by the agency and its threat to impose so-called sanctions on us are an intolerable insult to our people who regard independence as their lives. [Yi] I agree. [Chong] Our people are not the sort of people who take insults to their national sovereignty and dignity. The more pressure and sanctions are imposed on us, the stronger our will will grow and the more free our peaceful nuclear activities will become. As we declared on many occasions, any brigandish logic or strong-armed action can never work with us. If hostile forces [choktae seryoktul] impose new sanctions on us despite our repeated warnings, we will take stern self-defensive measures commensurate with it. [Yi] I believe so. With our country's Foreign Ministry spokesman's 13 June statement that plainly reflects our people's firm will, we will consider all unreasonable resolutions adopted by the IAEA with regard to our issue up to the present as invalid and will not be bound to any rule or decision of the agency hereafter. Without the agency, we can develop our independent nuclear power industry and expand international cooperation in the realm of nuclear activities [haekhwaltong punya]. Any unreasonable inspection can never be allowed until we decide whether to return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or to completely withdraw from it. Hence, there is nothing for the agency's inspectors to do any further in our country. As sanctions cannot coexist with dialogue, it is our inevitable choice to respond to further sanctions by the United States, some officials of the IAEA, and the hostile forces with further self-defensive measures. Our steadfast position will never change until the nuclear issue is fairly resolved through dialogue and negotiations. [Chong] You are right. Our people value the national dignity and sovereignty as their lives. Our people will never allow any act by the U.S. imperialists and some officials of the IAEA Secretariat to infringe upon our sovereignty and to crush us. [Yi] Absolutely not. [Chong] The United States, some officials of the IAEA Secretariat, and hostile forces had better discreetly act while facing reality in the face. [Yi] Right. [Chong] We must now conclude our dialogue. [Yi] All right.
