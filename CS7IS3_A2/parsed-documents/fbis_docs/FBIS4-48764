Mr. Mufamadi also said that interim structures had been created in the form of three bodies to plan and oversee the process. The process will include combining the South African Police [SAP] and homeland police forces, removing military ranks, symbols and terminology, and applying affirmative action to make the force and its leadership more representative. It also aimed at removing discrimination against women. Mr. Mufamadi also announced that Lieutenant General Basie Smit, the last of three police generals under investigation on Goldstone Commission charges of alleged involvement in a third force, is leaving the force within the next two days. Two others, Major General Krappies Engelbrecht and Major General Johan le Roux, have already retired. Mr. Mufamadi said an SAP act would be promulgated to provide for the appointment of a national police commissioner and commissioners in charge of policing in the nine provinces. Deputy Minister Joe Matthews said closer cooperation would be forged with South Africa's neighbors to try to curb arms trafficking in the region. Mr. Matthews said that immunity would be granted to those willing to hand in their illegal weapons and ammunition to the police. He expressed the hope that the level of illegal arms trafficking would drop with the reduction in political violence.
