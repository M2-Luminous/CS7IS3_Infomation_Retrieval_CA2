FBIS3-42355 "jptot007__l94033" JPRS-TOT-94-007-L Document Type:JPRS Document Title:Terrorism FOUO 16 February 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU Police Confirm Drug Trafficking-Terrorism Link PY0902222494 Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 28 Jan 94 p A17 PY0902222494 Lima EL COMERCIO Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Police have reported that Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano" or "Loco Limoniel," has had direct contact with "Artemio" and "Clay," who are, respectively, the political and military chiefs of the Shining Path's Huallaga Regional Committee and were members of the terrorist organization's national board. Both Artemio and Clay were close to Abimael Guzman Reynoso, aka "Gonzalo." Even though "Vaticano" gave the Shining Path thousands of dollars as "quota" or "contributions," the drug trafficker said he was not the only one to do so, adding that there are other "firms" (organizations of "drug traffickers") who have done the same and are still paying large amounts of money. Among the firms are the groups led by "El Ministro," "Lucho Culon," "Cholo Claudio," and "Cachiques." During a news conference at DINCOTE [Counterterrorism Directorate] facilities on 27 January, it was reported that "Vaticano" was practically the "king" of Uchiza in 1988 and 1989. After that he moved to Campanilla, Mariscal Caceres Province (San Martin), where among other things he repaired a stretch of the Marginal Highway to use it as an airstrip. Services to Other `Firms' This was the point of departure for not only his small planes, but he also used the airstrip to render services to other "firms," with the protection and security granted by the Shining Path, which was paid $5,000 per flight plus $3 per kilogram of basic coca paste or $6 per kilogram of washed coca paste. Furthermore, Vaticano has supplied terrorists with war arms (FAL and AKM rifles, submachine guns, pistols, etc.), transportation services, military outfits, communications equipment, food, medicine, and information on the activities of the forces of order. Repented terrorists identified by codes AIA-000083, AIA-000092, AIJ-O55461, and AIJ-O55463 have confirmed this information, positively identifying "Vaticano" as the person who gave money to "Artemio" and "Clay," and to other terrorist leaders known as "Mancini," "James," and "Liborio," whom he used as liaison for paying "quotas" or contributions. DINCOTE sources said "Vaticano" has admitted before the special military prosecutor that he is a "narcoterrorist" and that when he had his operations center in Uchiza and Campanilla, he supplied the Shining Path with medicine, food, clothes, transportation, etc. But he did not admit that he supplied firearms, ammunition, and explosives. It should be noted that along with "Vaticano," DINCOTE also has pressed high treason charges against Shining Path chiefs "Artemio" and "Clay," who were charged "in absentia." Narcoterrorism Uncovered DINCOTE sources said this is the first time police have arrested a drug trafficker of "Vaticano's" level who has cooperated with terrorism, thus confirming the existence of the so-called "narcoterrorism." "In the past, references were made only to the union of terrorism and drug trafficking. Countless documents hinting at it were found but there was no direct evidence. Now we have it," the sources said. One of the major documents shown at the 27 January news conference is the "Economic Balance of the Shining Path, produced by the `quotas' of (TID) [illegal drug trafficking] firms," which DINCOTE seized on 23 August 1993 in the village of Anda (Tingo Maria). The balance book has detailed information on daily operations with income and expenses. It also clearly shows that they charged $3,000 to $7,000 per flight by small planes. The balance book, which is dated March 1991, mentions "Limoniel" as a debtor for flights that were already made.
