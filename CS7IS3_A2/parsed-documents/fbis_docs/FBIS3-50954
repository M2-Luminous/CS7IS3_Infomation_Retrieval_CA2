On 6 January he met with leaders from the Union of Railroad Workers of the Republic of Mexico [STFRM] and told them that economic competitiveness, improved trade procedures, and increasingly efficient services would be inconceivable without the railroad industry. He emphasized that the railroad sector must play a very important role in turn-of-the-century Mexico. Colosio pledged to promote a new phase of regional development in Mexico in which the railroad will be fundamental. The presidential candidate asserted that Mexico will become stronger as its regions become more closely integrated, thereby increasing and improving trade. Colosio described the railroad workers as heirs of the tradition, effort, and tenacity to promote Mexico's growth. The STFRM's national leader Antonio Castellanos Tovar spoke on the union's behalf.
