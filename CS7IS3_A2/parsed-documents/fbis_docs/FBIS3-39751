Minister President, dear Mr. Necker, Mayor, Deputies, Ladies and Gentlemen: First, I would like to seize the opportunity to wish all a happy new year. The year 1994 is an important one, in which, in particular, the people here in the new laender are facing further important steps in our joint future. When the Federal Association of German Industry held the first Day of Medium-Sized Industries after the reunification of our fatherland in Leipzig in April 1991, German unity had been completed only six months earlier. At that time, we were still rather at the beginning of the task of establishing independent medium-sized industrial enterprises in the new laender. Those who look back at the developments of the past two years will realize that the will for independence has developed most dynamically in the new laender. More than 600,000 companies have been established, and thousands of successfully reprivatized enterprises speak for themselves. I would like to express my gratitude and recognition to the entrepreneurs in eastern Germany. They have done a great job in reconstruction, in many cases under tight deadlines and, especially in the starting phase, also against certain obstacles. I also would like to thank the enterprises in western Germany which, despite the slump in the economy, stuck to their investment plans in the new laender. It is a pleasure for me to say today that the business community's promise to double its purchasing volume in the new laender to 50 billion German marks [DM] from 1992 to 1995 so far has been kept. A special word of thanks also goes to those who have provided assistance and support for creating jobs for apprentices in the new laender over the past year. The chambers, but also the land groups of the Federal Association of German Industry [BDI], provided sufficient training opportunities in 1993. The medium-sized enterprises are one centerpiece of the social market economy. It is in the many medium-sized enterprises in Germany that most people not only find employment, but also where innovation takes place most rapidly and frequently, where state-of-the-art products are developed, and where new markets are explored. We know from 40 years of experience that the strength and international success of the German economy are based largely on the existence of a wide and active foundation of medium-sized enterprises in Germany. The medium-sized enterprises are, at the same time, a symbol of individual entrepreneurial freedom and independence. This is one of the reasons that the old regime in the former GDR tried to destroy the medium-sized economy. It was only with unification that the personal and economic freedom necessary for wide development of business initiative was recreated. I am glad that the second "Day of Industrial Medium-Sized Enterprises" after reunification is taking place today in the new laender. Representatives of medium-sized enterprises from the old and new laender have come together here in Magdeburg for an exchange of opinions, for discussing problems, and for establishing the course of our joint future. Ladies and Gentlemen, we must vigorously advance developments in the new laender in the future, too, and complete the internal unity of Germany. Had I said five years ago that businessmen from western and eastern Germany would hold a joint meeting here in Magdeburg today, most people would have questioned my state of mind. Some have not realized yet that we are facing a major challenge, a challenge unprecedented in history. What is certain is that somewhat more than three years after unification, we have made considerable progress on the path toward internal unity. After last year's dynamic increase, we are expecting the economy in the new laender to grow between 6 and 8 percent this year, too. In 1993, eastern Germany supported growth in all of Germany and will do so in 1994, too. Until recently, hardly anyone would have considered this to be possible. According to a forecast presented by the Hamburg Economic Research Institute last week, for the first time since unification exports from eastern Germany will increase. The new direction of exports, including exports to the West, shows that the international competitive strength of the enterprises in eastern Germany is increasing. The new laender already export more goods to the countries of the European Union [EU] and EFTA [European Free Trade Association] than to the former East Bloc, which used to be their main client. Meanwhile, public as well as private per capita investment in eastern Germany, is higher than in western Germany. This year, even per capita investment in the construction industry will be higher there than in western Germany. This has become possible only through the Federal Government's determined actions. The settlement of inherited debts in housing construction, which was accomplished and is mainly funded by the Federal Government, has given an enormous impulse to investment. The number of construction licenses increased enormously, from practically zero to an estimated 75,000 in 1993, doubling the 1992 figure. Housing construction also increased significantly in western Germany. According to provisional calculations, last year some 430,000 apartments were completed. This year we expect the construction of half a million new apartments; this is the highest figure in 16 years. The Federal Government has increased rapidly and significantly its financial efforts in all spheres since the conclusion of unity. I would like to give a few, very descriptive examples. In the last three and one-half years of German unity, more telephone connections were made than in the 40 years of the GDR. Rapid communication also facilitates investment! Within a few years a major development project was brought under way, and I do not have any doubts that the activities of the mail service will even be speeded up after the postal privatization, for which I am yearning. In order to transform the economy in the new laender and create new, competitive jobs, existing enterprises must be modernized and new, competitive enterprises created. The Trust Agency has done a great job of privatizing enterprises, and largely concluded its work by the end of last year. Most of the more than 13,500 privatized enterprises were sold to medium-sized firms. In addition, the Trust Agency created a series of measures especially designed to improve the economic outlook for the newly established, medium-sized enterprises in the new laender. These measures range from real estate offers to granting time to pay the purchasing price and have served to promote the development of medium-sized industry in the new laender. In the sphere of trade we are experiencing particularly rapid development. In this area, privatization was concluded two and one-half years ago. This has meant great progress not only for the business community but also for the consumers in eastern Germany: Today any consumer can buy virtually everything he wants in his immediate neighborhood. The Federal Government is firmly determined to continue its policy of promoting large-scale investment at a high level. This is a really promising course for effectively supporting the emergence of new, competitive economic structures and jobs in eastern Germany. One example that I would like to mention in this connection is the investment grant, which we created, or the billions in credits we granted for the founding of companies and investments. Regarding public orders, we have introduced preferential treatment to enterprises from eastern Germany. The Federal Government, meanwhile, is places a fair share of its orders in eastern Germany. Of course, there are still many difficulties, which you experience daily in your personal vicinity: Necessary changes sometimes progress slowly and in some cases these are still obstacles with which to contend. We must not close our eyes to the fact that 40 years of division have left deeper traces than we assumed. This simply cannot be undone with a few declarations. Today I am more convinced than ever that the decisive challenge as far as German unity is concerned is the meeting between people, the coexistence between people in Germany. Thus, I am asking all of you, all of us, wherever we are, to do everything to make us talk with one another and not about each other, so that those who have much to go through will not forget that prosperity in the old FRG did not come overnight but was the result of 40 years of hard work. I also understand the working people who are worried about the future of their jobs. This is why the Federal Government is backing the necessary process of structural adaptation through its active labor market policy. This is how millions of people could be prevented from becoming unemployed in the next few years. Behind these naked figures stand the fates of many individuals and their families, who could be helped in this way. Despite some criticism, I stand by this active labor market policy as the expression of a real social market economy. After all, German unity does not only mean introducing cold capitalism in eastern Germany. What we want is a social market economy as defined by Ludwig Erhard. It is true we are still losing old jobs. Nevertheless, more and more we are able to replace these with new, competitive jobs. Ladies and Gentlemen: For many people in the new laender the personal situation has improved. Since the introduction of monetary, economic, and social union in May 1990, incomes of private households in eastern Germany have almost doubled; last year, they almost reached 70 percent of the western level. This is an unprecedented process of catching up! Regardless of all achievements we have made in the reconstruction of the new laender, we must not ignore the fact that in many areas there is still a lot of unsatisfied demand. Of course, the large amounts of money we are investing currently in the new laender will lead to the emergence of blossoming regions in the new laender. There can be absolutely no doubt about that, even though it might take a few years longer than we originally thought. Yet, if this is the only point in which I was wrong, then I can be quite content. Despite all our efforts, we must recognize that first and foremost the two sides of industry are shaping the opportunities and prospects for work and employment. It is up to you and your decisions to give real priority to employment and jobs. This does not only apply to the new laender but to all of Germany. I expressly welcome the fact that both sides of industry have recently shown readiness to be flexible. The first wage agreement for 1994, which has now been achieved in the western German chemical industry, has had an impact on public service, by the way. This agreement gave priority to the objective of jobs, which is good. One thing I would like to emphasize is the agreement on flexible working hours of 35 to 40 hours a week. Also of particular importance are the special agreements for people entering professional life or for the long-term unemployed. For the first time, industry and labor have reached concrete agreements that take into consideration differing efficiency and thus are making it easier for enterprises to hire new people. I think that the agreement in the chemical industry contributes to the creation of more jobs, and should serve as a model for others industries, too. In practical terms, this is solidarity shown by those who have a job for those who are finding it difficult to find one. Flexible working hours can help extend machine running times and create more part-time jobs. Now it will finally be possible to increase the offer of part-time jobs. In other industrialized nations this has been common practice for a long time. In the Netherlands, for example, almost one out of every three people employed works part time. Labor exchanges for part-time jobs have even become an independent branch there. Surveys have shown that in our country interest in part-time jobs is much greater than what is being offered. Industry and labor should take into consideration more strongly than in the past that part-time work offers a major potential for more employment in Germany. II. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have mentioned this example since today priority has to be given to preserving jobs and to creating new jobs in the whole of Germany. Particularly in the old laender structural weaknesses in the economy and the society have accumulated in the course of the past few years. These problems have nothing to do with German unity. Demographic developments the average number of years an individual works have profound consequences in the long run, for example, for the labor market and the social security systems. Dramatic changes in the age structure of the German population after the turn of the millennium already are beginning to show. Today Germany has one of the lowest birthrates in the world. In 2030, presumably every third person will be over 60 years old. Considering today's 1.8 million serious nursing cases, nursing-care insurance is increasingly urgent. Therefore, we will push it through -- we will also push through that the ancillary wage costs will not be increased. In order to ensure Germany's competitiveness as a business location for the future, we jointly have to do everything to overcome these structural weaknesses. The securing of the business location is not only the Federal Government's business; both sides of industry, the enterprises, the social groups, and every individual citizen are called upon to live up to their responsibility for the future. It is now time for us to do everything that is overdue. For that purpose, familiar paths have to be abandoned. However, if we really want to say yes to the future, we have to be able to do what is necessary today and not to postpone it any longer. This is particularly important because of changes in the world economy. Competition has become stronger. However, this does not mean we have deteriorated, only that others have improved. This applies not only to the Asiatic regions of growth, but also to all countries of Central, East, and southeastern Europe. After all, we want democracy and market economics to be introduced there and these countries to recover again. However, if they are successful, they will also become competitors. We have to be prepared for this. Last year, the Federal Government made several, also unpopular decisions for the securing of our future. Property cuts were unavoidable, claims had to be pushed back. However, only in this way can we preserve the bases of our social security in the long run. But for me one field has to be excluded: pensions. Pensions are not a charitable gift of the state. People have worked for them their whole life. Therefore, we were not only guided by economic considerations when we decided to take over pensions for older people in the new laender. We owe special solidarity to the generation of the people who are today 60 or 70 years old. These people primarily carried the burden of the war and were cheated out of better living conditions in the GDR. As you know, the topic of savings also includes combating social services abuses. Here, the campaign initiated by the Federal Employment Office, the trade unions, and employers last spring has been impressively successful. The number of cases of abuse of services and illegal employment being investigated by the employment offices increased by almost 50 percent. In this way, by the end of November, a savings of almost DM1.2 billion was achieved. This shows that there was and still is a burning need for action. And this equally applies to tax evasion and subsidy fraud. Ladies and Gentlemen, regarding savings and the combating of abuse, social cuts are not at issue, as some claim. A change in the people's way of thinking, reshuffles, and reorientation are required. Because of the enormous expenses for the new laender, we now have the opportunity to advance the development speedily. However, this also took the public budget to the limit of its capacity. Yesterday and the day before yesterday the Federal Government and the coalition resolved two things: On the one hand, we agreed on specific, additional savings of DM5 billion in the budget. I need not explain that this was not easy after about DM21 billion had already been saved in the 1994 Federal Budget. In this way, we wish to stress that the stability of state finances is unrenounceable for us. For me stability also means the inflation rate will go down further; I regard it an enormous success that last year we achieved for the first time a rate in the 3-percent range -- here I am also particularly grateful to the Bundesbank. On the other hand, yesterday we agreed on an "action program for more growth and employment." I refrain from explaining the measures to you in detail; those of you who have not yet read it will certainly do so some time. From my point of view, the intention of the Federal Government to continue its deregulation policy with the objective of shortening the planning and authorization process in Germany is particularly important. This program is apt to accelerate the economic recovery which is becoming noticeable and, at the same time, permanently improve the conditions of Germany as a business location. It relieves the enterprises and facilitates the securing and creation of jobs. With this action program, we also are implementing essential measures we announced last September at the time of our report on securing the future of Germany as a business location. Notwithstanding the election year, these decisions are absolutely necessary for securing the future. I have always said we must not lose any time in securing jobs in Germany. For me, the postponement of such important measures for the future is not possible because, in this way, we would betray our future. We already implemented a large part of the measures contained in last lyear's report on Germany as a business location. I would like to mention the following examples: - The law on facilitating investment and land for housing construction and the law on facilitating planning are making the planning and authorization processes, which were often too long and complicated before, far easier. I immediately add the following: Far more could be done here. However, for this we above all need the cooperation of the laender, because they determine public administration in the federal system. - After a long struggle, the amendment to the genetic technology law has been achieved. This has also cleared the way for the idea that research and innovation again have priority -- without exceeding the limit of what is morally permitted. - Because of the railroad reform, the way is cleared for the reorganization of the railroads into a modern transportation system under entrepreneurial leadership. In this way, we have atoned for the omissions of the past 25 years. We are firmly determined to make purposeful progress in implementing during the current legislative period additional pending measures recommended in the Report on Safeguarding Germany as an Industrial Location in the Future. This includes conclusion of the postal reform, in order to strengthen our competitive position in the telecommunications markets, which are growing with enormous speed all over the world. The public response to our Report on Safeguarding Germany as an Industrial Location in the Future is more than encouraging. It shows that we have tackled a central topic for labor and employment. Ladies and Gentlemen, essential preconditions for safeguarding the competitiveness of German industry are future-oriented private investments and successful enterprise strategies. In addition to reducing production costs, it is the task of the companies to help new products gain a breakthrough and develop new markets. We Germans are international leaders in environmental technology and in the development of new materials. What is possible in these areas can also be achieved in other fields that are important for the future. However, in this we must always keep in mind that not everything that is technically and scientifically feasible is also ethically and morally permitted. The same goes for the relationship between economy and ecology. However, Ladies and Gentlemen, a country like ours also needs a climate that is friendly for technology. Creating this atmosphere is one of the important tasks in educating the young generation. In particular, we must once again impart to students the feeling that technological top achievements are something that we can be proud of -- just as athletic top achievements naturally fill us with pride. Therefore, here, too, we need to cultivate the elites. III. Ladies and Gentlemen, responsibility for one's own actions, courage for entrepreneurial risks, and readiness for innovation -- all these are qualities which characterize the independent medium-sized industries in our country -- are also needed in other spheres of our society. I am confident that together we will master the challenges we are facing. We must recognize the signs of the time; we must open up new leeway for action for our country. This is also a precondition for enabling us to make use of new opportunities we will face in the future. The new international changes offer excellent opportunities in particular to us Germans. The recently achieved conclusion of GATT is of outstanding importance for us. It is the most comprehensive liberalization package of past decades. Without liberalization of international trade relations, a country like the FRG that is so strongly integrated into international economy, would be hit in its vital nerve center. This month the second stage of economic and monetary union came into effect. As a result, Europe continues to grow together in terms of economic and financial policy. About 70 percent of our products go the countries of the European Community and EFTA -- this is a strong argument in favor of the emerging Europe. Our economic future is most closely linked with the process of European integration. The decision to name Frankfurt/Main the seat of the European Monetary Institute, and thus of the future European Central Bank, is convincing proof of trust in us Germans. At the same time, this decision is an important symbol of the fact that a future European currency must be as stable as the German mark. Ladies and Gentlemen, what is of concern to me at the moment is, however, something else. There is a widespread view that, after all the things that have happened, war has been banished from our region forever. This is what people also thought in the 1920's when Aristide Briand and Gustav Stresemann received the Nobel Prize as the architects of the new peace. Evening after evening I see the horrible pictures from the former Yugoslavia, where people, who have lived together for generations, are attacking each other. There are also worrying reports from the area of the former Soviet Union. There some people once again think that borders can be shifted by force. If we want to overcome borders, we must bring people together. I give you an example from my homeland, the Palatinate. There, Palatines and Alsatians live together as Germans and French and Europeans. This is what Thomas Mann said a long time ago: We are German Europeans and European Germans. We want Europe to be our protection and shield for the future. Therefore, we must understand this development as an opportunity; this also is particularly true for German unification. Here I categorically oppose the stupid pessimism that is currently spreading. We must overcome it and make use of our opportunities. We must act with courage and determination, with those principles and virtues that have made our country great, with humaneness, loyalty, industriousness, and reliability. Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to cordially invite you to follow this path together with us, to understand it together with us, and to act accordingly.
