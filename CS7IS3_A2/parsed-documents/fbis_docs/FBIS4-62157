[Video shows Defense Minister Pavel Grachev being interviewed] Pavel Sergeyevich, now that the president and the chancellor have reached agreement on holding the ceremony in Berlin, can we say that all the problems connected with withdrawing our troops from Germany have been settled? [Grachev] You cannot say that all the problems connected with withdrawing our troops have been settled. The fact is there are fundamental political decisions by the chancellor and our president. The ceremonial sendoff of the troops will take place from Berlin. Now the onus is on us. [Correspondent] There were plenty of discussions in the German press about the Russian military insisting, I emphasize insisting, that the ceremonial sendoff be with the Allies. In order for there not to be any misunderstanding here, perhaps you could comment on this. [Grachev] This is really a misunderstanding. I do not want to say that this is some sort of provocation, provocative questions; no, this is purely and simply a misunderstanding. We were not insisting, we were not even suggesting that the withdrawal should be organized together and simultaneously with the Allies. The timescale was laid down a long time ago. [end recording]
