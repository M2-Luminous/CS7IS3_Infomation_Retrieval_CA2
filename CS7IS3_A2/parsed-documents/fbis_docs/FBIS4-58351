The mentality that plans such assassinations needs to be changed to adapt to the modern age. [passage omitted] A state's assassination of its citizens is an indication of failure and bankruptcy. Assassinating individuals cannot save a country, lift a blockade, repulse an enemy, or restore arms programs that are the rights of every state. It is only an expression of anger and the loss of nerves, and these are not the characteristics of rational states or wise governments. We condemn the assassination of a citizen born in Iraq at the hands of other citizens. Yes, Iraqi officials made a mistake in planning and perpetrating the crime, which constitutes a diplomatic problem demanding an extraordinary solution. Lebanon's security must be safeguarded against all physical liquidations that take place on its territory to enable it to prepare the people to confront the Jewish enemy. But why sever relations between Lebanon and Iraq? Some time ago we heard from the Lebanese Industrialists Association; trade union officials; and political, financial, military, and press figures that they believe that the only useful, practical response to the Gaza-Jericho agreement is the establishment of a Lebanese-Syrian-Jordanian-Iraqi common market and political-economic-military-cultural coordination. This could save our people in Palestine from being swallowed by the Jewish state and could be a force that would stand in the face of the Jewish Satan and those behind him. Our vital interests, which affect our future and social existence in greater Syria, have been undermined and no longer have any value because of the blood of one individual. It is being said that no individual, no matter how prominent he may be, should be more important than society and that his death is no reason for killing the future of that society. Will severing its relations with Iraq make Lebanon grow stronger and more united, strengthen its economy, and reinforce its political and military position or will the establishment of Lebanese-Syrian- Jordanian-Iraqi-Palestinian working committees that will make plans, not statements, and implement them achieve these goals? We are compelled to make a comparison between the Lebanese official position toward Iraq and its position toward the Jewish state. Lebanon should immediately break off negotiations with the Jewish enemy, negotiations that will lead to the establishment of diplomatic relations. The Israelis recently shelled Sidon and killed some of its citizens. Before that, they masterminded the explosion in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church through their agents and were about to rekindle the war in Lebanon. They killed our citizens. [passage omitted] Why hasn't Lebanon broken off negotiations with the Jewish state, which is responsible for killing tens and even hundreds of Lebanese citizens on Lebanese territory since the beginning of the capitulation negotiations, but broke off relations with Iraq who killed--in the view of the Lebanese state--an Iraqi citizen on the same territory? We never knew that the Jewish state was closer to Lebanon than Iraq. We never knew that the patience of the Lebanese was exhausted toward a brother but not toward the Jews. [passage omitted]
