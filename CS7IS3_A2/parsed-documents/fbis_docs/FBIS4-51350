According to a new policy, four or five auto giants competitive in the world market will be set up by the end of this century. The output of these giants is expected to produce 70 percent of China's total. During the past 40 years China has put about 34 billion yuan into the auto industry. Statistics show that China's annual output capacity of 1.3 million automobiles is distributed across more than 120 plants. With low-quality products and high production costs, China's auto industry can meet neither the demand of domestic market nor the challenge of international competition. According to experts, when the annual output increases from 1,000 to 50,000 at an auto company, the production costs will decreases by 40 percent; when output increases to 10,000, costs decrease by another 15 percent; when output is 20,000, costs decrease by a further 10 percent; and when the annual output hits one million, the production costs will decrease by about another 10 percent. Most of China's auto companies do not reach the minimum effective annual output scale of 60,000 to 100,000, except for eight major enterprises. According to the policy, China will not approve any new projects for assembling vehicles in the coming few years. Attention will be paid to lowering production costs and to extending production scale in the existing companies. China is expected to have 20 million automobiles running by 2000, of which 4.5 million will be sedan cars. This indicates that China's auto output during this period will hit three million, including 1.5 million sedan cars. To reach the target, the only way out for China's auto industry is mass production, experts said. To cope with the competition in the domestic and international markets, some large auto companies in China have begun to look for partners for co-operation or targets for annexation nationwide in recent years. Auto industries in the developed countries such as the U.S. and Japan have experienced mergers and annexation in the course of their development. China's auto industry will do the same in order to become a pillar industry, the experts said.
