The South Korean Government noted the March 21 resolution adopted by an absolute majority and saw it as a reflection of the international community's will, Chang Ki-ho, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in a statement. "It's a reflection of the suspicion and concern of the international community regarding North Korea's nuclear development caused by North Korea's refusal to fulfill its responsibilities and obligations despite global efforts over the past year," the statement said. "The government urges that North Korea completely implement all its safeguards obligations and clear up global suspicion about its nuclear development," it said.
