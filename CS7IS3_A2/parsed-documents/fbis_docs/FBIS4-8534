FBIS4-8534 "dreeu072_s_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-072 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 SLOVENIA _O_Impact of Jansa's Departure on Political Scene _O_Impact of Jansa's Departure on Political Scene 94P20624A 94P20624A CSO [Editorial Report] Following the dismissal of Defense Minister Janez Jansa on 28 March, his Social Democratic Party of Slovenia [SDSS] left the governing coalition, raising the prospect of a political crisis in Slovenia. Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek tried to discount this possibility in an interview published by the Brussels LE SOIR on 31 March. In response to a question about the governing coalition (comprised of Drnovsek's Liberal Democrats [LDS], the Christian Democrats [SDK], the United List of Social Democrats [ZLSD], and Jansa's Social Democrats) now being "threatened" by Jansa's removal, Drnovsek said that his party was prepared to rule with the Christian Democrats alone, because "above all, the entire country first needs continuity and stability." Drnovsek minimized the possibility that other parties would demand a new election, saying he was convinced that the LDS, his own party, would emerge with a majority if "elections were held today." According to 31 March Ljubljana Radio reports, the LDS discussed future relations with its coalition partners at a closed meeting in which Drnovsek remarked that the coalition agreement would probably have to be "redefined." The SKD, led by Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle, discussed two possibilities: immediate departure from the government or continued cooperation. The SKD leaders decided to remain, stating that in "times of political crisis" the cooperation of the two parties was necessary to establish a "new political balance," and recommending to Drnovsek that the ZLSD, a coalition of leftist parties, leave the government. A commentary in the 28 March issue of the right-of-center Ljubljana daily SLOVENEC strongly criticized Jansa's removal, characterizing it as "a putsch" organized by the leftist forces, and predicted further polarization of the Slovene political scene--the strengthening of the right-wing opposition parties in their fight against "corruption and neocommunism" on one side and attempts by the leftist parties to "restore old political structures" in all spheres of public life on the other. The liberal Ljubljana daily DNEVNIK of 28 March expressed concern about the impact of Jansa's dismissal on the military readiness of the armed forces, emphasizing that the army must remain depoliticized. Indicating that there might be further personnel changes in the Defense Ministry and in the armed forces, the paper says that military personnel "carry the largest burden" and must prove that "the army serves the country and does not take part in politics in this critical political situation." In this context, DNEVNIK sees Colonel General Albin Gutman, the armed forces commander, having a "special responsibility," because it depends largely on him how much impact political developments might have on his subordinates. On 29 March Ljubljana Radio reported that the State Chamber of the Slovene Assembly had confirmed Jansa's removal as defense minister by a vote of 49 in favor and 39 opposed and approved Jelko Kacin, Prime Minister Drnovsek's choice to replace him, by a vote of 48 to 39. In an interview published in DNEVNIK on 25 March, nominee Kacin stated that "recent events" had damaged the reputation of the military, which must try to restore its positive image. He said that as defense minister he would strive to restructure Slovenia's Territorial Defense Force into a modern army composed of highly trained personnel and equipped with sophisticated technology. His goal, he added, was to create a "depoliticized, professional" army whose members would be sought as specialists in the civilian economy when their military careers were concluded. DNEVNIK's 28 March prediction of further personnel changes appears to have been borne out by Kacin's replacement of Anton Krkovic, commander of the "Moris" 1st Special Brigade, with Vojko Pavlin, former head of the School for Noncommissioned Officers, reported in the 31 March issue of SLOVENEC. According to the 29 March issue of Ljubljana MLADINA, a pro-LDS weekly, "special" units are subordinate directly to the defense minister rather than to the armed forces' chain of command.
