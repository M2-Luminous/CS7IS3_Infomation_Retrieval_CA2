As fiscal macroeconomic regulation and control capability is being tightened, particularly over central finances, the tax sharing system reforms that "seem ready to happen" have naturally become the focus of attention of people in all walks of life. "Down With the Package" Has Become a Militant Slogan Is China now capable of carrying out tax sharing system reform? Theoretical circles have not yet reached a consensus on this. One of the focuses of the debate is how to assess the fiscal package system. Academics who strongly oppose the tax sharing system fully affirm the merits of the fiscal package system, holding that it helps to stimulate local fiscal initiative, while those who favor implementing tax sharing as quickly as possible strongly attack the current fiscal package system, on which grounds they promote tax sharing system reform. These latter hold that while the fiscal package system has pros, such as package figures being simple, clear, and easy for all to grasp, its many existing practical defects fully prove that it has completed its hstorical mission. Scholars who favor tax sharing system reform list the following major defects of the fiscal package system: 1. Fiscal package bases are set irrationally, protecting vested interests, creating "injustice and taking more from the best," and further widening the interregional economic and social development gap. 2. The local revenue package weakens tax regulation capability, reinforces "regionalism" and "feudal separatism," and blocks commodity circulation and the formation of a uniform market. 3. The fiscal package slants revenues toward localities, leaving state revenues, particularly central ones, without strict guarantee and oversight mechanisms, and creating a severe loss of central revenue. 4. The fiscal package contributes neither to the thorough conversion of government functions or to genuinely pushing enterprises toward the market, while causing local governments to guide the disposition of resources unilaterally in the interests of increasing local revenues, which leads to duplicate production, construction, and importing, as well as to wars over all types of raw materials and to the assimilation of local industrial structures. 5. The fiscal "separate kitchens" results in localities haggling with the center over the setting of sharing percentages and contract bases, as well as causing lateral competition. This makes central fiscal actions nonstandard, with arbitrary borrowing from localities and income equalitarianism, while localities take many fiscal accomodation steps to intercept and keep revenue that should be paid to the center. This ultimately limits the rational growth of state revenue and fiscal macroeconomic regulation and control capability. There Is Still a Lingering Fear of "Tax Sharing" Just as more and more people are shouting the praises of the tax sharing system, theorists are singing "another tune," even though it may be a very "faint" one. The current theoretical stands against the tax sharing system can be summed up in the following three key areas: 1. As the tax sharing system's point of departure and grounds conflict with our overall reform objectives, the tax sharing system should be firmly opposed. The scholars who favor this view hold that the tax sharing system is focused on increasing the [central] revenue percentage, by concentrating central financial might, the grounds for which are that the above base sharing part paid to the center in the fiscal package is too small. But they say that promoting tax sharing on this grounds ignores a fundamental issue, i.e., that increasing local fiscal might was aimed at stimulating the fiscal initiative of local authorities, with fiscal authority being devolved along with administrative authority, meaning that a lower central revenue percentage was inevitable. So tax sharing would be bound to weaken the impact of local profit forces, causing a tightening that would be adverse to stimulating central and local initiative simultaneously, as well as to sharp economic growth, and ultimately to increasing central revenues. 2. China is not yet fully equipped with the conditions for tax sharing. The academics who favor this view point out that standardized tax sharing requires: 1) a clear division of central and local administrative authority; 2) a break with the order of revenue division based on enterprise subordinate relations; 3) a scientific revenue and expenditure base factor appraisal law; 4) a relatively perfect local tax system; 5) separate central and local tax management and collection. But China is not yet fully equipped with these conditions. For instance, current local taxation still involves many places unsuited to tax sharing. This can be seen mainly in that local taxes are more nominal than real, with the local tax revenue percentage too small to meet local spending needs and unable to increase along with local economic growth, and collection and management in chaos. So as the terms for tax sharing do not yet fully exist, rather than expanding the tax sharing experiment in scope, it would be better to begin by studying and drawing up a scientific methodology based on a factor appraisal of revenue and expenditure bases, in order to make good preparations for standardized tax sharing system reform. 3. The aim of fiscal reform should be not "tax separation," but rather "system separation," i.e., the establishment of a graded budget system. This is because tax sharing actually solves only the revenue division matter, not the system problem. The graded budget system put forth by the scholars who hold this view includes the following key substance: Drawing up separate central and local tax revenue systems; giving governments at all levels corresponding spending independence; setting up a standardized system for the shift of payments from the center to localities; establishing separate central and local budgets for independent balance; and providing local governments with the authority to issue local government bonds to increase their capital account revenue. Tax Sharing: The Trend of the Times With State Council approval, the Ministry of Finance began in June 1992 to conduct tax sharing experiments in nine provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities authorized to formulate their own plans independently, striving to divide central and local revenue sources through tax categories, in order to standardize and rationalize central and local financial distribution relations. These tax sharing experiments have shown the following features: 1. They have expanded local fixed revenue limits and better stimulated local revenue organization initiative, helping to reinforce tax collection management, stop up system loopholes, prevent revenue erosion, ensure basic central government spending needs, and tighten central macroeconomic regulation and control. 2. The tax sharing system turns flow taxes from most being retained by local governments to a central local "50-50" sharing, adjusting central-local distribution relations, eliminating to a degree tendencies, such as unchecked local development of high tax rate products and unchecked striving for output value and speed, and helping to promote the state's industrial structure and the formation of a uniform market, eliminate financial distribution arbitrariness, adjust interregional financial distribution, and appropriately shrink the interregional economic and social development gap. 3. Tax sharing can play a promotional and driving role in the reform and opening of our whole economy. On one hand, all areas will pay attention to managing the flow taxes shared by the the center and localities. On the other hand, once all state-owned, collective, and "the three kinds of foreign trade" enterprise income taxes become local fixed revenue, this will spur local governments to pay attention to enterprise economic efficiency, providing more effective guidance and oversight of enterprise operations. Based on these tax sharing experiments, the state has decided to practice the tax sharing system on a wider scale beginning in 1994. So theorists have made the following suggestions on ways to implement tax sharing in practice: 1. At present, due to a number of limiting factors, it will be impossible to accomplish the tax sharing system all in one move. Overall reform steps could proceed in the order of "the current package -- a tax sharing package -- a tax sharing system in which shared taxes dominate -- a thorough tax sharing system." Meanwhile, based on conditions in various areas, we could break down and apply varying methods for a tax sharing system. 2. Tax sharing reform must be accompanied by reforms in other areas, most crucially: a) We need to clearly divide governmental administrative and fiscal authority, particularly construction investment authority, with central revenue undertaking mostly key national and transregional project construction, and local revenues being responsible for building regional projects. b) We need to reform our tax system, by establishing one conforming to market economy needs, as well as a sound local tax system. c) We need to reform systems, such as planning, pricing, investment, circulation, and social security.
