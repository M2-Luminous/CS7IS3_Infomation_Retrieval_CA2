FR940607-0-00084 FR940607-0-00018 II. Amendments by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 Section 1407 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved Oct. 28, 1992; hereafter referred to as ``1992 HCD Act'') directs the Secretary to make several amendments to this discretionary program. Subsection 1407(a) prohibits the Secretary from making a property available for lease under the homeless initiative program unless the property has first been listed and made generally available for sale to the public for at least 30 days. Subsection 1407(b) of the 1992 HCD Act provides an exception to subsection 1407(a) with respect to any area in which the Secretary determines that there will not be a sufficient quantity of decent, safe, and sanitary affordable housing available for use under the program if properties located in the area are first made generally available to the public. In such exception cases, the Secretary will make available to preapproved applicants up to 10 percent of the total number of properties in the HUD inventory for the area before offering those properties to the general public. The Secretary is also directed to consult with the unit of general local government for the area in determining which properties should be reserved. The 1992 HCD Act, in subsection 1407(c), also directs the Secretary to identify and describe, upon request by an applicant or lessee, any exemptions or reductions related to the payment of property taxes under State or local laws that may be applicable to lessees or to the leased properties. Finally, subsection 1407(c) of the 1992 HCD Act also provides that the Secretary may not require the lessee to make deposits for the payment of taxes into an escrow account, where such an exemption or reduction is provided. III. Final Rule On August 11, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule (58 FR 42707) which would implement the changes required by section 1407 of the 1992 HCD Act, as well as some additional conforming changes. This final rule implements those proposed changes as described below. 30-day Marketing Period and Exception In accordance with subsection 1407(a), this final rule amends 24 CFR 291.400(c) to reflect the statutory requirement that HUD make property available for sale to the general public for at least 30 days before HUD makes the property available for lease under the program. In addition, this final rule also requires that the property be vacant, and not under contract or committed to another program for availability under the lease program. This final rule also adds conforming changes to ยง291.410(d) regarding notification to applicants of available properties. After the public sale period, the HUD Field Office will notify applicants of eligible properties available in the ZIP Code areas previously designated by them. Specific properties selected by an applicant will be held off the market for a 10-day consideration and inspection period, which will begin to run upon written notification by the applicant to the Field Office. (The Department encourages applicants to notify Field Offices by Facsimile (FAX).) Only those properties in which an applicant has submitted a written expression of interest will be held off the market. If no further communication from the applicant is received by the end of the 10-day consideration and inspection period, the Field Office will resume offering the properties for sale to the public. In accordance with section 1407(b) of the 1992 HCD Act, the final rule provides an exception to the 30-day listing for general sale in Field Offices having 200, or fewer, total properties in inventory as of October 1 of each year. HUD has determined that these offices are less likely to have properties available for applicants after 30 days on the market. HUD will select these ``exception'' field offices based upon the number of properties held in inventory as of October 1, of each year (initially October 1, 1993), the number of properties the Department anticipates acquiring over the ensuing 12-month period and the speed with which such properties are selling. In ``exception'' Field Offices, if homeless providers have requested to lease properties, properties will be offered to them for a 10-day consideration and inspection period before the properties are listed for sale to the general public. Field Offices subject to this exception will notify applicants of properties in designated ZIP Code areas prior to public listing until such time as 10 percent of their total inventory, as of October 1, has been leased. The Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner will supply a list of the exception Field Offices to the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development and all field offices on an annual basis. The final rule also provides that, in those Field Offices subject to the exception, HUD will consult with units of general local government to identify areas where there is a need for units for homeless persons and will make this information available to applicants. However, local governments will not have veto-power over where properties used by the homeless are located. Exception From or Reduction of State and Local Property Taxes The final rule also amends 24 CFR 291.415(d) to describe HUD's duty under subsection 1407(c) of the 1992 HCD Act to provide information to applicants or lessees regarding any exemption from or reduction of property taxes under State and local laws. Under this final rule, where State or local law grants such an exemption or reduction, HUD will not require that the applicant establish an escrow account for that portion of the payment of property taxes. While the amendment necessitated by subsection 1407(c) is included in the final rule, the Department previously determined that this provision is effective as of October 28, 1992, the date of enactment of the 1992 HCD Act. HUD Field Offices were instructed to provide this information upon the request of an applicant or lessee. Miscellaneous Changes This final rule also amends part 291 to reflect changes to the Department's Supportive Housing program. The 1992 HCD Act terminated the Supportive Housing Demonstration (formerly implemented in 24 CFR parts 577 and 578), and replaced it with a new Supportive Housing program. An interim rule for that program was published on March 15, 1993 (58 FR 13870), and is codified at 24 CFR part 583. Changes to the Proposed Rule Finally, the Department has made several changes to the proposed rule in this final rule. Those changes are as follows: A. This final rule requires that applicants submit a certification of compliance with fair housing laws, as well as other nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements, as part of the preapproval process. B. In ยง291.410(d), the references to a 45-day period have been changed to 30-day period. The 45-day reference was inadvertently put in the proposed rule, and this change reflects a technical correction.
