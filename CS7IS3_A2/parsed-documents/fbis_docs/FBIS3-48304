The meeting in Moscow will be the first about the long-standing territorial dispute since Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited Japan last October. Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda will attend the meeting, while Vice Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov will represent Russia, Terada said. Terada declined to comment on the possible agenda for discussions at the two-day meeting, saying the Japanese and Russian Governments are currently working it out through diplomatic channels. Japan claims four Russian-held islands off northeastern Hokkaido. The former Soviet Union seized Shikotan, Kunashiri, Etorofu and the Habomai Islets at the end of World War II. Tokyo and Moscow originally scheduled the working-level talks for January, but postponed them at Russia's request.
