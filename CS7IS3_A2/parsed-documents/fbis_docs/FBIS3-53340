The crisis would continue and get worse. The nine points call for the formation of committees, leadership bodies, development councils, and planning and consultation bodies. They contain no political substance, but the problem is basically one of political substance. It was the absence of an agreed political concept that prompted the call for reform, the drafting of a memorandum urging reform, and the dispatch of a delegation headed by 'Abd-al-Shafi to discuss the issue of reform. For instance, the Taba negotiations are going through a crisis at present. The negotiations are led on the Palestinian side by Dr. Nabil Sha'th. If a committee was formed to participate in the negotiations with him, would that make a difference to the negotiation outcome and would it mean a certain change for the better? Of course not, because the presence of a committee with Sha'th would not make him more eloquent in expressing the Palestinian position and would have no effect on the nerves and morale of the Israeli negotiators. It is a question of Palestinian "policy." Palestinian policy is the point of contention. That is what should be discussed with 'Arafat. After that and once agreement is reached on that, it would be easy to form committees and we might discover that there was no longer a need for such committees. We have, over a period of some months, witnessed conflicting Palestinian policies. There was the policy pursued for 11 rounds in the Washington bilateral negotiations and then there was the policy which emerged in the Oslo secret talks and torpedoed all foundations of the negotiations held in Washington and the efforts to impose the idea of Palestinian sovereignty there, and then there was the third policy pursued in the Taba and Cairo negotiations raising the question of sovereignty again through insistence on the issue of the crossings and their control. Now, with the unconditional -- as they say -- resumption of the Taba negotiations we are seing a fourth aspect of Palestinian policy. That could mean dropping the formal demands on sovereignty and accepting just symbolic verbal or practical hints. These conflicting Palestinian policies denote a lack of strategy, absence of vision, absence of constant principles, and absence of red lines. They also reflect a Palestinian crisis. It is a political crisis. A political dialogue is needed for resolving that crisis but many people feel that it is now too late for that because the decisionmakers had already made up their minds and signed the Oslo agreement, and that it is now up to them to pluck out their own thorns with their own hands. The Palestinian crisis is no longer a crisis between hardliners and moderates or between romantics and realists or between accepters and rejecters and therefore it is not a matter for committees or committee debates to solve. The crisis is now between those who believe in a Palestinian pan-Arab position and those advocating cooperation with Israel's genius or who dream of Palestinian regional concept. It is now a battle between continuation of the fedayeen factions hegemony over Palestinian political action or new hegemony of the social forces over political action. These matters are the crux of the crisis and that is what should be discussed regardless of whether or not the nine requested committees are formed.
