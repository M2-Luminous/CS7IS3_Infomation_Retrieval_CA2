[Marjanovic] Well, you see, the stability of the government will depend on what we manage to achieve. Times are tough, and had we not believed that we could achieve something, I believe that neither I nor my associates would not have undertaken this task. What is the essence? The essence is that the only strong elements we had as pointers that we had to apply ourselves to diligently in order to fully succeed lay in our belief that, even in conditions of sanctions, there was a possibility of mobilizing the mechanisms for reviving the economy. If there were no sanctions, this would be a completely different thing, and I believe that we would be able to come up with even better programs. However, I am convinced that we will find the strength to keep the dinar stable, to improve and increase production, at least to the extent that will keep the dinar stable for the time being. Once we gain a little strength, then we can think more seriously about the further revival of the economy. [Jovic] I thank you for this interview, and wish you successful cooperation with your team and the best of luck in your work.
