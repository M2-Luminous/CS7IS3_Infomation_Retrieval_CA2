Anhui is leading other provinces in deposit volume of 36 minerals, including coal, iron, copper, sulfur, alum stone, cement limestone, and bentonite with a potential value of 700 billion yuan, winning Anhui not only a spot as a leading province in mineral deposits but also an economic superiority . The outcome of a recent evaluation on the extent of guarantee that Anhui's 37 major mineral resources can provide to the national economic construction in the year 2010 showed that the province's 146 confirmed coal bases -- mainly scattered in areas between Huainan city and Huaibei city -- with a deposit volume of nearly 25 billion tonnes rank seventh in the nation and tops other provinces in Eastern China. The close to 3-billion-tonnes confirmed iron deposits in 92 explored iron-producing areas representing 40 percent of the eastern China region's total, ranking first in the region and fifth nationwide. These iron deposits are mainly dispersed in the Maanshan, Lujiang, and Huoqiu areas, of which deposits in Maanshan and Lujiang account for 52.4 percent of the provincial total. It is estimated that additional potential iron deposits throughout the province may reach 1.2 billion tonnes. Confirmed copper deposits also rank fifth in the nation and second in eastern China region, mainly concentrated along the Chang Jiang River, of which deposits in Tongling, Wuhu, Guichi, and Anqing alone account for over 83 percent of the provincial total. Additional potential copper deposits are estimated to be 160 percent more than the existing known figures. What is particularly gratifying is that, of all the confirmed mineral deposits, 55 categories are concentrated along both sides of the Chang Jiang River, representing 60-100 percent of total deposits of the same minerals across the province. Besides iron, copper, and sulfur, cement limestone is also a major mineral resource along the Chang Jiang River, with confirmed deposit volume reaching 3.48 billion tonnes in 72 explored areas throughout the province. Ranking fifth in the nation and representing about 80 percent of the provincial total, these cement limestones are primarily scattered along the Chang Jiang River and in Chaohu Prefecture. Anhui's rich and diversified mineral deposits have provided an effective resource guarantee for its economic development.
