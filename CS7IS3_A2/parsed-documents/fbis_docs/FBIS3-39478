Democratic Alliance chiefs were amongst those of eight parties which recently announced the formation of the Progressive cartel, but the loose grouping of left-wing intellectuals withdrew its support shortly after, in protest over positions struck by the Progressives. Today's decision to return to the fold came after assurances from the other parties in the cartel, which is dominated by the Left Democrat Party, that the Progressives would continue with the economic recovery programme set in motion by current Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Also important were guarantees from the Left Democrats on elements in the cartel's programme, and on candidate selection.
