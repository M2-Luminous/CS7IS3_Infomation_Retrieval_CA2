An ITAR-TASS correspondent reports on the artificially hyped atmosphere of spy mania around the so-called Ames affair. An indicative example: On TV shows viewers are being asked what punishment they would determine for this married couple, who are accused of espionage. Whereas formerly it was claimed that two Soviet citizens cooperating with the CIA were exposed and executed in the eighties on Aldrich Ames' tip-offs, this figure has now already increased to 10. Meanwhile, after Ames fell under suspicion from the FBI in 1991, he was removed from top-secret work involving opposition to the KGB and was transferred to a department remote from politics -- the department for combating narcotics. All the same, the exposure of a double agent, a routine event for the intelligence world, is still riveting the heightened attention of the mass media. THE WASHINGTON POST reports on the recently completed visit of a special CIA delegation to Moscow. Details of the visit by the U.S. intelligence agents to their Russian counterparts are not reported. The paper only says that discussion of the Ames affair was unproductive. However, it can be assumed with a great deal of probability that the visitors from Langley could not have failed to take advantage of the opportunity afforded to them of censuring their Russian colleagues and rivals for not honoring a sort of gentleman's agreement between the two intelligence services to stop recruiting their agents among high-ranking officials, to which category Aldrich Ames can apparently be assigned. It can also be supposed that the Americans tried to twist the arms of the Russian intelligence agents to make them wind down their activity on U.S. territory and reduce the number of Russian intelligence agents working there. And, possibly, they also tried to find out what secrets Ames betrayed. Of course, the leadership of the Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] could not meet such demands. FIS Director Yevgeniy Primakov once called on the Americans to wind up intelligence activity against each other on a mutual, equal basis. However, the Russian intelligence agency's call was left hanging in the air. In principle it would be possible to return to discussion of this proposal today. However, judging by the assessment of this visit given by the Americans themselves, Langley believes that only they have the right to carry out intelligence activity. It would be unjust to accuse Russian intelligence agents of perfidy and breaking a gentleman's agreement -- if, despite all the stupidity of such an agreement, it does exist. The point is that Ames, the U.S. press claims, was recruited back in the mid-eighties before the beginning of Gorbachev's perestroyka. And Russian intelligence agents, as it were, inherited him from the Soviet intelligence agency. And it would be simply the height of folly to refuse the services of such a valuable agent. I am confident that, if the Americans were in our place, they would have acted in exactly the same way.
