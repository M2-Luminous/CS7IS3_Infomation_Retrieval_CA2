Vitaly Radetsky signed Wednesday [20 April] in Kiev an agreement on cooperation between the two countries' defense ministries. This is a framework agreement that stipulates different forms of cooperation in defense matters, including consultations on the formation and financing of defense forces, and joint action within the NATO Partnership for Peace program and in security policy. Kannik told reporters after signing the agreement that it will promote further development of Estonian-Ukrainian relations, which "are sound enough at present." "We have a number of problems in common, as we both derive from such an abnormal country as the Soviet Union was," Kannik declared. The Ukrainian defense minister said the security of Estonia and Ukraine can be ensured only through joint effort. "At present there are no big or small, strong or weak states: all countries must be treated on an equal footing," Radetsky claimed. The defense ministers discussed in meeting opportunities for exchanging information about international peacekeeping missions. Kannik introduced to Radetsky the Baltic states' plans for establishing a Baltic peacekeeping battalion. The Ukrainian defense minister observed that his country already has experience of keeping peace, since the Ukrainian blue helmets have for the past two years participated in peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia. Kannik spoke about the current state of Estonian-Russian relations. Radetsky, on his part, acquainted the Estonian defense minister with the relations between Russia and Ukraine and the tensions stemming from the division of the former Soviet Black Sea fleet and the subordination of the Crimean peninsula. The defense ministers' meeting touched on the reduction of conventional and nuclear armaments in Ukraine. Kannik voiced the opinion that Ukraine might consider donating or selling its superfluous military hardware and supplies to Estonia. "We decided to set up a group of experts to solve the issue, but made no concrete decisions as yet," Kannik told BNS. The defense ministers discussed the implementation of NATO's Partnership for Peace program in their countries. Kannik affirmed that Estonia hopes the program will lead to eventual full membership in the NATO. The Ukrainian defense minister said his country's parliament has blocked Ukraine from joining any military bloc for the time being, including military organizations of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Radetsky told BNS that Russian troops must withdraw from Estonia by the agreed-upon deadline. "Russian military bases on your territory are your domestic affair and you must yourself decide whether to let them remain or not," he stated. In the Ukrainian defense minister's opinion, Estonia shouldn't give Russian military retirees any special status. "Everything must be done in conformity with the requirements set by international organizations," Radetsky said. Kannik is scheduled to meet today with the Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister and Deputy Defense Minister Col. Gen. Ivan Oleinik, and several other high-ranking officers. His program for today also includes laying a wreath at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Kiev. The Estonian defense minister will tomorrow visit the Ukrainian Institute of Land Forces and meet with members of the general staff. Kannik is accompanied by the parliamentary Defense Commission Chairman Rein Helme, Estonia's charge d'affaires in Ukraine Andrei Birov, Defense Ministry Chancellor Tarmo Molder, and Defense Ministry and general staff officials. The Estonian delegation returns to Tallinn 23 April.
