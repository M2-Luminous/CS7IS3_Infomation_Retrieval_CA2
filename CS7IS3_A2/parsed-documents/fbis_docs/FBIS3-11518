So, will you run for the presidency of the Republic, Mr. Cardoso, or is it still a secret? "It is not a secret," he answered calmly, "but I still have to settle some things. I have not yet made up my mind." The international financial community does not hide its preference for the finance minister as the next Brazilian president. Thomas J. Trebat, an executive manager from the Chemical Bank, contends that Cardoso is the best hope for the continuity of the present economic reforms under the next Brazilian president. Tamzin Hobday, a Latin American expert at Baring Securities, cherishes the hope that a coalition among the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], the PFL [Liberal Front Party], and the "ethical sector" from the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] will choose Cardoso as presidential candidate. Ed Cabrera, a Latin American expert at Merrill Lynch, believes that if Cardoso's stabilization program achieves a measure of success he will outpoll all the other candidates, heading a center-left coalition in the runoff elections.
