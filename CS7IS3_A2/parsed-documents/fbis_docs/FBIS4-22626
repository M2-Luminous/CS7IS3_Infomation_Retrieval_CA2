The Ministry of Agriculture has submitted the draft Program of agrarian reform, which has been going on for three years already, to the Committee on Agricultural Policy of the Federation Council. The committee has invited to its parliamentary hearings forces which usually associate with one another in the language of ultimatums. It was intended to impartially listen to members of the government, deputies of the agrarian faction of the Duma, leaders of the "free farmers" and the "red landlords" and, having evaluated the positions of the parties, to decide where and how to further move the agrarian reform forward. However, as should have been anticipated, the proximity in the hall of the ideological opponents did not at all bring them together. Representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Russian Federation Committee on Land Resources and Land Management summed up the results of three years of reform. They produce a great impression in the sphere of the redistribution of "no man's property." Thus, 95 percent of the agricultural lands have found owners--collective and private. Moreover, the former have remained in the minority: only 34 percent of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes have maintained their status. Most of the land and property has been divided on shares among the members of joint-stock companies and associations (tovarishchestvo) and transferred free of charge to individual farmers, horticulturists and gardeners. That is, a mixed economic system has already returned to the village. Which, according to theory, presumes the competition of the producers and reasonable sustenance for you and I as a result. In practice, however, there hasn't been an increase in produce from the redistribution of the kolkhozes. The production of plant-growing products continues to decrease, although at a slower rate than in industry. During the three years farms have lost 15-20 percent of the cattle stock, which has slipped to the level of the '60s and '70s. In comparison with the pre-perestroyka period, deliveries of trucks to the village have dropped by a factor of five and those of combines and tractors by a factor of almost two. Last year arable land received two times less fertilizers than required, i.e., the land is losing fertility and we are squandering the grandchildren's property. The parties (storona) have not found a common answer to the question that is traditional in such a situation--"Who is guilty?" The representatives of the agrarian faction of the Duma have traditionally accused the reformers of the breakdown of the kolkhozes and the hurried spreading of individual farming. No less traditionally the representatives of the government have alluded to the errors of the previous Cabinet of Ministers, which fought against inflation at the expense of reducing state support of the village, and did not restrain the monopolists whose output increased in price three to five times more rapidly than grain, milk and meat. As a result both strong kolkhozes and individual farmers have found themselves bankrupt. There was even greater discord in forecasts. The academic secretary of the Russian Agricultural Academy, Anatoliy Shutkov, has predicted a 10 percent reduction in production this year and transformation of Russia into a raw material appendage of the West in the near future. Deputy Vasiliy Starodubtsev has stated that 30 million tonnes of grain less than usual will be gathered and that production on individual farms will drop by 15 percent. The head of the Ministry of Agriculture, Viktor Khlystun, on the contrary, has stated that in the next few months not only will one manage to stop the fall but also to gradually raise production. Having made the proviso, it's true, that to do this it is necessary to implement the decree on financial support of the agricultural industry and to adopt the Program of agrarian reform prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture. Don't confuse this document with the not unknown food program. And not just because it is being proposed to raise the village this time by market measures--demonopolization of enterprises, privatization of processing, of land... In this draft of the Program of agrarian reform, which is designed for two years, there is not even a hint of a limit with respect to the harvests, milk yields, or volumes of construction which it is necessary to reach. The question is one of the general principles and directions of the development of the agro-industrial complex and a policy of state protectionism. There are measures in the program long since promised and long since expected in the village. Let's say, the proposal to introduce state regulation of the prices for the products of monopolist enterprises and for the peasants--guaranteed purchase prices for basic products. Or the introduction of a single land tax instead of the innumerable assessments which now fleece the producers and in no way stimulate the efficient utilization of the land. Or the abandonment of the subsidization of food imports with the simultaneous repeal of all restrictions on the export of our own agricultural products. The question is when these measures will move from the sphere of drafts to real life. It's to the point to remember that this version is the sixth in succession. The previous five drafts have been buried in an abyss of corrections and coordinations. We have already paid dearly for attempts to reform the village without thinking, by means of one-time decrees and edicts. Tatyana Vasilyeva, an independent farmer from Krasnodar Kray, has said frankly that privatization has become pilferage and has proposed the adoption of a law by which one would be able to confiscate land from false independent farmers, of whom there are any number. It is no easier to correct the mistakes with the hasty privatization of processing enterprises built by kolkhoz and sovkhoz money. It is noted in the draft Program that the controlling bloc of shares in this case is to belong to the producers. However, time has been lost--many creameries and meat-packing plants have been privatized by city-dwellers and are dictating their own terms to the village... The program was prepared in today's version as long ago as last year, but because of the obstinancy of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economics simply hasn't attained approval. According to Viktor Khlystun the intention is to consider the draft in the presidium of the government only in April. The Duma and the Federation Council will examine the document later still, and later still both houses must adopt a group of laws in elaboration... Given the polarity of the viewpoints towards reform on the part of the executive and legislative power there is no guarantee at all that the concept of agrarian reform will be legitimized in the next few months. Well, what of it you say? We lived three years without a program and we'll live some more. Perhaps so. Only in this case tomorrow the reformers are condemned to make yesterday's mistakes. While the peasant hasn't known and doesn't know how much and what to sow. And whether to sow...
