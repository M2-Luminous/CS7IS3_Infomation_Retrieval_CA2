Government spokesmen admitted that the unions and Indian and peasant organizations which supported the strikes caused the intermittent closure of some roads but stressed that public forces rapidly reopened them. The spokesmen did not say if there were any clashes. According to reports from radio and television stations and human rights organizations, four peasants are in serious condition after being shot by soldiers who were trying to unblock a road near the port of Guayaquil, Ecuador's most congested city. Another person was injured when he was struck by a tear gas canister, according to information from the Ecumenical Human Rights Commission (CEDHU). Teachers and students also participated in the national strike even though the government had suspended classes at schools and colleges throughout the country to prevent disturbances. Government reports of strike observance in the electricity, telephone, fuel, and social and medical security sectors differed from more radical reports by the "Defense of Sovereignty and Anti-Privatization Front," [Frente de Defensa de la Soberania y Contra las Privatizaciones], the organization that organized the strikes. A Public Communication Secretariat communique containing a city by city strike report said there were only a few protests. As of 1800 (2300 GMT), the protests had not included power or telephone service cuts, a possibility voiced by some strike leaders. Evening newspaper headlines read: "War on Privatization," "Roads Militarized," "Roads Blocked," "Bureaucrats, Indians, and Teachers Paralyze Country," and "Protests." Radio and television stations reported that many public institutions that could be affected by privatization are on strike. Platoons of soldiers and police are patrolling the principal cities and national roads and are guarding gas stations and public offices. Ecuadoran Government Minister Marcelo Santos said the strike is being encouraged by "a tired union leadership that confuses state modernization with massive dismissals." He added that "the modernization process cannot be postponed or renounced." Santos said public security forces "have coordinated to ensure security, peace, and normalcy for those who wish to work." Carlos Larreategui, secretary general of public administration, said the government will not allow the country to be paralyzed by these two days of protests, which are occurring only five days before the legislative, municipal, and provincial elections on 1 May. Larreategui said the government could impose "administrative and even criminal sanctions" on the strike leaders, but he ruled out the possibility of decreeing a state of emergency.
