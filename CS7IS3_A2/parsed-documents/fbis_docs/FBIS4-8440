Czech President Vaclav Havel is host to the meeting, which will be attended also by: Thomas Klestil (Austria), Richard von Weizsaecker (Germany), Arpad Goncz (Hungary), Lech Walesa (Poland), Michal Kovac (Slovakia), and Milan Kucan (Slovenia). The seven presidents will discuss long-term possibilities for cooperation throughout the continent, but primarily in Central Europe. They do not intend to form any kind of union, adopt some initiative, or sign any strategic documents. Four specific themes have been identified as topics for discussion. First is the definition of Central Europe, its position and perspectives, and possibilities for cooperation within the region. Second is the position of Central Europe within an overall European context. Third is the problem of Russia and the Balkans. Fourth is the present condition of Europe, its problems and tasks, the threats it faces, and perspectives on its integration. On Saturday the seven presidents will hold a live televised discussion, moderated by French political scientist Jacques Rupnik. The April 15-16 meeting follows up a last year's meeting of Havel, Goncz, Klestil and Weizsaecker at the Salzburg Music Festival. Like that meeting, the current one will include several cultural events. The two days may also include some bilateral discussions, although none are formally planned. At the request of Austria's President Klestil, Havel has expressed his willingness to discuss the Temelin nuclear power plant being built in southern Bohemia. Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus will pay a brief visit as well, and will have dinner with the presidents on Friday night. At the conclusion of the conference on Saturday, six of the presidents will bid farewell to President von Weizsacker, who is leaving office later this year. Besides the hundreds of officials, police officers, journalists and others, local residents are also eagerly awaiting the presidential gathering. The last head of state to visit Litomysl was Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Josef I, who stayed there in the 1880s during some military exercises. Litomysl is being repaired and cleaned up for the visit, but "we are not building any Potemkin village," Mayor Miroslav Brydl said. He added that he intends to invite the heads of state to a glass of slivovice (plum brandy), but is not sure if the beverage meets the requirements of diplomatic protocol. The six guest presidents will spend Friday night at the Hotel Cernigov in nearby Hradec Kralove, while Havel is being prepared a room in Litomysl Castle. On Saturday and Sunday the castle will also host a symposium of Central European intellectuals under the title "A Shared Solitude," organized by +Stredoevropske noviny+ (Central European News). Participants will meet with President Havel on Saturday. Among them are Czech Culture Minister Pavel Tigrid, former Slovak Culture Minister Ladislav Snopko and Czech writer Ivan Klima, political scientist Jacques Rupnik, and former Czech Premier Petr Pithart.
