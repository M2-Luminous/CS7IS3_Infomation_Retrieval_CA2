At a news conference, President Mahamane Ousmane stated that they were prepared to send "a contingent or any other form of contribution depending on the exact request that will be made to us." He added: "The French initiative deserves to be supported. We have given it our moral and political support. At this stage, no other request has been made to us." President Mahamane Ousmane made the statement at the departure ceremony for Burkinabe President Blaise Compaore, who left Niamey this morning at the end of a 24-hour visit. When interviewed on his position on the French operation, President Compaore expressed his "support" for the operation but explained that Burkina Faso did "not have the means" to contribute materially. He said France was "forced" to make this decision due to the "resignation of the international community," including Africa. He added: "What are Africans doing? People are killing each other, but Africans are doing nothing to intervene. That was why France was forced to make that decision." He further stated: "Whether the solution comes from Africans or from others, we think that if anything can be done to save people now, it should be done."
