It should show the need for action by all possible political means in order to secure the withdrawal of the aggressors from the region and the return of the Iraqi Government to Kurdistan to serve our Kurdish people, as well as peace and stability in that entire region. Nobody, under the conditions prevailing in Kurdistan, and in light of the incident involving the two helicopters, can guarantee the avoidance of an actual military confrontation between Iraq and the coalition forces. It could happen at any time the United States or any other aggressor state fabricates an incident similar to the one involving the two helicopters, or some other incident, and accuses Iraq of being behind such an incident in order to carry out an aggression against it. This is especially true during the interim period prior to the next UN Security Council meeting, which will decide whether to increase or reduce the months of the blockade, which is the best description of the current general trend within the Council, including the position of three permanent member states that requested that the chairman's statement on the Council period meetings include reference to Iraq's cooperation with the world organization. The systematic U.S. campaign against Iraq since the last Security Council meeting, accusing it of violating what is termed "human rights" and perpetrating attacks on UN employees and observers in Kurdistan despite Iraq's repeated denials of these allegations, generally confirms Washington's intentions against Iraq; namely, to carry out a new aggression against it without going back to the Security Council. They hope to do this on the basis that the United States and its collaborators are not in need of another resolution from the Security Council in this regard since the Council had previously empowered them in the session which permitted the 30-state aggression on Iraq in 1991 to wage new attacks if Iraq declined to implement the UN resolutions according to their own opinions. If for some reason the new aggression could not be carried out against Iraq, the other solutions would be continuing the blockade and keeping the situation as it is in the Iraqi Kurdistan region on the pretext of protecting Iraqi Kurds from the Iraqi Army. We must observe the following: 1. The first announcement about the shoot down of the two U.S. helicopters came from the sources of the renegades. The announcement claimed, even before the facts about the incident became known, that the two helicopters were shot down by the Iraqi Air Force, a deliberate attempt to mix the cards and prepare the psychological environment for a military action by the United States and another ally against Iraq. This is explained by what U.S. officials had kept repeating, several hours after the incident, that they were waiting for the findings from the Coordination Center in Kurdistan and the European Command in Germany before determining the party responsible for the incident. 2. U.S. officials kept insisting, despite their admission that the two helicopters were shot down by two U.S. F-15 fighter bombers, that the two helicopters were carrying UN personnel, which was denied by the United Nations. The U.S. aim behind this was to mislead the world public about the foreign presence in Kurdistan and to portray it as a UN presence. This also was refuted by the spokesman of the UN secretary general when he pointed out that the United Nations had nothing to do with the different activities of the United States and its allies in Kurdistan. The U.S. reference to UN personnel was intended to avert the reaction of the families of the dead Americans, especially in the present circumstances when the U.S. Congress is locked in a sharp dispute with the waffling U.S. president over the Whitewater scandal. So, it was decided to release the information on the helicopter incident and the nationalities of the dead men to the American people in installments. At any rate, our people and the international community need to be extremely alert so as to confront the intrigues and plans of the United States, which seeks to greatly harm Iraq by every means, both inside and outside the UN Security Council, and to do all it can to make people in the United States and abroad forget the helictoper incident and to implement new plans against Iraq.
