FR941219-0-00062 FR941219-0-00016 HUD response. A servicer may report a delinquency to a credit reporting agency provided that the report does not concern a pending qualified written request, which questions the correctness of the account, or a loan payment sent by the borrower to the transferor, rather than the transferee, within 60 days after the servicing of the loan is transferred. (6) One commenter hypothesized a situation in which a borrower sends a qualified request in September concerning a late charge assessed on the March payment, yet the borrower has not made his April through August payments. Is the servicer prohibited from reporting these delinquencies in September, although they are unrelated to the March dispute? HUD position. The receipt of a qualified written request by the servicer determines when the 60-business day period begins. If the April through August delinquencies are caused by the problem or issue identified by the borrower in the request, adverse information related to all of these delinquencies may not be submitted or resubmitted, if previously reported. In this instance, the 60-business day period begins when the qualified written request is received in September. However, there is nothing in RESPA that prohibits the servicer from initiating foreclosure action, or taking other remedial actions under the applicable mortgage documents, against the mortgaged property based on the delinquent payments in March through August. The servicer's timing on initiating foreclosure action is governed by the provisions of the borrower's mortgage document. Servicing Involving Certain Government-Related Agencies or Enterprises Section 6 provides that certain government or government-sponsored entities that have oversight or other relationships with servicers are not themselves servicers for purposes of Section 6. These entities include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) in connection with assets acquired, assigned, sold, or transferred pursuant to section 13(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or as receiver or conservator of an insured depository institution. Section 6 also makes provisions for certain circumstances involving mortgage servicing loans when government or government-sponsored entities have to deal with the termination for cause of the contract for servicing a loan or with the commencement of proceedings for bankruptcy of the servicer in a program involving such entity. In addition, in giving the transfer notice the statute also allows a delay of up to 30 days after the transfer of servicing. HUD believes that Congress exempted these entities from most mortgage servicing transfer requirements so as not to interfere with the fiduciary responsibilities of the entities with regard to protective actions needed to be taken by such entities, and not to create for such governmental entities potential liability that could inhibit the orderly transfer of servicing. Also, imposition of standard business requirements in troubled situations involving a fiduciary could adversely affect the underlying value of the related mortgage servicing. Because the rationales discussed above apply equally well to other Federal entities not specifically enumerated in Section 6(i)(2) of the Act, the Secretary has exercised his authority under Section 19(a) of RESPA and has added certain other Federal agencies (HUD, including FHA; VA; NCUA; and FmHA) that might also be in a fiduciary position or need to protect a borrower in an otherwise covered mortgage loan situation. In addition, under Section 19 the Secretary has exempted FHA from having to provide the Notice of Transfer in those instances where the mortgage has been assigned (along with the servicing) to FHA for the payment of the mortgage insurance benefits pursuant to section 230 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715u). Under the assignment program, the mortgagor actively provides information to both the mortgagee and FHA in order to show that the mortgagor meets certain eligibility criteria. The assignment of the mortgage to FHA is not a business decision. Rather, it is a means by which eligible mortgagors can avoid foreclosure and keep their homes. Mortgagors are aware early on in the process that, if deemed eligible, HUD will become their mortgagee and servicer. HUD also accepts assignment of other single-family insured mortgage loans under certain specialty programs. These assignments are not comparable to the normal sale and purchase transactions that the mortgage servicing transfer provisions of Section 6 were designed to address. Thus, requiring HUD to provide the notice of transfer in cases where mortgages are assigned to HUD would not serve the purposes of Section 6, and these assignments have been exempted under the Secretary's authority in Section 19. Damages and Costs (1) The statute provides that whoever fails to comply with any provision of Section 6 shall be liable to the borrower. These damages include actual damages and, in an action brought by an individual, up to $1,000 for a pattern of noncompliance; in a class action, the additional damages may not exceed the lesser of $500,000 or 1% of the servicer's net worth. A commenter noted that ``actual damages'' should be clarified. If a servicer reported a debt to a credit bureau within the 60-business day proscribed period, and the borrower alleges that the reporting resulted in the borrower's inability to obtain credit, the servicer could be liable for damages, even if the report was correct. Therefore, the commenter suggested that to prove actual damages the borrower must show: (a) The servicer made the report to a credit company within the proscribed period; (b) The borrower was correct, the dispute was resolved in the borrower's favor; and (c) The borrower would have otherwise been approved for the credit. HUD position. If a servicer violates ยง3500.21(g) by reporting information on a borrower to a credit agency relating to a dispute regarding the borrower's payments within 60 business days of receiving a qualified written inquiry from the borrower, that servicer will be liable for all proven actual damages that the borrower suffered because of the servicer's action. Further, if a pattern of noncompliance can be established, the servicer may be liable to that borrower for additional damages not to exceed $1,000. The costs of the action and attorneys fees also can be recovered. The statute requires no qualifying criteria that the borrower must meet before actual damages may be sought from the servicer. (2) One commenter suggested that the date on the Servicing Disclosure Statement was unnecessary. Another commenter noted that the Acknowledgment Form requires the applicant to state that he has read and ``understands'' its contents; however, the commenter stated, this might create potential legal complications. HUD response. Since the servicer is liable for damages and costs, it is in the servicer's own interest to note, by dating the form, when the Servicing Disclosure Statement was given (or placed in the mail) to the borrower. In any event, the requirement is statutory and has been retained in the final rule. Similarly, the language concerning the applicant's understanding of the disclosure statement reflects the statute and follows common business practice. Conforming Amendment to Escrow Rule The Department is also publishing a conforming amendment to its final rule on escrow accounting procedures, published on October 26, 1994 (59 FR 53890). Other Matters Regulatory Flexibility Act Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the undersigned hereby certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. HUD finds that there are no anticompetitive aspects of the interim rule that are discriminatory with regard to small entities nor are there any unusual procedures that would need to be complied with by small entities. In any event, by statute, the requirements of this rule must be adhered to by all lenders and servicers.
