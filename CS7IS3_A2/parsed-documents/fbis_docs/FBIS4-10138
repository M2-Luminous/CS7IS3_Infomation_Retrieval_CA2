Abelardo Moreno, Cuban representative on the special committee on UN peacekeeping operations, warned that if that fundamental element was not taken into account, with or without a Cold War, with or without an East-West confrontation, conflicts would continue to proliferate and become increasingly dangerous. Moreno predicted: Then, the United Nations will continue to be drawn into an upward-spiraling tendency to resort to weapons and militarism that will erode its credibility and ruin the philosophy that gave rise to the United Nations itself. He reflected: Those who believed the end of the Cold War was the universal cure-all for solving problems accumulated over centuries forgot that erecting solid foundations for development and promoting economic and social progress for all constitute the very raison d'etre for the collective security system provided for in the UN Charter.
