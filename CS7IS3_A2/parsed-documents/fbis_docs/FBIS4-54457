Miri: "The Matter Could Be Brought to Court"] [Text] Yesterday the Albanian-language media in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] broadcast an extremely harsh protest against Albanian Radio-Television [RTSH] by the ethnic Albanian parliamentary group, Albanian ministers in the Macedonian Government, and other members of Macedonian state institutions. They described the work of Albanian Radio-Television as "anti-Albanian activity aimed at splitting further the Albanian political body in Macedonia." At the same time, they repeated that RTSH programs have contained inaccurate news, implying that this was done for divisive purposes. If the RTSH and its programs are going to continue like this with their lies and slanders, the Albanian political, state, and public figures in Macedonia pledged that they "would be compelled to bring it to court." How could the RTSH come to such a fateful point? All this comes as no surprise. It was in fact the RTSH's real objective from the very beginning to reach a point that could virtually be called extremely detrimental to the national cause by splitting and misinforming the nation. There is no cause for wonder, because the RTSH first started doing this sort of thing with the Albanians in Albania by unjustly accusing, differentiating, and insulting them, by misinforming the public, and not allowing others to speak their mind. However, the people in charge of the RTSH are under the "umbrella" of the party in power, and are therefore untouchable. They have been running unstopped. If nobody deters them in Macedonia, the danger will be much greater. Do the RTSH's divisive activities, as our compatriots in Macedonia call them, have any significance for our national unity? It may sound paradoxical, but it is of immense significance. The political parties, intellectuals, and ordinary people here in Albania who were directly or indirectly affected by the RTSH over this period used to think that it was their misfortune alone, and that nobody cared about their plight. Meanwhile, the RTSH extended its evil activities to the detriment of Albanians living outside Albania. When the poor Albanians heard about it, they felt somewhat relieved that they could share their plight with their brothers across the border. This is a very good opportunity for Albanians to unite in their plight, which was created for them by the so-called RTSH. What can we say about the financial problems of the RTSH? Since the RTSH satellite programs are sponsored by Albanians living outside Albania, as is public knowledge, and since the whole thing was built up by those Albanians, it means that the RTSH has obligations toward them. However, it does not mean the obligation to misinform the public, lie, and pursue divisive activities, as the declaration from Macedonia proves the RTSH is actually doing. Recently the RTSH has been launching appeals for cash donations to its bank account. After all these professional flaws and the discontent that the RTSH has created, one might doubt that any money will be forthcoming. Finally, what is the Albanian parliament going to do about it? According to the law, the RTSH answers to the Albanian parliament, and one of its defined objectives is to serve the national cause. Thus, parliament finds itself confronted by two great problems. Will this parliament have its say on the matter, given that both the law and our national unity have been damaged? It remains to be seen.
