On the basis of summing up and exchanging experiences, the meeting mainly discussed measures to strengthen the management of "call-in hotline" programs so that this kind of programs can develop the strong points and avoid the weak points and create a fine media environment for reform, opening up, and socialist construction in a still better way. "Call-in hotlines" are a new form in broadcasting reform. This form of programs has broken through the traditional mode of "one-way" broadcasting and increased the opportunity for the audience to participate so that broadcasting can be much closer to the masses, life, and reality. "Call-in hotlines" have not only won an audience but also injected vitality and vigor into broadcasting in competition with the numerous other news media. But because management has not kept up with "call-in hotlines" since their launching, many problems have surfaced in the course of the promotion of this form of broadcasting by radio stations of various localities. Some have indiscriminately set up "call-in hotline" programs without considering program content or whether or not it is appropriate for the programs to be broadcast, resulting in too many "call-in hotline" programs and too much indiscrimination. Some "call-in hotline" programs discuss topics that are devoid of positive meaning. Some broadcast boring content and fail to interest the audience. Some program hosts are of low caliber, have weak ability of expression, and are long-winded. They talk empty words or nonsense with the audience, wasting broadcasting time. Some "call-in hotline" programs of a few radio stations produce content deviating from the principles and policies of the party and the government. Strengthening the management of "call-in hotline" programs and developing their strong points, while avoiding their weak points so that they have their own characteristics and enhance social efficiency is an important question in the deepening of broadcasting reform. Participating comrades held that it is first necessary to strengthen general management and refine the programs, saying: It is necessary to integrate "call-in hotlines" with traditional form of broadcasting so the two forms develop their own strong points and are continuously innovative and the tendency of indiscriminately producing "call-in hotline" programs in the absence of ripe conditions can be avoided. It is necessary to exercise control over "call-in hotline" programs. Radio stations that do not have the conditions should not indiscriminately launch this kind of program. Those with some conditions should also consider their own strength. This kind of program should not be too numerous. It is necessary to make efforts to improve the quality of call-in programs. Second, it is necessary to define the guiding principles for all "call-in hotline" programs and set up sound operational mechanisms suited them. Programs for conversational purposes should have their finger on the pulse of the times. They should keep abreast of the changes in social life and the feelings of the masses and choose topics in which the masses are interested and which have a bearing on the national economy and people's livelihood and on tens of thousands of households. They should exchange views with the audience through hot lines, propagate the party's and government's principles, policies, and new measures and should dismiss the masses' misgivings, vent their feelings, enhance their confidence, and play a correct role in guiding public opinion. Hotline programs for entertainment purposes should integrate education and entertainment. Their ideological and cultural standards should be enhanced and they should nurture the audience with healthy and forward-looking programs. Service "call-in hotline" programs should ensure the accuracy, truth, and reliability of the broadcast content, embodying the principle of earnestly and sincerely serving the audience. Programs that involve social problems should first be recorded, examined, and selectively broadcast. Moreover, they should report the results of reporters' interviews so they play the role of supervising the media. Radio stations that launch "call-in hotline" programs should establish a sound monitoring system, a checking-monitoring system, and a responsibility system that match this kind of programs. They should have corresponding technical equipment and ensure that this kind of programs is safe and of good quality through systems and technical measures. Moreover, it is necessary to continuously improve the political and professional quality of "call-in hotline" program workers, including program hosts, editors, and reporters and to enhance their sensitivity and adaptability to news to guarantee the quality of this kind of programs.
