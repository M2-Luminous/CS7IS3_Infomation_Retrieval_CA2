In the first place I would say: the international prestige of the United Nations would be undermined. That is certain. This action would look like a unilateral action to punish the Serbs. Moreover, great losses among the civilian population are inevitable. Second, the inflicting of these strikes could trigger a large-scale war, and, even worse, these strikes could act as a trigger for other states, neighboring states, to be drawn into this war.
