Denktas, who is on a private visit to Turkey, called on the Turkish National Assembly to declare the union between the occupied areas [northern Cyprus] and Turkey on the same day the announcement is made that Cyprus has joined the European Union. Denktas asked the Turkish leadership not to confine itself to the military occupation, but to support the pseudostate financially. With financial support, he said, the pseudostate could become a showcase for Turkey, which will rid it of the image of an occupation force. Alternate government spokesman Spiros Arotis stressed Denktas' inconsistency and recalled that the high level agreements [of 1977 and 1979] providing for a federal solution in Cyprus bear his signature. The spokesman said Denktas has proven in practice that what he seeks and hopes for eventually is the recognition of his pseudostate.
