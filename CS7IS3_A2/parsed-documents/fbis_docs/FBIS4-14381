The agreement will lead to a unified and good performance that will enable us to look forward to a good future. Moreover, it will constitute the groundwork for expanding the circle of dialogue and finalizing formulas for Palestinian unity. In an exclusive statement, Zaki added: This is the first time in history that the Palestinians have embarked on establishing an entity. That requires priority in caring for, protecting, and defending this entity. Zaki stressed: In order to avoid what happened in other revolutions that ended painfully with the outbreak of civil wars, we will not allow those models to be repeated in Palestine. Therefore, we have continued and will continue the dialogue with all Islamic and national Palestinian forces and factions in a bid to avoid the specter of a civil war and infighting.
