UNITA is accusing the government troops of firing on Huambo again. The spokesman for the UNITA delegation in Lusaka, Jorge Valentim, has just told us what happened: [Valentim] There was heavy bombardment by the government air force from 1000 hours [0900 GMT] yesterday, in an unexpected, irrational and blind way. Bombs were dropped everywhere in waves, on houses. Many houses disappeared... [Unidentified correspondent, interrupting] Have the government armed forces or the Angolan Government acknowledged these renewed attacks? [Valentim] Well, there is no way they can deny these attacks, because there were international observers. These had to go to the shelters too, including an American representative visiting Huambo. [Announcer] That was UNITA spokesman in Lusaka, Jorge Valentim, speaking to us moments ago. He accuses the Angolan Armed Forces of resuming bombardments on Huambo.
