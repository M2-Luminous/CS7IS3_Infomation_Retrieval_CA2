The Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat issued a communique announcing the creation of the subpanel. The communique added that in his speech in Brussels, Herminio Blanco Mendoza, under secretary for international trade negotiations, assessed President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's economic and social policy, which seeks to improve the distribution of income and combat extreme poverty. During this meeting, Blanco Mendoza stressed the need to create jobs and raise the competitiveness of Mexico's productive sector. He said the government's efforts in these areas have gotten under way through the utilization of four complementary strategies. These strategies are: achieving macroeconomic stability; consolidating trade opening; deregulating various sectors of the economy; and expanding bilateral, subregional, and multilateral negotiations to open and reinforce markets. Foreign Under Secretary Antonio de Icaza, in turn, noted that new circumstances were affecting Mexico and the world, and he stressed that Mexico was undergoing a deep-rooted transformation to adapt to the new situation. In this regard, it should be stressed that Mexico, besides being a founder of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, has joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum and will soon join the OECD. In addition, NAFTA will provide Mexico with the means to consolidate structural changes and to achieve an efficient incorporation into the world economy. In discussing the nation's recent evolution, De Icaza highlighted the national political agreement reached a short time ago and the different electoral reforms and other pacts that consolidate democracy and strengthen its institutions. Juan Prat, general director in charge of North-South relations, noted that greater emphasis on economic cooperation constitutes a solution to the new situation in Latin America by encouraging activities of mutual interest that will reinforce regional reform.
