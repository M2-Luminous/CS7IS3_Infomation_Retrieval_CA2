The important thing now is not to lose, but on the contrary, to develop the positive impetus and try to consolidate it. This was stressed by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev when he took stock of the almost two-hour long talks he held today with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, who is visiting Moscow. The Russian foreign minister described the talks as fruitful and frank. The Bosnian guest shared the positive appraisal. Noting that prerequisites have emerged for settling the conflict, Silajdzic added: The opportunity must not be lost. It is time to move toward the establishment of peace in Bosnia. We expect the Russian Government to play a constructive role in the continuation of the talks on Bosnia, Silajdzic said. At the same time the prime minister called for Russia to pursue a more balanced policy toward certain aspects of the Yugoslav crisis. We hope, he added, that the Russian battalion deployed around Sarajevo will play a positive role and make it possible to preserve Sarajevo as a multiethnic city. For his part, Kozyrev said that Russian diplomacy always maintains a balanced stance with regard to the Yugoslav conflict. The minister stressed: We reject the discriminatory approach to the peoples of the former Yugoslavia and particularly Bosnia-Herzegovina. All these peoples and ethnic groups are near and dear to the Russians. Regarding the reaching of an accord on the formation of a Croatian-Muslim federation, Silajdzic stressed that this agreement excludes no one. Of course, he indicated, it could not be implemented without the Serbs' consent. We clearly stated that our agreement would also be proposed to the Serb side. At the same time, it is quite possible that at the moment they are not ready to accept it. In that case, we will find some other option that is nonetheless based on the main thing -- namely the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Silajdzic said that during his meeting with Kozyrev a whole range of issues of bilateral Bosnian-Russian relations were discussed. The prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina called, in particular, for the development of cultural cooperation. The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned that Silajdzic is to depart from Moscow at about 1630 today.
