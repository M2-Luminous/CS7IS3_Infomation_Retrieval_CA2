Tel Aviv and Ankara officials will hold talks on the most important regional and international issues and the expansion and strengthening of relations between the Zionist regime and Turkey during his visit. The high-ranking mutual visits between Ankara and Tel Aviv have significantly promoted their bilateral political relations. They have also promoted their relations on issues relating to trade, defense, and security. Turkey and the Zionist regime have reached agreements on free trade, improving bilateral trade relations, cooperation in the defense industry, improving relations in tourism, and supplying water from the Manavgat River to occupied Palestine. The main objective of Peres' visit to Ankara can be described as reaching a final agreement on the two countries' plan to supply water to Israel from the Manavgat River, which is on Turkey's Mediterranean coastline. One of the main reasons why Tel Aviv wants to improve its relations with Ankara is the Zionist regime's need for the water of the Euphrates, Tigris, and Manavgat Rivers in Turkey. According to the Zionist regime's leading officials, Tel Aviv can solve the water problem, which stops many Jews resettling in the occupied land, that is, if that regime can have itself accepted as a country that shares the region's water resources with Ankara's support. The Zionist regime's officials are convinced that Turkey, as a NATO country and a close U.S. ally in the region, can make a significant contribution to the effort to step up the pace of the talks on the so-called Middle East peace plan. That will help the Zionist regime, which still occupies Jerusalem, to remain and increase its strength in the region. That Islamic movements in Turkey and the region are gradually gaining strength must not be overlooked. Obviously, it has made Turkey and Israel uneasy. The recent victory achieved by the Prosperity Party in the local elections in Turkey is a clear sign of the strength the Islamic movement has gained in that country. The issue of Islamic movements has always been a priority in the talks held between Turkey and Israel. Undoubtedly, the issue will have priority in the talks that Shim'on Peres will have in Ankara. Considering all that, Peres' visit to Turkey can be described as a new step to promote bilateral relations and draw the policies of the two sides closer. The objection of the Islamic people in Turkey, which is an Islamic country, to the improvement of Ankara's relations with the Zionist regime has worried the two sides. Both have identified the psychological obstacle. But officials of the two countries continue to promote their relations as much as possible. Political observers in the region have assessed the demonstrations held by thousands of Islamic people in Turkey against the United States and the Zionist regime on the eve of Peres' visit to Ankara as a warning against Tel Aviv's expansionist and hegemonist policies in the region.
