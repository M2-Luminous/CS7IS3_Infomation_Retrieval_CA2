This information was passed on to us by the president's Press Office staff. The president previously criticized the budget, which had been passed by the Sejm, for not taking into account social expectations and particularly for failing to keep the promises given by the government parties during the course of last year's election campaign. Today's decision was preceded by consultations the president conducted among various circles. Andrzej Drzycimski, press spokesman for the Belweder, recently explained that Walesa had asked the question whether to sign or not to sign many times and had received various answers. The government coalition argued that the president could not refuse to sign the budget, which had been adopted by the government and passed by parliament, because this would be against state interests. At a meeting of the Council for Local Government Affairs at the Belweder, the president announced that he intends to veto the electoral law for parish councils. He said he will be prepared to accept the law, provided the local government elections are postponed until next year. [begin Walesa recording] My assessment of local government is quite good or even very good. For this reason, in this complicated situation, I wanted to postpone the election for a year, but it has not worked. The coalition wants to have its own people. This is normal. That is why, no matter what I do, I will not have time to make another move. If I had another two months, I could do it. There was social pressure. They are not strong enough not to change their minds. But I do not have enough time. My only possibility is the electoral law, whether it should be the old one or the new one. I am convinced that the new one should not be introduced. Now, either changes are introduced, or I will insist on my veto of the new law. They will not have time to introduce changes. The choice will be either to change the law and postpone it for a year, or retain the old electoral law. [end recording] [Announcer] The council supported the president's position. Let me remind you that the council's members are representatives of local government assemblies and the Union of Polish Cities, as well as academics and parliament members responsible for local government affairs.
