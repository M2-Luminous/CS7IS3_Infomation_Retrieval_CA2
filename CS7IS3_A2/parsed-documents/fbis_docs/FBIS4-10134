FBIS4-10134 "drlat068_l_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Bolivia Government Silent Over Incident Government Silent Over Incident PY0804021294 La Paz Television Nacional Network in Spanish 1700 GMT 7 Apr 94 PY0804021294 La Paz Television Nacional Network Spanish BFN [Text] The government refuses to clarify the mysterious manner in which Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, assistant to Isaac Oso Chavarria, traveled to Costa Rica to be questioned by the DEA. Justice Minister Rene Blattman says he has no information about this case, which is being investigated by the Ministry of Government. He also does not know whether or not Edgar Fernandez Lazcano was forbidden to leave the country. The minister said, however, this is not very important, as anyone in Bolivia can disobey the prohibition on leaving the country and get out of Bolivia. The migration under secretary certainly did not like Blattman's statement. [Begin recording] [Unidentified migration under secretary] Did the justice minister say that? Well, he must send me a list of the names of people who left the country during my administration in defiance of an order to remain. [Unidentified corresponedent] Was Fernandez Lazcano prohibited from leaving the country? [Under secretary] Fernandez Lazcano? No, he received no order prohibiting him from leaving the country. Until the moment he left -- because it is not known when he left the country -- there was no order prohibiting him from leaving the country. [end recording] If Fernandez Lazcano was not forbidden from leaving the country, he could have left the country legally, with a passport. The migration office says he did not use it: [Begin under secretary recording] I can tell you that his departure was not registered in any airport controlled by the Migration Undersecretariat. The only thing I can tell you is that if he left the country he may have left using one of the many methods used by people linked to drug trafficking, through clandestine air strips or by land. [end recording] Meanwhile, the president of the Republic has met with several ministers to discuss this subject, and it has been reported that in the next few hours a communique will be released to the public explaining how Edgar Fernandez Lazcano left Bolivia. In turn, the DEA was criticized in political circles for kidnapping Edgar Fernandez Lazcano to question him in Costa Rica. Bolivian congressmen agree that the DEA owes an explanation to Bolivia. [Begin Deputy Fernando Kieffer Guzman recording] Yes, of course, I think they acted excessively and arbitrarily, which must be countered as soon as possible; otherwise, this will unnecessarily affect U.S.-Bolivian relations, as there was no real reason for this action. The two objectives sought by the DEA in this case could have been met: that Fernandez Lazcano be a witness in court, and also in the lawsuits that are being followed in the United States. Right? Yet this was a precipitate, clumsy action. It was an abuse. [end recording] MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] Deputy Fernando Campero said that in the case of Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, Bolivian sovereignty is being trampled upon. [Begin Campero recording] The amendment approved some time ago by the U.S. Congress, which authorizes the kidnapping of individuals linked to drug trafficking even without the knowledge or coordination with the officials of the foreign country, represents an offense to the dignity of our countries. I think that in this joint struggle carried out by the United States and all the countries against this scourge of drug trafficking, we should seek mechanisms of coordination and mutual respect. [end recording] So far, neither the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor the Ministry of Government have made statements on this sensitive subject.
