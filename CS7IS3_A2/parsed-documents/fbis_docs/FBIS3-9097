The Zagreb-based Croatian radio said Moslem troops were attacking Croat positions around Kiseljak in central Bosnia from small arms and anti-aircraft guns. The same source said the situation in the Mostar area was calm on Saturday. The Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo, on the other hand, reported continuous small arms attacks on the Moslem section of Mostar. Moslem attacks on Serb positions in central and northern Bosnia also continued on Saturday. Bosnian Serb military sources in the area of Srbobran (formerly Donji Vakuf) reported Moslem provocations from the direction of Bugojno, central Bosnia. The Moslem troops on that section of the front have been regrouping over the past 24 hours, the sources said and added that the local authorities in Srbobran had ordered all public institutions and schools to suspend work in the expectation of a Moslem attack. The Bosnian Serb army said the strongest Moslem attacks were reported in the Trebava river valley to the northeast of Doboj. The Moslem infantry attacks were successfully repulsed and the enemy was forced to retreat, the same source said and added that the Moslems were regrouping and bringing in reinforcements from Gracanica east of Doboj. A Moslem commando team attempting an infiltration into the area south of Doboj was successfully neutralized on Friday night, the Bosnian Serb army said and added that two commandoes were killed after stepping on a mine while retreating and that several others were seriously wounded.
