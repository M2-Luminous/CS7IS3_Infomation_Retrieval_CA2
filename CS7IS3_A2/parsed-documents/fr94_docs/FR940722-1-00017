(iii) Additional obligations of the trustee when name, TIN, and address of the trust are furnished to payors_ (A) Obligation to file Forms 1099. The trustee reporting under this paragraph must file with the Internal Revenue Service the appropriate Forms 1099, reporting the income or gross proceeds paid to the trust during the taxable year, and showing the trust as the payor and the grantor or other person as the payee. The trustee has the same obligations for filing the appropriate Forms 1099 as would a payor making reportable payments directly to the grantor or other person, except that the trustee must report each type of income in the aggregate, and each item of gross proceeds separately. (B) Obligation to furnish statement. ( 1 ) Unless the grantor or other person treated as the owner of the trust is the trustee or a co-trustee of the trust, the trustee reporting under this paragraph must also furnish the grantor or other person with a statement that_ ( i ) shows all items of income, deduction, and credit of the trust for the taxable year; ( ii ) provides the grantor or other person with the information necessary to take the items into account in computing the grantor's or other person's taxable income; and ( iii ) states that all items of income or gross proceeds that the trustee is required to report to the Internal Revenue Service on Form 1099 have been included on the statement. ( 2 ) By furnishing the statement, the trustee is treated as having satisfied any obligation to furnish statements to recipients with respect to the Forms 1099 filed by the trustee. (iv) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b)(1). Example 1. G creates an irrevocable trust which provides that the ordinary income is to be payable to him for life and that on his death the corpus shall be distributed to B, an unrelated person. Except for the right to receive income, G retains no right or power which would cause him to be treated as an owner under sections 671 through 677. Under the applicable local law, capital gains must be added to corpus. Since G has a right to receive income, he is treated as an owner of a portion of the trust under section 677. The tax consequences of any items of capital gain of the trust are governed by the provisions of subparts A, B, C, and D (section 641 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Because not all of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor, the trustee may not report by the methods described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Example 2. (i)(A) On January 1, 1995, G, a United States citizen, creates a revocable trust all of which is treated as owned by G. The trustee of the trust is T. During the 1995 taxable year the trust has the following items of income and gross proceeds: Interest $2,500 Dividends 3,205 Proceeds from sale of B stock 2,000 (B) The trust has no items of deduction or credit. (ii)(A)( 1 ) The payors of the interest paid to the trust are X ($2,000), Y ($300), and Z ($200). The payors of the dividends paid to the trust are A ($3,200) and B ($5). The payor of the gross proceeds from the sale of B stock is S ($2,000). The B stock was purchased by T for $1,500 on January 2, 1995, and sold by T on November 30, 1995. T furnishes the name, TIN, and address of the trust to X, Y, Z, A, B, and S. T timely files a Form 1099&hyph;INT with the Internal Revenue Service on which T reports interest attributable to G, as the owner of the trust, of $2,500; a Form 1099&hyph;DIV on which T reports dividends attributable to G, as the owner of the trust, of $3,205; and a Form 1099&hyph;B on which T reports proceeds from the sale of B stock attributable to G, as the owner of the trust, of $2,000. On or before the date specified in section 6034A(a), T furnishes a statement to G which lists the following items of income and information necessary for G to take the items into account in computing G's taxable income: Interest. $2,500 Dividends. 3,205 Gain from sale of B stock 500 Information regarding sale of B stock: Proceeds $2,000 Basis 1,500 Date acquired 1/02/95 Date sold 11/30/95 ( 2 ) In addition, the statement furnished to G states that all items of income or gross proceeds that T is required to report to the Internal Revenue Service are included on the statement.
