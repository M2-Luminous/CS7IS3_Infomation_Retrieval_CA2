After three months of unsuccessful debates, the government bloc suddenly on the evening of 20 April sided with the minority to approve the proposal for the JNE to organize the elections, thus freezing the implementation of a new elections system provided for in the new Constitution (1993). One political analyst said: "This drastic change was prompted by a recommendation by President Fujimori." The chief of state allegedly said: "There can be no suspicion of fraud if the adversary's rules are used." The draft bill was approved by 55 votes to four, with three abstentions. It is divided into 11 articles. The first article states: The JNE, fully renewed, will organize the national electoral process for the election of president, vice president, and legislators. The JNE will comprise five members: One chosen by the Supreme Court, one by the Board of Supreme Court Prosecutors, one by the Lima Bar Association, one by the deans of the law schools of the public universities, and one by the deans of the law schools of private universities. It also states that by next July, at the latest, the JNE should have a comprehensive single text of the election rules to be used in April 1995. Moreover, it must draft the regulations for the operation of the voters' registry and come up with a vote return system to expedite the vote tally. Constitution Commission President Carlos Torres y Torres justified the "sudden change of mind," stating that it sought to prevent people from "talking about fraud." Henry Pease of the Democratic Left Movement (MDI), among others, praised the decision. "The opposition was being pressed by public opinion and had no other alternative than to back down."
