Target of Bribery Probe Prosecutors Question Officials OW1701155594 Tokyo KYODO in English 1441 GMT 17 Jan 94 OW1701155594 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Prosecutors are investigating major contractor Obayashi Corp. on suspicion that it gave 10 million yen to former Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii to secure favorable treatment in a bid for a public works contract, sources close to prosecutors said Monday [17 January]. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office has questioned Obayashi Corp. officials, including a 66-year-old vice president, and Sendai City officials on a voluntary basis, the sources said. Investigators believe the Osaka-based company gave 10 million yen to Ishii, then Sendai mayor, in October 1992 after asking him for favorable consideration in its bid for a 8.2 billion yen project to construct a waste incineration plant, they said. Ishii allegedly proposed to city officials that they separate the bids for the building and other parts of the plant in response to the firm's request. Obayashi Corp., Japan's fourth-largest construction firm, wanted to contract only the building, but the bid was held in June last year as one lump package in spite of Ishii's efforts, they said. The concern subcontracted part of the project from Osaka-based plant maker Hitachi Zosen Corp., which won the contract for the whole project to build the Kuzuoka Waste Incineration Plant, scheduled to be completed by September 1995. No official of Obayashi Corp. has been arrested or charged in the current wave of bribery scandals involving mayors and governors, in which officials of seven major construction firms and a paper manufacturer have been indicted since last summer. Ishii, 68, is on trial for allegedly taking a total of 130 million yen in bribes from six general contractors including Hazama Corp., Shimizu Corp., Taisei Co., and Nishimatsu Construction Co.
