The meteorological institutes forecast there will be no major condition changes in the next hours. From reporter Angel Leon Cabrera in Santiago de Cuba, we have the following report on the damages caused by the rain. [Begin Leon recording] Intense rain continues in Santiago de Cuba. According to information from the provincial capital released at noon, one person was reported missing in Guama and one person injured in Santiago. There are also reports that 1,057 homes have been affected. Of these, 43 of were completely destroyed and 245 partially destroyed. That figure could rise. A man showed me the roof of his house, which was about to collapse. This situation can be seen in several homes. Ninety-two people remain evacuated. Damages to the electric system have increased. Because of damages to the fuel tanks, three units of the Rente power plant are completely paralyzed. There is also significant damage to roads and telephone lines. That is why information from those municipalities is limited. According to Ruben Vidaud, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Santiago de Cuba Municipality, the city has taken steps in case the situation grows worse. After approximately one week of rain in Santiago, people are wondering how long this situation will continue. The intense rainfall begins at night and lasts throughout the night and into the morning. At dawn, they wake up to the images that we have seen. [end recording] For its part, Guantanamo Province, which was also affected by intense rain, suspended classes until weather conditions improve, with the exception of mid-level classes at boarding schools. This Provincial Defense Council measure was taken to prevent accidents and deaths. Rosa Maria Fernandez reports from Guantanamo. [Begin Fernandez recording] The people of Guantanamo are serenely confronting the adverse conditions caused by the rain since 18 May, especially yesterday evening and morning. There was intense rain, strong winds, and lightning throughout the day and a total of 123 millimeters of rain fell. The province has an average of 276 ml of rain so far this month, which is 40 percent over the usual average for May. The dams continue to overflow. The dam with highest capacity, (La Yaya), is releasing 525 cubic meters per second causing floods downstream. This has affected numerous agricultural areas. Likewise, the dams close to the Salt mines in Caimanera are completely full, which has caused flooding in the lower areas. The municipalities of Yateras, Niceto Perez, El Salvador, and Maisi are completely cut off. Serious damage to the Farola road has rendered Baracoa completely inaccessible and has cut communications to Maisi. Also, Guantanamo Province does not have access to neighboring provinces by road or train. This entire situation has brought about the evacuation of more than 7,800 people, 3,202 of which are being sheltered by the state. The rest of the people are receiving warm help at private residences from solidary neighbors and relatives. So far, 764 homes have been affected by the storm, eight of which were completely destoyed. In that sense, the municipalities most affected are Guantanamo, Yateras, and Imias. It has also been necessary to evacuate more than 12,000 heads of cattle. The Provincial Defense Council's concern as well as that of the State's highest leadership, which has kept itself informed on the decisions made and solutions determined regarding each case, is constant. There is a reason for saying water costs the people of Guantanamo a lot: sometimes because there is too little water; other times because there is too much. Nevertheless, we continue our struggles against nature because life goes on. [end recording]
