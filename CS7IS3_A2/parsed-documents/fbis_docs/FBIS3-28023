Regarding this, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement strongly denouncing the brazen-faced betrayal of the United States and declaring our position that in the event the United States overturns the promise made with us, we no longer are bound to the promise made with the United States; that if the United States does not want the DPRK-U.S. talks, neither do we want it; and that if the United States wants to make any other choice, we will also choose the reciprocal countermeasure [sangunghan taeung pangdo]. This is indeed correct. As everyone knows, in the DPRK-U.S. contact held at the end of last year, the two sides agreed that they will hold a third round of talks, that the United States will stop the Team Spirit joint military exercise, and that we will accept a limited inspection [hanjongdoen pomwiui sachal] necessary to ensure the continuity of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] safeguards on our nuclear sites, as a measure for a package solution of the nuclear problem. Accordingly, we have endeavored in all our efforts to do our part. However, the IAEA Secretariat foolishly attempted to realize a full-scope inspection, [chonmyon sachal] which is not even an object of discussion, and the United States is urging us to accept it by setting a time limit with an ultimatum-like attitude that if we do not accept the agency's demand, the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks cannot be held and it cannot but take the road to impose sanctions. What is graver is that by once again bringing up the issue of conducting special inspections of our two military sites, which have nothing to do with our nuclear activity, the United States stands in a position of making international-pressure commotions against us. This is a brazen-faced betrayal and challenge of the party to the dialogue. To proceed with dialogue and resolve the issue, one should faithfully keep the promise in equal position. If any one of the parties breaks faith with the other, putting forward its unreasonable demand [pudanghan yogu] to the other, there can be no dialogue and the problem cannot be solved. The United States is, however, pursuing a dishonest motive by breaking both the promise and faith and insisting on its robbery demands. Isn't this a betrayal of the party to the dialogue and an intolerable crime blocking the road for the peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue? The whole world recognizes that we are not developing nuclear weapons. The nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula is caused by the United States, which drew nuclear weapons in South Korea running counter to our nation's opinion, and the threat is aggravating because the United States has threatened us with nuclear weapons by ceaselessly conducting nuclear war exercises. Therefore, the responsible party for resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is none other than the United States. It is a robbery act as if the burglar is holding the stick with which the United States is creating blockage for the peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue by picking on us about the non-existent nuclear issue, talking about full-scope inspection [chonmyon sachal] and sanctions. Contrary to its repeated promise of not using any armed forces, including nuclear weapons, and of not using them as a means of threat, the United States is trying to crush [apsal] our Republic by committing large-scale nuclear war exercises by all means. This is proven by the facts that U.S. official circles are raving that if the Team Spirit joint military exercise cannot be conducted, then they plan to continue other joint military exercises--in Hawaii if not in South Korea; that the United States is full-fledgedly hurrying to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea; and that an intelligence support team composed of specialists has been deployed to and is now in operation in South Korea. The United States is only talking about the resolution of the nuclear issue through talks but in fact its aggressive strategy toward the DPRK has not changed a bit. All the facts clearly show that the United States has no intention at all to peacefully resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but invariably seeks only its inner intention to crush our Republic through strength. It is a miscalculation if the United States thinks its robbery pressure and military threats can threaten us. We love peace but would never beg for it. As declared in our Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement, if the United States chooses any other way, we will also choose a reciprocal countermeasure. If a catastrophic situation is created on the Korean peninsula, the United States will take all the responsibility for the dear price resulted thereafter. The U.S. hard-line, conservative forces should look straight at our people's unshaken will and act prudently.
