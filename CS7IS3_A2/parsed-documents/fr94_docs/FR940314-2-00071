FR940314-2-00071 FR940314-2-00043 C. Comprehensive Perinatal Care Program and Special Infant Mortality Reduction Initiative Eligible Applicants All CPCP and SIMRI awards are expected to be made as continuation awards to current recipients of CPCP and SIMRI funding which are performing satisfactorily. Review Criteria The review criteria for CPCP continuations, including SIMRI, are: (1) The extent to which the current and proposed basic center operations are sound; (2) the extent to which infants born to the center's perinatal users are at high risk for mortality and/or morbidity; (3) the extent to which the previous CPCP funding has been used to enhance the basic perinatal services of the center, such as by provision of case management (risk assessment, coordination and referral, follow-up and tracking, crisis intervention and documentation), outreach to targeted special populations (e.g., homeless, HIV-infected, substance abusing, teenaged populations), patient education and counseling, and home visiting; (4) the capability of the center to improve perinatal health as demonstrated through various process and outcome measures of progress, such as increased perinatal caseload, increased first trimester enrollment, reduced late or absent entry into care, increased post partum return rate, reduced incidence of low birth weight, and increased newborn visits (an increase in perinatal caseload may also be a process indicator of progress in reaching out to women to get them into care early); (5) the extent to which the plan is reasonable in that it: (a) addresses the specific perinatal care needs of the community, focusing on women and infants at high risk of poor health status; (b) further develops an appropriate system of care which includes collaboration with other resources; (c) contains specific time-framed, measurable objectives, responsive to the CPCP and SIMRI expectations and the clinical measures; and (d) contains an associated budget which is appropriate for the proposal in that it is in accordance with Federal cost principles and corresponds to the proposed activities. Additional review criteria for SIMRI applicants include: (1) For those SIMRI grantees in Healthy Start target areas, the extent and effectiveness of collaborative efforts with the Healthy Start consortium; (2) the extent of collaborative efforts with other Federal, State and local programs to develop integrated systems of perinatal care that address the needs of the community; and (3) the extent to which the grantee's plan and progress demonstrate that SIMRI funds are being used to effectively address gaps in perinatal services throughout the community. Other Award Information All grants to be awarded under this notice are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, as implemented by 45 CFR part 100, which allows States the option of setting up a system for reviewing applications from within their States for assistance under certain Federal programs. The application kits will contain a listing of States which have chosen to set up such a review system and will provide a point of contact in the States for that review. Applicants (other than Federally recognized Indian Tribal governments) should contact their State Single Points of Contact (SPOCs) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. State process recommendations should be submitted to the appropriate Regional Office (see Appendix). The due date for State process recommendations is 60 days after the appropriate application deadline date. The Bureau of Primary Health Care does not guarantee that it will accommodate or explain its response to State process recommendations received after this date. Public Health System Reporting Requirement Section 329 and section 330 programs are subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirement, PHS Circular 92.01. Reporting requirements have been approved by the OMB under control numbers 0937&hyph;0195. Under this requirement, the community-based nongovernmental applicant must prepare and submit a Public Health System Impact Statement (PHSIS). The PHSIS is intended to provide information to State and local health officials to keep them apprised of proposed health services grant applications submitted by community-based nongovernmental organizations within their jurisdictions. Community-based nongovernmental applicants are required to submit the following information to the head of the appropriate State and local health agencies in the area(s) to be impacted no later than the Federal application receipt due date: (1) A copy of the face page of the application (SF 424); and (2) a summary of the project (PHSIS), not to exceed one page, which provides a description of the population to be served, a summary of the services to be provided and a description of the coordination planned with the appropriate State or local health agencies. (In the OMB Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, the Community Health Center program is listed as Number 93.224 and the Migrant Health Center program is listed as Number 93.246.)
