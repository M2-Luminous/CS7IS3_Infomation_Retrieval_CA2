The Russian side took a firm stand refusing to agree to an inventory of the Black Sea Fleet against its state in December 1991, which was insisted on by the Ukrainian delegation led by First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Borys Tarasyuk. The sides failed to reach agreement on the issues discussed. The other issue was an inquiry into the causes of the incident involving the Black Sea Fleet ship Cheleken on the night of 8 April in the Odessa port. A high-ranking official of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense who asked not to be identified said it was very likely that the hydrographic ship Cheleken carried a commercial cargo, which, had it been discovered, could have led to an undesirable argument. According to the same source, Black Sea Fleet ships have recently been performing unsupervised commercial trips to foreign countries in the Black and the Mediterranean seas. After the end of the interstate negotiations, Ambassador-at-Large Yuriy Dubinin, who led the Russian delegation, and Russian Navy Commander Felix Gromov met the president of Ukraine. Asked by UNIAN to comment on the talks and the meeting with Leonid Kravchuk, Yuriy Dubinin said he and the president of Ukraine had agreed not to disclose their content in the media.
