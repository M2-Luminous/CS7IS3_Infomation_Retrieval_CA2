A Uniglory ship made its maiden call at the Buenos Aires port last week, thus opening another ship connection between Taiwan and Argentina. The Taipei-based Chien Hong opened its container service between Taiwan and Argentina through South Africa in 1992. Omar Leirado, spokesman for the Heinlein Maritime Agency, Uniglory's agency in Buenos Aires, said that eight full container ships have been assigned to ply the route between Taiwan and Argentina. "This will initially give us an average frequency of one vessel calling at Buenos Aires every 11 days," he said. Two-way trade between Argentina and Taiwan totaled some US$300 million in 1993.
