"I have spoken with the ambassador (from the United States in our country, James Cheek) and he told me there is not that much hurry on this topic," Menem said. He also highlighted the fact that "the United States understands that the delay in Congress is due to the need to achieve a better law." In remarks to the Buenos Aires radio station La 9.90, the president again denied that the United States was applying pressure to get the pharmaceutical patents law approved.
