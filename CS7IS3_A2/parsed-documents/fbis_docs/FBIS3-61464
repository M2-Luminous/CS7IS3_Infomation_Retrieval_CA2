V. Vinnik, K. D. Glinchuk, V. I. Guroshev, A. V. Prokhorovich] [Abstract]An analysis is performed to determine the reasons which lead to the difference in dose dependencies for the intensities of various luminescence bands in semiconductors. In other words, various luminescence bands have different (heightened or lowered) resistance to radiation exposure. It is shown that this difference might actually be due to more than the radiation stimulated change in the concentration of luminescence centers. Another factor may be the difference in the types of dependencies for the intensity of luminescence bands as a function of the intensity of luminescence excitation. The noted difference in dependencies must be taken into consideration when establishing radiation stimulated changes in the concentration of the luminescence centers from the dose dependencies of the intensity of the luminescence bands. 2 figures and 16 references.
