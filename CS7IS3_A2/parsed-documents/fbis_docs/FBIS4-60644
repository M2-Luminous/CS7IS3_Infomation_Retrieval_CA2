Dr. al-Irayni said that if such thing were to happen, it would return us to the 1960's era and the conflict between the monarchists and republicans. I do not at all imagine that anyone in Saudi Arabia wants the situation to return to the 1960's era. Therefore, I do not expect that Saudi Arabia in particular would recognize this state because they [the Saudis] are totally willing to have good relations with the Yemeni people. Otherwise, we would return to an era which the Saudi officials say repeatedly had been an extraordinary era in the Yemeni-Saudi relations during the conflict between the monarchists and republicans. No one wants a return to this era, and I never expect Saudi Arabia to be one of the countries that recognizes this enclave set up by al-Bid. This is because, as I said, they want to have good relations with Yemen, and because such recognition would return us to an era that we all do not want. Answering a question by the Jordanian press delegation last Sunday on whether al-Bid's state has the pillars of a new state or whether it is stillborn, Dr. al-Iryani said: In fact, two thirds of the land is not under the control of this state. The governorates of Abyan, Lahij, and Shabwah are now under the control of the legitimacy. Certainly, they still control Aden. As for Hadhramaut Governorate, I have no doubt that it will soon be under the unity's control. Distance is the only reason state authority has not so far spread to it. They [southern leaders] have no popular support on the ground. Most of the land and population are under the control of the legitimate state authority. Whoever proclaims a state from nothing will fail. On his expectations of when this current situation in Yemen would be over, Dr. al-Iryani said: In fact, there is a military dimension, and it is difficult to predict the period required by this dimension. However, I believe popular pressure will have a central role now that al-Bid has proclaimed a state. Therefore, I consider the proclamation of the state a step toward ending the situation. This means that this proclamation is an act of suicide that brings the end nearer. Regarding Sanaa's response to al-Bid's possible use of chemical weapons--provided they are available to him--if the legitimate forces entered Aden within the coming days, Dr. al-Iryani said: First of all, the possibility that he has chemical weapons is slight, but let us assume that he uses such weapons, he will then be in his death throes. No one in the world or in Yemen would forgive him for this crime or for using any banned weapon. The proclamation of the state, makes the fall and end of al-Bid more pressing and important. As for cluster bombs, I am sure he does not have any. Asked about President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's remarks on 21 May in which he emphasized development and economic reform in Yemen, and whether that signals a new course, especially after the legitimate troops have control of the entire Yemeni territory, Dr. al-Iryani stressed: Undoubtedly, crushing the rebellion will usher in a new phase in the life of the Yemeni people, consolidating the Yemeni unity and firmly establishing the principle of abidance by the peaceful transfer of power. There will also be a unified central decisionmaking body. Regrettably, our partners from the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] have understood political pluralism as being both plurality of parties and plurality of stands. In other words, they have allowed themselves to be partners and opposionists at the same time. This is a wrong understanding which leads to subversive acts. We have seen economic, political, and social subversion because our partner to the authority is an oppositionist--or rather a subversive--partner. When the opposition is outside the authority, it can only be an opposition. Al-'Attas was the prime minister and an oppositionist at the same time. For example, we agreed with the World Bank on a reform program which was received with broad enthusiasm. Everyone was ready to contribute to the program, particularly Japan, the World Bank, and the United States. A World Bank mission was supposed to arrive in October 1993. Al-'Attas said: Postpone the visit. He did not approve the mission's visit. I personally had to postpone the visit until December or January. World Bank officials said they would come whenever we were ready. This is an example of an oppositionist when he is inside the authority and a decisionmaker. Look how he ruins things. Otherwise, the Yemeni economy would have been on the right course now. This is an unprecedented case. Regarding the Fattah [after 'Abd-al-FATTAH Isma'il, former YSP secretary general who was killed in the June 1986 incidents in Aden] corrective trend and by whom it is led and what their position is, Dr. al-Iryani said: The Fattah trend is a YSP wing, most members of which are from Yafi' and Aden, as well as northern leaders whom we know. They were major loyalists to 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il. This wing still exists inside the YSP. It seems that they have decided to assert themselves as a wing with a certain position. They consider themselves Fattahi's, after 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il. For example, Fadl Muhsin, minister of fish resources, considers himself a Fattahi, because his relationship with 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il was very strong. He always speaks of 'Abd-al-Fattah with respect. In addition, his wife is 'Abd-al-Fattah Isma'il's sister. On Aden radio's vituperations against him, Dr. al-Iryani said: This is not the first time. They issued a statement before the war which was broadcast over Aden radio and television after the failure of the Salalah [in Oman] meeting. They described me as a warmongering general. Al-Bid personally slandered me and the brother president. This is a sign of bankruptcy. God knows, it never occurred to me that we would reach the point of war, but there was no other choice. They led us to war. Two weeks before the war, I had the honor to pound the table during a cabinet meeting while they were all present and to tell them that the absence of the defense minister from that session was a war decision. I said this with a loud voice. Some of them like Jarallah 'Umar [minister of Culture and Tourism], al-Salami [minister of Electricity and Water Resources], and Fadl Muhsin [minister of Fish Resources] remind me of this incident now. They neither denied nor objected to my saying that the absence of the defense minister from the session was a war decision and that he did not come because he did not want to implement the fourth provision of the Pledge and Accord Document on withdrawing the forces from the border areas, and that these forces are the fangs the secessionists will use if war erupts. I am not a war strategist. But I exposed them by saying they were preparing for war. That's why they are angry with me. They keep accusing me so that one day I will not say that I had announced at a cabinet session that the YSP had decided to go to war by not sending the defense minister to attend the cabinet session. I am proud that I was the one to warn against war, and not one of them replied. I told Fadl Muhsin: Brother Fadl, it is a pity if we hand things over to the military, so set your conditions. Another minister, the minister of electricity, replied that there are civilians who are more military-minded than the military themselves, and that this is our problem. I told him: Why hide things? I know you are speaking about me, because you discussed this at a YSP Political Bureau meeting and you decided to accuse me. He did not reply. Regarding rumors that the YSP ministers are under arrest in Aden, he said: This is not true. They are there and carrying out their duties. But are they doing so voluntarily or under pressure? This can be verified later but not now. I do not rule out the possibility that many of the ministers who are Political Bureau members are under pressure and are being threatened to have them go along with things. I know they do not support the proclamation of a state as this will mean their end. Regarding rumors that he lives a luxurious life, although I saw him having only yogurt and juice for breakfast, Dr. al-Iryani said: This is what I have been having for the past four years. I do not pay any attention to such matters. The truth is that the YSP started the war because they expected that fighting would take place on the previous borders for a few days or weeks, after which there would be pressure to halt the fighting and negotiations would ensue while the forces would remain on the borders between the two parts of Yemen. However, al-Bid was surprised to see that the front has collapsed and that fighting took place only 21 km from Aden, not to mention that the fighting also moved to the Shabwah front, which completely collapsed, as well as that of al-'Anad and its being captured by the forces of legitimacy. They counted on the fact that peace-keeping forces would come to disengage the combatants. However, the tribes tricked him, particularly in Bakil. The military were deceived. I view this as the biggest political trickery ever practiced by politicians against the military. This is because no military man has ever been tricked as those who were linked to al-Bid. Not a single bullet was fired in Sanaa. They told the military that Harf Sufyan, 'Imran, Arhab, and Naham would be set ablaze and that the Sanaa regime would be busy extinguishing the fires in its own house. They told them: We will entrench the partition plan, and you will once again become a state. Asked why all battles have started on a Wednesday, beginning with 'Imran, Dhamar, and al-'Anad, Dr. al-Iryani said: Wednedsay in the eastern and southern regions in Yemen is an ill-omened day and not one that heralds optimism.
