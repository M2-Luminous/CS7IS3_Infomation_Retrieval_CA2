Upon completion of the project, the channel may allow the passage of 100,000-ton common vessels in high tide and of 50,000-ton container ships day and night, said Yan Kai and Dou Guoren, academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Currently, it allows the passage of only 10-ton vessels in high tide. The proposed project is believed to be significant toward making the Shanghai harbor a rising new hub of international transportation on the western shore of the Pacific Ocean, and it will greatly enhance the economic development of the Chang Jiang river delta and the whole of the Chang Jiang river valley. The State Planning Commission has approved the plan, saying it is "technically feasible and economically profitable." The "river mouth," from Nanjing to Shanghai, is a cross-point of China's coastal areas with the vast Chang Jiang river valley areas. It is the shipping route for 200 million tons of goods a year. There are more than 100 over-10,000-ton ports along the edges of the mouth, including Shanghai harbor, one of the world's ten 100- million-ton harbors. The current difficulty in the Chang Jiang river mouth costs several hundred million yuan each year, since ships have to unload part of the goods or wait for high tides in order to sail into or to enter harbors. The two academicians said that the project will bring 4.05 billion yuan in profits to the transporters, harbors and manufacturers in the first five years of construction; later, it will save them an additional 7.36 billion yuan. Ten years after the project is completed, 28.8 billion yuan will be saved. The proposal was based on a key national research project on the Chang Jiang waterway, the results of which have been approved by the State Planning Commission. The research was conducted by nearly 100 scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Shanghai Waterways Bureau and the Nanjing Water Control Institute. Studies on the evolution of the Chang Jiang river bed and physical and mathematical model verification measures were used to produce the proposal. Experiments show that the project will neither affect the river's ability to drain floods, nor affect the water supply to cities along the river, despite an increase in the inflow of sea water. Experts believe the project will be conducive to the comprehensive management of the Chang Jiang river mouth and urged that it be put into action soon.
