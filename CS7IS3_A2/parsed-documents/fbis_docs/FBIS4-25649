"There is a dispute on the understanding of the overall performance of state-run enterprises," said a State Commission for Restructuring Economic Systems official. A consensus on the question was important because it would help determine the urgency with which the government proceeded with trying to overhaul the most lethargic economic sector. The official said that by some measures, the situation looked grim. Under new accounting procedures nearly half the state-owned sector was in the red. Yet, by other statistics, state-run enterprises were not doing all that badly. In the first quarter of this year, profits and taxes handed over by the state-run sector to the government increased by 22 per cent, despite a drop in the tax rate. Government revenue In the first four months of this year increased by 250 million yuan (HK$223 million) to reach 8.4 billion yuan. State-run enterprises accounted for 70 per cent of that revenue. The official said a central government pilot project to incorporate 100 state-run companies this year was on target. He admitted, however, that the companies were not yet selected but preparatory work had been completed and a decision should be made in July or August. In addition, provinces would be allowed to undertake their own experiments to incorporate state-owned industry. Sichuan, for one, wanted to value the assets of three dozen state-run enterprises and then sell them off. However, one central Government concern was that the best enterprises were floating shares on stock markets in China and abroad, thus shedding some of their traditional responsibilities for workers' welfare expenses. In contrast, the enterprises in the worst financial shape had to continue to shoulder the heavy burdens of worker welfare. The official said the government was confident it could bring inflation down from just over 20 per cent at the beginning of the year to under 13 per cent for the whole of 1994. For this to happen, inflation would have to drop to about seven or eight per cent in the second half of the year. Because of the high rate of inflation, price reforms originally slated for this year have been put off until 1995. The precise pace at which price reforms would proceed depended on inflation in the second half of this year, the official said. Meanwhile, state-run shops in Beijing yesterday increased prices for some grains by as much as nearly 30 per cent. Top-quality flour rose from 1.56 yuan per kilo to 2.14 yuan and top-quality rice rose to 1.92 yuan a kilo from 1.60 yuan. Edible oil prices would also rise soon, shopkeepers said.
