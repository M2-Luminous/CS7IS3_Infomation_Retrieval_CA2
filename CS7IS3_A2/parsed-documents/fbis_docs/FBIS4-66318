The nation's first domestically made laser rapid prototyping machine--developed, designed and made by Beijing Longyuan [7127 3293] Enterprises Ltd.--was unveiled the other day in Beijing, and has been put into formal operation. This new unit, model STILY-I, employs the [stereolithography (SLA)] additive technique in which various layers of material are selectively built up into the solid prototype by a laser whose scan sequences are controlled by CAD/CAM databases. The total process includes laser-heated powder sintering [i.e. selective laser sintering (SLS)], induced liquid photopolymer material [cut-out], and induced vapor-phase deposition for gradually building up [and curing] the final solid plastic, ceramic or wax model. [The wax models are then used to create ceramic molds for fabricating final prototype products--FBIS].
