Kostin, chairman of the PRP NVAER Trade Union Committee: "If No Money Is Paid For Work, Then For Whom Are These Reforms Intended?"] [Text] Dear Editorial Board of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA! Our appeal addressed to the president and government of the Russian Federation and the response thereto were published in your newspaper on 22 February and 22 March 1994. The course of events forces us to once again speak out in this newspaper and quite possibly not for the last time. Only the president of the "Rosenergoatom" Concern commented upon our appeal in the newspaper. The remaining elements remained silent. Truly, we were provided with "systematic assistance" in the form of a one-time credit in the amount of 30 million rubles, an amount which constituted one fifth of the monthly wage fund. This assistance was to be returned within a period of three months. Thus, there have been no changes for the better since the appeal was published on 22 February 1994. To the contrary, the situation has deteriorated and social tension has increased -- indeed, the last salary received by the collective was for November 1993. At the same time, lacking the funds for paying wages and thus not issuing them, the enterprise is obligated to transfer income tax (from wages not received) and to make assignments to the pension and other funds, with extra charges for late payments. Are we really speaking in a language not understood by the officials? We are not asking for nitpicking interference or for charity and we are not praying to the Almighty. No, we are asking the chief debtor, namely the state, to ensure reimbursement for the obligation in the form of dearly earned money. As a mark of protest against that which took place illegally, we participated in sanctioned picketing of the White House. There has been no response to our appeal and workers attached to the "Novovoronezhatomenergoremont" Production Repair Enterprise, for the fifth month now, since December 1993, have not received their wages and have been subsisting on bread and potatoes. Gentlemen, rulers! Your discussions regarding improvements in the people's standard of living and lowering inflation (inflation has declined, since half of Russia is not receiving wages) -- are nothing more than fantasies being substituted for reality. Thanks to your "talented" leadership, the approved program for the market is failing before our very eyes. The destruction of atomic power engineering, now in progress, is tantamount to the destruction of Russia. Gentlemen! Devote more thought to this matter.
