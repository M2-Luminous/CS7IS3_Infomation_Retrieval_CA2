The diplomat explained the need for the news conference by a desire to clarify the main points of a Russian draft plan for settling the armed conflict in order to dispel conjectures surrounding it. In connection with this, Kazimirov stressed with regret that some commentators on the draft had been trying to accuse Russia of "a striving to implement its imperial ambitions" and "an obvious preference for a particular side." According to him, this is being done in order to discredit Russian policy in the region. On the other hand, he noted, certain forces understand that if the conflict is settled with Russia's active involvement, this will strengthen Russia's influence in the Transcaucasus, something they obviously dislike. According to the diplomat, his country is pursuing the only goal of establishing good and efficient relations with Azerbaijan and Armenia. He specifically stressed that "a bias toward either side would be Russia's historical miscalculation, something it cannot afford." Touching upon the much talked about issue of Russia's striving to station its troops in Azerbaijan under the guise of peacekeeping forces, the special envoy noted that "even earlier his country offered to bring disengagement forces into the region, believing this form to be the most efficient one for resolving the conflict." However, Kazimirov said, the institution of international observers cannot be efficient in this case, in the absence of a stable cease-fire and an end of hostilities. According to the Russian ambassador, consensus between the sides has been attained to date, perhaps in the view that the conflict cannot be settled in one step and should be resolved stage-by-stage. The Russian draft plan, which consists of three principal stages, Kazimirov said, is based on precisely this premise. The first stage includes a reliably secured cease-fire and an end to hostilities and should take six days to achieve, including the disengagement of forces. The second stage envisages withdrawal from all the occupied territories (except Shusha and Lachin), a quick exchange of prisoners and hostages, the restoration of communications, and the return of refugees to their native land. The draft assigns 34 days to complete all this. The issue of freeing Shusha and Lachin will be examined separately two weeks after cease-fire is established. The third stage is for negotiations to study the issue of Nagornyy Karabakh's [Nagorno-Karabakh's] status. At the same time, Kazimirov did not rule out a possibility of the second and third stages taking considerably more time than envisaged, for "this is a very complicated process."
