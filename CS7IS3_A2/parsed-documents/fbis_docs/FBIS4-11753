FBIS4-11753 "drnes063yy_94005" FBIS-NES-94-063 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks Sha'th on Security Agreement, Police Deployment Sha'th on Security Agreement, Police Deployment JN0104121194 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 1050 GMT 1 Apr 94 JN0104121194 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Telephone interview with chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'th, in Cairo, by Sa'id Mu'addi, in the studio, on 1 April; from the "With The Midday Events" program -- recorded] [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Now that the agreement on the security arrangements in Hebron has been signed in Cairo, when will this agreement be implemented? [Sha'th] As soon as possible. Fifteen minutes after the signing I was at the Norwegian Embassy [in Cairo] with the official request signed by us and the Israeli Government. I submitted the request to Mr. Larsen, adviser to the Norwegian foreign minister and head of the coordination office of the donating states, to prepare for the arrival of 160 observers from Norway, Denmark, and Italy as soon as possible. I believe Mr. Larsen will go to Hebron in the next few days. Also, the chief of the Norwegian international observers will arrive in Cairo on Sunday [3 April]. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Does this agreement mirror the provisions of Security Council Resolution 904? [Sha'th] At least one of the two major paragraphs of the resolution is on international protection and the temporary international presence in Hebron. We reached this in accordance with Resolution 904. Very soon, 160 observers will be in Hebron to give its people a feeling of security. They will be present everywhere. They will have an open-door headquarters for the citizens of Hebron. I believe this will create a feeling of security. Israel took some measures and will take other measures to provide security and protection and to prevent settlers' violence in the city of Hebron. I believe we are seeking the implementation of the Security Council resolution, knowing that this resolution [as heard] was based on Security Council Resolution 904. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, the Palestinian side conceded its initial demand to send Palestinian police to Hebron. Why? [Sha'th] The Security Council resolution, in fact, does not call for dispatching Palestinian police to Hebron. There was an idea to send Palestinian police to Hebron, and Israel agreed to this idea. However, we could not reach an agreement on the number, arms, and conditions, in accordance with which the entry of this Palestinian police force woyld help achieve the security of the Palestinians in Hebron. If we cannot achieve this, their presence will add nothing to this protection, but could create problems, particularly in the absence of a real participation in the political authority that will supervise the security power. Therefore, following lengthy discussion and despite Israel's agreement to 130 Palestinian police, we decided to double the international observers in this stage and to postpone the entry of Palestinian police until after [the implementation] of the Gaza-Jericho accord when the Palestinian police are deployed throughout all West Bank cities and when the Israeli forces are redeployed outside the Palestinians cities, villages, and camps in the West Bank. [Mu'addi] Has an agreement been reached in Cairo on the return of longtime deportees? [Sha'th] Yes. A group of deportees will return very soon. And the Palestinian police will enter Gaza and Jericho very soon. I believe that this police will begin to enter during the next week to receive military headquarters and garrisons and to take over police stations in Khan Yunus, Gaza, and Jericho... [Mu'addi, interrupting] When will economic talks be resumed and what are the next steps in the coming week? [Sha'th] I believe the talks will take place next week, together with the return of the Gaza-Jericho talks in all their security and civilian committees. This is in addition to the release of prisoners. Furthermore, the legal committee and the standing drafting committee will be formed. All these committees will work intensively during the coming two weeks in an attempt to reach a comprehensive agreement on issues related to Gaza-Jericho as soon as possible. This is what we did during the past two weeks, particularly during the past three weeks as we worked from 9 o'clock until 2 or 3 after midnight. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much. [Sha'th] Thank you, brother.
