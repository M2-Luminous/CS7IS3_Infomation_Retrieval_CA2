For the first time since the ancient time of the Croatian kingdom, we have created a free, independent, and sovereign state, which already has allies in the world. These were the words Croatian President Franjo Tudjman spoke in reply to a warm welcome and applause at the beginning of his address to several thousand people outside a hotel in Citluk. By creating a federation of Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we have managed to enable Bosnia-Herzegovina to team up--or we could even say unite--with Croatia through a confederation, President Tudjman said. He added: [Begin recording] Mostar will be a mixed canton, as they say. In Croatian, we will call it a grand county [velezupa]. Still, this is precisely because of you, who are the guarantee for the Croatian state as a whole that this federation must be a new state in which the Croat people will be a sovereign people, in which it will secure not only all its civil and national rights, but also will ensure its full unity with the parent state of Croatia. This is why you can trust the Croatian state leadership who paved the way to a sovereign and independent Croatia. Trust yourselves. Create the kind of authorities here that will be in the interest of Citluk, in the interest of every Croat place, in the interest of Herzegovina--that Herzegovina which was and remains together with other Croatian regions on the front line of the struggle for Croatia's freedom, independence, and sovereignty. Your contribution to the establishment of Croatian freedom and democracy is a large one. The Croatian people as a whole will never forget this. You will always find jobs in Croatia. You must create conditions so that people will no longer emigrate from this beautiful part of Croatian soil to distant countries--to Canada or Australia, America or South America. [words indistinct] are already returning. Particularly here, in the Croat-Muslim federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we need every Croat man. We need Croat returnees from abroad so that we can consolidate, over a long period of time, what we have secured. Dear friends, some people from your area have asked me: Why do we have to be in this or that canton, as they are called? I reply: We are going to call them by their Croatian names, grand counties. Precisely because of your presence, all of these cantons--this entire federation--will have Croatian characteristics. We can demonstrate something that the world is also demanding of us. This democratic Western world--without which we cannot make do--is demanding that we create here a democratic society, that we make sure that this place is part of western civilization. If we have curbed Serbian terrorism and [word indistinct] aggression, it means that our present alliance with the Muslims under the Washington agreement must be a guarantee that there will be no fundamentalism, since Bosnia-Herzegovina as a federation and in a confederation with Croatia will develop as a western democratic country. This is why you here are--and you must be--a lasting guarantee of this. Long live Herzegovina. Long live our only and eternal Croatia. Thank you. [end recording] Following his visit to Citluk, President Tudjman and his aides have left for Capljina, where he will also address the people of this town on the Neretva and a large number of Croat refugees living in Capljina and its neighborhood.
