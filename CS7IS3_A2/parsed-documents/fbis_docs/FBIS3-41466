This is world practice and nobody, but Japan, makes so much ado about it,'' Valeriy Danilyan, head of the chemical service of the Pacific Fleet, told TASS on Friday. This ``ado'' forced a tanker from the Pacific Fleet with nuclear waste on board to dock in the Bolshoy Kamen Bay where it will have to stay until spring. In order to help the Pacific Fleet to cope with the situation, Japan offered its own tanker to be used for storing radioactive waste. It is hard to say whether this was just a hasty decision or an underestimation of the experience of Russian navymen, according to Danilyan. The Japanese tanker was worn out by 30 percent, it had no necessary double coating and no pumping system to load and unload the waste, he explained. Besides, it could not solidify liquid waste and the Pacific Fleet had to turn down the Japanese offer. Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Feliks Gromov told reporters during a recent visit to Vladivostok that 20 hours after dumping the level of radioactivity does not exceed the natural background in the Sea of Japan. He added that Russia is now designing an ecologically-safe technology to utilise radioactive waste.
