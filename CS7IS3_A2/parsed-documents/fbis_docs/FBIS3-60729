(The delegation was headed by Defense Commission President Boyon and included Daniel Colin, Dominique Dupilet, Pierre Favre, Rene Galy-Dejean, and Patrice Martin-Lalande.) They discussed the outlook for the American arms industry with the new Administration, industry, members of Congress, top Pentagon officials, and consultants. [passage omitted summarizing U.S. defense policy] All of these new orientations are clearly and precisely set out in a document entitled ``Bottom Up Review,'' which should be taken into consideration by those responsible in France. What conclusions can be drawn for our own industrial policies? Research and Development Research and development must be given solid support to maintain our skills base and know-how both at the level of researchers and production teams. There has been a tendency over the past few years to ask manufacturers to finance an increasing part of research themselves to alleviate government costs. If our main competitor is financing research from the taxpayers' money, France should do the same. Failing this, i.e., if our export products also have to integrate research costs, they will no longer be competitive and our overall research effort will become increasingly insufficient. However, the government must draw up a program and industry must reduce the size and number of its research centers. There are certainly too many of them and they lack coherence in their activities. Subcontracting Subcontracting must be given stronger support. The quality of our arms industry is based not only on the excellence of its major armaments, systems, and equipment manufacturers, but also on the existence of a dense fabric of small- and even medium-sized companies which have a proven capacity for innovative products, materials, and techniques. A drive has been launched to remove the reluctance of large companies to farm out research, but this drive need be reinforced. Exports The government should give priority to exportable arms and equipment in its programming. Programs which are technologically or industrially advanced in relation to their competitors should not be staggered. We know that France only exports arms used by its own forces and tested under real conditions. We should avoid delays in transferring weapons systems to units when they are expected to make a rapid breakthrough on foreign markets. Here again, we have to resist the temptation to delay such programs because of their potential to put us ahead of competitors. On the contrary, this potential should be strengthened. The Rafale fighter aircraft is a good example of this, but there are others. Cooperation Finally and above all, our objectives in terms of cooperation should be redefined. This was the focus of all our talks, and our American counterparts were no exception. Everyone is, in theory, favorable to this cooperation. However, as soon as we tried to go deeper in our talks, we were cut short by our counterparts. However, the idea of French-American or Euro-American cooperation was is being considered by the Pentagon, which, more than ever, is aware of budgetary constraints and realizes that cooperation would reduce cost prices and enable armies to buy more for less. In Congress, however, despite the good intentions of Senator Nunn, president of the Senate's Armed Forces Commission, or in the Administration, the idea of cooperation still remains somewhat abstract. Nearly all cooperation projects between France and the United States, and there were many of them at the beginning, never got beyond the phase of exchanging expertise and information. In the initial stages of research and development, they rarely got beyond the ``R'' stage and turned turtle on the ``D.'' The RITA [Integrated Automatic Transmission Network] case is the only exception. However, we must continue to believe in it, but we may not put all our eggs in one basket, because France can try to cooperate directly with the United States, but also with Europe. Direct cooperation with the United States is desirable in cases where Americans themselves say they are open to it and where Europeans seem unmotivated, unskilled, or where it is too small in scale compared to the United States. This is the case in the area of antimissile systems, which was the only area for which the various people we met made cooperation proposals. France will undoubtedly need to brace itself for this cooperation with the United States, and it should do so vigorously both at the industrial and political levels because there will be strong misgivings on the other side of the Atlantic. European Strategy In other fields, European cooperation should be relaunched while there is still time. We have a maximum of two to three years ahead of us to succeed because, after this period, there will only be one or two U.S. suppliers left to contend with and, considering the respective sizes of the American and European markets, Europe will only survive competition if it has a single supplier for each major category of material and equipment. There is an urgent need to emerge from this period of hesitation currently marking Europe. Our country has without a doubt a specific responsibility to raise the awareness of the highest European political authorities of this need and urgency. Conclusion Finally, the American Administration's determination, which is stronger than ever, to support the defense industry on export markets must also be taken into account. We have seen that a simple personal telephone call from the President to a head of state can carry considerable weight and provide effective assistance in penetrating markets. Even if this is not part of the French Government's tradition, it should face facts and learn to use this strategy surreptitiously. The exchanges of view the National Assembly's Defense Commission managed to have with different American officials lead to the conclusion that more than ever, France's defense industry must not be considered as a mere supplier for its own army. It holds and must continue to hold an important position both in France's economic and international strategy.
