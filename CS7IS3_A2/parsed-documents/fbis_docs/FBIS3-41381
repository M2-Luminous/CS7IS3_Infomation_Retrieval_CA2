According to department head Vladimir Stoykov, drug traffickers and pushers can hardly be convicted because under the operating law the harm inflicted on society is measured by the cost of the narcotics sold or seized. In comparison to those prevailing in Western countries, the price of narcotic substances in Bulgaria is low. A kilogramme of crack sells at 260,000 leva (about U.S.$7,000), while the pure narcotic cost twice as much. A shot of 0.25g is sold for 450-500 leva in the Bulgarian black market, Mr. Stoykov said. Given those cheap prices, in terms of value the damages caused by drug trafficking and pushing fall under the title of petty offences, and as offenders are usually careful to keep under the limits set by the law, it is impossible to impose harder punishment on them, he went on to say. Mr. Stoychev pointed out that traffickers smuggling 30-40 kg of heroin had received four or five years in prison. Stressing that courts often release arrested traffickers on bail, Mr. Stoykov said that the National Investigative Service had no information about the number of convicted offenders. A great number of drug pushers are amateurs who cannot assess the purity of the narcotic overdosing it sometimes. Hence the danger of a lethal outcome drug abusers are exposed to, overdosing caused the death of seven drug addicts in Sofia last year, Mr. Stoychev said. Drug abuse became a serious problem in Bulgaria two or three years ago. Though the drug traffic from Asia to Western Europe passed through Bulgaria, the cases of pushing narcotics were few until then. Over the last few years drug pushing in this country has been on the rise. The number of drug addicts on record has gone up from about 3,000-4,000 to more than 20,000, as recent statistics show. Some 25 percent of pupils in Sofia have tried or are taking drugs now, Minister of the Interior Viktor Mikhaylov told the National Assembly some time ago. Starting with glue-sniffing, 13-year-old children then take to heroin, Col. Slava Koeva, chief inspector at the Criminal Police of the Sofia Directorate of the Interior, told headmasters of Sofia schools yesterday. In her opinion, homeless and stray children are most susceptible to drug abuse. According to a survey conducted by the Institute of Criminology and Criminal Law with the Interior Ministry, 21.2 percent of juvenile delinquents are substance abusers and 16.5 percent are drug addicts, Col. Koeva said.
