Sergio Caramagna, head CIAV-OAS official in charge of delivering the 3-80 Northern Front's counterproposal, which primarily consists of demands for the rearmed group's security and the withdrawal of EPS forces in the conflict areas as conditions for holding another meeting with the government authorities. A few days ago the government ordered the EPS to halt operations -- a cease-fire -- as a sign of political willingness to initiate talks with the 3-80 Northern Front. In addition, the government's peace proposal explicitly stated that a political negotiation with the rearmed group is unacceptable. Despite the presence of EPS special troops in the Quebrada Negra and El Mapa areas, 10 km northeast of El Rosario, Commander Esteban, [Salvador Talavera Alaniz] second in command of the 3-80 Northern Front, deemed "very positive" this first encounter at the health center. Nevertheless, "the EPS is setting up a military cordon that endangers future talks," Esteban noted after reporting that this is why Commander El Chacal [Jose Angel Talavera], the 3-80 Northern Front's main leader, was not present at the meeting, which was attended by Commanders Piloto, Chele Gringo, and Musun. Caramanga delivered to Esteban a letter from General Humberto Ortega addressed to El Chacal. The letter proposed to the 3-80 Northern Front an "earnest meeting" between this rebel group and a broad sector of the government. EPS delegates also participated in the meeting, sitting down to talk to an armed group for the first time since the demobilization of the Nicaraguan Resistance. Esteban told LA PRENSA that Gen. Ortega's letter "was looked upon favorably," and that El Chacal will respond with a personal message in a few days. Caramanga today will attempt to set up a new meeting with the 3-80 Northern Front. Yesterday at El Rosario he said that the CIAV-OAS had fulfilled its objective by delivering Gen. Ortega's to the 3-80 Northern Front. On the presence of EPS special troops, Caramagna said that the CIAV-OAS was investigating to verify the activity of those troops. Caramagna did not want to go into detail about the demands contained in the rebels' counterproposal.
