Indo-Russian Contracts To Total $100 Million"] [Text] Delhi -- The shortfall in deliveries of spares from Russia for weapons which India bought from the former Soviet Union has become the talk of the country. This issue has been raised literally at every level up to and including the Russo-Indian summit. Our former government found itself strangely unable to resolve an issue that was not so difficult. But things have now gotten moving -- a package of long-awaited contracts on shipments of spares has been signed in Delhi. It is mainly a question of meeting the needs of the Indian Air Force, not least its naval aviation. "Yet another package of similar contracts will soon be signed," Stanislav Filin, deputy general director of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, who headed the Russian delegation at the first round of the Delhi talks, said. "These will stipulate shipments of spares for the ground forces. The total value of the contracts will be approximately $100 million. The spares issue will thereby mainly be removed from the agenda...." But the main result of the Delhi talks, in S. Filin's opinion, is that Russia and India have agreed on a program for further cooperation in the military sphere that takes account of the sides' long-term interests. There has been a great deal of speculation in India about the modernization of our MiG-21 fighters. There are several hundred of these aircraft in service with the Indian Air Force. Indian pilots rate their performance highly. But over the past few years the MiG-21 has become obsolete. Russia has stopped producing them. Hence the problem with spares shipments. India came up with the idea of not writing off these aircraft but modernizing them. A few years ago the Indians appealed to us to draw up a modernization program. The Mikoyan design bureau carried out the order. Corresponding proposals were put to India. But Delhi's reply was delayed. Exploiting this uncertainty, some former Warsaw Pact states put their own proposals to India for the modernization of the Russian fighters. Recently Israel has been particularly importunate in offering its services. Israeli delegations have descended on Delhi one after another. Their arguments have boiled down to saying that many former Soviet aircraft engineers have now emigrated to Israel to work, and they will have no difficulty in modernizing the MiG-21. But ultimately India preferred its traditional partner -- Russia. Any other decision would have looked strange: It was Russia that gave birth to the large MiG family, and even the collapse of the Soviet Union has not adversely affected their production -- after all, the leading enterprises producing the MiG's and components for them are located within the Russian Federation. The modernization of the MiG-21 will be substantially advantageous for India -- its combat might will be increased at least 2.5 times for a relatively small outlay. Winning this major order will also be a "shot in the arm" for our aircraft plants, which are going through hard times. Accord was also reached at the Delhi talks on the acquisition by India of a new batch of modern MiG-29's. A figure of 30 aircraft is being mentioned. Justifying their purchase, the Indian side is drawing attention to the increased combat might of the Pakistani Air Force. India is particularly concerned about the possibility of several dozen U.S. F-16 aircraft being supplied to Pakistan, with which it has a strained relationship. But not all of the package of proposals which the Russian delegation brought to the Indian capital was agreed. India's acquisition of certain types of Russian military hardware was postponed. These include the unique "Tunguska" air defense system. On the other hand, another avenue in Russo-Indian cooperation is opening up -- the leasing of our weapons systems to the Indian Army. We agreed that the Indian side could try our weapons in its country before making its final choice. Admittedly, India will have to pay for the pleasure of seeing our latest weapons in action. Military specialists are particularly interested in large-caliber Russian guns. The Indian Army would like to take a three- to five-year lease on some 152-mm self-propelled howitzers. They plan to use them as the basis for manufacturing their own 155-mm artillery pieces under Russian license in line with the standard used in the Indian Army. The gun could be given a "self-propelled" capacity by a mount developed on the basis of the T-72 M1 tank. Our new helicopters will substantially strengthen India's defense potential. They are designed for antitank warfare. We will also be supplying air-defense systems to the Indian Navy. It seems as though the hiatus in Russo-Indian military cooperation has been overcome. But it should be remembered that a fierce competitive battle is under way for the large Indian arms market -- the Indian Army is the fourth largest in the world. Britain is persistently offering India its military helicopters. The British premier is acting as "fixer." France, which has already supplied Mirages, is after more aircraft orders. Italy and the United States have not lost hope of selling their military aircraft equipment to India. Western arms suppliers are offering the Indian Army tanks, artillery systems, and other weapons, while offering the Navy their old ships as well as new vessels. A winding-down of Russian military shipments to India -- something which had begun to occur -- would merely have played into our competitors' hands. Issues like this are not resolved unilaterally. Russia cannot afford to suffer economic, moral, and political damage for the sake of abstract principles.
