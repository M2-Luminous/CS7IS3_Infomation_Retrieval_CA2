There are reports that the AFL has started the process, but there has been immense distrust between NPFL leader Charles Taylor and ULIMO chairman Alhaji Koromah. In Monrovia, Ofeibea Quist-Arcton asked Alhaji Koromah if he had begun disarming his men. [Begin recording] [Koromah] I will give my commander the order as of today so that the arms can be given in. Already, I have given orders that the arms in Kakata and Bong Mine should be given in. [Quist-Arcton] Charles Taylor seems to be very worried, not disarming, until he sees evidence that ULIMO is disarming. Clearly there is lingering mistrust between the two groups. [Koromah] Whatever that may be, we are going by the schedule. We are going by stages as agreed to by the joint peace disarmament committee, as agreed to by the implementation committee of ECOMOG and when we agree to a schedule, ULIMO will go by that. We don't necessarily trust Taylor. We know his background; we know his record. [Quist-Arcton] You are just saying that you don't trust Taylor? [Koromah] Of course not. Why should I trust him? Is that surprising to you? [end recording] So, ULIMO is beginning to disarm, but what about the NPFL? A wild card there is the Liberian Peace Council [LPC] which has been fighting Charles Taylor's forces in the Rivercess Region, south of Buchanan and which is not a signatory of the Cotonou Peace Accord and it seems that Charles Taylor is in some difficulties. On the line Robin White asked him if had issued an order to his troops to disarm. [Taylor] Well, we are trying to still find out what is going on here. As you know, the Council of State was sworn in and the government is still not seated because the cabinet ministers have still not assumed their offices. Our people informed me this morning that they have been prevented from entering ministries and agencies of government and so, we are not sure if the government is fully seated. We are trying to see how these things play in before we get into actual business. [White] So you haven't actually ordered your men to hand in their arms yet? [Taylor] We have not given any such order. We are waiting still for the government to take a seat. My ministers are at risk. Right now in Monrovia, they have been stopped from entering the building. You know, even in Britain, John Major does not have a government unless he has ministers, is this not correct? [White] Some people might say that you are stalling, Mr. Taylor. [Taylor] We are not stalling. The ECOMOG people are in the camp. You know, we are under attack right now. We are fighting the LPC. In fact, the expanded ECOMOG that should be moving into parts of Buchanan and the southeastern region have not entered because of the heavy fighting. So, you know, it is like a guy shooting at you and you are having a gun on one side and the bullet on another side. So, all of these things are going to come into shape. I do not think that there is any major disruption and, I mean, these things take a little bit of time. [White] You said there is fighting going on with the Liberian Peace Council in the Buchanan area. How extensive is that fighting? [Taylor] Very extensive. It is into and out of Buchanan, into Rivercess and parts of Sinoe. There is very serious fighting going on. No expanded ECOMOG has been able enter that zone yet. There is very heavy fighting. And if you were to call Monrovia, the Ugandans will tell you that they have not been able to help them because bullets are flying and bombs are going and there is heavy fighting there. So, that is the problem on that side. On this other side, we are prepared to begin disarmament. We are waiting for word from Monrovia because our ministers have not taken seat, but we can still be going forward because I think we have made a giant step forward and we do not want to reverse the progress.
