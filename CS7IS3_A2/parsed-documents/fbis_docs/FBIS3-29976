The United States has made a strategic conclusion [chollyakchogin mamurirul chikko] by deciding to overlook the past, whether or not North Korea currently possesses nuclear weapons, and not to allow its additional production of nuclear weapons from now on. At the same time, it decided to deploy Patriot missiles to the U.S. forces stationed in the ROK. This seems to be the first-step countermeasure mapped out by Washington with no other particular idea. I do not know whether the ROK's invariable principle on and concrete countermeasures to the North Korean nuclear game are what have already been tuned by the ROK and the United States, but I know from reports that Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu has successfully persuaded Washington to attempt a peaceful approach to the issue. North Korea, however, is a group that believes in a logic based on strength, and it only forces its negotiation partner not supported by strength to make endless concessions. We know this well through experience. I am concerned about our easy-going attitude just like adjusting our neckties without recognizing that our trouser legs are getting wet in the rain dropping from the "imitation nuclear umbrella [yusa haek usan]" carried by North Korea as we are accustomed to the comfort of the protection under the large U.S. nuclear umbrella. Regarding our government's position, Minister Han Sung-chu said in New York: "Our government does not care even if North Korea possesses nuclear weapons now. The nuclear weapons it possesses can be abolished [pyegi] or dismantled [haeche], like those of South Africa. Our government's negotiations with North Korea are not aimed at inquiring into the past, but will focus on North Korea's future intent." If North Korea had already been acquitted for its possession of nuclear weapons only by going in and out of the NPT over the issue regarding the method of inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], without mentioning whether it possesses nuclear weapons or not, it would be needless to even predict if it is possible to abolish or dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons in the future. Minister Han's remarks that our government does not care about the past seem to be an iteration of the U.S. policy, not our government's own idea or countermeasure. The U.S. countermeasure is considered a strategic arrangement linked to its far-reaching scheme to pave the way for the 21st century, foreseeing the future of Northeast Asia. The United States never wants its influence upon the Korean peninsula, including North Korea, to be weakened, nor will it allow China, Russia, or Japan to hold sway over Northeast Asia. I think we need to seriously study [koryo] if it is the best strategy in the reality we face now to accept and follow this countermeasure based on the U.S. strategy. Although it seems that the United States has put forward such countermeasures against North Korea on the assumption that either special inspection or simultaneous inspection of the North and South would not be easily carried out, it is possible for us -- who are the party concerned to separately hold negotiations with North Korea -- to be placed in a difficult position when we agree upon the proposal. What is important here is, I think, that we need to carefully watch out the IAEA's attitude toward North Korea. The IAEA led by Director-General Hans Blix, who served as Swedish foreign minister, has adhered to its strong position that it would not make an exception of the nuclear inspections of North Korea in accordance with the basic principle that contributes to maintaining global peace, as well as to ensuring nuclear nonproliferation throughout the world. Also, it has raised an objection to the United States' attitude to be flexible in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue in order to maintain its continual influence against North Korea and to keep the continuity of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which will be terminated in 1995. North European member-countries -- such as Norway and Sweden, including Director-General Hans Blix himself -- have said that although the socialist ruling parties were in sympathy with North Korea at one time when they were in power, there were some points upon which they had doubts about North Korea because of its power system character, continuous tricks, and stickiness on the nuclear weapon program. They have also continued their consistent demands that North Korea abide by the IAEA's basic principles. France's L'ARMEMENT has carried an editorial saying that "we must not be optimistic about the future of the North Korean nuclear issue mainly because North Korea has accepted nuclear inspections, but rather be aware that the only resolute and consistent attitude is the very effective factor in maintaining peace on the Korean peninsula." Despite such editorials by the French paper, South Korea, which is directly threatened by North Korea, has been hesitant to resolve the nuclear issue. We wonder if the government has really a firm policy or consistent and basic principle to cope with the North Korean nuclear issue. Considering the fact that North Korea's nuclear threat may be continuously offensive against us, we must take our action and, with it, make North Korea become aware that their nuclear weapon development will be an intolerable burden to them. Judging from the ongoing contacts between the ROK and the United States to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue or the ROK people's feeling against it, however, I don't think it is possible for the government to take any action against North Korea. Under this reality, the ROK's dependency upon the United States cannot but be continuously deepened. The government must know, however, that there are some people who regard the United States as an unwelcome friendly country. We must pay attention to it. Also, we must keep in our mind the fact that we can avoid making repeated mistakes only if we fully learn something from our history. We must not develop our demands into the senseless stickiness to the nuclear issue, but instead remember the fact that the agreements reached between the North and South have been so far kept in dead storage. Therefore, we can say that "there are only broken agreements between the North and South at present."
