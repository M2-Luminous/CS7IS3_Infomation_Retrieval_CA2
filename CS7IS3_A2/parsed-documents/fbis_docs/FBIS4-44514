The central theme of this conference is clarifying the guiding thought and studying how to formulate an experimental implementation plan for the experiment. Since the idea to conduct the experiment to "optimize the capital structure and increase enterprise strength" in some cities was proposed, it has received serious consideration from several provinces and municipalities. Moreover, the concerted effort of our nine ministries and commissions has acquired the support of State Council leaders. I. The Current Enterprise Reform Situation and Our Task The enterprise reform situation is very good. First, the orientation of enterprise reform has already been clearly shown. The Decision of the Third Plenary Session indicates that establishing a modern enterprise system with "clear property rights, explicit rights and responsibilities, division between government and enterprises, and scientific management is a definite requirement for developing a socialist large production and market economy and is the orientation of China's state enterprise reform." For a period in the future, it will be an important task of enterprise reform to cause large- and medium-sized enterprises that are prepared to essentially accomplish conversion of mechanisms and establish a modern enterprise system that meets the demands of the socialist market economy system to make full use of the main force function of large and medium-sized state enterprises in the socialist market economy, and spur the entire national economy to sustained, rapid, and sound forward progress. Secondly, reforms of the five major systems of treasury and taxes, finance, investment, foreign trade, and planning have been implemented one after the other. With reform of the tax system having been implemented for a month and a half, it has generally gone smoothly and no major problems have occurred. The transition to a tax system dividing responsibility with local treasuries and the transition to a unified tax system for the enterprise contract system is an extraordinary thing. Although some problems have been exposed in the implementation, the party Central Committee and the State Council are adopting measures to resolve the problems and improve the situation. We have investigated the situation of the new tax system in eleven industries. All reflected that quite a few problems with increased value added tax burdens in such industries as coal, small chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and small water and electricity have already been resolved and the independent mine resource tax problem is being negotiated. Leading comrades in the State Council have pointed out several times that they will account for the tax reduction and tax exemption policy approved by governments at the provincial level and above before the end of June 1993 and within two years they will adopt methods for late return of previously levied taxes. The Ministry of Finance and the State General Bureau of Taxation are formulating concrete suggestions. The general spirit is not to lightly change the policy that is in effect and to focus on smoothly establishing new mechanisms. The implementation of these macroeconomic measures has changed the situation of enterprise reform's being an isolated force penetrating deep into enemy territory and has caused enterprise reform from being alone to enter a new stage generally coordinated with other reforms and has provided state enterprises with a new development opportunity to move toward the market and participate in competition. Third, there is a series of laws and regulations regarding enterprise reform. For example, such laws and regulations as the Enterprise Law, Mechanism Conversion Regulations, Supervision and Management Regulations (to be implemented), Accounting Standards, and the General Rule on Financial Affairs, along with the Company Law have been promulgated and implemented, creating a rather good legal atmosphere for enterprise reform. Based on the orientation and tasks of enterprise reform and this year's situation, in accordance with the principle of "combining overall progress with key breakthroughs" proposed in the Decision of the Third Plenary Session, we have proposed a plan "for converting mechanisms and establishing the system and ten thousand, thousand, hundred, and ten" plans based on thorough investigation and analysis and repeated solicitation of the suggestions of provinces, municipalities, and enterprises. "Converting mechanisms and establishing the system" is the abbreviation of the theme of the second part of the Decision. It speaks of promoting overall enterprise reform. That is, all state enterprises should do a good job of implementing the Regulations on Converting Mechanisms and the Supervision and Management Regulations to be implemented concentrating their efforts on converting mechanisms to create the conditions for laying a good base to establish a modern enterprise system. The "ten thousand, thousand, hundred, ten" is a concretization of the key breakthroughs in current enterprise reform,. That is, by some enterprises (indicating 10,000, 1,000, and 100 enterprises) advancing a step and coordinating their reforms with some cities (indicating some ten cities), a breakthrough is achieved in an important link to act as a model to effectively spur on overall enterprise reform, and "converting mechanisms and establishing the system" and "ten thousand, thousand, hundred, ten" are an organic whole. To promote overall "conversion of mechanisms and establishment of the system" requires that all regions and departments and all enterprises do a good job in the following three efforts: 1. Unremittingly persist in thoroughly implementing the Regulations on the Conversion of Mechanisms. The Regulations on the Conversion of Mechanisms are the cornerstone for establishing the socialist market economy system. We should implement to the letter the rights and responsibilities conferred on enterprises by the Regulations on the Conversion of Mechanisms. First, we should implement the base of the fourteen autonomies, leading to enterprises' using autonomy well, sufficiently, and actively. Second, every department should formulate and implement accompanying regulations to the Regulations on the Conversion of Mechanisms. Third, we should continue to increase publicity and in cooperation with the procurator's department, we should investigate and prosecute cases of attacks and reprisals toward enterprises in violation of the Regulations on the Conversion of Mechanisms and expose them in the news to the point of pursuing legal responsibility. Fourth, seize the opportune time for government reform and promote conversion of government functions. This year we should make a breakthrough in handling self-management of foreign trade import and export rights and refuse to apportion rights, and improve methods of approval, simplify procedures, and improve efficiency of foreign trade import and export rights. We should let enterprises that have already been given the rights to manage imports and exports themselves enjoy the same rights as foreign trade enterprises in such aspects as export licenses and allotment of quotas. We should curb arbitrary apportionment as an important way of coming to grips with anti-corruption. Regions and industries should combine their actual situations and formulate specific methods to curb arbitrary apportionment and announce them to the masses and enterprises to be monitored and enforced. 2. Organize the implementation of the Supervision and Management Regulations and establish a system for supervision and management of state assets. The Supervision and Management Regulations are the completion and development of the Regulations on Converting Mechanisms. The Supervision and Management Regulations are mainly aimed at the current situation of mismanagement and serious erosion of state assets. On the one hand, relevant departments should take responsibility for supervising the state assets of enterprises that they are assigned to supervise and as needed conscientiously assign supervisory board tasks. On the other hand, we should determine enterprise legal person property rights and establish a system of asset management responsibilities linked to the managers' own interests, increasing their value based on ensuring that state assets are not eroded. 3. Actively and safely establish a modern enterprise system. Assisted by the Central Committee financial and economic leading group, with our commission taking the lead together with more than ten departments, we have investigated and studied the subject of a modern enterprise system and at the demand of the financial and economic leading group, we have taken steps to establish a modern enterprise system. We believe that in establishing a modern enterprise system, we should especially pay attention to doing a good job of handling the relations between experimental enterprises and other enterprises. All enterprises should conscientiously implement the Regulations on Conversion of Mechanisms and the Regulations on Supervision and Management and carry out the Accounting Standards and the General Rule on Financial Affairs and reform enterprise labor, personnel, and wage allocation systems, lighten the social burdens that enterprises handle, clear up credits and liabilities, reappraise stocks and assets, and demarcate property rights. This is the main content of the current enterprise reform and creates the necessary conditions for establishing a modern enterprise system. This means that in carrying out the reforms described above we are giving impetus to state enterprises' moving in the direction of a modern enterprise system. This is a reform that all enterprises should now conduct. At the same time, we should recognize that establishing a modern enterprise system is an arduous and complicated task, especially for a state enterprise to become a company requires trials. We should guard against all enterprises rushing to reorganize as companies, watering down or overlooking the Regulations on Converting Mechanisms and the Regulations on Supervision and Management. While generally steadily promoting "conversion of mechanisms and establishment of the system," we should use the "ten thousand, thousand, hundred, and ten" form to realize key breakthroughs. "Ten thousand" means to thoroughly implement the Enterprise Law and the Regulations on Converting Mechanisms and do a good job of carrying out the Two Standards in 10,000 large and medium-sized state enterprises and accomplish the task of reappraising stocks and assets and essentially accomplish conversion of mechanisms. "Thousand" means that in implementing the Regulations on Supervision and Management, the state by stages and in groups should assign supervisory boards to 1,000 key mainstay enterprises related to the national economy and the people's livelihood and inspect the state assets of the enterprises. This task is beginning. "Hundred" means with the unified leadership and planning of the State Council, to select 100 large and medium-sized state enterprises of different types to establish an experimental modern enterprise system and explore ways for state enterprises to become companies. "Ten" means in some ten cities to conduct experiments with the complete reform of "optimizing the capital structure and increasing enterprise strength" and strive to achieve breakthrough progress on the key and difficult problems of getting large and medium-sized state enterprises into the market and taking part in competition. II. The Object and the Main Content of Selecting Some Cities to Conduct Complete Experimental Reform After the suggestion to select ten cities to conduct experiments to "optimize capital structure and increase enterprise strength" was proposed at the national economic and trade working conference, it aroused the general interest of provinces and cities throughout the country. Altogether official letters have come from 27 provincial and municipal governments throughout the country requesting that 39 cities conduct the experiment. To do a good job of conducting the experiment together, nine ministries and commissions, our commission together with the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Labor, the People's Bank, the Auditing Administration, the General Bureau of Taxation, the State Assets Bureau, and the Bank of Industry and Commerce, formed the "city experiment cooperative working group" and, dividing forces in all directions, we conducted on the spot investigation and research. On this basis, the document put out jointly by the nine ministries and commissions determined the sixteen cities of Tianjin, Tangshan, Taiyuan, Shenyang, Changchun, Qiqihar, Shanghai, Changzhou, Bengbu, Qingdao, Zibo, Wuhan, Zhuzhou, Liuzhou, Chengdu, and Baoji would conduct the experiment in "optimizing capital structure and increasing enterprise strength," and reported it to the State Council. Cities such as Chongqing and Harbin, formerly designated as the six old industrial bases, were not listed among the sixteen cities. Based on the strong demands of the two cities and the proposal of the provincial governments, consideration was given to the reform and development needs of the old industrial bases, and with the consultation of the nine ministries and commissions, Chongqing and Harbin were listed as associates and based on their situation they will conduct comparable experiments and attend working conferences related to the experiment. According to the data from this investigation and research, the sixteen cities together have 3,199 large and medium-sized state industrial enterprises, 21.3 percent of the large and medium-sized state industrial enterprises in the country, and 8.3516 million workers, 23.20 percent of the workers in state industrial enterprises in the national budget. These enterprises together have gross assets of 467.26 billion yuan and net assets of 139.4 billion yuan, respectively making up 18.2 percent and 17.9 percent of the state industrial enterprises in the national budget. The 1993 principal indicators and their share of state industrial enterprises in the national budget were: gross value of industrial output 321.726 billion [yuan], 23.2 percent; sales receipts 358.73 billion, 19.8 percent; profits and taxes achieved 53 billion, 24 percent, within which profits were 27.401 billion, 44.20 percent. That is less than one-fifth of the large and medium-sized state enterprises with one-sixth of the net assets created more than one-fourth of the profits, indicating that these new and old industrial bases still have potential, but current problems are not small. In selecting the cities described above to conduct the "optimize capital structure and increase enterprise strength" experiment, the three main considerations were: 1. The base for establishing the socialist market economy is large and medium-sized state enterprises. In the crucial period for converting from the old to the new system, we should seize the opportunity and realistically increase the strength of state enterprises. This year, with the implementation of macroeconomic system reforms, the external environment of enterprises is greatly changing and a fair competition environment is gradually forming and large and medium-sized state enterprises are facing development opportunities and serious challenges. So, on the one hand, we should direct enterprises' gazes inward and painstakingly develop inner skills, and especially by strengthened implementation of the Bankruptcy Law, we should weed out enterprises that there is no way to save and increase enterprises' sense of urgency and sense of crisis and promote the conversion of enterprise operating mechanisms. At the same time, we must face up to the situation with state enterprises and by feeling out the situation and what the financial strength of each sector will allow, grasp the precious opportunity to transition from the old to the new system and, seeking truth from facts, determine the residual problems that the old system gives enterprises and create favorable conditions for large and medium-sized state enterprises to go into battle with a light pack and make great strides in entering the market. 2. Enterprise reform still is a key and a difficulty in current reforms and we must obtain experience through experimentation. Enterprises still are the greatest difficulty in the current establishment of the socialist market economy and intensification of reforms. Despite the fact that other aspects of reform also are rather difficult, we generally can learn from foreign experience. For example, in the differentiated tax system, most Western countries have implemented this type of financial and tax system and in banking, most countries in the world have established different types of banks. But there still is no foreign precedent for how we can make these vast state enterprises smoothly enter the market and participate in equal competition. We can only look to privatization and this does not conform to China's national characteristics. We definitely cannot take this road. State enterprises are the mainstay of the market economy and the ultimate undertaking of reforms. If complete reforms do not arrive, there is no way for state enterprise reform to be intensified. But if reform of state enterprises is not effectively advanced, it will be difficult for other reforms ultimately to be accomplished. So, reform of state enterprises has a widespread involvement and numerous problems, and the situation is complicated. We must painstakingly organize experiments and in practice explore and review experience to advance the task that we are faced with. 3. One possible way to do a good job with state enterprises is to rely on the cities to accomplish comprehensive rectification. Reform already has penetrated to today. Resolving deep-seated key and difficult enterprise problems can no longer go the old way of reducing taxes and conceding profits. It is necessary to optimize enterprise organizational structure and capital structure with adjustments; establish property rights exchange markets with reform of the property rights system; and establish an integrated labor force market with an improved social insurance system. In these respects, fully utilizing city functions and regional advantages is well worth doing. In sum, the objective of conducting urban experiments is to seek a new line of thinking and new methods to do a good job on large and medium-sized state enterprises through these experiments. That is, taking large and medium-sized state enterprises as the key and using cities as the basis, closely focus on current key and difficult problems and by complete reforms and comprehensive rectification, strive to obtain breakthrough progress and strengthen large and medium-sized state enterprises to effectively combine the public ownership system and the market economy to lay a firm foundation for establishing the socialist market economy. To accomplish the goals described above, the main content of the urban experiment can be simply summarized with eight characters: bankruptcy [pochan (4275 3934)], replenishment [buchong (5943 0339)], stripping [boli (0475 4418)], and lightening the load [qingzhuang (6535 5944)]. The first thing is to strengthen the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law and step up organizational restructuring of enterprises. Those enterprises that do not have the resources to pay off their debts in kind and have no hope of turning around their losses and cannot clear the debts that are due should be declared bankrupt and, by means of the experimental norms, we should proceed with legislation to promote the conversion of operating mechanisms. The Bankruptcy Law has been officially implemented since 1988. It has already been six years. Although the number of enterprises that have relied on the law through the courts to declare bankruptcy has increased from year to year, for various reasons, such as the systems, the concepts, and the overall situation, mechanisms to select the superior and weed out the inferior still have not been completely established. This time we should use the cities as a basis and truly establish a weeding out mechanism external to the enterprises and self-restraint mechanisms within the enterprises and bring along and advance the establishment and improvement of a social insurance system. We should rely on cities to establish a property rights exchange market and by property rights exchanges optimize asset accumulations and enhance the basic function of the market in asset distribution. Secondly, we should adopt various measures and multiple channels to replenish enterprise self-circulating funds. First, enterprises should fully utilize policies already in effect such as income tax rate cuts, the abolition of adjusted taxes and "two funds," and not submitting after tax profits in the near term, and implement the Two Standards to accelerate depreciation and conscientiously replenish circulating funds. Half in principle, enterprises should use exemption from submitting "two funds" and after-tax profits to replenish circulating funds. At the same time, the central government, departments, and localities also should strive together to replenish enterprise capital by multiple channels and resolve the problem of a serious inadequacy of enterprise production and operating funds and realistically strengthen enterprises. The third thing is to establish labor force markets, strip enterprise social functions, and improve the social insurance systems with cities as the center. The test cities should gradually take on various functions for society. For example, arrange for such functions as enterprises' surplusing by various channels to create the conditions for intensifying the reform of three internal enterprise systems. The fourth thing is to feel out situations, structures, and contributing factors to the unreasonable burdens that the old system has formed for test city large and medium-sized state enterprises, and by stages and in groups resolve the problems described above. We should review our experiences while experimenting, and give impetus to the task that confronts us and strive by the end of the Eighth 5-Year Plan to be able to completely implement the regulations to convert the enterprise operating mechanisms of large and medium-sized state enterprises, the mainstay of the national economy, and get them into the market and participating in competition.
