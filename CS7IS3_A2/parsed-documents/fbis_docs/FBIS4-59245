Colonel Fawzi Zaqzuq, commander of the contingent, said it is part of the Palestinian 'Ayn Jalut Forces, which was stationed in Egypt. In addition to enlisted men, it includes several officers of various ranks and some noncommissioned officers. He said today's contingent complements the group that entered yesterday. He explained that their weapons and equipment arrived in Gaza earlier. Staff Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad 'Abd-al-Wahhab, commander of the 'Ayn Jalut Forces, said that the weapons on hand are sufficient for sentry purposes and to maintain order in the Palestinian streets. He said that the first groups to arrive will assume their positions and carry out a temporary deployment until the remaining forces arrive and take over overall authority for security in the area. Brig. Gen. 'Abd-al-Wahhab said that the Palestinian forces are ready to begin their duties in the autonomy areas, pointing out that 2,000 policemen are ready to enter immediately if Israel agrees. He noted that all the Palestinian people are waiting for the arrival of their national forces and will welcome their presence regardless of any political differences among various factions. Brig. Gen. 'Abd-al-Wahhab remarked, however, that the technical capabilities and equipment of the Palestinian police are still very poor because no grants or aid have been received yet from the countries that announced plans to send aid. He said the United States has sent 200 vehicles as a gift, but they are not equipped as police cars.
