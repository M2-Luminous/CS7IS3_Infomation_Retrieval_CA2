She was addressing the 14th annual Hussainia Conference in Islambad today. The prime minister said the government has undeniable proof of a conspiracy hatched by an inimical neighboring country to inject or hire citizens or some saboteurs so as to create law and order problems by airing harsh sectarian feelings [sentence as heard]. The government is alive and alert to its duties and would take firm measures to maintaining smooth law and order. She said the chief ministers of the provinces have already been directed to adopt stringent steps in this regard. In its bid to cow down Pakistan to desist from venting a principled moral and diplomatic support to the consensus Kashmir cause [as heard], the neighboring country has hatched conspiracies one after the other to create internal problems for Pakistan. The prime minister said with the help and support of the people and by making use of all machinery at its command the government would frustrate such nefarious designs.
