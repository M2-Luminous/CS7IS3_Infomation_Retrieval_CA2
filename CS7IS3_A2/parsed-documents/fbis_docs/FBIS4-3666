In recent weeks, much has been said about caning as a form of punishment in Singapore, he noted when addressing the official opening of two prisons here this morning. He said some in the American media had gone so far as to equate caning to torture because caning caused pain and possibly permanent cane marks. And they called caning a "cruel", "inhuman" or "unusual" punishment. "It is absurd that societies so stricken with crime should attempt to apply their standards on us and teach us what to do," the minister said. The United States should not "try to impose its system on others" since even in the United States, it does not have a criminal justice system that is universally applied in every one of the 50 states, he said. The American teenager, Michael Fay, 18, was sentenced here last month to four months imprisonment, a fine of 3,500 Singapore dollars, and six strokes of the cane. "Nobody takes any joy in carrying out these strict punishments, be it imprisonment, caning or execution. But if it has to be done, it must be done," Wong said. "Laws will not be effective if the penalties are not sufficiently strict. Only then will these laws have the desired punitive and deterrent effects," he added. "In Singapore, our own experience has convinced us that strict laws, rigorous and impartial enforcement and a fair and transparent judicial system have made our country relatively crime-free," the minister said.
