He will be faced with the far from easy task of promoting "on behalf of the president" proper interaction among the chambers and factions of the new Russian parliament, which has already proved to be an independent political force. As a matter of fact, the 46-year-old scholar has sufficient experience in dealing with political leaders of different leanings. As director of the Russian Socio-Political Centre, he was able to find common language with the Communists, with Baburin's Russian National Union, with Nikolay Travkin's party, whose headquarters are under the centre's roof. The "naturalistic-experimental interest" of this scientist, who is, moreover, a member of the Presidential Council, in all the "sectors" of the political spectrum was not always adequately received within President Yeltsin's administration. This is why Satarov had to publicly explain that the state was interested in interaction with all the political parties and movements, because they represent a channel for promoting a dialogue between the authorities and the society. Being concurrently director-general of the Centre for Applied Political Studies -- Indem (Informations for Democracy), Candidate of Technical Sciences Georgiy Satarov has also proved to be a remarkable sociologist. His scientific works on the balance of political forces within the Congress of People's Deputies of the former Russian Supreme Soviet, which were repeatedly published in the magazine "Russian Monitor", give reason to assert that Satarov will apparently display an equally correct approach to the forecasting and analysis of the current parliament's work. It is indicative that the president is gradually giving up the practice of inviting politically engaged people, who, while at the helm of power, cared mostly for their own career, but began to oppose Yeltsin the very minute they were deprived of it. Satarov's appointment as presidential aide (new decrees are expected to be issued to include in the presidential administration other members of the Presidential Council from among independent scientists) differs positively also from the latest personnel changes within the government. President Yeltsin publicly stated last year that he would "fire" Satarov for disagreeing with the timing of the next presidential elections. The ideas of this member of the Presidential Council, which proved necessary during the compilation of the new Russian constitution and during the preparation of the presidential message to the parliament, have apparently "outweighed" the president's erstwhile anger, and one more outstanding personality was added to the group of the presidential aides.
