FBIS4-11435 "drlat082_b_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-082 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 Haiti Monde: End Talks, Install Government, Die Together Monde: End Talks, Install Government, Die Together FL2604220594 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole in French 1800 GMT 26 Apr 94 FL2604220594 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole French BFN [Passage within quotation marks in Creole] [Text] The president of the Chamber of Deputies announced that the executive power vacuum will probably be filled this week. Frantz Robert Monde, reporting on the consultations begun last week, indicated that the majority of sectors he met with expressed concern about this vacuum. The Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to meet soon to choose the constitutional formula required within the current context, according to President Monde who expressed himself during a news conference today: [Begin Monde recording] At least if the Haitian Armed Forces had said no, but President Aristide said yes, we could make them meet and see what is negative in this plan. From there, we could then manage to find a consensus between the two protagonists of the crisis. But, one said no, and because he said no, the sanctions must be reinforced. This is an aberration. I therefore say that if the sanctions are reinforced, "greeting or not greeting your enemy is the same thing; he will eat you up anyway for something you did." Close the door on all negotiations, install a government, and agree to die together. [end recording]
