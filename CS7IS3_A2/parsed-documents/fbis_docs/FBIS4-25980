The inspection has taken selling at marked prices as a breakthrough point to straighten out market order and prices. As a result of hard work over the past two months, the practice of selling at marked prices has become increasingly popular. More than 95 percent of department stores, 95 to 96 percent of eating houses, and 60 percent of supermarkets and individual traders have followed this practice. Some 140,000 units were inspected and it was discovered that 80,000 units had failed to abide by the relevant rules and regulations. Fines totalling more than 120,000 yuan were imposed. In the meantime, our inspection personnel also seriously handled cases of those units or individuals who increased prices arbitrarily before the promulgation of measures aimed at curbing price increases in light of the seriousness of their illegal practice. [passage indistinct] [passage omitted] Our inspection personnel exerted their main efforts in inspecting 8,130 key units and discovered 2,343 law violation cases involving 15.49 million yuan. In the course of carrying out their inspection work, they also paid attention to handling cases reported by the masses. They dealt with a total of more than 1,200 cases reported by the masses, more than 1,000 cases of which were handled immediately. Although certain results have been achieved in the mass inspection work, there are still some problems: First, the prices of a small number of daily necessities still remain high. Second, it is more difficult to standardize prices on market fairs or set prices for individual traders. Third, cases of our inspection personnel being besieged, scolded, and beaten still happen from time to time. In future, relevant departments must truly take effective measures to promote the healthy development of our mass inspection work.
