The Canadian-built facilities are located in the Castellanos bed and use a system of zinc precipitation, which is widely used in the international gold industry, to extract the mineral. According to mining authorities, this mine opens new possibilities for Cuba to diversify its economy. In addition to Castellanos, Cuba has gold deposits in the Isle of Youth (Delita), in the central province of Villa Clara (El Descanso), and in the eastern provinces of Camaguey (Jobabo) and Holguin (Aguas Claras). The most promising of those gold deposits is the one located in Delita. Experts have concluded, however, that this is where gold extractions will be more difficult because the mineral is accompanied by large amounts of arsenic, which is definitely an undesirable element. Cuba is divided into 37 areas for geological prospects. More than 20 contracts have been signed with foreign investors, particularly from Canada, for the exploration of solid minerals.
