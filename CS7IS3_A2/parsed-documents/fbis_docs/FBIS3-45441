Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave an important speech at the conference. He emphatically pointed out: Party committees at all levels should pay great attention to united front work, further enhance the concept on united front and never slightly slacken our leadership over united front work. It is necessary to unite with nonparty personages in various sectors to jointly build our country and unite with as many people as we can. If we fail to have this consciousness, that means we are practicing closed-doorism and will be unable to vigorously develop our undertakings. Chen Xitong pointed out: At present, a considerable number of leading cadres have failed to fully understand the importance of united front work and believed that united front work was "important in the past, but not now," and that it is "all right to have it or do without it and to slacken or tighten efforts in it." These are all wrong. United front work is our "magic weapon" in the past and it is still so today. During the democratic revolution period, our party was fairly weak and small. We would be unable to win victory in the revolution if we did not have the people's support and have so many people to rally with us. At that time, united front work was a matter of life and death and the people had a fuller understanding of it. However, along with the victory in revolution, our strength became stronger; we were in control of the political power; and some comrades began to pay less attention to united front work. This is very one-sided. Actually, during the period of accelerating reform, opening up and economic development, we need united front work and the new situation has also put forward higher demands on united front work. The united front is playing an important role in guaranteeing social stability and economic construction, and its tasks are not lightened but aggravated. Chen Xitong called on party committees at all levels to further enhance their understanding of the united front's strategic status, strengthen the party's leadership over united front work and include it on the agenda. We should pay attention to making friends with people outside the party, do a better job in implementing the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC, formulate specific measures and open more channels for democratic parties and people from various circles to participate in the discussion of political affairs and give democratic supervision; pay attention to absorbing people outside the party to participate in the work of government departments; support and help democratic parties to train successors and solve some practical problems of democratic parties and representative personages outside the party. Meanwhile, we should realistically strengthen the building of ranks of united front work cadres and of united front work organs. In his speech, Chen Xitong further stressed: To successfully carry out united front work, we must deeply conduct investigations and studies because only on this basis can we be able to develop and blaze new trial in a better manner. To judge the success or failure in united front work, we should see whether we can unite with all the strength that can be united, whether we can mobilize all positive factors and whether we have made contributions to safeguarding stability and unity in the country and the capital and realizing the goal of enabling Beijing Municipality to become well-off three years ahead of schedule. At the conference, Shen Rendao, vice chairman of the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political consultative Conference [CPPCC] and director of the United Front Work Department of the municipal party committee, delivered a work report, entitled: "Clearly Understand the New Situation, Form a New Climate, and Make New Contributions To Realizing the Goal of Achieving Stability and Development in the Capital and Enabling It To Become Well-Off Three Years Ahead of Schedule," and made specific plans for implementing the guidelines of the national united front work conference and further strengthening the municipality's united front work. Li Zhijian, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, presided over the conference and gave a summing-up speech. He said: This conference is quite successful and the participants have conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the standing committee meeting of the municipal party committee. Using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a guidance, unceasingly enhance our understanding of the importance, strategic meaning, inevitability and necessity of united front work are the preconditions for successfully carrying out united front work under the new situation. At present, the united front is facing the new situation, new circumstances and new problems, and at the same time, it is also facing very good opportunities. The establishment of the socialist market economic system has opened up a vast world for united front work and has instilled positive factors into it. The broad masses of cadres on the united front should have a sense of urgency, seize the opportunity, put forward new ideas and create new experiences. Li Zhijian demanded: After the conference, party committees at all levels should propose specific opinions in line with the reality of their own units; do practical things for the people outside the party and exert efforts to solve their practical problems; strengthen the building of united front work departments and urge united front work cadres to strengthen study, unceasingly raise their own quality and further create a new situation in the united front work of Beijing Municipality. Wang Daming, chairman of the municipal CPPCC Committee, gave a speech on doing a better job in united front work. Wang Tong, Yang Shichao, Qiang Wei, Tie Ying, Lu Yucheng, He Luli, Chen Dabai, Li Bokang and Zhu Zupu, and other leaders attended the conference.
