This information was provided by National Police sources, who indicated that antinarcotics operations in the Upper Huallaga, as well as in the mountain ranges of the central jungle, have been momentarily suspended because of the absence of these helicopters. Experts in the struggle against drug trafficking said that the helicopters are a great help in transporting police personnel, as land transportation is very difficult in the jungle due to ambushes by narcoterrorists. A spokesman for the National Police said that despite this inconvenience operations are going on, but not as many.
