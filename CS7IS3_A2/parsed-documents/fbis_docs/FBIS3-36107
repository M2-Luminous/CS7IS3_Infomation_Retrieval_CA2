We have started the reform program in accordance with the memorandum negotiated with the IMF, Mr. Ciobanu also added, whereas nothing is being done in the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic, no kind of reform is carried out. Through the intention of joining the ruble zone, the Tiraspol authorities want to perpetuate their power and to preserve the status quo of the separatist leadership. Moreover, they want to reestablish -- through various ways and means -- the situation of the former Soviet Union, Mr. Ceslav Ciobanu, President Mircea Snegur's counselor in charge of economic issues, emphasized. Also today, a meeting was held in Tiraspol by the City Soviet at which a report on the activity of the Executive Committee and on the budget for the current year were presented. The request by some deputies to include into the agenda other problems, such as rationing foodstuffs, the dismissal of the public education chief, Mrs. Vera Dvoreanu, who is defending the Latin writing in schools in that area, led to fiery discussions, which ended with the initiators leaving the hall in the hope that they would be able to block the proceedings. On behalf of the Union of Civic Movements and political parties in the Dniester region, Igor Smirnov was asked to dissolve the Tiraspol City Soviet until the elections for local bodies, which are scheduled to be held in April this year. Until then, it was demanded, the local leadership should be handled by Vladimir Emilianov as the representative of Igor Smirnov, the local correspondent of the Chisinau radio-television reports.
