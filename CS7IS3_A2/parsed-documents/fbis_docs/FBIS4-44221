As reported by HELSINGIN SANOMAT's Pekka Vaisanen, the party at its convention in Turku instead voted 100-80 to satisfy itself with simply supporting the EU accession agreement as signed by the government. According to Vaisanen, the debate showed clearly that most delegates favored EU membership, but voted on compromise wording favored by RKP Chairman and Communications Minister Ole Norrback, who feared a strong membership resolution could alienate the party's vocal anti-EU minority in the March 1995 parliamentary election. Norrback also was seen as hoping to keep open the chances of making electoral alliances with members of the tiny Liberal Party and other new independent movements in the spring election. Among such grass-roots movements is one supporting popular Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn. Led by Deputy Chairman Hakan Malm and mainly representing agricultural interests, the anti-EU forces had wanted an additional statement declaring that Finland should have the right to change its decision on membership if Sweden's membership referendum went the other way. This was handily defeated, however. The most outspoken opposition to membership heard at the convention came from a rural delegate, who warned that Finland would lose the ability to control economic policy under the EMU (European Monetary Union), and that in a future recession this would hurt forestry exports. According to Maria Romantschuck of HUVUDSTADSBLADET, this compromise allowed the RKP ministers in Prime Minister Aho center-right cabinet to claim to have received "support from the entire convention for the government having signed the agreement." In a separate analysis piece, Vaisanen asserts that those in favor of EU membership had a "clear upper hand" in the debate. "The Swedish People's Party delegates want into the EU above all for security and economic policy reasons," he claims. A theme often heard was the need to tie Finland to the Nordics and the West in general. Again according to the author, for the delegates it was "important to show Finland belongs to West Europe, and in no circumstances to East Europe." Quoting from one delegate's speech: "The alternative to EU membership is that we will become a small island on Russia's flank."
