First, according to Satarov, "the president of Russia is inclined to minimize the potential harm inflicted by the political amnesty decision." With this aim in mind Boris Yeltsin will, in the near future, possibly today, address the citizens of the country in defense of human rights and with an assessment of the act of political amnesty. Second, Georgiy Satarov remarked, State Duma chairman Ivan Rybkin and the deputies have recognized that they have "become the hostages of their own decision and of the future behavior of those whom they have set free." Therefore, the president's aide thinks, "whether from considerations of self-preservation or arising out of a wish for accord and reconciliation" the deputies will try not to allow a new round of extremism in society. Another participant in the briefing -- Aleksandr Yakovlev, the president's plenipotentiary representative in the Federal Assembly -- voiced a warning in connection with the fact that 1 May 1994 might repeat the "fresh and painful experience of last year's May Day." The lawyer reminded his listeners that the law does not provide for a second act of amnesty in relation to one and the same group of persons. Unlike his colleagues in the presidential administration, Yuriy Baturin, the president's national security aide, sees from his viewpoint the greatest danger for society as being in the split among the democrats. He pointed out that there is now a strategy for uniting democratic forces, laid down in the president's message. Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on how Boris Yeltsin reacted to the two aides' efforts to suspend the political amnesty, Georgiy Satarov answered: "We have not been asked to resign. His reaction was a balanced one." Although the members of the the presidential apparatus intended to devote the briefing to the president's message, journalists changed the theme of the meeting with questions like: "How was it that the situation with the political amnesty caught you unawares?" In their answers Aleksandr Yakovlev, Georgiy Satarov, and Yuriy Baturin repeated their already well-known arguments on the imperfect nature of the legislation, the dual position of the procuracy, and the need to observe the law.
