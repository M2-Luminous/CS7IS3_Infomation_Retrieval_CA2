Valentin Karabashev is a member of the Alternative Social Liberal Party (ASP), which entered parliament on the ticket of the Union of Democratic Forces. It was expelled from the coalition at the end of 1992 because of its support for Lyuben Berov's cabinet formed under the mandate assigned to the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms and backed by the formerly Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party, which now holds a majority in the National Assembly. Minister of Industry Rumen Bikov is also a member of the ASP. Explaining his resignation in a letter to the prime minister, Mr. Karabashev says that last autumn the functions of the two deputy prime ministers (the other is Evgeni Matinchev, who also heads the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs) got confused, creating mistrust and chaos in the governing institution, and that there were several cases of the prime minister taking action without notifying him. Mr. Karabashev says that one of those cases was the prime minister's attempt to launch an idea of his own about privatization. In Mr. Karabashev's opinion, Prof. Berov's attempts to revise the operative legislation on privatization were the reason for its slow pace. Making a declaration on the government's intentions until the end of the year in parliament yesterday [27 April], Prime Minister Berov blamed the slowdown in privatization on the deputy prime minister in charge of it and sharply criticized the Ministry of Trade. "The criticism of my performance as a deputy prime minister and minister of trade is serious but unfounded," Mr. Karabashev says in his letter. He also states that the cabinet changed planned by the prime minister are quite different from his own views. Interviewed by the media at the Council of Ministers, Valentin Karabashev said that Prof. Berov had asked him not to be overhasty with his resignation. MP Asen Michkovski of the ASP, who was at the Council of Ministers too, said that the party leadership would consider whether to withdraw its support for Prof. Berov's government or not. Mr. Michkovski stated that the ASP might ask another of its representatives in the government, Minister of Industry Bikov, to resign too. "I should abide by the decision of the ASP, but ultimately this is a question of personal choice," Mr. Bikov said. The National Assembly is expected to debate Mr. Karabashev's resignation when it resumes work after the Easter recess, which is until May 11. It is possible that the ASP will propose an extraordinary sitting of parliament because there is a cabinet crisis in the country, as Mr. Michkovski put it.
