During 1992, the Mexican alkaloid accounted for approximately 23 percent of the drugs circulating on the U.S. black market: a proportion lower than 33 percent, the number reported in 1988. This announcement was made yesterday by Manuel Quijano, vice chairman of the UN's Internal Narcotics Inspection Board, upon submitting that agency's annual report. At a press conference, he added that, during the past three years, a control program in Mexico also has reduced the illegal opium poppy crops to their lowest index in 10 years.
