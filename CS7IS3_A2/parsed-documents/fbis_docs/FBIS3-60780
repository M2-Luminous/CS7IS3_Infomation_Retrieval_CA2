Seven other persons were also captured in the police operation, as well as a sizable arsenal which was examined yesterday, 25 November, by prosecutor Humberto Espejo. The persons arrested were identified as Esteban Burgos Torrealba, military chief; Alejandro Placencia Urrutia, logistics chief; and Ariel Saenz Bont-Martens, political chief. Also arrested were a married couple, Luis Emilio Lopez Sandoval and Iris Galleguillos Donoso, and Claudia Mella Mateluna, Gabriel Venegas Escorza, Leslie Maxwel Narvaez, Jacqueline Navarette Mellado, and Paola Orlando Orlando. According to a senior civil police official, the police operation was the culmination of extensive intelligence work that began last June with the arrest of Jose Saa [sic] Gerbier, 30 years of age, the top leader of the extremist movement. After obtaining as much information as possible from the interrogation of Saa Gerbier, units of Intelligence and of the Second Assault Police Station raided four residences on the night of 23-24 November, located at Neptuno 101, Pudahuel; Cabo de Hornos 0545, Maipu; Pasaje Salitre Peregrino 0882, Puente Alto, and Pasaje Corcega 940, La Cisterna. In the first three, the police seized handguns and shoulder-fired weapons, and at La Cisterna they captured an extensive arsenal that included LAW rocket launchers. Following the arrest of Saa Gerbier, the government requested a visit by a prosecutor to investigate the subversive organization. The prosecutor designated was Magistrate Humberto Espejo Zuniga who, after a 10-day period of detention for the presumed extremists, conducted a visual inspection yesterday of the house at La Cisterna followed by an inspection of the captured weapons and explosives at the main offices of Investigations. Espejo described the quantity of armaments that the group possessed as impressive, when asked about the result of the police operations. As to their eventual use, he said that it was "evidently for a terrorist plan. We cannot guess what they planned to do, but there is no doubt that they were destined for terrorist acts." When asked whether documents with specific plans were found, he said "no, because these people rarely keep written planning records. It must be understood that these are terrorist organizations and the chiefs think about what they are going to do, at most they will write down some information, an address, but they never write down plans." As for crimes that might be attributed to the group, the prosecutor said that "approximately 24 high voltage towers have been blown up since last year, which is what started this investigation. That is for what concerns terrorist acts, but there is also a very large number of crimes for gain, about 32 or 33 crimes, robberies of banks, finance offices, and supermarkets. A guard was killed, and there could be some connection with the death of a gendarme." (Jose Cortes, on 11 October, in the motor vehicle section of the Gendarmeria.) He said that this group was an offshoot of the FPMR and that "the size of the band" was being investigated, that there was no evidence to indicate that this was the group that had freed Maritza Jara, on trial for the kidnapping of Cristian Edwards del Rio, from San Miguel prison. The "Raul Pellegrin" detachment, which came into being in 1991 as a result of the breakup of the FPMR, subscribes to the thesis of the armed revolution. Its leader uses the name of "Commander Rodrigo" in memory of the leader found dead together with Cecilia Magni in the mountains of the Seventh Region, following the attack on the village of Los Quenes in 1987, in which the carabineer Juvenal Vargas was killed. [Box, p 14] Arms and Explosives Captured In the residence at Pasaje Salitre Peregrino 0882, Puente Alto, the police seized an SHE submachine gun, model P 25, 9 mm Parabellum, and two Llama revolvers, Comanche model, .38 caliber special. There were also three magazines for the submachine gun with a capacity of 40 rounds each, and a large quantity of ammunition for the revolvers. In Neptune 101, Pudahuel, police seized a Rossi .38 caliber special revolver, a large quantity of ammunition for the weapon, and a 50 mm anti-aircraft round. In Cabo de Hornos 0545, Maipu, police found a Spanish grenade, a revolver and a CZ pistol, 9 mm short, and ammunition for both weapons. There were also two detonators, one with 15 centimeters of black fuse. Finally, in Corcega 940, La Cisterna, police found an extensive arsenal consisting of more than 15 kg of paint grade aluminum powder, used for making homemade bombs; ammonium nitrate; potassium chlorite; laminating powder; 300 meters of detonating cord at 10 grams per meter, which is also an explosive; homemade detonators; a large number of booby traps, T4 explosive plastic, electric-type detonators, seven LAW's with their rockets, all live or in working order; seven M-16 rifles with a large quantity of ammunition, approximately 30 magazines with 30 rounds in each one; sawed off shotguns, revolvers, and electric detonators. When asked about the destructive power of this arsenal, the chief of the Ballistics Department of Investigations said that "if we only consider the damage that a LAW rocket can do, we have a warlike arsenal able to cause damage of an incalculable magnitude. If we add to this the firepower of the M-16's and the amount of ammunition seized, we cannot measure the consequences."
