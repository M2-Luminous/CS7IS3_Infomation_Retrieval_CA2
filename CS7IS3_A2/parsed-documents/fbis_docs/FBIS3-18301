The main points of the program are the following: Economy - The ratio between the deficit and public debt must be lower than the ratio between the increase in gross domestic product and the GDP itself, states the document, adding that the two main lines of approach are: transferring current public spending to investments, "reducing waste and useless expenses"; restructuring of the public sector, reducing government intervention and favoring private initiatives, especially through: an overhaul of the public employment sector, a "radical change" in the state's shareholdings in industry, privatizations and so-called fiscal federalism. Labor -- Unemployment is "the real problem," according to the League, which is pushing for more flexible working hours. Fiscal federalism -- The two key elements of this catchword platform are giving regional administrations total freedom in setting local taxes and giving the same administrations spending responsibility, in accordance with revenues. The League also wants a reduction in personal income taxes and the total number of taxes and simpler fiscal procedures. Industrial policy -- A "clear distinction" must be made, according to the League, between "development in the north and development in the south." The foundation of Italian industry must remain small- and medium-sized businesses, which must be helped grow by forming consortiums. Immigration -- More restrictive legislation must replace existing laws that, according to the League's thinking, make it too easy for foreigners to enter the country and obtain residence permits. Immigration must be stopped and foreigners (presumably from Third World countries) must be allowed to enter only if they have work permits. Social Security -- The League wants to set up a regional pension system and wants pensions to be calculated according to individual payments. The South -- The League wants all state aid to the poorer Mezzogiorno [southern] regions stopped and development of a region's resources to be commensurate with a drop in the crime rate. Education -- Authority must be taken from the ministry and given to the regions, with the central government responsible only for coordinating the national Conference of regional authorities. Justice -- The judiciary must stand in the middle ground "between the state and society," the program states, adding that trials must no longer be led by more than one judge. Defense -- The Armed Forces must be overhauled and the present draft system must be replaced with a mixed volunteer-draftee Army. Spending must be reduced and investments increased for the volunteer Army and technological updating. Mass media -- The League wants changes mostly in television and wants to privatize the public network, RAI. "Clear" rules must be made "to protect both broadcasters and citizens." Healthcare -- Regions must be given full autonomy, including in running hospitals, and general family practitioners must be given a larger role in the system.
