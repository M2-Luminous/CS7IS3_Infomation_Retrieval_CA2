"We have learned that the 21 civilians are confined at the Cerro Hueco prison, unfairly charged with being members of our army; furthermore the EZLN leadership hereby declares that none of its members are currently in any of the country's prisons," the rebel Subcommander Marcos stated. In a communique signed by the subcommander published today by some morning newspapers in the State of Chiapas, southeastern Mexico, the EZLN insists that it has verified its list of fighters and the names of the persons currently in prison do not appear on the list. The 21 civilians were taken prisoner on 2 January, during the armed clashes between the Army and the rebels. In addition, they were all charged with being EZLN members, accusations which they have all repeatedly denied. Since last week, the civilians detained at the Cerro Hueco prison near Tuxtla Gutierrez began a hunger strike demanding that the charges be withdrawn and they be released. The civilians are also demanding an investigation and that penalties be imposed on a group of soldiers who, according to the prisoners, proceeded to beat them, tied their hands and feet, and held them isolated and without food for several days before throwing them in jail. According to Marcos "to continue holding these innocent persons in jail is an obstacle to continuing the peace process and dialogue with the federal government." Finally, Marcos indicated that the EZLN believes that with these detentions "there is a clear intention to cover up arbitrary actions in the indiscriminate arrest of civilians during the conflict and accusing them, without any basis whatsoever, of being members of our army."
