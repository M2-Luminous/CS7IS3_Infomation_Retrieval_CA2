Negotiations aimed at drafting a sectorial code for aviation will continue for a year. The various subsidy systems are at the heart of the conflict between the Europeans and the Americans. For airplanes with a capacity of more than 100 passengers, the 1992 U.S.-European accord should still apply, at least until the spring of 1995. It limits direct aid (the Community system) to 33 percent of development costs and indirect aid (the U.S. system) to 4 percent of the turnover total. A new accord is supposed to be signed in April 1994, to take effect one year later. It will also pertain to small aircraft and engines. If, after a year, the negotiations have failed, the aviation sector will be integrated in the General Subsidies Code (as defined by the GATT), with modifications to take the specific characteristics of the sector into account. One of the solutions conceived by the major European construction enterprises with regard to adapting to GATT calls for nothing less and nothing more than adopting a subsidies code close to that used by the Americans. Indirect aid (via NASA or the Department of Defense) is difficult to quantify, unlike the direct aid provided in Europe in the form of reimbursable advances. In addition, the civilian aircraft manufacturers in America benefit greatly from the research carried out within a military context, which is not affected by the GATT. This is the case regarding the development of engines, in particular. But differences on the position that should be supported emerged in connection with the manufacturers of small aircraft, equipment, and engines. Another controversial subject is the structure of sales. According to Yves Michot, the director general of Aerospatiale, orders placed by the American government administration and agencies account for 70 percent of the turnover totals of the aviation firms on the other side of the Atlantic, with the remaining 30 percent representing sales to the private sector, either on the domestic market or for export. In France, the proportion is exactly the reverse, so that to achieve the same result, the budget of the Ministry of Defense alone would have to be quadrupled. The only advantage the European industrialists see in the possibility of an agreement in the aeronautics sector that would be integrated into the GATT is that the reimbursable support by the European nations to their industries, which has been the subject of constant litigation with the Americans, would be legitimized. These advances could not be demanded in the event of a failure of the program involved.
