Trujillo said: We have asked companies to inventory their losses. We can anticipate that the economic losses exceed $200 million. Many cities did not have communications for over one week during the strike staged by the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, Conaie, to protest the recent approval of the agrarian reforms law. The blockade caused lack of food supplies in some cities and it led to clashes between demonstrators and residents who were affected by the blockade. As a result of these clashes, four people were killed and 10 were wounded. Trujillo says there is concern among businessmen about the losses they have sustained. We want to make sure the country has the necessary guarantees to allow the companies to operate, he said. President Sixto Duran Ballen, who declared a state of military emergency on Tuesday to quell the Indian demonstrations, said the Army will stay on the streets. We will maintain troop mobilization as long as necessary, Duran Ballen told newsmen. Duran Ballen said that the Army reopened highways where many people were trapped for several days and that the public forces had truly reestablished the flow of vehicles. The president said it is necessary to maintain the state of militarization because of the threat by several organizations joining the Indian movement. The president said that other organizations had announced strikes in support of the Indians. The country's largest labor organization has called for a general 24-hour strike this coming Tuesday to support the Indian protest movement. The United Workers Front, FUT, called a strike to demand that the government meet the demands of the workers, the Indians, and peasants. A FUT communique says it demands the repeal of the agrarian law, among a list of demands to improve the living standards of the people. President Sixto Duran Ballen said the law cannot be repealed, because it was approved by the executive and legislative branches jointly and its elimination would leave all agricultural activities without a regulation framework. Conaie President Luis Macas said the Indian organizations will continue to protest the new law, which they consider harmful to their interests. According to several Indian organizations, the new law eliminates agrarian reform achievements and authorizes the government to confiscate properties currently held by Indian to turn them over to wealthy landlords.
