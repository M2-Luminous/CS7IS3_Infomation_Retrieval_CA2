FR940720-2-00081 FR940720-2-00068 If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above date.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d).

Arizona Public Service Company, et al., Docket Nos. STN 50&hyph;528, STN 50&hyph;529, and STN 50&hyph;530, Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (PVNGS), Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3, Maricopa County, Arizona Date of amendment requests: June 17, 1994. Description of amendment requests: The proposed changes would enhance the PVNGS technical specifications (TS) by removing five tables of component lists in accordance with NRC Generic Letter (GL) 91&hyph;08, ``Removal of Component Lists from Technical Specifications.'' The affected tables are 3.3&hyph;9B, 3.3&hyph;9C, 3.6&hyph;1, 3.8&hyph;2, and 3.8&hyph;3. The references to these five tables will also be removed from the text of the TS in accordance with the sample TS change amendment provided by the NRC in GL 91&hyph;08. These five removed tables will be incorporated into a new document, which will be administratively controlled according to the change controls provisions of the TS. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Standard 1_ Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated: The proposed amendment will remove five tables of component lists from the TS and add them to an administratively controlled document which is subject to the change controls provisions of the TS. The new location of the affected component lists is easily retrievable. The existing TS requirements and those components to which they apply are not altered by this TS amendment. There are no changes to the operations, maintenance, surveillance, and/or qualification of any component on the removed lists. Therefore, the probability of occurrence and the consequences of any previously evaluated accident is [sic] not changed. Standard 2_ Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated: The TS requirements and the components to which they apply are not altered by this amendment. The removed component lists are added to a controlled and easily retrievable document. This amendment has no impact on plant operations, maintenance, testing, or component qualification. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created by this amendment. Standard 3_ Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety: The removal of these five component lists from the TS does not alter existing TS requirements or those components to which they apply. These lists will be added to an administratively controlled document which is subject to the controls provisions of the TS. More specifically, there is no impact on safe plant shutdown, maintenance or hot standby, containment isolation capability, containment leakage rate, and/or the operability of safety related valves. Therefore, removal of these five component lists from the TS will not involve a reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration.
