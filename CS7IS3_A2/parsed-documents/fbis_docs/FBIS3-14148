A short while ago, Jordanian-U.S. talks began at the Prime Ministry following the arrival in Amman of the U.S. coordinator of the Arab-Israel talks, who began a brief visit to Jordan as part of a regional tour. The Jordanian side, which is chaired by Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, includes Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani, Finance Minister Sami Gammuh, the deputy chairman of the Jordanian delegation to the peace talks, a number of advisers, and the members of the Jordanian side to the peace talks. The U.S. side, which is chaired by Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of the peace process includes members of the U.S. delegation and the U.S. ambassador in Amman. Ross' regional tour aims at reviving the Arab-Israeli talks, which were suspended by the Arab parties involved in the peace talks. Observers also believe that Ross will seek to explain the recent American stand vis-a-vis the Security Council resolution and U.S. abstention from voting in favor of some of its paragraphs. Ross, who arrived in Amman this evening, was received by Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani and the U.S. ambassador in Amman. [end recording]
