It asserts that the treaty has strengthened many common features between the two fraternal countries, thus unifying their paths and objectives. AL-BA'TH adds: Among these features is the need for a joint confrontation of the Israeli occupation and ambitions. Both countries have pledged to continue coordination and consultations in order to liberate southern Lebanon and the Golan. This has been obvious since the launching of the peace process. Both Syria and Lebanon proved that any attempt to single out any party was doomed to failure because the leadership and people in Syria and Lebanon are fully convinced that what harms ones side will also harm the other. AL-BA'TH asserts that the executive measures of the coordination and cooperation treaty have created much popular satisfaction, especially after the recently announced measures to facilitate movement at the Syrian-Lebanese border. The paper says this step will undoubtedly consolidate the ties between the citizens of the one people in the two countries.
