(e) Monitoring long-term requirements._ (1) Owner-occupied housing._ (i) Initial certification. At the time a household enters into a purchase contract for an AHP-assisted housing unit or at the closing on the financing for such unit, or at the time a household that already owns a housing unit receives a commitment of a loan or a grant pursuant to the AHP, the Bank or its designee shall obtain a certification from the sponsor, as required under §960.15(c)(1)(i), that the household has an income at or below the level committed to in the AHP application. (ii) Monitoring after initial sale. (A) During the required long-term period applicable to an owner-occupied housing unit assisted by a grant provided under the AHP, the Bank or its designee shall monitor the unit to determine whether it has been sold to a household with an income that exceeds the level committed to in the AHP application. (B) Monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, periodic review of relevant reports or certifications obtained from the sponsor, including reports and certifications received pursuant to §960.15(c)(1)(ii) and, at least on a sample basis, periodic review of land title records at intervals to be determined by the Bank, based on the amount of funds received by the project pursuant to the AHP, the type and complexity of the project, or other factors deemed relevant by the Bank. (2) Rental housing._ (i) Restriction on transfer. The Bank shall require an AHP-assisted rental housing project to be subject to a deed restriction or other legally enforceable mechanism which requires that upon sale of the project prior to the end of the long-term period during which the project's rental units, or portion thereof, must remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application, the Bank or its designee receives notice of the sale, and: (A) The project's rental units, or portion thereof, must continue to be affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application for the remainder of the long-term period committed to in the AHP application, and the purchaser agrees to be subject to the same restrictions on resale that applied to the seller; or (B) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, and if the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the seller must repay the grant as provided in §960.16(d)(1); or (C) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, and if the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the applicant which in turn provided a below market rate loan to the seller, then the provisions of §960.16(d)(2) shall apply. (ii) Initial certification. Upon initial full occupancy of the units in an AHP-assisted rental housing project, or one year after initial disbursement of the subsidized advance or direct subsidy, whichever occurs first, the Bank or its designee shall obtain a certification from the sponsor or the owner, as required under §960.15(c)(2), that the project's units, or portion thereof, are affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at initial occupancy at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application. (iii) Monitoring after initial occupancy. (A) During the long-term period for which the units, or portion thereof, of an AHP-assisted rental housing project must remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application, the Bank or its designee shall monitor the project to determine whether the project's units, or portion thereof, remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application. (B) Monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, periodic review of relevant household income and rent reports or certifications obtained from the sponsor or the owner, including certifications received pursuant to §960.15(c)(2) and, at least on a sample basis, periodic inspections of the project at intervals to be determined by the Bank, based on the amount of funds received by the project pursuant to the AHP, the type and complexity of the project, or other factors deemed relevant by the Bank. (f) Monitoring compliance with the special needs priority. If an applicant in its AHP application commits to fund a housing project that will address a special need pursuant to §960.10(d)(3), either through providing units for persons with a special need, or through providing a special service for occupants, as defined in the Banks AHP implementation plan: (1) The Bank or its designee shall obtain a certification from the sponsor or owner upon completion and occupancy of the project, as required under §960.15(c)(3), that the project's units, or portion thereof, are occupied by persons with such special need, as committed to in the AHP application, or that a special service is being provided, as committed to in the AHP application; and (2) In the case of a special service being provided pursuant to §960.10(d)(3), the Bank or its designee shall monitor the project, as determined by the Bank in its AHP implementation plan, for at least one year from the date of initial full occupancy of the project, to verify that such special service continues to be provided to the households, as committed to in the AHP application. (g) Monitoring compliance with the District Bank priority or priorities. (1) If an applicant in its AHP application commits to fund a project that meets a District Bank priority or priorities established by the Bank pursuant to §960.10(d)(4), the Bank or its designee shall monitor the project to verify that it continues to meet the Bank priority or priorities.
