Bin-Ghalbun said: "Since that group broke away there have been voices calling for prudence and trying to dissuade this group from its plan under the pretext of unity, claiming that splits weaken the unity of ranks and serve the interests of the regime only. But that is untrue, because the split is prompted by the care for national interests and aimed at correcting and strengthening the moderate national line." He expressed his hope that "the new organization will become one of the active and strong Libyan organizations. I know some of the men responsible for its establishment, management, and guidance. They are capable of shouldering the responsibility and are experienced and knowledgeable and their national commitment and sincerity are above all suspicion." [passage omitted]
