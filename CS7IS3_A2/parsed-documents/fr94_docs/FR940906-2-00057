FR940906-2-00057 FR940906-2-00049 A contractor's performance is evaluated against each applicable standard in the Program Requirements criterion. Each contractor must certify that all information submitted to HCFA related to CPEP, including without limitation all records, reports, files, papers and other information, whether in written, electronic, or other form, are accurate and complete to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief. A contractor will also be required to certify that its files, records, documents, and data have not been manipulated or falsified in an effort to receive a more favorable performance evaluation. A contractor must further certify that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the contractor has submitted, without withholding any relevant information, all information required to be submitted with respect to CPEP under the authority of applicable law(s), regulation(s), contracts, or HCFA manual provision(s). Any contractor that makes a false, fictitious, or fraudulent certification may be subject to criminal and/or civil prosecution, as well as appropriate administrative action. Such administrative action may include debarment or suspension of the contractor, as well as the termination or nonrenewal of a contract. If a contractor meets the level of performance required by operational instructions, it meets the requirements of that standard. Any performance measured below basic operational expectations constitutes a deficiency. The contractor may be required to develop and implement a corrective action plan when performance problems are identified. The contractor will be monitored to assure effective and efficient compliance with the corrective action plan and improved performance where standards are not met. A contractor's performance is assessed under the Process Improvement criterion to determine the success of the improvements developed and/or implemented by the contractor during the review period. A contractor's performance is similarly assessed under the Customer Satisfaction criterion to determine the degree to which the contractor has satisfied its customers. The results of performance evaluations and assessments under all three criteria will be used for contract management activities and will be published in the contractor's annual performance report. We may initiate administrative actions as a result of the evaluation of contractor performance based on these performance criteria and standards. Under sections 1816 and 1842 of the Act, we consider the results of the evaluation in our determinations on: •Entering into, renewing, or terminating agreements or contracts with contractors; and •Decisions concerning other contract actions for intermediaries and carriers (such as deletion of an automatic renewal clause). These decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and depend primarily on the nature and degree of performance. More specifically, they depend on: _Relative overall performance compared to other contractors; _Number of standards in which deficient performance occurs; _Extent of each deficiency;
