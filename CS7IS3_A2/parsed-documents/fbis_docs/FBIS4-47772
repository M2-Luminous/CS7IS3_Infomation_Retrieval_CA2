In a vain attempt to fulfill their dream of occupying the city of N'dalatando, the Luanda war chieftains chose to reinforce their forces with more mercenaries along the Dondo-N'dalatando axis. Fighting intensified when the forces of the Luanda regime tried to move in the direction of the coveted city of N'dalatando and it was especially fierce in the area of the bridge over Lucala II River, where the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] left 63 soldiers confirmed killed on the ground. Our forces also captured two (?VHS) two-way radios, 44 AK-47 weapons, one rocket launcher, and countless rounds of ammunition. The Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel correspondent in the area reports the fighting occurred in a very closed area, which explains why all the captured war materiel is not yet in the hands of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] which are, however, continuing their searches. Mercenaries were clearly taking part in the fighting. Several FALA soldiers have told Firmino Lucamba, our correspondent in N'dalatando, that they saw many men with painted faces in the FAPLA ranks. Meanwhile, the infantry was made to pay the price of that adventure. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] air force dropped bombs which claimed innocent civilian lives. Firmino Lukamba reports that the MPLA-PT air force daily carried out eight raids on the villages of Cuanza Norte Province. Many people lost their lives in an MPLA-PT air raid yesterday morning, but it was only possible to confirm that 12-year-old Rosa Fernanda and 11-year-old Fatima Diogo had been wounded. It is worth noting that Fatima Diogo lost her parents in the course of the MPLA- PT air raid. [passage omitted]
