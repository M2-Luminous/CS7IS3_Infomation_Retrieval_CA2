A MILLIYET correspondent has been informed that the security forces know that several PKK militants crossed into Iran after being pressed down by the military forces' operations carried out in the Agri and Tendurek Mountains over the past four months. Acting on that information, the Internal Affairs Ministry officials asked their Iranian counterparts to establish a "control line" [kontrol hatti] in the region. Earlier, the Iranian Administration promised to support Turkey's struggle against the PKK. This promise was made during the joint security committee meetings between the two countries. Considering Turkey's request, Iran transferred four battalions to an area in the vicinity of the Agri and Tendurek Mountains to maintain security along the border between the two countries 10 days ago. The officials disclosed that the measures taken by the Iranian military forces along the border have prevented the PKK groups, which have sustained severe blows in the mountainous region, from crossing into Iran. A high-ranking official said Iran's support was very important for the "mop up" operations. He asserted: "Iran's transfer of troops to the operations zone was a second gesture by that country. That is an indication that the relations between the two countries on security matters are improving." It should be recalled that Iran arrested a group of PKK militants and handed them over to Turkey some time ago.
