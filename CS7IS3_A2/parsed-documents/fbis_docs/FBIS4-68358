They include Ivan Grachev, who was for several years the head of the Power of the People parliamentary faction of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan. But the change in status does not, of course, mean that this politician is no longer interested in problems of a republic scale. He frequently travels to Kazan and coordinates, as before, the activity of the Equality and Legality election bloc. Our correspondent met with Grachev on the first day of business of the present session of the Republic of Tatarstan and put several questions to him. [Grigorenko] Ivan Dmitriyevich, how would you evaluate the present session? [Grachev] Quite a standard session, nothing new or interesting. I have a negative view of the budget message of the president of Tatarstan. In what way, for example, does a feudal state differ from a democratic one? In the first the ruler distributes the requisitions from various classes at his discretion, in the second, the collected taxes are transferred to the representative authority, which determines the rules of their expenditure and monitors all outlays. I know from personal experience that the deputies of Tatarstan had no opportunity to exercise supervision of budget funds and the actual income from the republic's foreign economic activity or to influence the distribution of taxes. The real structure of the budget is now as follows: for the needs of the agro-industrial complex, up to 70 percent of all investments in the national economy, and for the development of "defense," which is the future of the Republic of Tatarstan, only two percent. This imbalance is unfair to the urban electorate and is fraught with the danger of a surge of unemployment and the destitution of many thousands of inhabitants of the republic. Even today we need to be creating new jobs in the cities of Tatarstan and to be seeking options for support of the "locomotives"--the most active industrial enterprises. All this will require much material expenditure because nothing comes free. The well-known saying: "The skinflint pays twice," should not be forgotten. [Grigorenko] What step, in your view, should the corps of deputies take? [Grachev] It would be expedient to vote down the proposed budget for approximately a month. Within this time a working group composed of people's deputies, members of the government, and businessmen would examine the most serious problems. I refer primarily to an easing of the tax burden, which is far higher in the Republic of Tatarstan than in the Russian Federation. Thus at industrial enterprises of Russia there are per R1 of profit an average of R1.4 direct and indirect taxes, in our republic, R1.7. Were it possible to find a solution that would make it possible to lower certain types of taxes, many municipal structures and industrial enterprises would have a pretty good chance of development. [Grigorenko] Lately, information has been heard from various sources that the Government of Tatarstan will very shortly be forced to resign or, at least, undergo significant personnel changes. How do you view this prospect? [Grachev] The members of Power of the People do not intend to vote for the resignation of Prime Minister M. Sabirov. I am convinced that for the reform of the managerial structures a transitional period, in which it is necessary to preserve stability and set about the reforms in earnest, is essential. Mukhammat Sabirov is coping successfully with the first task, and the accomplishment of the second is not, from our viewpoint, confined merely to this candidate. The opposition is opposed to revolutionary changes in the government. Let the team that is there now maintain economic stability in the republic. And a market managerial structure imbibing more and more powers should grow and gradually strengthen. [Grigorenko] What, in your view, is the political situation in Tatarstan? [Grachev] It is developing in the right direction. The fact that more than 30 parties and blocs are operating in the Russian Federation at this time is of little use, in my opinion. A two- or three-party political system may be considered suited to regulation of the economy. A favorable situation is taking shape here in Tatarstan in this sense. We have the Equality and Legality bloc, the party of the nomenklatura, Unity and Progress, the national political organizations, the communists, who will, most likely, "degenerate" into social democrats.... Ultimately a three-party system will be formed in the republic, and the electorate will know precisely at the next elections for whom to vote. [Grigorenko] Judging by foreign press reports, the rating of the leader of the Yabloko bloc has begun to grow once again. Among the candidates for the office of president in the not-too-distant future experts put Grigoriy Yavlinskiy second after Viktor Chernomyrdin.... [Grachev] From the viewpoint of personal image the leader of our bloc could lay claim to first place also. But, as practice has shown, an excellently organized team, which gathers all the necessary information, distributes leaflets, and performs precisely many other assignments, is also needed for the achievement of complete success. It is this election machine that Yabloko lacks. I am prepared to help Yavlinskiy create it. [Grigorenko] May the suppositions of certain of the capital's journalists that the president will necessarily acquire such allies as the Russia's Choice and Yabloko blocs be considered objective? [Grachev] There need be no doubt about Russia's Choice, but close interaction with the Yabloko bloc with a normal development of events is unlikely. The situation could change only in the event of a powerful showing of the Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov factions. As far as my personal opinion is concerned, Yeltsin should not run in the next elections: he has already honorably done all that he was supposed to have done. Of course, the president's entourage could play a part. These people are no longer in a position, evidently, to nominate a new leader and for this reason are prepared to instill in Boris Nikolayevich the idea of the need to take part in the elections once again. [Grigorenko] There are stories in Moscow about the fine life of deputies of the State Duma. A few words about how your daily routine is arranged and whether normal conditions for work have been created. [Grachev] I am staying in a hotel and I have been promised an official apartment at the end of summer. I can summon a car, although I am successful here far from always. But, like other deputies of the State Duma, I am most depressed by the fact that practically none of us has his own work place. It is not even a question of the lack of an office but of an ordinary writing desk in the parliament building.
