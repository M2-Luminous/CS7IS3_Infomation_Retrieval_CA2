The speaker, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri also said the enemies of Islam were seriously concerned about the revival of Islamic movements in the remotest parts of the world and even in Europe. He said the utterance of the word, Allah and the phrase Allaho Akbar (There is no god but Allah) is considered an offense by the global arrogance and that any body who abides by Islamic laws will be the target of U.S. propaganda ad military attacks. "It is for this very reason that we now see enemies of Islam committing crimes against Muslims including women and children in every part of Islamic lands," he said. Nateq-Nuri also warned that the U.S. was trying to prevent Muslims from getting united and engage them in internal problems in a bid to contain the spread of Islam. "Muslims should seriously avoid discord, settle their differences by themselves and not allow foreigners to interfere in their internal affairs," he advised. The unity between Shiites and Sunnis has been materialized in Iran for years, he said, adding "we appeal to world Muslims to follow the pattern of unity and sincerity between their Shiite and Sunni brothers in Iran." Addressing Pakistani ulama, the Majlis speaker said the zealot Islamic groups who sow discord among Muslims are certainly against their interests.
