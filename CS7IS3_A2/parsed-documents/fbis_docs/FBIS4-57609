The U.S. Government has proposed -- without success -- that Latin American and Caribbean countries participate in a multinational force designed to invade Haiti and oust the military from power, according to a report in the Mexican newspaper EXCELSIOR, which claims that it holds diplomatic documents proving its statement. The newspaper says the U.S. State Department is sounding out the willingness in Latin America and the Caribbean to participate in an armed operation against the military regime in place in Haiti since 1991. The article, signed by Jose Manuel Neva, EXCELSIOR Washington correspondent, points out that the government of President Bill Clinton has failed in its attempts to convince countries to use force, except for the Governments of Argentina, Uruguay, and the English-speaking Caribbean countries that support the U.S. initiative. The article points out that on 12 May, acting Secretary of State Strobe Talbott gathered the Latin American and Caribbean diplomatic corps accredited to the White House and the OAS to sound out their participation in an invasion force. Quoting reliable sources, Neva says this is one of the three options being considered by the Clinton administration for a way out of the Haitian crisis. The other is the formation of a force of Haitian refugees, and the third -- which is the least feasible -- is a U.S. unilateral intervention. Private consultations also took place on the same topic [words indistinct] other allies within the United Nations, especially in the configuration and specific mandate of an intervention force.
