FR940816-1-00021 FR940816-1-00007 a. Current actual and allowable emissions inventories that meet EPA guidelines 11 (see section VI.D. below). 11 ``PM&hyph;10 Emission Inventory Requirements,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;93&hyph;XX, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC, 1993. b. Submission of a SIP, under section 189(b)(1)(A), that includes a demonstration that the plan provides for attainment by the applicable attainment date (December 31, 2001 for the areas initially designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 by operation of law under section 107(d)(4) and no later than the end of the tenth year beginning after the area's redesignation for areas subsequently redesignated nonattainment), or a demonstration that attainment by the above date is not practicable and that the plan provides for attainment by the most expeditious alternative date practicable. 12 12 Subsequent to adopting requirements for BACM shortly after the nonattainment area is reclassified as serious, it may be necessary for the State to adopt additional control measures in order to demonstrate that the SIP provides for attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in accordance with section 189(b)(1)(A)(i). If the State demonstrates, in accordance with section 189(b)(1)(A)(ii), that attainment by the applicable serious area attainment date is impracticable and seeks an extension of the attainment date pursuant to section 188(e), the State must demonstrate to the best of its ability that the plan for the area includes the most stringent measures that are included in the implementation plan of any State or are achieved in practice in any State, and can be feasibly implemented in the area. c. Provisions, under section 189(b)(1)(B), to assure that BACM (including BACT) will be implemented no later than 4 years after the area is reclassified as serious. d. A requirement, under section 189(b)(3), that the terms ``major source'' and ``major stationary source,'' used in implementing a new source permitting program under section 173 and control of PM&hyph;10 precursors under section 189(e), include any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits, or has the potential to emit, at least 70 tons per year of PM&hyph;10. e. Contingency measures 13 (see section VII. below). 13 Contingency measures are other available control measures, in addition to those in the control strategy to attain the NAAQS, that can be implemented if EPA determines the area fails to make reasonable further progress or to attain the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date [see section 172(c)(9)). f. Quantitative milestones, (applicable to both moderate and serious area SIP's under section 189(c)), which are to be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment, and which demonstrate RFP toward attainment by the applicable date. The provision includes a requirement for periodic reports demonstrating whether the milestones have been met (see section VIII. below). g. Plan revisions which provide for attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS and annual reductions of not less than 5 percent of inventoried PM&hyph;10 and PM&hyph;10 precursor emissions within the area, under section 189(d), if the serious area fails to attain the standards.
