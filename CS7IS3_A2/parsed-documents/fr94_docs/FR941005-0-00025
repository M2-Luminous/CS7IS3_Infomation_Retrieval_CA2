FR941005-0-00025 FR941005-0-00010 2. The standard PRR for rockfish fillets/no skin (code 22) is changed from 0.35 to 0.33, and the standard PRR for sculpins, headed & gutted with roe (code 4) is changed from 0.88 to 0.87. These changes are insignificant and are made to reflect information contained in the literature for these product types. 3. A standard PRR for pollock surimi of 0.14 was proposed. That rate does not reflect seasonal variations experienced in this product. Seasonal variations are caused by changes in the physical condition of pollock flesh during the spawning season. This season generally occurs from January through June, followed by a recuperation period. Starting in July, the condition of pollock flesh improves, becoming optimum during the late summer months. For this reason, the BSAI pollock non-roe season was changed by regulation from June 1 to August 15, beginning in 1993. To investigate seasonal differences in pollock products, NMFS reviewed data from the 1993 pollock roe and non-roe seasons, which occurred January 20&hyph;March 8 and August 15&hyph;September 22, respectively, for the ``offshore component.'' NMFS also reviewed data from the ``offshore component'' from the 1994 pollock roe season, which occurred January 20&hyph;February 18. These data contained estimates of total retained pollock catches as reported by NMFS observers and amounts of surimi produced from the retained pollock as reported by vessels. During the 1993 roe season, 20,934 metric tons (mt) of surimi were produced from a retained pollock catch of 134,558 mt resulting in a average PRR of 0.155. During the 1994 roe season, 23,267 mt of surimi were produced from a retained pollock catch of 144,134 mt, resulting in an average recovery rate of 0.161. During the non-roe season, 29,878 mt of surimi were produced from a retained pollock catch of 171,320 mt, resulting in an average recovery rate of 0.17. From these data, NMFS has determined that sufficient information exists to demonstrate seasonal differences in surimi recovery rates. Therefore, NMFS is establishing a standard PRR of 0.16 for the period January through June and a standard PRR of 0.17 for the period July through December. 4. The standard PRR for pollock skinless/boneless fillets (product code 23) is revised from 0.22 to 0.21. This revision is based on results of recovery tests conducted by NMFS observers. 5. The target species category ``flathead sole'' had been proposed to be referenced in ยง675.20(a), which was an error. It is now correctly referenced in ยง672.20(a). 6. The target species category ``other flatfish'' had been proposed to be referenced in ยง672.20(a), which was an error. It is now correctly referenced in ยง675.20(a). 7. The standard PRR for Atka mackerel, headed and gutted western cut (code 7) is changed from 0.61 to 0.64, and the standard PRR for Atka mackerel, headed & gutted eastern cut (code 8) is changed from 0.64 to 0.61 to correct a transposition error in the proposed rule. 8. The product codes 95 for discards and 99 for dockside discards have been removed, because they serve no useful purpose.
