No. 91&hyph;240] RIN 2120&hyph;AD75 Temporary Restriction of Instrument Approaches and Certain Visual Flight Rules Operations in High Barometric Weather Conditions agency: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. action: Final rule; correction. summary: On April 12, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a final rule amending the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) governing temporary flight restrictions (59 FR 17450; April 12, 1994). This action corrects an error concerning the intended placement within the FAR of the new section governing temporary restrictions of instrument approaches and certain visual flight rules operations in high barometric weather conditions by creating a new §91.144 and deleting §91.92. effective date: May 12, 1994. for further information contact: Larry Youngblut, Regulations Branch (AFS&hyph;240), Flight Standards Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20591, Telephone: (202) 267&hyph;3755. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On April 12, 1994, the FAA issued a final rule amending the FAR governing temporary flight restrictions (59 FR 17450; April 12, 1994; Federal Register Document 94&hyph;8775) by adding §91.92. The FAA intended to put the new section with other regulations governing temporary flight restrictions. However, §§91.27 through 91.99 are reserved. Other flight restrictions are contained in §§91.137 through 91.143. This action corrects the error by redesignating §91.92 as new §91.144. This document corrects the preamble to the final rule published on April 12, 1994 (59 FR 174501) by replacing every reference to §91.92 with the new §91.144. Accordingly, the Federal Register document FR Doc. 94&hyph;8775, which was published on April 12, 1994, at 59 FR 17450, is corrected as follows: PART 91_[CORRECTED] On page 17452 in the third column, in amendatory instruction 2, §91.92 should be correctly designated as §91.144, and the section heading is correctly added to read as follows: 2. Section 91.144 is added to read as follows: §91.144 Temporary restriction on flight operations during abnormally high barometric pressure condition. * * * * * Issued in Washington, DC on July 19, 1994.
