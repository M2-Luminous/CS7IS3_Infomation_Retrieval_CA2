FR940616-2-00006 FR940616-2-00004 The cumulative impacts associated with this uncertain scenario were identified in the original FEIR. The EIS/SEIR will consider this potential scenario and alternatives to it in the alternatives analysis section of the document. Project Alternatives Possible alternatives to the project would include: 0 ␣No action or not constructing the pipeline. 0 ␣Any reasonable project that can achieve the objectives of the Proposed Action, with lower overall impacts to the environment. 0 ␣Route alternatives identified as a result of project scoping. Supplementary Information A number of documents providing general information about the ANF have already been issued. These documents include the ANF Land and Resources Management Plan, FEIS and Record of Decision. These documents allow, under certain conditions, the issuance of special use permits for pipelines. Because of the magnitude of the changes made to the project and its potential significant impacts on the environment, an initial study was not prepared. The originally submitted and newly amended PEAs provided by PPSI in its Application, as well as the Pacific Pipeline FEIR and Executive Summary were used to determine the need for the EIS. These documents are available for review at the following locations: California Public Utilities Commission (L.A.

Thus, the Applicant will require right-of-way authorization and special use permits from the ANF. In order to consider issuance of these permits, and based on potential impacts identified in the Applicant's PEA, ANF will prepare an EIS pursuant to NEPA requirements. The Draft EIS (DEIS) is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and should be available for public review by November of 1994. At that time, the EPA will publish a notice of availability of the DEIS in the Federal Register . The comment period on the DEIS will be 60 days from the date the EPA's notice appears in the Federal Register . The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of the DEIS must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC , 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of the Final EIS (FEIS), Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris 490 F. Supp. 1334 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the comment period so that the substantive comments and objectives are made available to the Forest Service. This is to ensure that substantive comments and objections are made available when the USFS can meaningfully respond to them in the FEIS. Comments on the DEIS should be specific and should address the adequacy of the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed (see The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA at 40 CFR 1503.3). It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the DEIS. After the end of the DEIS comment period, comments will be analyzed and considered by the USFS in preparing the FEIS. The FEIS is scheduled to be completed by April of 1995. In the FEIS the Forest Service is required to respond to the comments received (40 CFR 1503.4). The responsible official (Mike Rogers, Forest Supervisor, ANF, Arcadia, CA) will consider the comments, responses, environmental consequences discussed in the EIS, and applicable laws, regulations and policies in making a decision regarding this proposal. The responsible official will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to appeal under 36 CFR part 215. Proposed Scope of the EIS/SEIR The EIS/SEIR will present the analysis of the environmental impacts of the proposed Pacific Pipeline Project and comparative environmental effects of the alternatives, and will identify mitigation measures for potentially significant impacts. The EIS will address the Project from Emidio to the Ultramar refinery in Wilmington. However, for the segment from Castaic to Texaco's Wilmington refinery the EIS will, primarily, rely on the existing FEIR. The joint document will contain a separate section in which the conclusions stated in the FEIR will be summarized. The potential for construction and operation of the segment of the project which was previously proposed between Santa Barbara and Castaic Junction will be considered in the alternatives analysis section of the document. The EIS/SEIR will address all issue areas for which potential significant impacts are anticipated. These issue areas include: 0 ␣Air Quality. Construction and operation emissions and effects. 0 ␣Biological Resources. Effects on native habitats that support rare, threatened, or endangered species; impacts on sensitive habitats or species downslope from the ROW as a result of sedimentation or erosion; damage to native plant habitats due to construction; loss of habitat due to vegetation removal; and effects of noise disturbance on nesting and foraging of wildlife species. 0 ␣Cultural Resources. Construction effects on prehistoric sites, structures, regional districts or other physical evidence associated with human activity; disturbance during erosion control program excavation, illicit artifact collection by pipeline workers and construction equipment and oil spill containment encroachment in sensitive areas; Impacts on Native American values. 0 ␣Environmental Contamination. Effects of disturbance from trench excavation to contaminated sites along the ROW on pipeline workers; migration of contaminants via surface ground water runoff; and pipeline passage through oil fields with abandoned wells. 0 ␣Geology. Slope stability and seismic impacts associated with fault rupture and liquefaction/lateral spreading; and damage to above ground structures from earthquake-induced ground shaking.
