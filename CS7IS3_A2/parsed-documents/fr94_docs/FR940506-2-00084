FR940506-2-00084 FR940506-2-00050 Analysis of Consent Order To Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from respondents Oak Hill Industries Corp., a New York corporation, and Malcolm Foster, individually and as an officer of the corporate respondent. The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order. This matter concerns the labeling and advertising of Oak Hill brand plastic plates, bowls and utensils. The Commission's complaint in this matter alleges that Oak Hill brand plastic plates, bowls and utensils are made from non-foam polystyrene; that they are packaged in thin plastic packaging which is sometimes made from polypropylene film and at other times from low-density polyethylene film; and that such plastic products and packaging do not identify the type(s) of plastic resin from which they are made. The complaint charges that Oak Hill falsely represented that the plastic plates, bowls and utensils and the plastic film packaging are recyclable. In fact, the complaint alleges, the plastic products and packaging are not recyclable, because there are only a few collection facilities nationwide that will accept non-foam polystyrene plates, bowls or utensils or the polypropylene film or low-density polyethylene film plastic packaging for recycling. The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. Part I of the proposed order requires that respondents cease and desist from misrepresenting, in any manner, directly or by implication, with respect to any product or package the extent to which it is capable of being recycled or to which recycling collection programs are available. Part I also contains a proviso that allows the respondents to advertise non-foam polystyrene, polypropylene film or low-density polyethylene film products or packages as recyclable without violating Part I of the order. The respondents may do so if they truthfully represent that such products or packages are capable of being recycled; disclose clearly, prominently and in close proximity to such claim: (a) That such product or package is recyclable in the few communities with recycling collection programs for non-foam polystyrene, polypropylene film or low-density polyethylene film; or (b) the approximate number of U.S. communities with recycling collection programs for such product or package; or (c) the approximate percentage U.S. communities or the U.S. population to which recycling collection programs for such product or package are available; and in addition, such product or package itself bears a clear identification of the specific plastic resin(s) from which it is made. Part II of the proposed order provides that if the respondents represent in advertising or labeling that any product or package offers any environmental benefit, they must have a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that substantiates the claims. The proposed order also requires respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate the claims covered by the order, to distribute copies of the order to certain company officials, to notify the Commission of any changes in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, and to file one or more reports detailing compliance with the order. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms. Donald S. Clark, Secretary.
