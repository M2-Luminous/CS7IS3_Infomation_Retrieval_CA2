He made this remark in reference to the fact the numerical targets' definition is still not clear even though Japan and the United States have agreed not to include numerical targets as an objective criteria measure in the Japan-U.S. economic talks, which are due to resume soon. He said even when the United States asks for something that comes close to numerical targets -- like a growth rate measure --, Japan will reject it at the sector-by-sector talks. Asked about the possibility that at the automobile and auto part talks, the United States might ask to set targets on the number of auto dealers, he said: "We cannot make any promise on something that is out of the government's reach."
