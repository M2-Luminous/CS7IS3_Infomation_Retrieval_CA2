FR940527-1-00193 FR940527-1-00014 2. Results We have used the actuarial model to estimate the change in payment for capital-related costs from FY 1994 to FY 1995. To show the effect of the capital prospective payment system on low capital cost hospitals and high capital cost hospitals, we are presenting separately in Table IV the results of our simulation for these hospitals. We consider a hospital to be a low capital cost hospital if, based on a comparison of its initial hospital-specific rate and the applicable Federal rate, it will be paid under the fully prospective payment methodology. A high capital cost hospital is a hospital that, based on its initial hospital-specific rate, will be paid under the hold-harmless payment methodology. Based on our actuarial model, the breakdown of hospitals is as follows: Capital Transition Payment Methodology 1Type of hospital 1Percent of hospitals 1FY 1995 percent of discharges 1FY 1995 percent of capital costs 1FY 1995 percent of capital payments Low Cost Hospital 64 59 48 50 High Cost Hospital 36 41 52 50 A low capital cost hospital may request to have its hospital-specific rate redetermined based on old capital costs in the current year, through the later of the hospital's cost reporting period beginning in FY 1994 or the first cost reporting period beginning after obligated capital comes into use (within the limits established in ยง412.302(e) for putting obligated capital in use for patient care). If the redetermined hospital-specific rate is greater than the adjusted Federal rate, these hospitals will be paid under the hold-harmless payment methodology. Regardless of whether the hospital became a hold-harmless payment hospital as a result of a redetermination, we have continued to show these hospitals as low capital cost hospitals in Table IV. Assuming no behavioral changes in capital expenditures, Table IV displays the percentage change in payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995 using the above described actuarial model.
