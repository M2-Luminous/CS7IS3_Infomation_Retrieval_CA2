The live interview with the LDP's Mori begins at 2238 GMT. When asked about the LDP's attitude toward upper house debates on the political reform bills, Mori notes the coalition government should accept the LDP's opinions on three major points of the reform bills. Mori says: "The first question is about the quota and allotment of lower house seats. Under the LDP proposal, seats of the lower house should be reduced to 471 -- 300 for single-seat constituencies and 171 for proportional representation constituency... [pauses] Second, the size of the proportional representation constituency should also be reviewed. If the proportional representation election for the lower house is conducted under a single nationwide constituency, there will be no difference in style between the upper and lower houses. Countries which have the parliamentary cabinet system and two houses cannot adopt the same election system in both houses. In this regard, we are insisting that each prefecture must have a constituency for the proportional representation election. And finally, we must provide legal control over individual politicians' fund management organizations, which have been left untouched. The coalition government says individual politicians do not have to receive money in the future, and all political donations must be concentrated to political parties. That is the ideal situation, and it may be possible to enforce the rule on Diet members. However, not all local-level politicians belong to specific parties. For example, 95 percent of mayors and governors are independent from any parties. It is impossible to take all funds from them." In response to a question asking if the LDP will seek a positive settlement of the political reform issue through the summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono, Mori says: "I have been saying that, if the ruling parties really want to enact the bills, they have to make proposals acceptable to us." Referring to the previous Hosokawa-Kono talks held immediately before the lower house's approval of the political reform bills, Mori questions Hosokawa's leadership in the coalition parties, saying: "During the previous meeting with the president, he made no compromise on major points of the bills. It may be very rude to say this, but it is questionable if he had decisionmaking authority. I think he had no decision at that time." The moderator asks Mori about the possibility of another political regrouping this year, and Mori says he thinks there is a "fifty-fifty" chance. Following Mori, Ouchi, Health and Welfare Minister who concurrently serves as chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], begins to speak at 2313 GMT. Asked if the coalition government is seeking the enactment of the political reform bills during the ongoing extraordinary Diet session without further revision, Ouchi says: "Generally speaking, that is true. If the bills are revised further in the upper house, they will again be placed under discussions in the lower house. Probably, we will not have time to do so. Under such circumstances, we are planning to enact the bills without further revision as a stopgap measure, and to discuss necessary revisions at the next ordinary Diet session. However, I personally have some questions about the appropriateness of such a methodology." In reply to a question on the DSP's future partner when the political regrouping takes place again, Ouchi says: "We will join forces with democracy-oriented parties or politicians. Also, our partners must have the completely same stance as us toward policies on Japan's fundamental systems." Regarding the possibilities of another political regrouping, Ouchi says "I am over 80 percent certain."
