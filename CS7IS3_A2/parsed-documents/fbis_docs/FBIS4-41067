As is well known, in the course of this session day packed with stormy debates and scandals not one legislative act received any reading. It would appear that the Duma expended all its creative potential on the adoption of the budget and has subsequently proved ready only for political, largely internecine, battle. Such an evolution of the country's supreme legislative organ looks particularly striking against the background of the gathering pace of the president's activity; in the course of the past week he not only completed a lightning tour of important Russian regions, but also continued the preparation and publication of a series of edicts, among which the edict on stepping up the battle against gangsterism has attracted the most attention. The Duma has not been able to deliver an intelligible response to a single one of these presidential initiatives. The compromise proposed by a number of Duma leaders -- to postpone the entry into force of the edict on combating crime until the appearance of an analogous law, which the Duma promised to adopt in two weeks -- looks unrealistic. First, the Duma has had almost six months to adopt such a law. However, instead of doing so, legislators used the lion's share of the time to prepare and adopt the law on the deputies' status and the decree on the creation of parliamentary radio and television broadcasting. The law on the budget, adopted at the second reading, in this sense looks like the exception without which, as we know, there is no rule. Second, July is the last month of the session's work. Thus deputies of the chamber have only 10 plenary sittings ahead. The timetable of legislative work has long since been disrupted, probably irreversibly. In addition, the disposition of political forces in the Duma gives no grounds for hope that a law devoted to combating organized crime can be adopted quickly enough, even if preparation of all other legislative acts is put to one side for this purpose. And, of course, factional boycotts and deputies' strikes -- which we have also witnessed over the past week -- cannot be ruled out. At the same time deficiencies in legislative activity were more than compensated for by an upsurge in aggressiveness. A number of episodes at the 17 June session put one in mind of the scenes played out at the Congresses of People's Deputies. It is insufficient to attribute this to the speaker's absence from the session, although I. Rybkin does indeed demonstrate masterly control of the Duma. But it is impossible not to focus attention on the fact that the main sources of tension in the Duma last week were by no means the representatives of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] faction, but the leaders of the nonregistered deputies' groups "12 December" and "Russia's Path." It is improbable that the roots of this activity lie exclusively in an innate sense of justice causing deputies to contend with the Duma Council, which, in their opinion, has both usurped power in the chamber and has turned into a counterpart of the old Supreme Soviet Presidium. On the contrary, it is more likely that it is a question of attempts to penetrate this leading parliamentary organ themselves by any means, including some which closely resemble blackmail. Moreover, it is hardly exclusively in order to obtain the additional benefits which registered factions and groups enjoy. Their main aim here seems to be their inclusion, as quickly as possible, in the existing system of the political establishment, and, as a consequence, their inclusion on equal terms in the political process, which is hard to describe as anything other than preparation for elections. Everything which happened in the Duma last week creates a fairly firm impression that deputies assessed the president's press conference and his legislative activity as the beginning of the election campaign. What is more, they found themselves at the same time grouped with the laggards who have lost the initiative and effectively find themselves in time trouble. After all, less and less time remains until the elections, and there are so far, alas, not many grounds to be proud of their achievements. The president's expedited legislative activity, which is taking place against the background of the Duma's poor effectiveness, the ambiguous situation over the General Prosecutor's Office, and the absence of the Constitutional Court, although it will most likely increase B. Yeltsin's popularity with the voters, could also have quite unexpected consequences. The upsetting of the balance between the the legislature and the executive in the favor of the latter can already be seen extremely clearly today. It is not hard to suppose that irate charges of usurping power will be leveled against the president in fairly short order by the State Duma. However, at the same time it would not be superfluous to remind the initiators of such charges that they themselves in their time have ignored many instruments of power under their full control. Such as, for example, the constitutional laws on the Constitutional Court, on the president, and on the elections. At least, nothing is heard today of the preparation of these legislative acts.
