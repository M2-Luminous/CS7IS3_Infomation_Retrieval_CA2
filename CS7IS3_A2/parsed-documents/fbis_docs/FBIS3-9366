Are these front lines also dividing the liberals? [Peto] These lines are borders increasingly dividing parties and groups of parties, and not trenches. The government coalition, namely the national conservative camp, is united even though, clearly in view of the election campaign, the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is trying to distance itself from the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] but it is quite cautious in this endeavor: one step forward and one step back. However, these two parties will nevertheless take voters away from each other. On the other side, we find the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] in a nonparty cooperation with the National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ], while the group of liberal parties is a separate camp. Although the SZDSZ and the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] have similar positions on basic issues, the liberal parties are also rivals in the elections. We have always started from the premise that an SZDSZ-Fidesz cooperation is in our mutual interest. The SZDSZ thinks that the positions would be weakened if the two liberal parties sought possible coalition parties separately or if the SZDSZ and the Fidesz were not in the same government or opposition camp after the elections. The present coalition parties are trying to split the liberal forces. For example, we can hear almost daily that, unlike the SZDSZ, the Fidesz could be an acceptable coalition partner for the MDF. [passage omitted] [Pinter] In your opinion, to what extent will the issue of Hungarians living beyond our borders and the religious issue affect voters' decisions? [Peto] In discussing this issue from the viewpoint of political competition, people try to present the SZDSZ in a bad light, as an insensitive and indifferent party. However, this attempt will not affect the election results. Obviously, those who continue to regard symbolic gestures as a major way of treating the issue of Hungarian minorities will not vote for the SZDSZ. We are speaking to those who are expecting deeds and who are not taken in by empty rhetoric. Obviously, those who believe that the SZDSZ is an atheist and anti-clerical party will not be SZDSZ voters. The SZDSZ attributes great importance to religious life and an important social role to the churches; at the same time, as a liberal party, the SZDSZ wants a complete separation of church and state, and does not find a possible state ideological role of the church desirable. [passage omitted] Our views regarding the national minorities have not changed. The SZDSZ is fostering close contacts with the political organizations of Hungarians living beyond our borders, and this is advantageous for everyone. [passage omitted] [Pinter] Are new elements emerging in the election campaign? [Peto] From the beginning, I have noticed manifestations of discrimination or manipulation and the abuse of government power, which violate the rules of honest political competition. However, such attempts are almost always doomed to failure, and this is reassuring. This does not harm the SZDSZ; on the contrary! However, this does harm the entire Hungarian democracy and political style. The control of the mass media, and the drama of firing journalists from Hungarian Radio are causing such serious damage to Hungarian democracy that it goes far beyond the election campaign. If a country can get into the world's press with reports of a Csurka essay or the firing of 129 radio journalists mostly for political reasons, that country becomes part of the Balkans in Western public opinion. This should draw the attention of those who constantly lecture us on national interests while they fail to consider this nation's most elementary interests. [passage omitted] [Pinter] In which areas does the SZDSZ intend to cooperate with the government and the coalition in order to maintain the ability to function? [Peto] When people were fired from the Hungarian Radio for political reasons in a deliberate violation of the law, some people in the SZDSZ proposed that we express our indignation by limiting our parliamentary activity. However, the dominant position in the SZDSZ is that we should not endanger the ability of the country and Parliament to function. Parliament should work as long as it can, because its activity is needed, and the government should also function to the last minute of its mandate. If it becomes a government party, the SZDSZ will follow the customs of developed democracies, and it will not question the obligations deriving from accepted laws, no matter what position we took in the course of the legislation. Compensation and the return of church properties will also be the task of the new government, and we will guarantee continuity in this. Of course, there are laws that we will want to change, but these changes will not make everyday life unpredictable. The SZDSZ does not want a government change accompanied by tabula rasa every four years. We have confidence in the members of the public administration, and we will not initiate any purge for political reasons. [passage omitted]
