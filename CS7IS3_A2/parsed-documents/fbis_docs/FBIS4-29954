So far, base stations have been required to obtain approval beforehand for frequency use. However, the MPT will introduce a "license system for designated comprehensive frequencies." This system will enable each base station to use all frequencies allocated to companies who own ground stations. This is one of the pillars of the deregulation measures the government's administrative reform promotion council headquarters and working group on information and communications will prepare by the end of this month. The system will take effect next January. This will enable mobile telephone companies save application fees when changing frequencies. In addition, it seems the system will also become a support measure for the Japan Mobile Telephone Company (IDO), which plans to increase its number of base stations to ease the trade frictions between Japan and the United States. It is necessary to construct more ground stations because the mobile telephone market is expanding rapidly. According to the MPT, it seems that the number of ground stations will reach 8,700, or 70 percent more than the current number, in two years. Currently, ordinary mobile telephone companies are using from 10 to 50 channels at their base stations. But, they need to increase the number of bands [denpa su] they use to ease telephone congestion. However, every time a new station is built or one station wants to increase its number of frequency bands, the current system requires the station and six to seven of its neighboring stations, which need to adjust their frequencies, to obtain approvals before making changes. Under the current system, one month or so is needed to examine applications before approval, creating obstacles to attempts to make changes to cope with the situation. Because of this, the MPT decided to introduce the new system, designed to issue licenses to enable all stations to use all frequency bands allocated to companies which own ground stations. Under the new system, the companies will no longer need to apply for approval before changing the specifications for each base station. They will only need to notify the MPT after actually making changes based on their own judgment.
