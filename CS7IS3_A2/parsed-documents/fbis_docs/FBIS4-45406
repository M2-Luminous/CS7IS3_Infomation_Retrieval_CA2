The Federal Counterintelligence Service's regional administration is spearheading the operation to expose the channels whereby this "commodity," which is new to Novgorod, gets into the area. Our correspondent interviewed Vladimir Belyasko, chief of the Economic Counterintelligence Department. Klebanova: Vladimir Mikhyalovich, this is the second time that Novgorod has become a member of the Hanseatic League [sentence as published]. Does it not seem to you that this renown will be augmented by another kind of fame--the region will appear on the sinister maps of the international drugs business? Belyaskoz: The illegal international circulation of narcotics has become a real real problem recently. According to our forecasts there is a danger that in the near future Novgorod Oblast could become a major transit point for drugs dealers. There is no actual large scale market for sales yet--the number of drug addicts numbers a little over 100. Thus the main danger is the smuggling of narcotics via Novgorod from and into Russia. That is what the evidence of the past two to three years suggests. Klebanova: Is this connected with the arrival of refugees and migrants, who bring with them not just their own culture but also vices previously unknown to the inhabitants of central Russia? Belyasko: Partly yes. But the oblast's geographical position--its proximity to Moscow and St. Petersburg and the countries of the Baltic--is far more attractive to criminal structures. In addition, the influx of foreign tourists and business people is growing. Field reports that are coming in show that some of the latter are involved in the drugs business. Unfortunately, migrants from the southern republics and Central Asia, to whom the Novgorod region has hospitably thrown open its doors, are making their own unfortunate contribution here, too. A. Proskuryakov has been convicted of distributing 32 kg of marijuana while the Filippov brothers have been imprisoned for possession of opium. Until now these drugs have been produced from growing plants but there is information to suggest that synthetic narcotics could appear in the future. Klebanova: What are the supply routes for this "commodity"? Belyasko: The means and contrivances vary, from the traditional method of the courier to methods that are utterly brazen. The "commodity" is simply sent in packages through the post to various addresses in Novgorod. Klebanova: Is it possible to draw the conclusion that there are permanent channels and "professionals" already operating in the oblast? Belyasko: No specific stable groups have been exposed yet but their signs are there. The growth of foreign economic ties makes possible the expansion of contacts and in addition to the "traditional" smuggling of raw materials and weapons the illegal shipment of narcotics across the border cannot be ruled out either. After all, it has to be borne in mind that the drugs business means the "laundering" of very large sums of money and prices for drugs are rising all the time. Klebanova: Vladimir Mikhaylovich, several large "foreign" diasporas have now formed in our country. Can you tell us who is the main bearer of this evil which is assailing the Novgorod region? I do not think that we will offend anyone's national dignity in this instance because such criminals violate not only state laws but also human and divine laws. Not just those of the Novgorod region... Belyasko: Unfortunately there have been cases in which local inhabitants have also become embroiled in this "dirty business." But in the main it is the Azerbaijanis who are involved in the drugs business. Last year joint operations were carried out with the relevant agencies from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The fact is that the campaign against the narcotics trade will not succeed on one territory alone and for that reason the special services of all states have an interest in exposing, preventing, and thwarting the illegal circulation of drugs. Klebanova: Workers of the law enforcement agencies often attribute the ineffectiveness of the fight against the spread of the contagion to the absence of the necessary legislative base... Belyasko: In this case we have the necessary articles of the law covering the whole range of the problem. But if you take into account that Russia is as yet not assimilated into the international drugs market you can see that preemptive legislation is needed. This work is already in hand and professional conferences are being held at various levels where the long-term is also discussed. But it is necessary to strengthen cooperation with the special services in the West, which have great experience in this field. International agreements and massive joint actions are also needed. [Belyasko ends] The theme of the interview with Vladimir Belyasko was not a happy one. But I must admit that after the conversation with this worker from the "secret front line," I was not left with a sense of overwhelming despair, as is often the case. Nevertheless, it is a good thing that we have an agency which is not only fighting the onset of this ever-expanding evil but is also considering possible ways in which the latter might launch its attack and the prospects for repulsing it. So perhaps we will not have to drain this bitter cup of narcotics to the very bottom. Perhaps it will pass us by.
