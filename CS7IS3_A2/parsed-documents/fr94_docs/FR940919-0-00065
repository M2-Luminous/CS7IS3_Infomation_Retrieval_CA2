FR940919-0-00065 FR940919-0-00016 5. Universal Treatment Standards for Metal Hazardous Constituents EPA is promulgating UTS for both the nonwastewater and wastewater forms of each of the 14 BDAT list metal constituents. The standards are found in the table ``Universal Treatment Standards for Metal Constituents'' at the end of this preamble section. These UTS will replace the existing metal constituent treatment standards for all listed wastes, and will constitute applicable levels for underlying hazardous metal constituents in ignitable, corrosive and TC organic wastes. They do not apply to wastes exhibiting the toxicity characteristic due to metal constituents, i.e., waste codes D004&hyph;D012, nor do they replace the treatment standards promulgated in the Third Third rule for EP metals. Wastecodes D004&hyph;D012 will be addressed in an upcoming rulemaking. a. Nonwastewaters The nonwastewater UTS for 12 of the 14 metal constituents are based on the performance of high temperature metal recovery (HTMR) or stabilization. The remaining two metals are arsenic for which the standard is based on vitrification, and mercury, which standard requires recovery by roasting or retorting for certain highly concentrated mercury wastes. As always, when the Agency develops concentration-based treatment standards, the use of other technologies to achieve those standards is allowed. The following table presents a comparison of the previously promulgated standards with the UTS.
