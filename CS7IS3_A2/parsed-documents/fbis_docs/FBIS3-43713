And we have with us this morning Mrs. Patricia de Lille who is a member of the Executive Committee of that organization. And we are going to be opening the phone lines later on and we'll give you the number. Good morning Mrs. de Lille. [De Lille] Good morning, David. [Hall-Green] Many people would say that in the light of the way that things are going with the break down of apartheid and the general improvement in our society and the steps that have been taken, that the PAC is being more militant than necessary. What would be your answer to that allegation? [De Lille] Well, if the truth means that we are militant, then that is correct, because we've always and consistently propagated the truth to our people. We have not tried to divert the attention from the main problems facing our country. And if people say we are militant because of that it's because we propagate the truth. [Hall-Green] But what I'm saying is that you are said to be more militant than is actually necessary, the steps that you're taking. [De Lille] Well, you know I don't know how they measure it, what criteria they use to say that we are more militant. But I accept that there is a perception that the PAC is more militant. This is being created by the media, by the electronic media, the printed media and so on. Our members, because they are young and vibrant, and because they are angry, they are frustrated, the only way of showing their feelings is by action, because they've got no democratically elected representatives in Parliament that they can use to air their grievances. [Hinds]Patricia, on that note, what is your view about the violence taking place in the townships? How do you feel about it? [De Lille]Every person who gets killed today in our country, every person who dies at the hands of violence -- it is unacceptable to the PAC. We feel that not enough is being done to end the violence. The time has come to stop pointing fingers as to who is responsible for the violence. We must say the violence must stop. At the moment one organization blames the other and that has been the trend over the last three years. [Hall-Green] What about attacks such as that on the Heidelberg tavern in Cape Town? [De Lille] The Heidelberg attack in Cape Town -- the police are still busy with their investigations, thereafter I suppose they will charge people. After they have charged them officially they will then have to appear in a court of law, and it's only then that we can comment and say who is responsible and who is guilty in that particular case. At the moment it's all sub judice and investigations are still going on. [Hall-Green] Does the PAC disassociate themselves entirely from that attack on the Heidelberg? [De Lille] The PAC, our deputy president Johnson Mlambo, has disassociated the PAC from the attack on New Year's Eve. I personally had condemned all violence throughout the country irrespective of whether it's in Cape Town, in Natal, or in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area. [Hall-Green] What about control or not controlling the military wing APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army]? [De Lille] That is more than a question of controlling or not controlling, that is again something that's being... [pauses] a perception which is being carried in the media. We have no control over APLA. APLA is the military wing of the PAC. They are accountable to the mother body, the PAC as much as the political leadership of the PAC is accountable to the mother body. [Hinds]You mentioned just now that violence is unacceptable, but has the PAC ever adopted that view and discouraged violence in the black townships? [De Lille] The PAC is not involved in the internecine violence in our townships. The PAC has in the past, and we are still trying to act as a mediator between the various parties. I challenge anybody in the country to point out where the PAC is actually responsible for violence within the townships. The violence itself is not acceptable to all of us in the country. If there are other means of achieving your political objectives that should have first priority before thinking of taking up a gun, being intolerant and eliminate your political opponent. [Hall-Green] We're going to open the phone line. If you would like to phone in with a specific question for Mrs. Patricia de Lille please do so from now, and the telephone number is the same from wherever you are phoning in the country. [passage omitted] [Hall-Green] Mrs. de Lille, what's the story now with Tanzania? We read that the Tanzanian Government are banning any political activity of the PAC in exile in Tanzania. What is actually the story. There seems to be quite a bit of contradiction in the reports. [De Lille] Well, as far as I know, David, that we did receive a note from the Tanzanian Government. This is a diplomatic issue which we want to confirm that we did receive such a letter, and the PAC will attend to that in due course. [Hall-Green] But does it seem likely that it's going to severely curtail the operations of the organization? [De Lille] I must first of all say the Tanzanian Government is one of the few governments in the continent which has always shone out amongst the others as far as assistance and support for the liberation movements are concerned. It's very unlikely that they will just all of a sudden stop that support for the liberation movements. So once we have more clarity about the content of the letter the PAC will respond. [Hall-Green] As we move further and further into the so-called new South Africa, it would seem that physical monetary support -- financial support -- for the PAC is diminishing. Is this going to mean that the organization is going to have to change its identity from that of a liberation organization to become more of a conventional political party in order to survive? [De Lille] Let me first say that we've never in the PAC relied solely on international funding... [Hall-Green, interrupting] But you've had considerable support. [De Lille] Yes, we've had support from them, but at the same time we've also cultivated a culture of self-reliance among our people. So we are quite well placed to continue with our self- reliance program. It will most probably affect the PAC adversely to an extent only. As far as the question whether we are going to contest the election as a liberation movement or as a political party, we have to register as a political party to contest the elections, and we will do so very, very soon. [Hinds] We have our first caller on the line. It's Joe from Cape Town. Good morning. [Joe] Good morning lady, good morning Mrs. de Lille. I would just like to ask one question. Why is it that the media is making a fuss of the Heidelberg tavern, and let's go back quickly to the Amy Biehl case. They made a fuss about the Amy Biehl case when they, the regime -- the illegitimate regime -- have killed a 13-year-old boy, Sam Siphuwo, in Guguletu the world did not cry out. If you can just tell me why is it that the media don't see the one side of the story, but they see the other side of the story? [De Lille] I think partly that question needs to be put to the media, but I must agree with you that there is a hypocrisy in the way of response by the media on various issues. And I hope that now that we are moving to a free and fair election, we are moving to a stage whereby we want to level the playing fields effectively amongst the political parties. So this kind of reaction by the media must come to an end. But the question is best put to the media themselves. [Hall-Green] And the next caller Robbie Roberts. Good morning to you, Sir. [Roberts] My question to Patricia de Lille is would she be willing to go to the United States and tell the Americans that they must give all land back to the Indians, and do the same in Australia, go to Australia and tell them they must give the land back to the aborigines, and in all other places that were colonized a couple of hundred centuries ago, because she's often said that all land must be given back to the blacks. First of all, the land never belonged to them -- there was nobody here. And I would just like to know if she would be willing to go and campaign for those kind of things to happen in America and Australia and if that happens. I'm sure the whites here won't mind giving all the land back. [De Lille] Mr. Roberts, I think you have to study your history books, and history books not written by the African people of this country but by people who came here in 1652. This country has been colonized, that is a fact of life. There's nobody that can dispute it. And what we've consistently said in the PAC was to call for the return of the land to the original owners. There's no such thing that there was nobody. When Jan van Riebeeck first put foot here on this continent, he was received very well. In fact, his whole boat was supplied with fresh produce and he could sail further. So for you to say there was nobody here is absolutely incorrect. I'll advise you to study your history books written by the people of this country. Thank you. [passage omitted] [Hall-Green] Mrs. de Lille, before our next question comes through, let's just get further clarification on this business of APLA. I think many people find it very difficult to believe that the military wing of an organization can operate apparently independently and with absolute impunity and not be controlled by the mother organization. [De Lille] No David, that is not correct. I know it's a perception, and I want to deal with those perceptions. It is not correct to say that. The PAC as early as June of 1993 has accepted the principle of mutual cessation of hostilities. You must understand that if you are in a war situation there must be two parties involved. We have then said further that we are prepared to discuss the implementation of that principle, and that agreement that we have with the regime. And at the moment that meetings [as heard] cannot take place because for one reason or the other they find some excuses not to meet with the PAC. And we went further to say that while the talks are in progress then we will place a moratorium so there won't be attacks from both sides. But we are not making war against ourselves. The war out there is between two parties, and I think that the other side of the parties that are involved in the war -- they are not looked at. They have been responsible for, I mean [changes thought]. The security forces in this country have been responsible for many killings. We have lost more than 10,000 African people since 1990. [Hall-Green] But now are you going to be prepared to say right now as you sit there that the PAC at this stage does not know whether or not the St. James Church massacre or the Heidelberg tavern were perpetrated by people belonging to APLA? [De Lille] It is not only the PAC that did not know. It is the whole country. [Hall-Green] You're saying you don't know. The PAC does not know? [De Lille, interrupting] The whole country, David, until such time a person has been charged and tried in a court of law, then we can for sure say. At the moment the police are still busy with investigations in the St. James attack, the Heidelberg attack and they must still conclude their investigation. [Hall-Green] So you don't know whether those were your people or not? [De Lille] We don't know if our people are guilty, but we do know that certain people have been arrested as suspects in this case and they are members of the PAC. [passage omitted] [Hinds]Regarding the forthcoming election in April, where does the PAC stand regarding participation? [De Lille]The PAC's congress recently in Umtata in December last year decided that the PAC is to take part in the election, and we are busy preparing for that. [Hinds]Let's talk to (Philip Mphahlela) of Johannesburg.Please go ahead. [Mphahlela] I would like to ask De Lille why [pauses] When they started the story they said that the PAC is too militant. Really, most of the people are disappointed because after they killed that school girl in Guguletu or Khayelitsha there was toyi-toying [protest dancing] at court every now and then. Is it not to the disappointment of most of the people when this happened? Why couldn't they apologize to the family publicly because it is the young PAC's who have done this. Thank you. [De Lille] Again Philip, your information is not correct. Again your information is based on what has been so far projected in the media. Legal investigations are still even continuing as far as that is concerned. Nobody so far has been found guilty and sentenced for the particular crimes you are referring to. So it is premature to say that we are responsible for those attacks. Thank you. [Hall-Green] Is this not another indication of ignorance of what certain elements operating under the banner of the PAC are actually up to? [De Lille] It's deliberate ignorance on the part of those who want to discredit the PAC. It's a deliberate attempt on the part of those people who want to demonize the PAC. As far as we are concerned there is no deliberate attempt by the PAC to say look, we are not responsible or we are responsible. It is other people who have a problem. We don't have a problem. [Hall-Green] You have a problem of bad publicity at the moment, rightly or wrongly, and whoever is generating this, you allege that the media are reporting inaccurately and that there is some kind of campaign, but you do have the problem of bad publicity. You have a bad press. [De Lille] Well, the PAC, David, you must understand, has not been built by the media and we will not be destroyed by the media. But people that we represent are the 75 percent functionately [as heard] illiterate people in this country who don't even have access to a newspaper, who don't even have access to a TV, and they hardly come to hear about all these bad things they are saying about the PAC. Of course the liberal press have got their own interest. They must print news that their backers would like to see in the newspapers, and we can't intervene. They still have the right to print what they want to print. [Hinds] (Bongani Linde) from Orlando east. [Linde] Good morning. I would like to speak to the lady from the PAC. [Hinds] Please go ahead. [Linde] I'm not a member of the PAC, but I would like to say to you Madam, all the African people here are behind you. We are definitely supporting the PAC, but the only thing we are totally opposed is bloodshed which we do not know as yet whether it comes from the PAC leadership. But all I would like to say is continue with the struggle, take it forward, and please stop theorizing a lot and start becoming practical and getting straight to the people on the ground and mobilizing us. Thank you. [De Lille] Thank you Bongani. [Hinds] It seems like the violence is an issue all over. Would you be addressing that pertinently? [De Lille] As I've said in the past, we've made attempts and we are still making attempts. Our members are caught in the cross fire of the internecine violence between Inkatha and the ANC in the townships and in Natal. We have on several occasions offered our services, our good officers, of our president to mediate between the two parties. We only received a favorable response from Inkatha and we are still pursuing that, although the ANC has turned our offer down for our president to mediate. [Hall-Green] Why do you think they have turned your offer down? [De Lille] They have accused us of being opportunists. I don't think you can be opportunist if you're concerned about the dying and the killing of African people, and they have never really come out with a clear answer except to say we are opportunists. [Hall-Green] Next caller on the line is Brenda Wardle from Sandown in the Transvaal -- in Sandton. Good morning Brenda. [Wardle] Good morning. Patricia, don't APLA, your armed wing, embark on these violent attacks now -- here I'm referring to those for which they are responsible -- as a means of struggle or actually as a token of disrespect for human lives. Now I ask this because of the toyi-toying [protest dancing] that took place outside the courtroom during the Amy Biehl murder trial, and does the PAC actually realize that there are some blacks who want to mislead our people into deeper oppression, for example the Buthelezis and some white people who are genuinely devoted to the struggle for example, the Joe Slovos of this world. South Africa is basically not just divided into good blacks and bad settlers, and I hope that you people will realize that. Thank you very much. [De Lille] Brenda, may I just say that if you know the history of the PAC and the history of the liberation movement, in the early 60's when there were no other channels open for them to pursue a peaceful change in this country, out of desperation and out of concern of getting the liberation and the freedom of our people, the movements resorted to the armed struggle. We in the PAC has [as heard] always believed that there's no ways that anybody can dictate to us what methods to use to free ourselves. The desperation and the dying and the maiming of our people calls for anything that, you know, you can use to free our people. We have, as the PAC, accepted the line of negotiations and we've not said that negotiations will be the only form of struggle that will bring liberation to this country. We've not made a revolution at the World Trade Center. But rather the various forms of struggle complement each other, and when they realize that there is a possibility that we might overthrow the existing regime through the ballot box, we then agreed to mutual cessation of hostilities early in June already. Thank you. [Hinds]From Bloemfontein, another caller. Mrs. Blom, good morning. [Blom]Good morning. I have a question for Mrs. de Lille. I remember a meeting she had with Dr. Allan Boesak in the Cape where she said among others: The white people have taken our country. Now we are just wondering, could she tell us what her origins are. Is she not also, in quotation marks, a settler? Thank you very much. [De Lille]What I said in Cape Town was quite correct, but all I can tell you is that I am a example of colonialism because my surname is of French origin, but if no French had come to this country then where does the surname come from? Many of our people have German surnames, have Spanish surnames. Now where do those surnames come from? It is proof that at one stage or another in our history there were people who did not have their roots in Africa. Thank you. [Hall-Green] You know, I think that many people's obvious question in their minds and on their lips sitting at home watching this right now is: If it were not for the so-called settlers, that large general grouping that you make, what would have become of this country? Would this country be the country that it is today? Is it not to all of our advantage ultimately in the long run that there were settlers, that there was the know-how brought in from the northern hemisphere to create the South Africa of today? We certainly wouldn't have been here today had it not been for settlers. [De Lille] I totally disagree with you David on this one. After all the people who used their hands, the workers of this land, it is them who are responsible for building up this country, it is them who... [Hall-Green, interrupting] In conjunction surely with the settlers. [De Lille] In conjunction, but in most cases they were in a supervising position. Even today just go down the street and you find a white person sitting in a truck, just sitting the whole day, and you find eight or nine African people slaving it away. But at the end of the day the rewards for the African people and the rewards for the white person who is sitting the whole day -- the contrast, the difference is so big. So it's incorrect to say that you can come with your knowledge, but if you came with knowledge, you still had to have programs and you still had to have hands for the programs to be implemented. So it's not fair to say that because you came with knowledge, it's because of the knowledge. [Hinds]But that's a situation which is fast changing surely. Do you admit that? [De Lille] I cannot. The changes you refer to [pauses] the people who we represent, to them changes mean having a house, a roof over their heads, that they have access to job opportunities, and so on. And the so-called changes that you are referring to are at the moment -- they are not being felt by the ordinary person in the street. We are still looking for the so- called new South Africa. We do not know where it is. We are trying to find it. We are still looking for the cemetery where they bury apartheid and you cannot find it. I am talking on behalf of the ordinary man and woman in the street, the so-called changes we still have to see. [passage omitted] [Hall-Green] That's about it for this particular discussion, and we say our thanks to Patricia de Lille. Before you go, I want to ask you please once more to answer us a yes or no answer regarding the knowledge that the PAC has of the actions of APLA. Can you say that you do not know that APLA is in fact operating completely independently of the mother organization? [De Lille] Let me say David, I'm under no obligation to say yes or no because the answer is not that simple. I was at pains earlier on to explain what is the situation. It seems then that you have accepted like many other people in the country a trial in the media. We've been sentenced and found guilty... [Hall-Green, interrupting] Personally I have a totally open mind on this, that's why I asked you the question. [De Lille] You know, it's not as simple like that. I'm under no obligation to answer that, thank you. [Hall-Green] Thank you Patricia de Lille, thank you for being with us this morning.
