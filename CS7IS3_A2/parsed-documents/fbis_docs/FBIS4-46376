He emphasized that the participation of the other Palestinian forces in the autonomy elections was "a good reason for us not to participate in them." In an interview with AL-HAYAH, al-Shaqaqi said that the military operations carried out by the "Islamic Mujahidin Forces" (QSM) [al-quwa al-islamiyah al-mujahidah] attached to the Movement "demonstrated that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza was not real, that Israeli sovereignty is still there, and that the authority in the Palestinian administration is Israel." He said that, in his view, "the Palestinian security forces abducted Hani 'Abid to use him as a political hostage to make us stop our jihad operations." He added that he told the PLO leadership and President 'Arafat "indirectly that the arrest of our brothers would escalate military action against the occupation to prove to them (the PLO leadership) that they cannot blackmail us by detaining one of our brothers in the Movement." He also said that as long as long as 'Abid remains in detention "we will escalate military action, and (his continued detention) will not be a reason to stop (military action) as they hope. We will redouble our operations against the occupation until they convince us that the occupation has come to an end and that there is no Israeli presence in Gaza." Asked why they have not been killing Palestinian "agents" or "collaborators" as the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has been doing, al-Shaqaqi said: "We are extremely careful regarding the question of collaborators. The cases where the Jihad Movement killed collaborators were clear and flagrantly self-confessed. We do not act on mere suspicion or personal interrogation." He ruled out the possibility of the Jihad Movement killing "collaborators because the Palestinian police force is there and that matter is ultimately left to it." After he reaffirmed his "absolute refusal to participate in the autonomy elections," AL-HAYAH remarked that other parties have contacted 'Arafat and are willing to do so. He replied: "That is a very good reason for us not to participate. Some, even a small minority, should uphold what is right, say no to this game loud and clear, and be the people's conscience."
