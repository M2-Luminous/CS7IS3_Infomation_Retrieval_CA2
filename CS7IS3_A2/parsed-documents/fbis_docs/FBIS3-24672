Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-23FEB94-SLOVAKIA Slovakia: Embattled Premier Strikes Back Through Media Facing increasing criticism from erstwhile allies as early parliamentary elections loom nearer, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar appears to have started his campaign by using media that has come under his control to publicize himself in a favorable light. For example, the daily Republika, whose chief editor, Jan Smolec, appeared on the 1992 election list of Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) (Narodna Obroda, 2 May 1992), published a highly sympathetic two-part interview in its 7 and 8 February editions. In the interview, Smolec declared that "independent Slovakia" is Meciar's "achievement as a statesman" and contended that the daily's readers were "very disappointed" in President Michal Kovac--a former top HZDS member now a rival of Meciar--when Kovac "stood up against you," adding that readers considered Kovac's advisers "obnoxious people." Meciar, by way of contrast, was presented in a friendly light, discussing his recent vacation in the Tatra mountains "roaming the streets" of villages, skiing, and meeting "young people." Highlighting his achievements as prime minister, Meciar contended that in December 1992 he alone took responsibility for building a new state, since "responsibility frightened even some members of the HZDS" who "left me all alone." Meciar added that "if an authoritative decision is to be made again," he "will not hesitate." Meciar also used state-run Slovak Television and Bratislava Radio, now headed by HZDS adherents, to defend his position during a two-week political crisis, when his governing coalition effectively lost its parliamentary majority through defections over his continued leadership. As opposition parties blocked key government initiatives and threatened to oust him from power, Meciar made a key 15 February appearance on a weekly television program "Press Club" devoted to presenting the government's point of view, thus enabling him to defend his control over the privatization of large-scale enterprises, his call for early elections in June, and his demand that defectors from his party be stripped of their parliamentary mandates. The same evening, Meciar also appeared on Slovak Television's "Kroky" news program to further explain his position, and, during a two-part 18 February interview with Bratislava Radio, he detailed his plans to hold a referendum on these issues. Meciar had prepared the way for his easy access to the airwaves last year, when he replaced television and radio officials with his own supporters, after denouncing Slovak Television for providing a forum exclusively for the government's opponents (See the Trends of 8 December 1993, pages 25 to 27).
