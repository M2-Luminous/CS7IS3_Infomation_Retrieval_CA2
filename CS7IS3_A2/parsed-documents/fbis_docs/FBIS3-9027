During his south Moravian trip on Tuesday [15 March], Ruml, the Czech Interior Minister, said he intended to take all possible steps to prevent Zhirinovskiy, the leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party, from staying in the Czech Republic. He said he would push his intention through with the use of the law on foreigners' stay in the country. A SPR-RSC statement given by a party spokesman to CTK today, says the SPR-RSC assures the government that Zhirinovskiy's visit to the Czech Republic will take place sooner or later. "Ruml is not disturbed by the crowds of economic refugees from the world flowing to the Czech Republic and being nourished from our citizens' taxes. Ruml is not disturbed by foreign mafias' staying (in the country) and pursuing criminal activities...," the statement says. It adds that Ruml is not even disturbed by trips of Sudeten German spokesman Franz Neubauer to the Czech Republic, towards which he is raising blatant claims. "Not the stance of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy but that of Ruml can be called fascist, and it directly contravenes the proclaimed democracy and post-November (1989) ideas". Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said in Warsaw on March 14 that he would pay a visit to the Czech Republic on March 20-21. He has been invited by the extreme-right SPR-RSC.
