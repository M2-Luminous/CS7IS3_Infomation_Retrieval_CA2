FR940606-1-00028 FR940606-1-00008 b. Primer and topcoat application operations. For all primers and topcoats used at the facility, records must be maintained of the name of each primer and topcoat and its organic HAP and VOC content as received. In addition, the EPA is proposing different levels of recordkeeping requirements depending on how the organic HAP and VOC content levels are met. For primers or topcoats that are individually compliant with the organic HAP and VOC content limits, records would be required of the organic HAP and VOC content as applied, all data, calculations, and test results (including Method 24 results taken during an enforcement inspection) used in determining the organic HAP and VOC contents as applied, and the monthly usage of each coating formulation within each coating category. If averaging among compliant and non-compliant coatings is used to achieve compliance, then the proposed standards would require that up-to-date records of daily volume-weighted average mass of organic HAP and VOC contained in the coatings as applied be maintained. This information would include all data and calculations used in determining these daily values, such as manufacturer's data certifying the organic HAP content of each coating as applied and Method 24 test results (including those taken during an enforcement inspection) or manufacturer's data that show the VOC content as applied. If a control device is used to comply with the organic HAP or VOC content limit for primers or topcoats, up-to-date records must be kept on the control device. Each owner or operator would be required to keep records of the equipment monitoring parameter measurements specified in the proposed rule. For an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator, continuous records must be maintained of the firebox temperature (or temperature in the ductwork immediately downstream of the firebox). For a catalytic incinerator, continuous records must be maintained of the gas stream temperature immediately before and after the catalyst bed. For both types of incinerators, records must be maintained of the overall control efficiency and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the overall control efficiency. For carbon adsorbers, records must be maintained of the overall control efficiency, all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the overall control efficiency, and the length of the rolling material balance period and all of its supporting data and calculations used to determine the rolling period. For inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations, either particulate filters or waterwash spray booths would be used to achieve compliance. Records must be maintained of the manufacturer's recommended limits for the pressure drop and readings of the pressure drop across the filters or waterwash that are taken once each shift during which the coating processes are in operation. c. Depainting operation. Each owner or operator of a depainting operation would be required to keep up-to-date records of the name of each chemical stripper used, the organic HAP content of each stripper and its supporting documentation, and the monthly volume usage of each chemical stripper that contains organic HAP. For non-chemical depainting methods, such as media blasting, owners and operators would be required to maintain records of the type of non-chemical-based equipment used and a description of any malfunctions that occur. If a malfunction occurs, the information to be kept would be the dates the malfunction occurred and was corrected, the methods used to depaint the aerospace vehicles during the malfunction, and the dates that these methods were begun and discontinued.
