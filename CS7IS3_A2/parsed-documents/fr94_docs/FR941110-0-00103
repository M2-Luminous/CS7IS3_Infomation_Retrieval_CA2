FR941110-0-00103 FR941110-0-00016 Comment: A few commenters requested clarification regarding the 14 calendar days referenced in paragraphs (d)(3). They weren't sure whether there was a single release of information that would occur 14 calendar days after some event, or whether more than one release of information, each after 14 calendar days, was contemplated. Another commenter wanted to know if the statement of deficiencies and plan of correction are a single document. Response: While the statement of deficiencies and the plan of correction are recorded on the same form (Statement of Deficiencies and Plan of Correction, Form HCFA&hyph;2567), the completion and disclosure of each is separate, not concurrent. The deficiency statement, as well as the separate sheet transmitting survey findings of isolated deficiencies which constitute no actual harm with potential for minimal harm, are notices that the certifying agency gives to a provider transmitting its official survey findings. We have concluded that, since the separate listing of a facility's isolated deficiencies which constitute no actual harm with a potential for minimal harm supplements the official deficiency statement, the listing must be disclosed along with the official statement of deficiencies if we are to provide the public with an accurate and complete report of that facility's compliance status. This information is disclosable within 14 calendar days after it is made available to the provider. Upon receipt of the statement of deficiencies, the provider responds, on the same form, with its plan and timetable for correction of cited deficiencies, as well as any disagreement with the survey findings. Sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act require that a plan and timetable for corrective action be approved by HCFA if alternative remedies are the only remedies being sought, and if the facility is to continue to participate with deficiencies that do not constitute immediate jeopardy in either or both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Information about the plan of correction must be released to the public, upon request, within 14 calendar days after the provider is notified of the approval status of its plan. Therefore, each part, that is, the deficiency statement and the plan of correction, is releasable within 14 calendar days after the provider's notification of that part.
