That amount was enough to enable NBP to take control of several privately-owned banks, which is the reason shareholders in those banks are suing NBP, and why some politicians are critical of the central bank. So far, NBP has invested over 1.650 trillion zlotys in savings in the Pierwszy Komercyjny Bank in Lublin. Then, NBP supported the bank with an additional 150 billion zlotys, to enable it to take over the Poznan-based Merkury bank. Saving the Lodzki Bank Rozwoju cost NBP at least 1.152 trillion zlotys, for Prosper Bank the figure was 950 billion, and for Interbank -- about 130 billion zlotys. NBP also provided financial assistance to Warsaw-based Gecobank for its takeover of Baltic Bank. Anti-Bankruptcy Nationalization "Instead of privatization of the banking sector, we are dealing with the repeated nationalization of some banks, conducted by NBP. In addition, these NBP expenditures are outside the control of parliament and the government," politicians say. Some of them also stress that this way, NBP is spending taxpayers' money. But NBP refutes the accusations by saying that the money for saving the banks comes from issuing additional money. Politicians also hold it against NBP for having persisted so vigorously in its position that the money supply should not exceed 150 trillion zlotys this year; NBP also refused to lend more than 35 trillion zlotys to finance the budget deficit, and given all that, it still decided to devote about 3 trillion zlotys to save banks without much hesitation. "Will this not cause an over-the-plan price increase?" politicians ask. NBP says definitely not, because it had taken the amount into account while planning on inflation levels. It explains that making an application for declaring bankruptcy by a large bank, could lead to a classic run on banks which would cause a domino effect and bankruptcies by more banks. /The first symptoms of a run on banks could be observed after the submission of an application for bankruptcy by Interbank and Baltic Bank,/ NBP reminds. It hopes that by taking over financially "sick" banks, it will succeed in protecting the entire system from customer panic. NBP assures that after bringing a bank back to health, it will sell its shares, maybe even through the stock market. It admits that the process of bringing a bank to health may last a few years, but -- according to NBP's expectations -- perhaps someone will agree to invest in a bank which currently brings no profit but will in the future. Clouds Over Empire NBP's measures are supported by the Association of Polish Banks of which almost all the country's banks are members. The association admits that it has itself tried to convince the central bank to financially support Interbank, and also to facilitate Gecobank's takeover of Baltic Bank. But some bankers are amazed at the fact that NBP -- as the supervisor of the banking sector -- also controls those banks in which it is a shareholder itself. "Regardless of the factual circumstances, this casts a shadow over supervisory activities," bankers say, and they suggest that supervision over banks be taken out of NBP's structures. Also shareholders of the banks which are taken over, are critical of NBP. They do not like that NBP devotes almost the whole share capital of a bank which is subject to takeover, to cover the bank's losses. Despite the fact that -- as NBP assures -- such utilization of share capital is in accordance with the Code of Commerce, shareholders of the Lodzki Bank Rozwoju and of Lublin- based Pierwszy Komercyjny Bank, have filed a law suit against NBP. NBP assures that takeovers of banks facilitate the regaining of credits. In both cases of the mentioned banks, about 100 billion zlotys each were regained from shareholders and the management so far.
