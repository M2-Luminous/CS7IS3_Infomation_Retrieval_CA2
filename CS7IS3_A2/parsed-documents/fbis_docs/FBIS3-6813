Ho Sam-su (Democratic Liberal Party) this week and question 33 others accused of involvement in the coup, prosecution officials said on Monday. The prosecution will ask Ho why and how he put then-Army Chief of Staff Chong Sung-hwa under the custody of the Defense Security Command and call in other former senior military officers who took part in the apprehension. The accused include U Kyong-yun, then-chief of the Criminal Investigation Detachment (CID), Song Hwan-ok, then-provost marshal general office's planning division chief, Choe Sok-nip, then-33 [as received] provost marshal and Yi Chong-min, then-provost marshal of the Army headquarters. A group of Army officers led by Gen. Chon Tu-hwan allegedly mutinied and took control of the Army on Dec. 12, 1979 amid political uncertainties following the assassination of President Pak Chong-hui on Oct. 26, 1979. The group apprehended Gen. Chong Sung-hwa, Army chief of staff and martial law commander, alleging that he had been involved in the president's murder. After the inauguration of the civilian government of President Kim Yong-sam in February last year, Chong and 22 others filed suit in July against Chon and 34 others on charges of treason, which is punishable by death.
