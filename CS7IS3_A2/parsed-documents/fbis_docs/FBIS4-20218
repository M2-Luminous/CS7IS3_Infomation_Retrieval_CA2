Two counterdemonstrations in the city center, which had also been registered for Saturday [30 April], have also been prohibited. Directives to this effect were issued by the city's public order office on Tuesday, on the instructions of Nuremberg Mayor Peter Schoenlein (of the Social Democratic Party of Germany). Schoenlein argued that the planned rally on the eve of 1 May was more and more becoming an "explosive danger for the city's internal security and its good reputation," since one had to expect the rally to take a violence course.
