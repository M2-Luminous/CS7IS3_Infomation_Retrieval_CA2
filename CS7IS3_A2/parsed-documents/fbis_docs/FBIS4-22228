A presidential edict issued on 26 November 1993 granted the state administrations of Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, and Luhansk oblasts authority to manage state-owned property. An experiment was initiated to create a kind of economic and legal zone capable of functioning quite independently. One would have thought that this arrangement would benefit everybody. The government would no longer be saddled with concern and responsibility for the situation in the country's most troublesome and tense region, and the local leadership would finally be given the opportunity to operate freely in market conditions. But the attempts of the regional administrations to bring the policies of ministries and departments into conformity with the president's edict do not always enjoy support from the center. What does this first experiment in economic self-government in Ukraine actually entail? We asked P.I. Lazarenko, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast State Administration, to tell us about this undertaking. [Lazarenko] The only thing that the leaders of the four oblasts wanted was to join efforts in assuring rational and mutually advantageous management. Especially as in some fields, even heretofore, our oblasts were very dependent on one another. The Donetsk-Dnieper region relies on a common energy potential. In addition to the metallurgical branch, the Donbas supplies the Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhya thermal electric power stations with coal, while the power these stations produce is sufficient to meet the needs of other oblasts as well. Integration in machine-building will also be very productive: the region's enterprises complement one another wonderfully. We are already cooperating in the production of a feed-harvesting combine. We have the "Ukrainian Automobile" program and many other, very promising ideas. In a situation in which the economy is collapsing, if we ourselves do not see to it that these ideas are implemented, no one else will. As you can see, the creation of a common economic space is not something that began today; life itself has forced us to seek out new ways to cooperate. All we need to do is bring to a logical conclusion a process that began a long time ago. It is particularly important to do so now that the integration of oblasts has been secured by the president's edict. [Makarenko] Did not a similar territorial-economic division during the period of the national economic councils prove ineffective? [Lazarenko] I would not take such a categorical stand on the councils of national economy. They had their shortcomings, but they also had their advantages. It was not mere chance that in the seven and a half years that they existed, the rates of growth attained in industry, agriculture, and the social sphere were higher than those achieved in the 25 years since the introduction of the branch system of management. Today's experiment also promises a lot. That we wasted time in starting this experiment and did not manage to settle the issue of regional ownership by the beginning of this year is another matter. But the blame for this lies with individual ministries, which failed to understand the point of the experiment, as well as the president's edict. Suffice it to say that although the edict came into force on 26 November 1993, the drafts of the normative acts needed to regulate its implementation were not submitted for review to the Ministry of the Economy until 30 December. Small wonder that the new economic conditions in which we are beginning to live are now at variance with acting legislation. To be sure, it is not all that difficult to bring all the legal acts into conformity -- this is only a matter of time. The worst of it is that the fundamental principles on which the entire, well thought-out concept of egional self-government is structured are being eviscerated as this concept makes its way through the various ministerial offices. [Makarenko] Pavlo Ivanovych, you must agree that one can understand the ministries in this situation. The Donetsk-Dnieper region accounts for the lion's share of the revenues that flow into departmental pockets, especially from such branches as metallurgy, mining, and the power industry. If the basic enterprises are handed over to the region, and they ultimately demonstrate that they can manage perfectly well without the center, will this not give rise to the question whether there is any need as such for the ministries as we know them today? This is a real delayed-action mine for them. [Lazarenko] It is very likely that many at the departmental level perceive our initiative in just such terms. But I believe that the interests of the people and of the state must take precedence over all else. Can anything other than personal ambition explain the following? The list of 857 enterprises proposed by us for transferring into regional ownership was "cut" by the ministries by more than half -- to 365. Moreover, the principle according to which the selection was made defies all logic. For example, the Ministry of Industry left a number of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgical enterprises, scientific-research, and planning and design organizations on the list, while removing enterprises in the metal products, ore mining, and coke and chemical subbranch. This, despite the fact that even a nonspecialist understands that these are components of a single metallurgical complex. Enterprises specializing in gas and oil and coal extraction were left off the list completely, as were all transportation and communications enterprises. Of 31 enterprises within the Ministry of Power system, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast got all of... six, although we asked that the three latter branches be included in the experiment with a double subordination. The managers of the republic's building industry also ruined our plans. At the request of the Ukrmontazhspetsbud, Ukrtsement, Ukrprombud, and Ukravtodor corporations, not a single enterprise in the oblast subordinated to them will be handed over. The building complex "generously" gave us 33 of the 139 enterprises we asked for. [Makarenko] This situation reminds me of the well-known saying: "Here, God, you take what I have no use for..." [Lazarenko] Yes, but only at first glance. After all, it is not as if we wanted to take over only the large and strong enterprises and not want to bother with the unprofitable ones. The whole point of the experiment is to make both strong and weak enterprises part of a single economic space and subordinate them not to a department, but to a common objective --either cooperation through joint production, or a long-term building program. Is it so important to us who runs an enterprise as long as it operates and provides people with jobs and the state with revenues? They just introduced a clause into the decree of the Cabinet of Ministers which forbids changing the product specialization of enterprises. Does this mean that a plant that manufactures products for which there is no demand should die?! Shut down?! Where is the common sense in this? [Makarenko] How many such contradictions are there in the Cabinet of Ministers documents that regulate the implementation of the edict? [Lazarenko] Many, unfortunately. In addition to cutting up the list of enterprises to suit itself, the Cabinet of Ministers has also drafted a decree on the procedure for managing enterprises, institutions, and organizations by the state administrations, which contravenes effective legislation. After all, all these questions were regulated back in 1992 by the Cabinet of Ministers decree "On Managing State-Owned Property," and no one has revoked this decree. And the Ministry of the Economy has still not gottten around to reviewing our proposals regarding other normative acts, without which it is impossible to pursue an effective economic policy in the region. [Makarenko] What is the gist of the proposals of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast State Administration? [Lazarenko] We requested that the draft of the decree include a clause establishing a regional order for production as part of the state order, as well as allowing the oblast administrations to issue export quotas and licenses as part of the same regional order in order to enable us to effectively resolve socioeconomic problems. Unless this is done, it is virtually impossible to regulate price formation and satisfy the region's need for imported goods. Second, the acts that have been drafted so far are clearly inadequate to ensure that the regional economy functions in a normal and full-fledged anner. In these new economic conditions, it is imperative to regulate the credit and financial policies of banks, develop mechanisms for settlement clearing with CIS members for deliveries of raw materials, fuel and energy resources, and equipment, and stipulate in greater detail the procedure for managing state-owned property. Until all these documents are completed and approved, any positive changes in the region's economy are out of the question. In light of this situation, the president of Ukraine was forced to issue another edict on 21 February 1994 "On Additional Measures With Respect to Delegating Powers to the Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, and Luhansk Oblast State Administrations To Manage State-Owned Property." The edict is well thought-out and tough. It takes into account the needs of the region. After all, Ukraine does not live and work in the capital, but in the regions. The edict provides for export quotas, for the right to act as guarantor for foreign investment, and many other necessary things. Essentially, this second edict says to the officials in Kiev quite unequivocally that Ukraine does not exist to serve them, but that they exist to serve Ukraine, and that it is not up to them to accumulate everything into their own hands and then disburse it. I hope that the officials will get the right message and not attempt to continue trying the president's patience... [Makarenko] In other words, as in any other field, the purity of an experiment in economics must also be assured? [Lazarenko] Absolutely. This experiment will make sense only if the Cabinet of Ministers executes all the nuances of this large-scale and unquestionably promising undertaking. On the other hand, I feel that our government simply does not have the choice whether to conduct this experiment or not. There are two presidential edicts, and, most important, we are now in a situation that threatens us with the collapse of the economy and a social explosion. All well thought-out proposals for tabilizing the economy -- be it in the republic or in a region -- must find support today. We are counting on the government to take this sober view of the situation. There is also a need to review our taxation policy. I will give you an example. Last year, our oblast transferred 220 billion karbovantsi into the Chernobyl fund and got back a mere two billion. Meanwhile, 26,600 participants in the liquidation of the accident at the Chernobyl AES reside in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, and the oblast still has no rehabilitation center for them. Next. The State Property Fund "made" 58 billion karbovantsi on privatizing enterprises in our oblast last year. I feel that 50 percent of the income from privatization of state enterprises should be left at the disposal of the region. In working out the taxation policy, at least one rule should be adhered to: do not kill the chicken that lays the golden eggs. Otherwise there will be nothing left to transfer into the budget.
