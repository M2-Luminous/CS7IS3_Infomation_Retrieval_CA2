He pointed out that the movement has so far acted "very responsibly." He said that the Palestinian entity emerging in Gaza and Jericho is a modest, but promising start. Replying to the clamor over the content of a tape of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat during his meeting with Muslims in a South African mosque, in which he called for jihad for the sake of Jerusalem, he said that there is always linguistic argument about the concept and meaning of the word jihad. He pointed out that 'Arafat called for jihad for the sake of Jerusalem, "that is, to strive collectively to liberate Jerusalem peacefully." Safiyah said that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin continues to speak of Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel. "What is important is the international will represented in the resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly, which consider Jerusalem an occupied territory from which Israel must withdraw." In a lecture delivered in London the evening of the day before yesterday at the invitation of the "Council for Arab-British Understanding" (CABU), Safiyah dealt with a number of controversial issues on the Palestinian scene, including the peace process since the Madrid and Washington negotiations through to the Oslo and Cairo negotiations, in addition to the future of the PLO, the Palestinian economy, and Hamas.
