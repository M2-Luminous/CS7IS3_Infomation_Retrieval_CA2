The British Government, in order to divert public attention from its failure to settle the Northern Ireland issue, does not refuse to engage in any trick and propaganda artifice in and outside Britain. A glance at the past history of clashes in Ireland has symptoms of the defeat of British policies, both military and political, in this region and the continuous notoriety earned by responsible persons in England. The shooting of any person suspected of terrorist operations is one sample of these policies. Perhaps the most conspicuous sample of British policy was the killing of three Irishmen suspected of membership in IRA in Gibraltar by British security forces in 1988. After killing them, the British police found out that the three Irishmen were not busy laying bombs as suspected but in fact had no weapons with themselves. The accident caused the families of the three murdered persons to file a complaint at European courts against the British Government for trampling on the second paragraph of the human rights convention of Europe. The British Government does not have a good record at the European courts and since 1950, of the 52 files presented against Britain, the country has been condemned in 30 cases. On the other hand in the opinion of many non-aligned observers the government of Britain has itself been one of the main causes of political chaos and violent actions in Northern Ireland. The secret researches performed by the government have also proved this true. For example, the daily 'INDEPENDENT' last June disclosed certain aspects of these secret researches which portrayed the depth of discrimination against those Catholics of Northern Ireland who want independence from British colonialism. On the basis of this report London's political-military control of Northern Ireland, has over the past 20 years led to gross inequality and the strengthening of the Protestants who support prolongation of British rule. Statistical comparison between the two societies of Northern Ireland indicate high level of unemployment among Catholics at a rate that is twice as much as Protestants, in addition to striking differences in housing, hygiene, and education among the two groups. In the opinion of the writers of this report, this is the direct result of the deliberate policies of London for enacting discrimination against those who want an end to its presence in the northern part of Ireland. On the other hand despite the claims of the British Government for stopping clashes and armed encounters among the two groups in Northern Ireland, the statistics of those killed in these incidents indicate another bitter truth. Statistics show that for the past seven years until 1993 about 220 Protestants were killed by the republicans. This is while over the same period 368 republican Catholics were killed by armed groups who are advocates of English rule. The British Government while showing itself inclined to peace to end the bloody clashes in Ireland has in fact, on many an occasion entered into coalition with rightist parties that are opposed to negotiations with the Catholics, and has considered many concessions for the Protestants in controlling Northern Ireland. For instance, British Prime Minister John Major late last summer, in order to benefit from the support of the extremist Irish Protestant parties in the parliament and specifically the Ulster Unionists Workers Party, granted them many privileges including the establishment of a special selection committee in parliament. This issue at that time caused independent observers to raise objections and voice concern over the grave results of this political give-and-take and the probable invalidity of the present political agreements between England and the Republic of Ireland in connection with the future of Northern Ireland. According to observers consider the only probable way for creating a stable peace in Northern Ireland is for the British Government to stop its discriminative policies against Catholics and participate in direct negotiations to be attended by all sides involved [sentence as received]. London for various reasons has thus far evaded this issue and occasionally by bringing up diversions and imaginary claims has tried to mislead public opinion in and outside the country especially among the powerful Irish community in the United States. Last year, too, an independent committee for investigating the problem of Northern Ireland named UPSAL had said that any peace agreement in relation to Northern Ireland without considering the Catholics and Protestants as equals and with equal rights for declaring their positions was doomed to fail.
