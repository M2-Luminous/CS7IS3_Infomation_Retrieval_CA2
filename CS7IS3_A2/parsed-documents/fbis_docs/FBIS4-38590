This is how Viktor Mezhak, deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet, commented on the statement by supporters of the deautonomization of the Crimea, who call themselves the "Crimean Opposition Supreme Soviet", which was broadcast Tuesday. He said there is nothing new in such statements. "Some Ukrainian public organizations have previously made demands for the dissolution of the Crimean parliament and for the introduction of presidential rule." "It is incomprehensible," Viktor Mezhak said, "why, broadcasting this information, journalists were not interested in who created this `opposition Supreme Soviet', who gave it the power to come out with a statement in the name of the Crimeans? I think this was done in order to whip up passions around the Crimea just a bit more." Stressing the desire of the Crimean people's elected representatives to tackle all the problems around the negotiating table with their counterparts from Kiev, Viktor Mezhak said: "We expect the Ukrainian parliamentarians to continue the dialogue on settling our relations. We are counting that they will come to the Crimea this Friday."
