During the meeting, the party's highest authorities are expected to discuss Secretary General Do Muoi's political report and Central Committee personnel changes, the sources said. Both issues were discussed at the sixth Central Committee plenum last November and taken up again at the National Assembly's second annual session in December in Hanoi. According to an official Vietnamese source, 15 of the 145 Central Committee members will be replaced during the conference, the first time one has been held between two Congresses. Politburo personalities and government officials might also be replaced, the informed sources said. In addition to the replacement of political personnel, the task of this "mini-Congress" is to make a political point of "doi moi" or renovation, promised since 1987, by discussing the rhythm of economic reforms and defining the direction to take until the eighth Congress in 1996. The 649 delegates who will attend the six-day party conference include Central Committee members and representatives of the army, the provinces, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and organizations such as the Homeland Front, the Women's Union and labor unions. Observers say it is unlikely that the regime will slow the pace of economic reforms. However, some leaders have called for a slowdown, even a pause, in the economic liberalization process out of fear that opening the economy to the outside world could lead to social unrest and political destabilization. On Monday, the army's daily newspaper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN, considered close to conservative circles, called for "maintaining and consolidating political stability" while reaffirming "the choice of economic reforms along socialist lines." "The painful lessons of the Soviet bloc have shown that social turmoil would lead to a political crisis," the newspaper said after launching a new warning against "hostile forces" that seek to "overthrow the socialist regime, sabotage the modernization work and destroy the party's leading role." "Political modernization is a very sensitive question that must be conducted in a progressive and wise manner," the newspaper said, adding that "it is not absolutely necessary to sacrifice political interests to benefit economic development." "We are determined to maintain the party's leading role, and we will accept neither pluralism nor multi-partyism, the newspaper stressed, saying that "revolutionary gains can only be defended by political stability." Former party members, close to dissident intellectuals, have recently criticized the single-party system and called for a change in the Communist Party's leadership.
