Hamas denounced the shaky, hesitant position of Yasir 'Arafat as a submissive position that does not take into consideration the Palestinian blood that has been spilled or the anger of the Palestinian people everywhere. The statement further said: We think that 'Arafat's stands serve the interests of the Zionist enemy, which seeks to placate popular rage over the massacre. The statement added: We consider insistence on pursuing a policy of relinquishment and continuing the negotiations, rather than responding to an overwhelming popular desire to withdraw from the talks, as treason against our people. An official Hamas spokesman said that it is a priority of the popular forces to maintain a strong popular momentum inside the territories and in the diaspora and to remain determined to achieve their goals.
