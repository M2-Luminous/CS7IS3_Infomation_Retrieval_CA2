The clashes lasted for two and a half hours, at the end of which troops led by General Fateira were put to flight. The People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] abandoned several killed and large quantities of war materiel on the ground. Our forces captured Lieutenant Pdro Joao, son of Joao Andre and Antonica Pedro Andre and born in Cazenga in September 1974. He was assigned to the 1st Company of the Tank Battalion. Our N'Dalatando correspondent Firmino Lukamba has other details: FAPLA forces abandoned 45 killed. The local Military Command has meanwhile denied a Radio Nacional de Angola report from Cuito, saying UNITA forces stationed in N'Dalatando have been deployed elsewhere to take Cuito.
