Bulgar] [Text] Pretoria April 19 SAPA -- The Multiparty Negotiating Council [MPNC] will convene at the World Trade Centre on Wednesday [20 April] to draw up legislative amendments to include the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] in the elections. Parliament will sit in Cape Town on Monday to pass the amendments, Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer told Tuesday's meeting of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]. The MPNC session follows Tuesday's historic agreement in Pretoria between President F W de Klerk, African National Congress President Nelson Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The agreement was hailed as an "historic breakthrough" by Mr Meyer and ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa. They said it would contribute towards the goal of an all-inclusive constitutional settlement and would help bring peace and stability. The TEC will meet after the MPNC session to ratify the legislative amendments. The amendments include changes to the Electoral Act, the Interim Constitution and the 13th constitutional principle providing for the future position of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. Political leaders struck an upbeat tone at the TEC meeting which was delayed for several hours because key members were involved in the talks at the Union Buildings. "This agreement could make a major contribution to reducing the violence in the country," Mr Meyer said. He said it would reduce tension. The parties viewed the agreement as a "major achievement" which would bring joy to all South Africans. He said the agreement did not resolve all the outstanding problems but for the moment it was a major contribution. Mr Ramaphosa said it was an agreement of "great and historical significance" and that it had laid the foundation for a peaceful transition. He described it as "the mother of all breakthroughs" and said people could "heave a sigh of relief" that it had been reached. He urged all parties to accept the agreement so that it could have a rapid passage through the MPNC. Mr Meyer said Parliament had to be recalled because it was not possible to change constitutional principles after the election. He said that in terms of Section 74 of the constitution, changes to constitutional principles could only be made before the elections. In terms of the "agreement for reconciliation and peace", Section 160 of the constitution dealing with the powers and functions of provinces would be amended to "provide for the institution, role, authority and status of a traditional monarch in the province, and shall make such provision for the Zulu monarch in the case of the province of kwaZulu/Natal". Constitutional principle 13 will be amended by the addition of the paragraph: "Provisions in a provincial constitution relating to the institution, role, authority and status of a traditional monarch shall be recognised and protected in the constitution." The amendments will satisfy the IFP and the Zulu royalists for the time being until they are further elaborated upon in international mediation after the elections. Apart from the constitutional amendments, there are also amendments to the Electoral Act to allow the IFP to take part in the election after its provisional registration lapsed when it failed to submit lists of candidates last month. Mr Meyer said the IFP's registration would be "reopened" and that it would be given time to file candidate lists. He added that this concession was only in respect of the IFP. He said the negotiators had agreed that the IFP's name, logo and the picture of its party leader would be printed on adhesive strips which would be attached to the bottom of ballot papers by electoral officers. A proposal that it be added to the back of ballot papers had not been acceptable to the IFP, he said. He said the Independent Electoral Commission's task of arranging the election had to be kept in mind and that it would not be possible for other parties to change their candidate lists.
