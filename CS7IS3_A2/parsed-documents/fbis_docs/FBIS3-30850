The high state of NATO weaponry would allow very precise and selective bombardment, he said: "From a technical point of view, it's no problem." Much more complicated is to evaluate the results of such a strike and what sense it would make, what it would solve and what would happen afterward. This is the reason it is being weighed by so many parties. It is also necessary to consider what could happen to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces already on the ground in Bosnia. "The number of warring parties could go up to four," he said, adding UNPROFOR to the Croats, Serbs, and Muslims already at war. "The UN Peacekeeping Forces are not armed enough to stand up to everything which could follow a probable aerial attack," he concluded.
