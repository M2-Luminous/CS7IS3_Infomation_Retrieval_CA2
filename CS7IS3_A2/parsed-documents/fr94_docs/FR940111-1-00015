FR940111-1-00015 FR940111-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;43] Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce, plc Spey Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc Spey series turbofan engines. This proposal would require a one-time inspection of stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT) steel disks for cracks and corrosion pitting. This proposal is prompted by a report of a stage 7 high pressure compressor steel disk found cracked due to corrosion. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent an HPT or LPT steel turbine disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure. DATES: Comments must be received by March 14, 1994.
