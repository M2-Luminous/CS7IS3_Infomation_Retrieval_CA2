Chegarovskiy under the rubric "Privatization-94": Somebody Must Leave"] [Text] The "war of the edicts" between the Department of Privatization and the Ministry of the Economy continues. The duel began back in the spring of last year and by the time it ended the ministry was left with the right to shoot. It took advantage of this right by preparing in October and finally approving on 5 January of this year the draft edict "On Measures for Regulating the Reorganization of Enterprises During the Process of Implementing the State Program for Privatization in the Republic of Moldova During 1993-1994." As of 12 January the draft had been okayed by the Procuracy of the Republic of Moldova, the Ministry of Finance, the Commission on State Control, the State Property Fund and, naturally, the Ministry of Economics itself. As you can see, consent has been given by all the interested ministries and control organs; the only thing lacking is the signature of Mircea Snegur, after which four pages of typewritten text written by the bureaucratic hand will magically be transformed into an edict of the president of the Republic of Moldova. True, it has not been signed by another department which also has something to do with privatization--the department with the same name. But is a convict frequently asked to consent to the sentence that is handed down? And the aforementioned edict is nothing other than a sentence both for the department itself and for the policy it has been "implementing" during the past two years. What are the chances that the edict will be signed by the president and, as they say, "take effect on the day it is signed"? The authors of the draft themselves estimate it as 50-50, but there are certain peculiarities that give reason to think that they are either being modest or are afraid of endangering their success. All preceding attempts on the part of the department and the ministry (the first was to consolidate their grip on the "heights" they had seized and the second was to push their rival off from them) ended in mutual failure, which largely suited the department as the defending side. Its persistence was largely determined by the personality of the leader and general director, Vissarion Cesuev. A pragmatist and a romantic, a swindler and practically a holy man prepared for self-sacrifice--this is how he is described by people from the "interested ministries and control organs." Today he is included on the election list of the SDPM [Social Democratic Party of Moldova] and, as a member of the coordinating council of this party, is among the top 10. He would be assured a place in the future parliament, but even before 27 February, according to the Law "On Elections," he would have to temporarily resign from his position as director and go on leave. In any case the department would lose its support and its banner. And it feels like a football team whose star goalkeeper has been injured and there is nobody to replace him. Moreover, there are very persistent rumors that are very close to the truth saying that the president's edict on firing Cesuev has already been prepared. This edict is also lacking the president's signature. The second peculiarity is also closely linked to the elections. The defeat of the department is above all a blow to the Social Democratic Party, and since this blow was prepared for in the government, one automatically recalls that practically all the government leaders (the prime minister and two of his deputies) ran for parliament on the ADPM [Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova] slate. The department, of course, has protection, and it is not weak. Money for its activity is allotted by the International Monetary Fund and other foreign investors. Here, true, an interesting question arises: How does the IMF use its credit to keep afloat a department whose activity is considered illegal in the homeland. After all, the republic procuracy approved (and not for the first time) a draft of the edict which contains the following: "A situation has developed whereby a considerable share of state property has been illegally transferred to entrepreneurial structures, a channel has been opened for illegal use and acquisition of state property, members of labor collectives are being deluded regarding the promised shares and dividends...." Let me repeat once again that the edict has not yet been signed by the president and we do not know whether it will be signed at all, but the procuracy has signed it! Measures for eliminating the "situation that has developed" / which developed "...on the initiative of the State Department on Privatization..."/, [punctuation as published] according to the edict, will be severe: forced opening of closed joint-stock companies; a ban on the reorganization into joint-stock companies with mixed capital of enterprises that are subject to privatization; the return to members of labor collectives and legal entities of monetary funds previously attracted for facilities that are valued at up to 1 billion rubles; the introduction of essential changes in the founding documents of hundreds of joint-stock companies in order to "return" them to the list of state-owned facilities offered for privatization for BND [certifications of national wealth] during 1993-1994; the declaration of documents of joint-stock companies that have not made these changes to be invalid, and so forth. Taken together these measures call an abrupt halt to everything that was done by the department in the sphere of the creation of joint-stock companies and throw the process of privatization back to 1991. Privatization is in danger. All of last year and the beginning of this year proceeded under this slogan. They are whispering about it in waiting lines, discussing it openly in the government, and shouting about it in the department. What danger can threaten a cause that has so many supporters? It is simply that in the waiting lines, in the government, and in the rebellious department there is no common viewpoint either on privatization or on the danger that threatens it. We are learning patience. The waiting line is not moving--someone must leave.
