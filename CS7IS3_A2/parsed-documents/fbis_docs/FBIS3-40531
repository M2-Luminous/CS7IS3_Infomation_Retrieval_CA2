The robot can distinguish between the color of the ground (white) and the color of the line (black), so its progress is controlled to stick to its course. The robot includes an actuator, photo-sensors, and logic circuits. Its dimensions are 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter. The micro robot was created for a maze competition. Good results were achieved in experiments. The width of the line corresponds to the size of the robot. Two photosensors distinguish white from black on the left and right. The robot's course is controlled by logic circuits. The actuator uses a combination of electromagnets and nylon angled hairs. This was developed by Professor Fukuda and his associates. It uses a coil and an iron core that are drawn and repelled by turning electricity on and off. The angled hairs that act as the feet of the robot proceed as they are moved forward. A distinctive characteristic is that the hairs scratch the ground. There is an electromagnet and angled hairs for both the left and right sides. Direction is changed by controlling their left-right movement. This was the first time that a 1 cm by 1 cm by 1 cm robot with sensing capability and logic circuits was used in a micro maze contest. It is noteworthy as a new micro robot system.
