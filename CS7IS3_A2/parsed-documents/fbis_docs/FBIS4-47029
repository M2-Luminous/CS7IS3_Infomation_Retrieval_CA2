Aside from imperialist ambitions, he also charged Moscow with being guilty of "nuclear blackmail." The dialogue, without even having begun, was disrupted. Why did Dudayev act in such an illogical manner? Sudden interest in negotiations with Groznyy was sparked in the Moscow upper echelons only after Ruslan Khasbulatov again surfaced on the political scene. The federal bureaucrats were thrown into such frenzy that they got tangled up in their own strategy. There is an official plan for regulating relations with Chechnya: Consultations with all the political forces in the republic, holding elections of the bodies of power there according to Russian laws, and then signing a treaty with the publicly elected leaders. Such a position was announced in the message of the RF President and in the decree of the State Duma. It is adhered to by Sergey Shakhray, who was appointed head of the Russian delegation at these negotiations. Another scenario directly contradicts the official line, and it is being supported by entirely official persons--Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko and the president's chief of administration, Sergey Filatov. They propose immediately opening negotiations at the highest level--between Yeltsin and Dudayev, and with no preliminary conditions. The reason for such inconsistency by Moscow is simple: Those surrounding Yeltsin have decided that the anti-Dudayev opposition will be headed by Khasbulatov. Then he will become head of the republic, and the treaty will have to be signed specifically with him. In order to prevent such an unpleasantness, the Kremlin is ready to agree to any concessions to Dudayev. But an embarrassing thing happened. Dudayev did not agree to any concessions. He too, it is true, was also disturbed by Khasbulatov's growing popularity, but the Chechen leader simply declared--once again--Ruslan Imranovich as being an "enemy of the people" and prohibited him from living in Chechnya. After that, Filatov announced with puzzlement that he does not understand why Dudayev is undermining the dialogue, and at the same time expressed regret that they have still not been able to exclude Shakhray from the negotiations. Since Dudayev had once said that Shakhray also does not suit him, it turns out that the Kremlin is ready to make further concessions to the Chechen president in the hope that he will become more conciliatory. The authorities of the "great power" are acting in a surprisingly undignified manner. We get the impression that it is Moscow which is begging for a union with Groznyy, while there they are merely lazily waving away the annoying flirtations. Then again, that is how it is. Dudayev did not demand either a meeting with Yeltsin or a treaty with Moscow. He is entirely satisfied with the existing state of affairs. In the past three years, a "free economic zone" has spontaneously been formed in the republic: First raw materials and goods were freely moved to Chechnya, and then just as freely went to the far abroad. In a parallel course, currency capital comes and goes freely--with considerable profit for Groznyy and without the slightest benefit to the Russian budget. As long as the workers of the president's administration are trying to persuade the Chechen general to engage in negotiations and helping him to eliminate his competitors, Dudayev is invulnerable. He can bargain forever, first breaking off and then renewing the dialogue, and always imposing more and more new conditions. Shakhray's plan of action presents a much greater danger for the general: Dudayev will not win in a new election, and Khasbulatov's chances are much more realistic. But since it is specifically this circumstance which frightens Moscow and introduces disorder into the ranks of the federal bureaucrats, Shakhray's plan is unrealizable. Thus, Khasbulatov has not yet returned to politics, while Dudayev has already extracted maximum benefit for himself from this bugaboo.
