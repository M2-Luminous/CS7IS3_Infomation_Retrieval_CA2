This year, the city will pour 1.4 billion yuan into several important facilities, including the Shanghai Library, Shanghai Museum and a television station in the Pudong New Area. From 1991 to 1995, Shanghai plans to inject more than four billion yuan into the field, compared with 536 million yuan in the 1986-1990 period. According to its ambitious plan, this biggest city in China will boast a batch of advanced facilities involving theaters, cinemas, music halls, book stores and gymnasiums before the end of this century. The investment is estimated at about 10 billion yuan. Despite the allocation from local government, most of it is to be raised through various channels, like land leasing, stock issuance and other flexible measures to absorb domestic and foreign funds. A top official of the municipality said that these facilities are important for improving the citizens' quality and building Shanghai into a first-class international city. At present, the city with a population of 13 million has less than 5,000 entertainment spots, 66 cinemas and 31 libraries, far from enough to meet the inhabitants' urgent demands resulting from rapid economic growth.
