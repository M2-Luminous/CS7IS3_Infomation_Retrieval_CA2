Vasylyuk: "Moscow Statement Is a Compromise" -- first paragraph is KYYIVSKA PRAVDA introduction published in boldface] [Text] Last weeks' equivocal events in the life of Ukraine's foreign policy have elicited many doubts, controversies, and hopes. It is hard to comprehend all the subtleties of politics and understand the official position of Kiev regarding these events without comments by a government official or diplomat. This fact prompted a meeting between Deputy Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk and journalists. The conversation went beyond the protocol, and therefore, responding to numerous questions, Mr. Tarasyuk briefed us about: ...The Meeting Between the Ukrainian and Kazakhstani Presidents Unfortunately, due to the intensity of the latest events, the first official visit to Ukraine by Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev went almost unnoticed. This was a very important event, since the visit become the first step toward rapprochement of both presidents' positions on cooperation between Ukraine and Kazakhstan in the framework of the CIS and beyond this structure. It is not a secret that Leonid Kravchuk and Nursultan Nazarbayev had differing viewpoints on an economic union among former USSR republics and the CIS in general. After the visit, the emphasis will apparently be placed on bilateral relations. It is hard not to appreciate future cooperation between Ukraine, one of the key countries in Central-Eastern Europe, and Kazakhstan, a leading state in Central Eurasia. Borys Tarasyuk emphasized that this visit initiated a new stage in Ukrainian-Kazakhstani relations. The presidents signed a new interstate agreement. A declaration signed by the two presidents became a milestone for bilateral relations between our countries. The declaration emphasizes, in particular, the necessity of establishing a universal interregional security system "from Vancouver to Vladivostok," which would include all countries without exception, as well as preventing the establishment of new blocs on the territory of new independent states which have ended up in a "security vacuum." The presidents reached an agreement as to concrete fields of cooperation such as, for example, space exploration. Although Ukraine's contribution to the development of space exploration amounted to 40 percent of the total share during the USSR era, the country does not have capabilities of using such a great potential. Kazakhstan possesses testing ranges and launching facilities. ...The Tripartite Statement [as published] by the Ukrainian, U.S., and Russian Presidents Signed in Moscow on 14 January The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine is convinced that the signing of the statement conforms to the vital interests of Ukraine. Regarding the compensation for nuclear weapons, the statement envisions such compensation for Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine in exchange for highly enriched uranium from nuclear warheads. The statement is not an international agreement and it must be ratified by the legislatures of the three countries. Although it is important to know what is the attitude of the Ukrainian legislature toward the statement, this document acts as a response to the reservations expressed by the Ukrainian legislature toward the signing of the agreement on nuclear weapons. The Moscow statement was signed by the presidents of three states, and this fact put it beyond the framework of a political statement, said Mr. Tarasyuk. It provides for concrete actions. Each one of the three states made certain concessions. This is a compromise among the three presidents. Ukraine obtained a response to the question concerning security guarantees, material and technical assistance in disarmament, and compensation. The participants in the negotiations reached an accord that, in case Ukraine signs documents on nuclear weapons, a multilateral document will be signed -- Great Britain also is willing to sign such a document. What is the deadline for dismantling nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine? This is a technical condition of nuclear warheads. The predetermined shelf life of many nuclear warheads will expire as early as this year, and next year this process will have an avalanche effect. ...The Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet Asked by journalists whether the complex economic situation will lead to a partition of Ukraine into separate territories, particularly with regard to the Crimea, Borys Tarasyuk replied that the international community, including Russia, recognized Ukraine as an independent state with defined borders in 1991. The UN Security Council recognized as groundless the 9 July statement issued by the Russian legislature on the status of Sevastopol. The tripartite statement signed by the Ukrainian, U.S., and Russian presidents says that the United States and Russia respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and existing borders. Speaking about the prospects for the withdrawal of the Russian part of the Black Sea Fleet from Ukraine, the Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister stated that the Black Sea Fleet, de jure, remains under the authority of the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. The political atmosphere between our countries has improved, following the Moscow summit. There are certain grounds to expect that the Black Sea Fleet issue will be resolved already this year. Certain political leaders of the Crimea, noted Mr. Tarasyuk, were looking for Russia's support. Nevertheless, we do not have any evidence to claim that Russia's Government rendered any help to political forces in the Crimea. The issue of leasing by Russia certain onshore facilities located on Ukrainian territory still remains on the agenda. However, this does not concern the city of Sevastopol but only several facilities. ...The Nonbloc Status Proclaimed by Ukraine and Perspectives for Cooperation With NATO Ukraine announced its nonbloc status in the 1990 declaration on state sovereignty. Since then, the geopolitical situation has changed. Although the Warsaw Pact does not exist, there still is NATO, and new military-political alliances have appeared on Asian territories. Given these circumstances, Ukraine could end up between two military blocs. Today, we remain in the so-called "security vacuum." Cooperation with NATO, CSCE, and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, does not contradict our main goals. The authors of the U.S. initiative "Partnership for Peace" believe that such cooperation does not mean membership in NATO but rather bilateral cooperation. Security guarantees, essential for every country, should include our own armed forces, cooperation with neighboring states, and participation in international security systems or military-political organizations. Providing these explanations, Borys Tarasyuk recalled consultations with government experts from all East and Central European countries conducted at a meeting devoted to establishing a security system, which was held in Pushcha-Ozerna in the vicinity of Kiev. The experts met to find ways of implementing Leonid Kravchuk's initiative for establishing a stability zone in Central-Eastern Europe and the U.S. initiative "Partnership for Peace." The main goal of the consultations was the rapprochement of positions, searching for compromises and common approaches to security issues. There will be another round of such consultations, which are eventually aimed at signing a multilateral agreement on the security system in Central and Eastern Europe. In the best case, noted Borys Tarasyuk, such an agreement should be signed already this year.
