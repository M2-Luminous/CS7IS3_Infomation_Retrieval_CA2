According to estimates by the Federal Association for German Waste Disposal [BDE], last year they consisted of nearly 55 million tons [t] of household waste. For this reason, recycling has never yet been so important as it is today. First, according to a forecast by the Berlin federal environmental department, by the year 2000, every other German household waste landfill will have used up its capacity. Second, against the backdrop of the fair, BDE's principal managing director, Frank-Rainer Billigmann, remarked: "Secondary raw materials afford the sector great opportunities." Numerous companies have already acknowledged this: almost every third one of the nearly 1,550 exhibitors at Entsorga, from 18 to 21 May in Cologne, is offering technologies, products and services centered on secondary raw materials. Still, it is easier to champion recycling than to practice it. On the one hand, the recycling bill passed by the federal parliament in April, expands the amounts of used material piling up each year for recycling. On the other hand, private waste disposers and communities for the most part still do have facilities to produce products from used materials using modern technology. The market itself is another hurdle for recycling. As noted in a report on the sector that has just been submitted by the market research firm of AIK [expansion not given] Kohlhaas & Partner in Krefeld: "Only if the price of used materials covers the cost of collection systems can one expect a working waste recycling system." The Krefeld firm considers continued development of environmental engineering in the direction of improved processes for recycling of used material as the greatest prospect for the used materials business. Better analysis and more effective sorting techniques will result in purer sorting and, as a result, more valuable secondary materials. The sector's response to the recycling boom is the creation of financially powerful waste disposal companies. But this development is not meeting with general approval. Michael Mueller, environmental spokesman for the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] remarks: "The processes leading to concentration in the waste disposal business undercut competition." A major parliamentary question to the federal administration in March by the SPD aims at examining the threat of monopolization. BDE spokesman Hanskarl Willms is also convinced: "Concentration will continue in the sector. Many waste disposal tasks can be tackled only by financially powerful companies because of their sophisticated facilities and technologies." There is hardly any doubt that the large number of waste disposal tasks will grow even more in the future. The reason is that waste avoidance has so far been hardly successful. According to AIK managing director Edgar Kohlhaas: "The political machinery is missing." According to his prediction, even in the future there will be no decline in the amounts of waste material, at best they will hold steady. The new recycling law already acknowledges this: in it recycling is not valued any higher than incineration.
