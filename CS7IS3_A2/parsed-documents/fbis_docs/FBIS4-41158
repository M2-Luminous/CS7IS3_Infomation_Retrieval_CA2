Boris Yeltsin noted the European community had recognized the fact that there was a transitional economy in Russia while the United States had refrained from recognizing this. [Begin Yeltsin recording] A most favored nation status in trade has been given to Russia in Europe. This is very important, too. Russia is only gaining from this.
