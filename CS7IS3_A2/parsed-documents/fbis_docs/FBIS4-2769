The move came a little more than three months after the enforcement of the revised tax laws on personal income, which stipulate that such gains should be taxed. For quite some time, so rife were the rumors and speculations of a possible introduction of the tax that the stock market plummeted. "The issue demands a whole set of principles and enforcement is rather complex," said vice-director of the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) Li Yonggui here today to the Beijing press. "Both the share-holding system and stock market are still in their infant stages. We need time to conduct research on how and when to introduce the tax. "This year and the next, gains from stock transactions will not be taxed," assured Li. Li said, however, whether or not to introduce the tax will depend on the research work and the real situation.
