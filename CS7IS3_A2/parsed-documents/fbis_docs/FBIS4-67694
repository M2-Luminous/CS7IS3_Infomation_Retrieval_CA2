Torres added that the diet program includes eggs, meat, fish, milk, tubers, and vegetables to bolster the regular diet received by every Cuban citizen. However, Torres acknowledged that this special diet is below the 4,000-calorie diet the patients received while at the sanatoriums, and which is still being provided to those kept there. The Cuban hospitalization program began in 1986. Since then, 1,011 HIV carriers have been detected. However, epidemiologists believe that there could be another 200 undetected cases. So far, 164 people have died of AIDS, 12 of them due to unrelated causes. Full-blown AIDS currently effects 256 individuals. The life expectancy of an HIV carrier in Cuba averages 12 years, while the average for AIDS cases is 1.5 years. These indexes are relatively high in comparison with world statistics.
