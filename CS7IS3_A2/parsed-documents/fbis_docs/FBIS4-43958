Ataman told his weekly press conference that the image which the organization attempted to portray about Turkey did not reflect the facts. Ataman said that parliament, independent justice, and a free press were functioning in Turkey which has been a member of the democratic Western community for half a century. `It is a fact that the significant fall of terrorism leads to significant improvements in human rights practices,' he said. Ataman also recalled that Article 8 of the antiterror law, which was criticized by Amnesty, was at present discussed at parliamentary commissions. `Turkey is a transparent democracy. Anyone may visit any place, like a recent visit by Western ambassadors to the southeast,' he said. In an annual report, the human rights group singled out Colombia and Turkey as being particularly aggressive violators and said they appear to be using U.S. military aid for torture, military attacks on civilians and other abuses.
