Tens of thousands of National Autonomous University of Mexico students and faculty members cheered Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas during a 6 June campus rally. Cardenas warned students that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has "set up the mechanisms to commit electoral fraud" and called for a "deluge of democratic votes" to overcome the stumbling blocks, traps, and fraud. Cardenas said the three essential conditions for transition toward democracy are: 1) support for an active and involved civilian society; 2) following Cardenas' victory, the beginning of a transition toward democracy; and 3) a complete revision of constitutional bases and an open debate on a new constitution. (Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 7 Jun 94 p 1A) According to a survey published today in VOZ Y VOTO magazine, the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] has lost 13 percent of its voter support in three years and now registers only 48 percent voter support. The PRI received 61.47 percent of the votes in the 1991 Federal District election. The poll was conducted between 13 and 17 May following the public debate between presidential candidates Zedillo, Fernandez de Cevallos, and Cardenas. Results show the PRI would get 48 percent of the votes; the National Action Party [PAN], 26 percent; the PRD, 9 percent; the Labor Party [PT], 1.48 percent; the Mexican Green Ecologist Party [PVEM], 0.84 percent; the Popular Socialist Party [PPS], 0.71 percent; the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party [PFCRN], 0.32 percent; and the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution [PARM] and the National Opposition Union [UNO], 0.26 percent each. Only 2 percent of those polled indicated they would not vote, and 11 percent declined to respond. Polled on personal versus party appeal, the results varied slightly: PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo would get 49 percent of the votes; PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, 26 percent; PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, 11 percent; PFCRN candidate Rafael Aguilar Talamantes and PT candidate Cecilia Soto, 2 percent each; and UNO candidate Pablo Emilio Madero, 1 percent. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1816 GMT 9 Jun 94) PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo visited a Mexico City railroad station and received an enthusiastic welcome from workers, whom he promised he would give an unprecedented boost to rail transportation and improve living conditions for railroad workers. Zedillo said the only acceptable government is that which is based on valid elections, adding that he was sure "the people would disregard any call to attack institutional rule and the social tranquillity and unity of Mexicans." Zedillo later met with small and medium business representatives, who listened with interest to the PRI economic platform. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94) Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, PAN presidential candidate, said that although the failure to reach a peace agreement in Chiapas is disturbing, it is important that the cease-fire be maintained and that the two parties remain willing to continue talks. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94) Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, PRD presidential candidate, said in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua State, that the failure of the government and of the armed groups in Chiapas to reach a peace agreement should not affect the 21 August elections, nor should it create an atmosphere of instability in the country. Cardenas later met with businessmen in Ciudad Juarez and told them it was necessary to broaden the jurisdiction of state and national human rights groups by extending "their purview to political and labor rights to give greater protection to the rights of all citizens according to the Constitution and the laws." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94) PARM presidential candidate Alvaro Perez Trevino said during the second day of a campaign tour through Zacatecas that a 70-percent voter turnout would be a genuine representation of Mexican citizens in the presidential elections. Trevino was to meet with the university's law school students, but the meeting was canceled due to poor attendance. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94) Referring to the Zapatist National Liberation Army's (EZLN) rejection of the Chiapas peace proposal in Veracruz, PT presidential candidate Cecilia Soto said that "a more precarious peace now exists." She proposed the creation of a secretariat for women to protect women in the labor and legal fields. Soto met with PT party leaders and supporters in Veracruz. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94) Jorge Gonzalez Torres, PVEM presidential candidate, arrived in Oaxaca on 13 June to begin a 10-day tour of Indian communities in the Mizteca and coastal areas and on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Speaking of his commitment to the underprivileged classes in Mexico, Gonzales Torres said the issue is not just "drug trafficking but also includes poverty and the abandonment of peasants and the poor." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 14 Jun 94) Asked about the recent events in Chiapas, PAN presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos said the least the presidential candidates can do is show prudence and not assume opportunistic positions. He said he was not surprised by the EZLN's rejection of the proposal because it was obvious when the document was released that it would be rejected by the guerrilla group. The government's reply to the EZLN was not clear, Fernandez de Cevallos said. He recalled that Subcommander Marcos recently said that EZLN members felt deceived, "but fortunately they said they will not renew the violence." Fernandez de Cevallos said the EZLN insists on further negotiations and wants a new, prudent, and honest effort. He added that the candidates must assume "very delicate" positions. Fernandez de Cevallos said candidates could and should express their opinions on the issue, but warned that any proposal urging the EZLN or the government to take specific action could easily be viewed as opportunistic. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 14 Jun 94 p 5) Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, National Democratic Alliance (ADN) presidential candidate, told those who favor the postponement or cancellation of the elections that he will demand that the elections be held on 21 August as scheduled. During a visit to the Autonomous University of Ciudad Juarez (UACJ), Cardenas also asked the government and the EZLN to renew negotiations and establish conditions for a lasting peace as soon as possible. Cardenas added that the ADN would work within the law and also demand that the law be respected and that the votes be counted fairly. During a morning news conference, he said he did not believe the EZLN announcement rejecting the government offer would affect the upcoming elections. He said the government must seek solutions to local, state, and national issues raised by the EZLN, such as how the government can guarantee clean elections and improve health and education. Cardenas said PRI candidate Zedillo's question to Peace Commissioner Manuel Luis Camacho -- Why has the peace effort failed? -- was directed at the wrong person. "The question should be asked of President Salinas de Gortari," Cardenas said, adding that the recent car bombing incident in Guadalajara "is evidence of the social disintegration caused by the current government."
