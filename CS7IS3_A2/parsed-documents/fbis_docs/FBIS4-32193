President Tudjman stressed that all political parties should primarily take into consideration the basic interests of the Croatian people and the Croatian state. These interests are being expressed today through specific problems, which must be resolved within the Croatian parliament, as a legislative and political representative body. He added that time and energy should not be wasted on useless party bickering of a procedural nature. President Tudjman called on all those present to make additional efforts to find a solution through agreement. But he stressed that the parliamentary speaker was elected legitimately and in accordance with the law, and that this can not be questioned. The parliamentary party presidents agreed that interparty talks should resume immediately with the aim of finding a solution through agreement, the president's office said in a statement.
