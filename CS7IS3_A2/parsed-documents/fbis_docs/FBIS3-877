International observers and non-governmental organisations members fear the IEC is dangerously behind deadline, though senior IEC members insist that they are "on track". Both insiders and outsiders agree, however, that the election date cannot be changed. After just over a month on its feet and a disruptive move from the World Trade Centre to premises in Johannesburg, the IEC is only beginning to put its national infrastructure in place. Furthermore, the lack of clarity on final registration deadlines and the sheer pressure of the task at hand, has caused serious tensions between the IEC's senior directorate staff and its commissioners. According to senior sources, director of electoral administration Piet Colyn tendered his resignation late last week because of interference by the commissioners, but was persuaded to stay. Colyn, the director-general of home affairs, denies that this incident took place. Several commissioners confirm, however, that this tension does exist. "All the authority seems to lie with the directorate," said one, "and it's almost impossible for us to find out what's going on. But we are the ones who are ultimately responsible to the electorate." But another commissioner said "our working relationship with the directorate does not have major problems." Is South Africa going to be ready for an election that will see up to 25-million people pass through about 80,000 voting booths in 10,000 polling stations observed by at least 10,000 monitors and staffed by 207,000 officials? Senior officers have just been appointed in the nine regions, from which they have until the end of the month to set up offices and recruit and train regional monitoring and administrative staff. And the last-minute registration crises, along with the late decision to move from one ballot to two, have placed an unexpected burden on the electoral timetable. Many in the international observer missions and in the NGOs that have been doing monitoring and voter education are anxious that the commission appears to be behind schedule. "People have great expectations," says Alice Coetzee, project director of Idasa's [Institute for a Democratic Alternative for South Africa] Pretoria branch. "I'm scared. If it is a shambles, we're going to muck up our only chance." This sentiment is generally shared by members of the international observer community. The following issues have been raised with the IEC by members of these organisations: - That only a small percentage of the requisite administrative field-staff have been appointed, and that the appointment process is a month behind the timetable the IEC set for itself. - That provincial offices are behind deadlines. - That the double-ballot system might put pressure on voter-flow, which might result in tension at the polling stations. - That the IEC has estimated too few voting compartments. - That the double-ballot system means many of the polling stations will be too small. - That the security forces who will play a crucial role in safeguarding the passage of the ballots have not yet been identified and trained. IEC commissioner Ben van der Ross responded: "We South Africans are a pretty resourceful lot. We're getting the message from the UN crowd that we can't do it. But we'll put this thing together. We're not a Cambodia or one of those places in a state of collapse." Said Bheki Sibiya, the IEC's regional director in kwaZulu-Natal: "Certainly, the situation is slower than it should be...If the job is `substantially' well done, that's the best we can hope for." Senior officials of the IEC's monitoring and electoral administration directorates are convinced that, even with the delays and hitches caused by the registration uncertainty, they can have their structures in place in time. Colyn said that nearly 2,000 district electoral officers will be in place in two weeks. "And once they are there, it's an easy job recruiting officials to staff the polling stations." Monitoring director Peter Harris said his department was also "on track". His department is recruiting and training monitors at the rate of around a thousand a week, and he is certain the 10,000 monitors will be in place by early April. Monitoring logistics chief Francis Wilson knows that anxiety is rife at the apparent lateness of appointments, but said "the bulk of the monitors aren't needed until the polling days." Van der Ross underscored this point: "Yes, it's true that we need 200,000 electoral officials. But about 150,000 of these are just to be employed for a couple of days, and their job will be quite mechanical. Really, they don't need more than an hour of training." Mary Burton, presiding officer in the Western Cape, is cool and confident about the task ahead of her: "The time scale looks manageable". She, along with many other newly-appointed IEC officials, noted that applications for positions and offers of secondment from the business and non-governmental sectors are pouring in. "I think," said one official, "that a few people are panicking. that's to be expected...give us a chance to actually put our structures in place." Colyn acknowledged that "our major concern is violence. What happens, for example, if the situation is so violent in an area that polling officials don't report for duty? It is my duty to plan for alternatives". Van der Ross said the double-ballot system has caused logistical problems and there was difficulty in locating large enough polling stations. The overwhelming sense from all the senior IEC officials canvassed is the election will not be smooth and flawless but, given the limited amount of time, it will happen. There's an aphorism going round the IEC's new nine-floor premises on Kruis Street: the commission's work is like building a ship while already at sea. Swimming against a tide of unpacked boxes and unconnected telephone-lines earlier this week, one wag was moved to quip: "Let's hope it's an ark, and not the Titanic."
