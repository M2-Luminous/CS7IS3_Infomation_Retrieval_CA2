The Requiem Mass, as assistant rapporteur Gustavo Krause put it, was celebrated last Wednesday "to the sounds of Minister Ricupero's Gregorian chant." Krause was referring to the finance minister's last-ditch effort to salvage votes on some items. Rubens Ricupero's hopes were as commendable as they were futile, since nothing, really nothing, can be done when the absence of a political compact is actually a smoke screen for cowardice. And so much the worse when people choose to blame others for the absence of character that enables one to acknowledge one's own mistakes. That was the case with all those who, preoccupied with October's election, fled from a confrontation on fundamental issues. For public consumption, they pretended that subjects like ending the monopolies, tax and social security reform, and changes in the election system had nothing to do with the daily lives of the citizens. It was easier to make it look as though only those people out there in Brasilia need be concerned about all that. This is false, because everyone retires, pays taxes, votes, and--especially--prefers not to see his money used to finance someone's excessive privilege. What is serious about this deceptive posture is the criminal significance it harbors. The case of Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] is an example. TV ads--paid for by the taxpayers, since they were financed by tithes deducted from the salaries of its employees--repeated over and over that ending the petroleum monopoly was synonymous with handing Brazil over to foreign interests [entreguismo]. By ignoring the modernity of the concept, actually so decrepit as to border on the sclerotic, the sponsors of this campaign are lying to the public. Why else didn't they depict on television the money pit that is Petrobras today? Why didn't they answer Nelson Jobim, rapporteur of the revision, when in an official capacity he sought to find out how much the state enterprise paid the government in dividends last year? Because then, by presenting the figures that demonstrate the disgraceful gigantism on which society earns no return, they would be exposing what lies behind the ostensible protection of the national patrimony: the defense of personal privileges in the case of the employees, and protection of a robust cash cow, in the case of the politicians. Since prudence dictates that one avoid generalizations like the plague, it is really better to name names. Here we have the case, made to order, of the PT. With its candidate for president of Brazil ranking well ahead in the polls, the party should long since have realized its folly. Or does the PT intend to govern with the tax system as it is? Or will it keep Social Security the way it is now? Of course not. Well, the party that fled the revision out of fear of facing issues that would expose the clout of the vested interests and inevitably result in breaking their stranglehold will, if it takes over in 1995, have nowhere to run. And there we encounter, once again, a typical case of ideological dishonesty. Afraid to lose votes, Lula has tried to serve two masters. He neither allowed the party to stand in opposition to the corporativist electorate nor let the PT defend nonstatist positions during the debate. Of course he needs the vested interests, but he also needs the middle class, which does not depend on the State. So he is trying to have it both ways. Obviously, if he is elected, he will make someone mad. One of the two sides will soon realize it has been deceived. Had it entered the debate now, the PT would always have had the option to let the reforms take place, vote against them, and pretend it had nothing to do with the outcome. With Lula in Planalto Palace, things change a little. His party will not have a majority. Therefore, he will need to play with the same political skill that he now says the leaders of the revision process lacked. Since he will need the reforms, the currency that the liberals will demand in exchange will be precisely the end of the monopolies. And then, since the PT will no longer have the alternative of pretending it has nothing to do with the matter, its only option will be to negotiate. Or to submit.
