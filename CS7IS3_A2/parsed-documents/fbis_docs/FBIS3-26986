According to the IAA spokesman, the DPRK informed the IAA that it is willing to let the IAA inspect its nuclear installations. If there is no abrupt change or turnaround, it will ease the situation on the Korean peninsula and will have a good impact on the DPRK's economic development. The DPRK made public its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty last March. Suddenly, the international community put more stake in the widely circulating rumor that the DPRK was secretly and intensively developing nuclear weapons. In particular, the anxiety of the ROK, the United States, and Japan was expressed repeatedly by their officials and their media. Not long ago, the United States said that economic sanctions would be applied against Pyongyang and that U.S. "Patriot" missiles would be deployed in the ROK. Japan also suggested indirectly that it had the capability to rapidly develop nuclear bombs. The ROK was particularly on alert. For a long time, the DPRK has seldom made contact with the outside world, and the international community does not have an appropriate and normal understanding of its political, economic, and military situations. Moreover, the annual U.S.-ROK joint military exercises cause the authorities in Pyongyang to lose their trust in the outside world and make them more nervous. Not long ago, there was a rumor that the DPRK had deployed many more troops in areas north of the 38th parallel. The DPRK has strong military strength, but its domestic economic situation is extremely difficult. In particular, with the disintegration of the Soviet Union, regular economic aid has been cut off, gasoline and energy are in short supply, foreign exchange has been exhausted, and its people are living in privation. Moreover, President Kim Il-song is getting old, and it is still not known whether his son Kim Chong-il will be able to succeed him. The outside world has expressed different views on the question of whether Kim Chong-il can assume the great task of leading the DPRK, but most are pessimistic. China Is Concerned About the Situation on the Korean Peninsula The DPRK should, however, pay closest attention to its economic problems. The DPRK has still failed to break away from its impoverished state. Naturally, China, as a close neighbor of the DPRK, is very concerned about the situation. From the Korean war to the post-war construction period, China paid a high price for selflessly aiding the DPRK. However, with the changes in the global situation, particularly after China started implementing the policy of opening up to the outside world in the 1980's, tremendous new changes have taken place in China's economy. China very much hopes that the DPRK can draw on its experience and adopt flexible domestic and foreign policies to attract foreign investment, to develop the domestic economy, and to ease relations with the ROK first before discussing economic exchanges between the North and the South. To our disappointment, however, the two Koreas have not been able to get beyond their feelings of mutual distrust, even though they have repeatedly held contacts with one other. Consequently, financial groups in the south still cannot invest in the north. The two sides of the strait are engaged in massive economic dealings with one another, which brings many advantages to compatriots on both sides. Hence, the DPRK should draw on China's example to adopt its own flexible policies. The Improvement of U.S.-Vietnamese Relations Does Have an Impact Pyongyang's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has damaged its international image. If it really develops nuclear weapons, it will not have the national strength to bear the burden of the consequences, which may even slow down economic development. Today, the DPRK has come to the stage in which it must change course and strike out on a new path. Ronald Dellums, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, will visit Pyongyang in the next few days to try to break the deadlock over U.S.-DPRK relations. This kind of high-level direct contact helps promote mutual understanding. The fact that agreement has been reached on the issue of nuclear inspections will be more advantageous to improving bilateral relations between the United States and the DPRK. It was reported that Kim Il-song had asked Billy Graham, a U.S. religious figure who had earlier visited Pyongyang, to convey to Clinton his suggestion of holding a U.S.-DPRK summit. Viewed from this angle, it seems that Pyongyang is ready to change its U.S. policy. The United States and Vietnam fought a bloody war for a decade, but their relations have greatly improved recently, and this should help awaken Pyongyang.
