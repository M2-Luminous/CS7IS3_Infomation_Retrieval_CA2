[Begin recording] [Peres] Well, we appreciate the call. We would like to see a more definite language, but this is a decision for Mr. 'Arafat, not for us. We shall condemn any and every act of terror whether it will be against innocent Arab people or innocent Israeli people. Nobody has the right to take away the life of anybody. [Rhodes] Has the Israeli Government expressed to 'Arafat that they would like him to use stronger language? [Peres] We are not offering lessons to anybody. It is for 'Arafat to decide the language he wants to use. [Rhodes] Is the Israeli Government satisfied with what he said? [Peres] Our job is to provide security and to continue with peace. We are not in the business of reviews. [Rhodes] The opposition is saying that if 'Arafat cannot even come out and condemn the attack, what kind of peace are we actually making? Can you comment on that? [Peres] He is making peace with us. You know, the opposition is measuring and judging everything by declarations. Declarations are important. They are not the most important thing, and I do see that the opposition is having a summer collection of wintry declarations. It is of no importance. Words are words and actions are actions, and changes are changes, and we are not in the business of confusing it like the right is doing. [end recording] [In a similar report on Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 14 April, referring to 'Arafat's response to the latest terrorist attack, Peres says in a recorded passage: "I believe that for his own sake and for the sake of his nation, he should come out with the sharpest condemnation of terror."]
