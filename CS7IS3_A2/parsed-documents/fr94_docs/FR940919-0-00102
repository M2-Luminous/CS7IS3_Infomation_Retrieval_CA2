FR940919-0-00102 FR940919-0-00016 D. Required and Available Capacity for Newly Listed and Identified Wastes Mixed with Radioactive Components EPA has defined a mixed RCRA/radioactive waste as any matrix containing a RCRA hazardous waste and a radioactive waste subject to the Atomic Energy Act (53 FR 37045&hyph;37046, September 23, 1988). These mixed wastes are subject to RCRA hazardous waste regulations, including the LDRs, regardless of the type of radioactive constituents contained in these wastes. Radioactive wastes that are mixed with spent solvents, dioxins, California list wastes, First Third, Second Third, or Third Third wastes, and Phase I wastes, are subject to the LDRs already promulgated for these hazardous wastes. EPA granted national capacity variances for all of these mixed wastes because of a lack of national treatment capacity. Today's rule addresses the radioactive wastes that contain newly listed and identified hazardous wastes being restricted in today's rulemaking. Based on comments received by EPA in response to the proposed rule, the ANPRM (56 FR 55160, October 24, 1991), and previous rulemakings, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is the primary generator of mixed RCRA/radioactive wastes. A variety of non-DOE facilities also generate mixed wastes, including nuclear power plants, academic and medical institutions, and industrial facilities. 1. Waste Generation a. Non-soil and Non-debris Mixed Radioactive Wastes In April 1993, DOE released the Interim Mixed Waste Inventory Report (IMWIR), which included a national inventory of all mixed wastes that were being stored or would be generated over the next five years and a national inventory of mixed waste treatment capacities and technologies. The report provides waste stream-specific and treatment facility-specific information for each site managing DOE wastes. This report is currently being updated; however the Final Mixed Waste Inventory Report (MWIR) Data Base that will be used to develop the Final MWIR was made public in May, 1994. This Data Base was used to determine the quantity of DOE-generated mixed waste requiring treatment. Based on the MWIR data, EPA estimates that DOE generates 1,700 m 3 /yr of non-soil, non-debris mixed radioactive waste contaminated with TC organic constituents. In addition, DOE currently has 19,000 m 3 of these wastes in storage. Table 4 lists the quantities of each category of non-soil, non-debris mixed waste that DOE expects to generate annually, as well as the amount currently in storage.
