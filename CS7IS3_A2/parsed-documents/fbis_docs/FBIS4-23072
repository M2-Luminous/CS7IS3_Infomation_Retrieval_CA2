M. Levin; UDC 621.396.67.01] [Abstract] An expression is derived which links the input resistance of a symmetric two-sided slot antenna on a circular infinitely long metal cone and the excited vertex with the input resistance of a metal vibrator whose shape and dimensions coincide with those of the slot. The input resistance of the slot and metal vibrators on a cone and pyramid are calculated with a method based on calculation of the wave resistance of a homogeneous line of infinite length. A radiator placed along the edges of a pyramid is easier to implement th an a conical radiator in the shortwave range or at lower frequencies. The conical and pyramidal radiators examined here have a constant and purely active input resistance, which provides a high matching level. If the radiator has finite dimensions, the range of frequencies is limited, but still rather wide. Figures 4; references 7: 6 Russian, 1 Western.
