His interview is published in today's issue of the daily. "The Ukrainian leader," the newspaper says, quoting his pronouncements, "has stressed that his republic should rely primarily on relations with the states of the former Soviet Union and the East European nations in order to improve the economic situation in the country. "To make the CIS economic union function effectively," Landyk believes, "it is necessary, first and foremost, to create a system for mutual settlements, based on a specialised inter-state bank."
