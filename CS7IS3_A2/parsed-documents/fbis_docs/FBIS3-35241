This was disclosed by Minister Musa, who pointed out that Egypt and Turkey are holding constant consultations over this issue. Answering a question on the approaching deadline given to the Bosnian Serbs with regard to weapons withdrawal from Sarajevo, the Egyptian foreign minister told news reporters that the Serbs will have to withdraw all their heavy weapons to a distance of 20 km from Sarajevo. The removal of heavy guns, he added, should be comprehensive and not partial. The foreign minister said that in the case of the partial withdrawal of weapons, the NATO's responsibility will continue. With the expiration of the deadline, Musa said, one of two things should take place: either the total withdrawal of all guns or a strike at Serbian positions. Asked about the situation in other parts of Bosnia, Minister Musa said that decisions concerning Sarajevo should be applicable to other besieged areas of Bosnia. Concerning his meeting with the Israeli ambassador in Cairo today, Minister Musa said that the meeting dealt with the Palestinian-Israeli talks that will be held in Cairo tomorrow, Monday. Asked about reports of agreements or security arrangements reached between Iran and some Gulf countries and how such a development would affect the Damascus Declaration, Minister Musa said that these arrangements are still just news reports. The Egyptian foreign minister said that there is no indication of official movement in this direction.
