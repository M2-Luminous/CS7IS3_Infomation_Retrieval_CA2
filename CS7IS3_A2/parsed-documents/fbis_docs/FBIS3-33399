A letter of intent, which represents great prospects for the possibility of developing cooperation in various areas, was signed today at the Minrex [Ministry of Foreign Relations] by Manuel Hermoso Rojas, president of the government of the Canary Islands, and Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice president of the Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers. The agreement provides for the display and trade of products and for support to Cuba for the development of its activities in Spain and the European Economic Community. Referring to the significance of the agreement, Hermoso Rojas said: [Begin recording] Today we are signing an agreement which concludes one more of the many talks we have been holding over the past few days concerning possible cooperation between Cuba and the Canary Islands. I have to say that every time we had to discuss a concrete issue, immense possibilities for cooperation emerged. The great tradition prevailing between the peoples of Cuba and the Canary Islands has been maintained. The people of the Canary Islands have been something peculiar to Spain in that they have been known as the islanders of Cuba [sentence as heard]. And we islanders have come with the purpose of cooperating. The agreements are no longer restricted to culture, but are also extended to the universities, to commercial relations, and, I hope, they will also be extended to the area of tourism. [end recording] Before the signing of the agreement, the president of the Canary Islands Government held a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, during which they discussed subjects of mutual interest.
