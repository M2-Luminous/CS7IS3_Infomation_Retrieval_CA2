In his today's statement Kostikov says hasty conclusions are being drawn out of a private incident, conclusions that affect the essence of the U.S.-Russian relations. As the press secretary noted, there can be no question of preventing foreign visitors' contacts with opposition leaders. It is in the Russian Government's interest that the full picture of political life in Russia is known abroad. It was expected that Richard Nixon, a well-known supporter of democratic transformations in Russia, will use his visit to Moscow with such an aim in mind. However, the ex-president's meeting with Aleksandr Rutskoy created a certain context that touched upon the complicated political moments in Russia's internal affairs, the press secretary believes. According to Kostikov, considerable part of the Russian public see Aleksandr Rutskoy as one of the main organizers of the October revolt and a serious threat to democracy and civil accord. As regards to relations between Moscow and Washington, Boris Yeltsin has repeatedly stated the importance of developing friendly, partner-like ties with the United States, the statement says.
