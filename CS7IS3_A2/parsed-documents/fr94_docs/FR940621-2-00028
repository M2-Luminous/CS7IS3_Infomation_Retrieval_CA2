FR940621-2-00028 FR940621-2-00018 Financial Assistance Award; Energy Efficiency Export Council AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award. SUMMARY: Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Region I Support Office, through the Golden Field Office, intends to award a grant to the Energy Efficiency Export Council (EEEC) to complete a series of tasks related to export promotion of U.S. energy efficiency products and services. The EEEC efforts are on behalf of and in collaboration with the Committee on Energy Efficiency Commerce and Trade (COEECT). COEECT functions as the Federal Interagency Working Subgroup on Energy Efficiency established by Section 1207 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, H.R. 776 (EPACT). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposal, which was negotiated with the DOE, Office of Technical Assistance (OTA), establishes funding for tasks related to increasing the export of U.S. energy efficiency products and services to be completed by the Energy Efficiency Export Council (EEEC). EEEC is made up of five non-profits: the Alliance to Save Energy, the International Institute for Energy Conservation, the National Association of State Energy Officials, the National Association of Energy Service Companies and the Solar Energy Industries Association. Tasks to be completed include: (1) a series of national and regional meetings to educate the U.S. energy efficiency industry about how to export; (2) energy efficiency market assessments in developing and transitional countries i.e. Chile and also Mexico or Russia and advanced marketing of U.S. energy efficiency products and services; (3) publications to provide guidance on exporting to the energy efficiency industry; and (4) assessment of the economic feasibility of performance contracts in Russia. The completion of these tasks should result in an increase in exports of U.S. energy efficiency products and services. Total funding is $580,000. Noncompetitive financial assistance to EEEC is in accordance with the justifying criteria presented in 10 CFR 600. The DOE/OTA has determined that EEEC has exclusive domestic capability to represent and interact with the U.S. energy efficiency products and services industry, and, is, therefore, uniquely capable to fulfill many aspects of the mission established for the COEECT by Section 1207 of EPACT.
