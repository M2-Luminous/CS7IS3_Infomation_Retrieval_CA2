Morocco's official stance has ranged from caution to semi-silence, avoiding any involvement in the conflict. This is in contrast to the stances of the Moroccan political parties. Some of these parties, such as the Independence Party, support the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] while others, such as the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, support the Algerian Government. Undoubtedly, the fundamentalist movement began to grow in a serious manner in the sixties and mid-seventies. This does not mean that the Moroccan parties did not contain Islamic factions. On the contrary, these Islamic factions were able to make their words heard within their own parties, such as the faction of Shaykh Mohamed Ben-al-'Arabi al-'Alawi in the National Union of Popular Forces and the faction of Habib Farkani in the Socialist Union of Popular Forces. The religious issue spawned by the growth of the fundamentalist movement is influenced by a number of pressing factors that come from the very core of society. These factors have diminished the political Islamic groups' ability for movement, maneuvering, preaching, and guidance. Although Morocco, like other Islamic and Arab states, is experiencing a conflict between two kinds of logic that barely coexist--the logic of the state and the logic of the Islamic call--it has sought from the outset to use the call to serve the state. It has not done this in a crude way but has made the call one of the factors for building the state. The state opened a number of channels through which it sought to control the call's course by controlling the scholars, who were the main activists. It supervised their work, guided them, and put them under surveillance. The state established the "Dar al-Hadith al- Hasaniyah" in 1964 and entrusted it with taking care of higher Islamic studies, which specialize in the science of the Koran and Sunna [body of Islamic custom and practice based on Prophet Muhammad's words and deeds]. The political authority's success in containing the call and controlling its work has enabled it to undermine competing and undesirable channels. The Scholars Authority was merged into the civil service. If the Friday preachers violated the directives of the Ministry of Awqaf, the latter would prevent them and even dismiss them if necessary. The scholars' role was confined to protecting the unity of the nation on the level of religion and creed. King Hassan II said: I am afraid for Islam from the Muslims. He adds: There is no exaggeration, no excessiveness, and no bigotry in religion. No one is a custodian of others. No one must dictate to others behavior, ethics, and daily activities of society. In the seventies Morocco witnessed extremist leftist currents that tried the course of political violence but failed. In the eighties Islamic extremist groups such as "Fasil al-Jihad" and "Katibat Badr" tried to adopt a strategy of violence to bring about political change. The security authorities, however, succeeded in dismantling them and convicting their members in 1984 and 1985. Not only did fundamentalism in Morocco fail in its armed violence but the call also did not receive an attentive ear for several reasons: 1. The longevity of the monarchy in Morocco, which dates to the eighth century when Idris Bin-'Abdallah sought refuge in Morocco after his escape from a massacre during the 'Abbasid era. The Aurbah tribe gave him refuge, honored him, and established ties of marriage with him. This tribe and others chose him as king and recognized his only son, Idris II, as his successor. In 1809 [as published] Idris II founded Fes and made it his capital. With time, and thanks to the efforts of the 'Alawite kings, it became one of the most important centers of Islam. It is no coincidence that the monarchy in Morocco is popular and Islamic. If it were not for the congruity between monarchy and Islam, we would not be able to speak about a Moroccan nation that has its prerequisites and unity. King Hassan has maintained harmony among the people and has achieved and upheld the country's unity despite the existence of multiple tribes and divergent views. The state's sole authority controlled the remote areas and the interior of the country in a secure, legislative, and economic unity encompassing shepherds, farmers, merchants, and sailors. 2. The Salafiyah [early 20th century movement led by reformers wishing to reconcile Muslim traditions with modern life and justify Muslim tenets through rational arguments] is the backdrop of the Moroccan nationalist movement. Since it took shape in the early thirties, the nationalist movement in Morocco leaned heavily on Islam in its fight against the protectorate [French] authorities. Thanks to its great pioneer, Alal el-Fassi, the national movement maintained a healthy Islamic attitude, dismissing dogmatic ideas, and denouncing misguided practices. The Salafiyah played an important role in the resistance against protectorate powers. The national movement did all it could to join forces with other groups involved in resisting the occupation, including mystic schools and Sufi [Muslim esoteric societies usually featuring a guru, initiation rites, and claims of psychic powers] movements. All differences were set aside in the common cause of achieving reform and liberation. Thus, all the above-mentioned groups joined in one movement whose aim was Moroccan nationalism: liberation and independence. Mystic traditions blended with the desire for reform, creating a sense of flexibility and a clarity of goal that greatly suited the simple tenets of Moroccan Sufism. 3. The civic code. A collection of laws regulating family relations was passed under the aegis of political authorities wishing to combine Islamic tenets, traditions, and the teachings of Imam Malik [early Muslim legislator] in one body of laws. A committee of ulema, judges, and legal experts were put to work and finally produced a civic code reminiscent of that of Tunisia. In many instances, the code recognizes equality between men and women. Despite widespread liberalism in Morocco, there is a certain balance between liberalism and Islamic values. Social freedoms steer clear of Muslim sensibilities. The port city of Sale, for instance, boasts many sidewalk cafes, busy with customers whiling away the time in the winter sun, but not one liquor shop. Morocco may be a Third World country that needs assistance, but neither its government nor its people are destitute. Its agricultural reform plan was a dazzling success. Morocco has met its international financial obligations, reinforcing confidence in its future. Morocco does not only enjoy political and economic stability, it also has political parties with a Salafi penchant. These parties are always trying to win over the Islamic tide. These efforts have robbed the fundamentalists of much of their lure and have diminished their political appeal. The fundamentalists have no grassroots support among the working classes or any presence to speak of in the countryside. Their activists work exclusively in big cities and among students. The Moroccans are open minded and moderate by nature. They see no contradiction between going to the mosque and adopting modern ways. The Moroccan family acts as a safety valve, for it greatly influences the cultural and professional lives of its members. Family bonds are stronger than political ones in that country. For all the above reasons, Moroccan fundamentalism has been unable to "strike back" and claim an exclusive mandate in matters of faith. Its field of action is confined to things political, which puts it in direct competition with other parties. Its appeal is ineffective and its record unimpressive. For lack of a better cause, Shaykh Abdessalam Yassine, a top fundamentalist preacher, advocates a brand of Sufism "that cannot be learned by study and earnest reading" or be found between the covers of a book. Morocco is a country with challenges on its mind. Shaykh Yassine's other-worldly appeal is no help in facing these challenges.
