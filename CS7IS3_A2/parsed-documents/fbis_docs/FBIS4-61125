The rate will be 60 manats per dollar, while the official rate is 10 per dollar, and is expected to stay until further notice by the Central Bank. Meanwhile, the street value of the dollar in Ashkhabad is 90 to 95 manats. All banks are allowed to buy hard currency at that commercial rate. The country's Vneshekonombank (foreign economic bank) and the joint stock commercial bank Turkmenistan have a right to exchange manats for dollars at this rate for Turkmenistan citizens go abroad while the Investbank will sell hard currency to individuals in cashless transactions to enable them to pay for cargo transportation abroad. The banks will not handle transactions with individuals involving more than 500 dlrs. In mid-March the manat was devalued from 1.99 to 10 per dollar. Simultaneously the government announced its intention to introduce a floating rate of exchange which was to be dictated by the prices at the country's inter-bank exchange. Following the first trading on 14 March 1994, when the banks sold 150,000 dlrs at a rate of 10 manats the exchange was suspended and the official rate stayed invariable despite the 30 percent monthly inflation rate.
