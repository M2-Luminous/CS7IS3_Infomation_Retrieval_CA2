It was caused less by the events in Germany than by those on the international financial and capital markets. No central bank can accept direct responsibility for the development of the capital market interest rates but can only reduce the expectations of inflation. Referring to the German money supply, which has soared 20.6 percent, Tietmeyer warned against precipitate conclusions, because the money supply reflects a number of special influences. Even though it is not easy to distinguish the special factors from the trend, in the future, too, the M3 money supply will be watched closely as one of the essential indicators. The decisions of the Bundesbank are based on the overall economic development. Therefore, the money market interest rates need not remain at the current level.
