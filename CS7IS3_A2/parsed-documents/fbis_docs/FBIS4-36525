In an interview with AL-QUDS, he asked: How could I enter my country with this deadly financial crisis? I must have something in my hand with which I will be able to ease the suffering of my struggling people. Nevertheless, the date of my return and the return of the Palestinian leadership will be determined shortly, God willing. We will announce this to all in due time. 'Arafat said: The donor states will meet tomorrow. I will attend the meeting to secure approval for the aid that the donor nations will provide when they set a definite date, despite their several considerations and their relatively harsh bureaucracy, which requires that they must await the result of their study of our projects and our return to the homeland. He added: We will remind the donor states that they must keep their promises. We must not let them promise us and then not keep their promises. They have promised us funds to help us build our future state. It is the future and the obligations it incurs. We must continue our efforts with these states to persuade them of our projects, our country's infrastructure, and the state it has reached. On his view of the Palestinians' future and what the masses should do to contribute to this future, Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat] said: Our future is proceeding, God willing, in steady steps toward better times. Having set foot on our chaste land, we will achieve what we have all aspired to in terms of establishing a state, stability, freedom, and democracy. Naturally, this will be achieved through the cohesion and solidarity of all the sons of our people, the ending of hatred, and the unification of efforts to build with strong fists, which will continue to work day and night. We will not look backward but always forward, leaving behind us the false slogans and the subversive and tendentious rumors. Regarding the Israelis' attempts to impose a fait accompli that Jerusalem is their capital, he said that holy Jerusalem is in his conscience, mind, and heart. He said that as long as there is a Declaration of Principles and an agreement to discuss the issue of Jerusalem, whatever the Israelis say is for local consumption and to satisfy the motives of various sectors of the Jewish people. He said: They use the Torah as a reference. We use what is much more recent, the "Umari Covenant" [Pledge by Caliph 'Umar Ibn-al- Khattab who opened Jerusalem in 637 A.D.]. Holy Jerusalem is occupied and is an indivisible part of the territories occupied in 1967. All the states of the world approve this principle. They also approve the principle of withdrawal from the occupied territories in return for peace. He said that regardless of the passage of time, there will be no abandonment of our holy Jerusalem, the capital of our independent state. There is no need for anyone to reassure us. With our own efforts, no matter how tiring they may be, our Jerusalem will remain for us. On the rumors circulating regarding his health, the Palestinian leader said that he is well and in good health. It was a passing illness. He said: We will not pay attention to the hostile rumors. We must always try with all our efforts and with our people's very high ethics to turn the foes into helpers. We are a people with high ideals and we love everyone. Our honorable motives are to build our country. We extend our hand in peace to the whole world without exception. Concluding, he said: How great are our Palestinian people with their ethics, morals, and struggle. How can I not be in good health when the people are with me and I am with them? I sincerely pray to God to enable me to do my best to serve this magnanimous people.
