ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Washington for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10). The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy certain Federal requirements of an approvable moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP for Tacoma, Washington. In the final rules section of this Federal Register, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received in writing by November 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to Montel Livingston, Environmental Protection Specialist (AT&hyph;082), Air Programs Section, at the EPA Regional Office listed below. Copies of the documents relevant to this proposed rule are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations. The interested persons wanting to examine these documents should make an appointment with the appropriate office at least 24 hours before the visiting day.
