In an earlier exclusive interview with INTERFAX, Meshkov made it clear that the Crimean naval forces are strong enough to defend this peninsula on the Black Sea. As the press-service noted, "Since responsibilities for national defense rest with the country's president and defense minister and since the Crimea is, although autonomous, also an integral part of the Ukraine, it is exclusively within the competence of Ukraine's president to discuss Ukrainian troop withdrawal from the Crimea." "Meshkov is not a military man, and therefore cannot assess the defense sufficiency of southern Ukraine," the press service noted.
