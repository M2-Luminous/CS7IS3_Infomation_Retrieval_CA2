The Kremlin is frankly claiming its sphere of influence in eastern and central Europe, where Russians think that Washington has nothing to do. Under such circumstances, the Chisinau officials plead for neutrality; this gesture is equivalent to "an act of national suicide," the quoted source asserts. President Snegur signs the adherence to the NATO program Partnership for Peace, and then tells Moscow, Tiraspol, and Comrat that this "will not make the Republic of Moldova orient itself toward the West and that it will remain a neutral state." The adherence to the Partnership for Peace requests the abandoning of the neutral policy in the prospect of gradual integration in European military structures. The Romanian space has always sought a support in the West, and when it could not find one, it had losses: An example is the loss of Bessarabia and Transylvania by [Romania's King] Carol II in 1940. In the situation when both sides want the expansion of their territory of influence, "our incorporation into the free world" is mandatory. Otherwise, the present state of this territory will degenerate in a free fall into the chasm of history, the author believes.
