Today the 91st conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union has opened there at the UNESCO headquarters. Yevgeniy Lukyanov, our Paris correspondent, gives the details. [Begin recording] [Lukyanov] The activities of the Inter-Parliamentary Union are widespread. They are mainly directed towards developing cooperation between peoples for peace on the planet. They also help to establish contacts between parliaments and parliamentarians of various countries, exchange work experience, and defend human rights, the basic factor of parliamentary democracy. The agenda of the present conference, which will work until 6 March, includes lots of questions. The two main issues that will be discussed concern problems connected with the prevention of conflicts, the maintenance of peace, as well as the problem of protecting the environment from various wastes of human activity, a problem that has now become a burning issue. A delegation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which includes the chairman of the Russian Federation council and the chairmen of the Supreme Soviets of Belarus and Kyrgyzstan, has arrived in Paris to participate in the present conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. I asked Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament and chairman of the inter-parliamentary assembly of the participating CIS states, to tell us about the aims of the CIS delegation, which has the status of observer at the conference. [Shumeyko] [Words indistinct] about 120 representatives of parliaments of various states have got together. There is considerable interest in our inter-parliamentary assembly, because the CIS, about which we talked so much with you, has not been in existence for long. At the last plenary sitting we agreed to use abbreviations less and that it is better to use the word Commonwealth. Many parliaments express an interest now in what the inter-parliamentary assembly of the former Soviet Union, and today of free sovereign states, itself intends to do, what aims it has, what approaches. Is Russia turning once again to a totalitarian path, an imperial path, the unification of peoples? I think this will never happen, and we, with our assembly, will show this. I will evidently read a paper here, at least the French side [word indistinct] this. I will try to tell of our goals and tasks and explain to the world that we come with peace. [end recording]
