The SDP chief made the pitch when he and SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo met with Hosokawa at the premier's official residence for almost an hour. Murayama said he spoke of the need for the cabinet to be united to tackle economic issues and expressed his opposition to an early cabinet reshuffle. "We think something that creates a crack in the cabinet should be avoided," he asserted. Hosokawa explained he wanted to focus on pressing economic issues such as strained trade ties with the United States and deregulation and sought the SDP's cooperation, Murayama said. The SDP chairman reiterated that the government must concentrate on passing the fiscal 1994 state budget as early as possible as a way to breathe life into the ailing Japanese economy.
