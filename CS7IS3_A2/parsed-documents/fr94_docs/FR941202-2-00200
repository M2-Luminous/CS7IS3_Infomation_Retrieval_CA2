FR941202-2-00200 FR941202-2-00098 _Current physical location; _Maintenance log; and _Calibration information, if appropriate. 5.7␣Test Methods and Standard Operating Procedures When the use of approved methods for a specific sample matrix is required, only those methods shall be used. In addition, where performance-based methods or non-legally mandated methods are permitted, the relevant start-up and ongoing validation procedures, and calibrations as specified in 5.7.2 must be followed and documented. The criteria listed in 5.7 must be met for all methods and SOPs. 5.7.1␣Laboratory Method Manual(s) and Standard Operating Procedures Each certified laboratory shall have and maintain an in-house methods manual(s) and SOPs. The methods manual(s) and any associated reference works (if required) shall be available to the bench analyst. For each analyte certified, a method or methods to be used by the laboratory shall be described in the methods manual. The method description shall include: _Analyte name and qualifier (the qualifier is a word, phrase or number that better identifies the method; e.g., ``Iron, Total'', or ``Chloride, Automated Ferricyanide'', or ``Our Lab. Method SOP No. 101''); _Applicable matrix or matrices; _Method detection limit; _Scope and application; _Summary of the method; _Definitions; _Interferences; _Safety; _Equipment and supplies; _Reagents and standards; _Sample collection, preservation, shipment and storage; _Quality control; _Calibration and standardization; _Procedure; _Data analysis and calculations; _Method performance; _Pollution prevention; _Waste management; _References; and _Any tables, diagrams, flowcharts and validation data. 5.7.2␣Method Validation/Initial Demonstration of Method Performance (Performance-Based Methods and Non-Approved Methods) Prior to acceptance and institution of any method, satisfactory initial demonstration of method performance, in conformance with the relevant EPA guidelines, is required. In the absence of method-specified requirements, this demonstration shall follow the outlined protocols of Paragraph 8.1.1 and Section 8.2 in the methods published in 40 CFR Part 136, Appendix A. Thereafter, continuing demonstration of method performance, in conformance with the relevant EPA guidelines, is required. In both cases, the appropriate standard Performance Based Method System (PBMS) checklist (see Appendix B) must be completed, submitted to the accrediting organization, and a copy must be retained in the laboratory. All associated supporting data necessary to reproduce the analytical results summarized in the checklists must be retained by the laboratory. Initial demonstration of method performance must be completed each time there is a change in equipment, personnel or procedure.
