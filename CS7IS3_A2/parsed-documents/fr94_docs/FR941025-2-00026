FR941025-2-00026 FR941025-2-00021 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION [CFDA No. 84.073] Office of Educational Research and Improvement_National Diffusion Network (NDN); Program Effectiveness Panel (PEP) Notice of Deadline for Submitting Projects for Validation by PEP for NDN Grants Summary: The NDN is a federally funded dissemination system that helps improve the quality of public and private schools, colleges, and other educational institutions by sharing information about and assisting in the implementation of successful education programs, products, and processes. The Department conducts a grants competition each spring to fund the dissemination and implementation of new projects. To be eligible to compete for NDN funds, projects must have obtained validation from the Program Effectiveness Panel (PEP). The PEP is the NDN's primary mechanism for validating the effectiveness of educational programs developed by schools, universities, and other entities. Based on evidence which applicants submit, the PEP judges the difficulties of the goals which particular programs are designed to meet, whether those programs are effective in attaining their goals, and whether similar results are likely to be attained by others who use the program. Any project or product approved by the PEP becomes a member of the National Diffusion Network, and may begin to disseminate that project under the auspices of the NDN, and also becomes eligible to compete for NDN funding, as desired. This notice establishes an annual deadline by which projects must be submitted to PEP for validation. Projects received by PEP by the deadline will receive validation results in sufficient time to determine whether the project is eligible to compete for NDN funds in the following spring grant competition. State educational agencies, local educational agencies, institutions of higher education, and other public or non-profit private agencies, organizations and institutions are eligible to submit applications to PEP. Deadline to Submit Projects for PEP Approval: December 31, 1994.
