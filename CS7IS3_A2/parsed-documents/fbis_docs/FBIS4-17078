Uray oil workers, for instance, have been forced to cut their oil extraction by 200 tonnes a day. And it is not only the Uray workers, Aleksandr Filippenko, head of the Khanti-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug Administration, confirmed. All oil production in the Ob River area is currently in a similar situation. Why? The first reason is obvious -- it is simply unprofitable to extract the oil. On average in the Ob region the prime cost of a single tonne of oil is 100,000 rubles [R], yet it is sold (that is, simply pumped into the pipeline) for R65,000. But the oilmen cannot even get this money, because potential purchasers have no money either, and they are tired of selling on credit. It is, as they say, a vicious circle.
