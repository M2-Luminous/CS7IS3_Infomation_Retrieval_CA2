FR940812-2-00036 FR940812-2-00033 [OPPTS&hyph;400058A; FRL&hyph;4906&hyph;5] Notice Regarding Revisions to Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Reporting Forms under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice informs the public that the annual deadline for EPA's receipt of voluntary revisions to Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Forms (Form R or report) is changed to October 15th each year. The new deadline is 6 weeks earlier than the November 30th deadline set in an earlier notice. Voluntary revisions must now be received from facilities on or before October 15th, in order for the revisions to be included in the next annual release of the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). TRI was established pursuant to section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community-Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11001, 11023, also known as the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 or Title III. This notice amends an earlier notice regarding revisions which is still in effect except for the change in the revisions deadline. DATES: This notice is effective beginning October 15, 1994, and continuing in each year thereafter. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Information Hotline, Environmental Protection Agency, Mail Stop 5101, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Toll free: 800&hyph;535&hyph;0202. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice informs the public of EPA's administering of the data management aspects of the TRI program. This notice amends an EPA notice published in the Federal Register of September 26, 1991 (56 FR 48795), titled ``Notice Regarding Revisions to Toxic Release Inventory Reporting Forms under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986'' hereinafter referred to as the ``September 1991 Notice.'' The September 1991 Notice, among other things, set November 30th as the deadline for EPA's receipt of voluntary revisions that could be processed in time to be included in the next annual release of TRI. The September 1991 Notice is still in effect except that the deadline for receipt of voluntary revisions is now October 15th each year instead of November 30th. Revisions received after October 15th will continue to be processed; however, EPA will not guarantee that they will be included in the next annual release of TRI. The new revision deadline reflects EPA's ability to process and release TRI data earlier due to increased efficiencies in data entry that have been accomplished since the September 1991 Notice was published. Dated: August 4, 1994. Mark Greenwood, Director, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19775 Filed 8&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
