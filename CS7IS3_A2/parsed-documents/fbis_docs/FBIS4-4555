Prime Minister Hosokawa briefed President Clinton on major points of the package by telephone, and then expressed hopes to resume the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The economic framework talks are in a cooling-off period following the breakoff of the February Japan-U.S. summit talks. Taking advantage of the cooling-off period, Japan has been looking for clues on ways to resume the framework talks. The door is not yet closed on the possibility of a resumption of the framework talks. Now that Japan has announced plans for its domestic reforms, both Japan and the United States should seriously study ways to resume the framework talks. Formal economic dialogue between Japan and the United States remains stalled, which is not a desirable situation for the two countries. Both the government and the private sector in Japan have held running discussions on how to patch up bilateral relations since the February Japan-U.S. summit talks broke off, and this move is an expression of the view taken by the government and the private sector in Japan that good Japan-U.S. ties are indispensable for the development of the world economy. We hope that both Japan and the United States will discuss issues at home and abroad, make proposals for each other's consideration, and work to defuse their economic friction at a forum of the framework talks. Notwithstanding, we do not highly rate all contents of the package. The government will make a final decision on how to implement the package in late June and on whether the package lacks concrete steps to open up markets in Japan and relax the bureaucratic regulations. The government has decided to defer setting a voluntary target to slash Japan's current account surplus in the package. In the package, the government has clearly indicated a declining trend in the ratio of Japan's current account surplus to its GDP on the basis of its economic forecasting, and envisioned the ratio at about 2.8 percent in 1994. As for increasing the amount of public investment, the government has not indicated how much the public investment will be increased, but said it would review the basic plan for public investment by June, while studying ways to increase public investment and reexamining the conventional allotment of public investment. On the issue of revamping the current tax system and cutting income taxes, the government has said that it will seek to reform the tax system within the year on the basis of a conclusion that the ruling coalition parties will draw in June. From the position of the bureaucrats who have mapped out the package, mention of the ratio of Japan's current account surplus to its GDP, together with reference to a review of the basic plan for public investment in the package, may be a great step forward. The question, however, is how much the prime minister's political decisions and ideas have been incorporated in the package. We would assume that since the prime minister rebuffed the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets, it would be proper for him to make more bold requests in the finalized package. Regarding deregulation, the government has clearly pointed out priority areas, but said that it would compile records on the results of the deregulation by the end of June. We see no vigor in the government's plans to relax the regulations. The government should relax the regulations as early as possible. If there is a lack of political decision making on key issues, no matter how favorably certain measures to open the Japanese market compare with those of other industrialized nations, the package of external economic measures as a whole does not leave a good impression. We hope that the prime minister will display his leadership by making an early decision on a set of concrete measures to implement the package without being complacent on a plan to map it out by June. Meanwhile, the government has announced that it will abolish Japan's voluntary restrictions on automobile exports to the United States as of this year. The government has made the announcement in accordance with an agreement worked out in the new multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round), and it can be said that the announcement is a symbol indicating that Japan-U.S. economic relations are heading for a new era. U.S. unilateral trade sanction measures like the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act run counter to the objective of the Uruguay Round. We hope that the United States will change its negotiating strategy of hinting at the possibility of imposing sanctions on its trading partners.
