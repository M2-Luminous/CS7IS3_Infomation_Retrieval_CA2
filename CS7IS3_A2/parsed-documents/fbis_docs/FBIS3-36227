This thought was expressed by Anthony Lake, assistant to the president for national security. In an interview on CNN's International Hour he pointed out that the administration keeps a close watch on the development of the political and economic situation in Russia and expresses its concern to a certain extent. "The transition to democracy and the market in Russia is a long and painful process," the high-ranking administration representative said. "Of course, we will celebrate the Russians' victories along with them and commiserate with their defeats. However, the most important thing is that the country's main development should not jeopardize U.S. interests." "It should not be forgotten," Lake went on, "that Russia is now at the stage of developing the plan for the further development of the economy. Government Chairman Chernomyrdin has assured everyone that he remains committed to the process of reforms. We can only adopt a wait-and-see stance and follow their further progress. Let us also remember that despite a certain departure from the original course, the past year can be described as successful in Russia. Approximately three-fourths of small enterprises and one-fourth of medium and large enterprises in Russia have now been privatized. More than 90 percent of goods are currently sold via the free market. We can see progress, and our task is to support it by every available means." Lake voiced U.S. concern at the possibility of growing tension in Russian-Ukrainian relations following Yuriy Meshkov's victory in the presidential elections in the Crimea. "At the same time we are completely satisfied with the reaction to this event of the Ukrainian and Russian governments, which have adopted a well-considered stance in this situation," the White House representative observed. "We are also satisfied with the policy pursued by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk since his meeting with Bill Clinton." Commenting on the statement by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, that air strikes by NATO forces on Serbian positions in Bosnia and Herzegovina would be regarded as a declaration of war on Russia, Lake observed: "I think we should be glad that Zhirinovskiy does not speak for the Russian Government and has not been involved in shaping Russia's foreign policy. If that happened, we would now be arguing with Russia over the ownership of Alaska."
