The Bosnian ambassador to Washington, Necip Sacirbey, appealed Friday [8 April] at the four-day international conference on the Balkans to "the world not to tolerate what was happening in Bosnia." The conference, which organized by the Solidarity Foundation of Turkey, is being held here from April 7 to 10, with participants from representatives from Austria, the United States, Britain, South Africa, Germany, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. "In the war in Bosnia," Sacirbey stated, "there are victims, aggressors, and observers. All of us are observers." He asked that the observers not be passive, but to be just, and he appealed to them to remember Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia. "Sarajevo is symbolic of the suffering of each group of people in today's world. When we are fighting for Sarajevo, we are fighting for a better tomorrow. Please help us," Sacirbey said. Meanwhile, turkey Friday renewed a call to the Serbs to join the Bosnian-Croat Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, saying "Ankara is ready to do what it can." Turkey, which shares cultural and religious ties with the Bosnian Moslems, has launched a series of diplomatic initiatives on use of force to stop the fighting in Bosnia. Fighting broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina in late February of 1992 when 4.3 million population in the former Yugoslav republic voted for independence from Belgrade.
