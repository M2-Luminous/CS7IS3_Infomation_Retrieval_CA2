Romanian National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca told us that he had asked French Minister Leotard to urge the important French companies to come to Romania to cooperate both in the field of military equipment and in the civilian economy. Similarly they assessed cooperation between Romania and France, as well as between the two armed forces, within the framework of NATO, in the context of the Partnership for Peace initiative, and within the Western European Union [WEU], where they noted Romania's status as an associate partner within that organization, a status granted to central European countries. The talks also focused on the perspectives of strengthening European stability, the readiness of the two parties to cooperate in that domain, and the possibilities opened by the stability pact initiated by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. The talks held this afternoon by the Romanian and French defense delegations proved to be a good opportunity to reconfirm the friendly relations between Romania and France and the two armed forces and the mutual desire to further those relations, in view of the need for cooperation to find the most favorable solutions to remodel the security context and common future of united Europe.
