Actually, after two hours of conversation, both sides maintained their original positions regarding the Skrunda station. Nevertheless, all participants in the meeting were unanimous on the point that G. Ulmanis should meet with Russian President B. Yeltsin and emphasize, during their meeting, the unwavering position of Latvia. G. Ulmanis promised that during his meeting with B. Yeltsin, he will speak about the possibility of shortening the term -- four years and 18 months -- of the Skrunda agreement, but admitted that he has no hope of a positive result, because the term has already been agreed upon between the United States and Russia. The president expressed his opinion and his support for the compromise achieved by the government on this issue. After signing such an agreement, he said, Latvia will at least have some international guarantees and supervision from other countries, whereas without any agreement, Latvia would have no such international support. Naturally, by concluding the agreement, the government and the president will assume political responsibility and risk, but if the opposite occurs, Latvia would make no progress, emphasized the president. G. Ulmanis stated that after signing the agreement, the United States will allot $10 million for the dismantling of the new building at the Skrunda radar station, and will provide assistance in relocating the military personnel to Russia. The view of the Latvian National Independence Movement [LNNK] was expressed at this meeting by Aristids Lambergs, who stressed that Russia should first withdraw its Army by 31 August 1994, and only then should the issue of the Skrunda radar station be discussed. However, even providing that the agreement with Russia is concluded, there are no guarantees that the Army will be withdrawn, said Lambergs. In his turn, Latvian Popular Front Chairman Uldis Augstkalns said that, first of all, the Latvian Government and parliament should officially acknowledge the fact of the 1940 occupation, and then appeal for the United Nations to do the same. U. Augstkalns emphasized that while considering the Russian troop withdrawal, Latvia should rely upon the CSCE document which demands immediate and unconditional troop withdrawal, whereas signing the agreement with the present conditions would mean that Latvia practically abandons all hope of fulfilling these documents. Ojars Blumbergs, representative of the "League of Economic Activities," represented by LNSA, emphasized that the presidents of both countries should take more pains to plan for the repatriation of civilians to Russia, because a lot of people wish to return to their fatherland. In addition, Russian state institutions have shown a well-disposed interest in this respect, he said. Several representatives of LNSA expressed the view that by signing the agreement on the Skrunda radar station's continued operation in Latvia for another four years, Latvia would show its willingness to maintain a Russian military base on its territory, which would mean that the withdrawal of the Russian Army is not complete. The chairman of the Party of Latvian Union, Maris Plavnieks, described the Skrunda radar station as a Trojan horse which, if it remains in Latvia, will always provide the opportunity for provocative actions, both on the part of Latvia and Russia. The leader of the "Fatherland and Freedom" faction in the Saeima [parliament], Maris Grinblats, stated that the national party members have not given up the idea of a referendum on the Skrunda issue. Taking into account the fact that the Constitution does not provide for referendums on issues regarding international agreements, there would be a possibility to organize a so-called recommending poll.
