He told a press conference in Khartoum that investigations so far have revealed no link. Takfir and Hijra Islamic group first originated in Egypt during the Sadat era and was famous for terrorist activities. The members regarded all Moslems of today as "infidels." Husayn said the death toll in the attack on worshippers at the Khartoum Ansar Souna mosque on Friday had risen to 16 with 20 injured. The motive of the gunmen is still not known. He said two of the suspected gunmen, who were West Africans, have been killed in a shootout with security forces. The third suspect, a Moroccan whom he identified as Muhammad Abdullah al-Khilayfi, was injured. Husayn said the gunmen, who were originally three, first attacked a police station at Umbadda neighbourhood, injured two policemen and took five Kalashnikov rifles and a Yugoslav gun. They seized a pick-up truck from a civilian at gunpoint outside the police station and drove back home where they collected their personal effects and headed for the mosque. Husayn said before they reached the mosque, the gunmen neutralised a police station along their way to make their operation smooth. The minister said during a shootout on Saturday with the security forces who had tracked them down, a fourth person, a Yemeni, appeared with the group. The Yemeni and the Moroccan, Muhammad Abdullah al-Khilayfi, were critically injured and cannot be interrogated at the moment. The minister said the security agencies are also holding a Palestinian student for suspicion of involvement in the massacre. He added, however, that interrogation so far has not linked him to the massacre.
