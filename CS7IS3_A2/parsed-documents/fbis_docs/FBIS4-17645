Ukraine comes out for the creation of an all-embracing security system in Europe and regards its participation in this system as one of the main external guarantees of its own national security, pointed out President Leonid Kravchuk. He told the guest that Ukraine regards cooperation with European structures as one of the priorities in its foreign policy. A proof of this is the fact that Ukraine was the first among the CIS countries to joint NATO's Partnership for Peace. Possibilities of admitting Ukraine to the consultative forum for cooperation of the WEU with the countries of central-eastern Europe and the Baltic states were discussed during the meeting. The Ukrainian president informed the secretary general about the political situation inside the state after the parliamentary election, which, in the opinion of the interlocutors, should not affect relations with foreign states.
