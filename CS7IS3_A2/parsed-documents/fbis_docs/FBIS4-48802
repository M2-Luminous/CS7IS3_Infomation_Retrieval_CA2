The leader of the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] said today that Edem Kodjo can no longer say that he is part of the opposition to General Eyadema. [Begin recording] [Agboyibor] In many of his statements, in particular his introduction to the presentation of his government, Mr. Edem Kodjo continues to refer to the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] - CAR parliamentary majority. But it is difficult to know whether he really believes in this majority, because, if that were the case, he should behave consistently. This means that, once we told him that for clearly defined reasons our party, the CAR, cannot join his government, he should have drawn the correct conclusion and refrained from forming a government. He cannot say, in spite of this refusal, well, I am forming this government with the Rally of Togolese People [RPT]. This act is an act of rupture with the UDT-CAR parliamentary majority. [Unidentified Correspondent] So if Mr. Kodjo remains in the government, he only wants to ally himself with the RPT? [Agboyibor] We have seen this. In a government where the RPT has more than 60 percent of the ministeries, while Kodjo has scarcely 9 or 10 percent, it is more than partnership, it is an alliance. [end recording]
