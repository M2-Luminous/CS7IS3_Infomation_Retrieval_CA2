The old totalitarian regime has been demolished. It is a dialectical process and it is our duty to adjust to other rules, the rules of the end of the 20th century, when the tendency to integrate all national economies into the world economy is a dominant," President Ion Iliescu stated during a meeting at the Oradea Municipality City Hall. President Iliescu admitted that adjustment to the new situation has generated severe social issues, but pointed out that the causes of such phenomenon must be traced down and eliminated, rejecting the wish of some to return to the old totalitarian rule. President Iliescu pleaded for dialogue as a means to solve most of the social issues: "It is good to listen to each other and to learn from the experience of each other. This is the fundamental element that rules our democracy, for a society keeps developing when all human potentials are being capitalised," Iliescu said. The meeting at Oradea City Hall took place after a visit paid by President Ion Iliescu to the Bihor County. "It has been a day of fruitful contacts and dialogues that were beneficial for me, for I had the possibility to directly get acquainted with the issues confronting people and with their thoughts," President Iliescu told a ROMPRES editor. "As a general feature, I would mention the people's concern for the really big issues confronting our economy, such as the financial blockage, inflation and unemployment, as well as their wish for an economic revival." President Ion Iliescu's fact-finding trip is to include on Thursday the Satu Mare County.
