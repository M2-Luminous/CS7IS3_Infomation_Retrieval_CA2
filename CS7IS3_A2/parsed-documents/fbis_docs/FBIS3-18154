The offer was clearly welcome in Sweden, while Finland and Norway were clearly less delighted. Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto received a question about this after he and Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen yesterday briefed the Eduskunta Foreign Affairs Committee on the situation in the negotiations. He did not exactly make an effort to dismiss the "divide and rule" theory. "The EU is a very skillful negotiator that exploits all the factors it can make use of...." Haavisto pointed out that the new EU offer is very different from the views that the EU Commission has expressed in the past. "The offer takes Sweden's special needs into consideration to an exceptionally high degree," he said. On the other hand Haavisto said that he does not think that there "really exists any Nordic front." The reports of Nordic cooperation on agricultural questions only mean that people have backed the idea that each individual country's agreement will build on the same components and be drafted in such a way that it does not cause difficulties for any other applicant. These components are the EU's own support arrangements, the much-desired special Nordic support, and environmental support. The foreign minister still believes that the EU is striving for "parallel solutions" on agriculture in the case of all the Nordic countries. And even if the EU were trying intentionally to split the Nordic front, Haavisto does not think that it is possible to draw from this the conclusion that Sweden is being given priority over Finland and Norway as a potential EU member. All three countries are probably seen as attractive in this context. As far as regional support is concerned, Haavisto said that Finland still has the central goal of achieving regional support under the Objective 1 classification. However, the new Objective 6 model can clearly been discussed if it is possible to "extend the regions covered in the same way that Sweden has been allowed to do." Thus the minimum demand is that Finland must be given regional support that is as favorable as that which Sweden has received. According to reports, the ministers' main message to the Foreign Affairs Committee was that a negotiated result can only be achieved if the national leaderships of the 12 EU countries now take an active part in the negotiations and give their negotiators orders to strive in earnest for results. Foreign Minister Haavisto described Finland's room for maneuver as limited. The committee members contented themselves with asking questions of the of the ministers and Foreign Ministry officials; according to reports, there was no suggestion of giving the negotiators orders. Social Democratic Party chairman Paavo Lipponen, who himself is a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said after the meeting with the ministers that Finland cannot count on pushing through all its demands on all the difficult issues. Nevertheless he is expecting that it will be possible to achieve a result in the negotiations. According to Lipponen, the government's list of priorities with regard to agriculture -- first an agreement on so-called northern support, then the transitional arrangements, and then production quotas -- is the right one, but it will probably be necessary to compromise on all these points. Lipponen said that the new regional support that has been offered "is not necessarily impossible for Finland if it is possible to have it adjusted." In his view it is also possible for Finland to make an immediate transition to EU price levels. However, this would presuppose financial support for Finnish agriculture for a transitional period. Lipponen seemed fairly satisfied with the information he had received. However, he said it was sometimes difficult to know whether it was the foreign minister or the chairman of the Central Association of Agricultural Producers [Haavisto's former position] who was speaking....
