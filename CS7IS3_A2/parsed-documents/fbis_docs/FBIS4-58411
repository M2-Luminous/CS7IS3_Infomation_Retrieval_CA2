The prime minister's statements addressed his Egyptian counterpart's visit to Jordan and the higher committee's work. Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali also noted the high regard in which Jordan holds its political relations and coordination with Egypt at this sensitive stage. Jordan has consistently exerted itself on behalf of revitalizing Arab solidarity and common Arab action. Hence the prime minister's observation that while the Arab world is going through a delicate stage and a rapid succession of developments, certain Arab parties handle their differences as if they do not appreciate the gravity of the situation. There has been an absence of real attempts to smooth over Arab differences so as to take account of global changes from a pan-Arab outlook and tackle the challenges facing the Arab nation. Unless they get their act together and iron out their differences, the Arabs will be made to stomach a regional order under the new world order that will shape their lives for many years to come. In order for the Arabs to avert such a likelihood, the prime minister suggested that they approach their differences as if they were debts to be rescheduled over, say, a 10-year period with a three-year grace period, during which time the parties pause to think over these differences. Jordan appreciates the critical circumstances the Arab world is experiencing and is equally aware of the political and economic implications of these circumstances. Jordan knows full well that if the Arabs intend to advance their interests and ward off dangers, they have to close ranks and revert to effective action based on new and clear rules that respond to ongoing and rapid changes sweeping the world. To quote the prime minister, there is no place for spectators under the new world order, in which the Arabs have to play an active and effectual role.
