Ford Federal Direct Loan Program RIN 1840&hyph;AC11 AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Final standards, criteria, and procedures. SUMMARY: The Secretary of Education issues final standards, criteria, and procedures governing the alternative repayment and income contingent repayment (ICR) plans under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program for the academic year beginning July 1, 1994. These standards, criteria, and procedures apply to loans under the Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan Program, the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford/Ford Loan Program, the Federal Direct PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program, collectively referred to as the Direct Loan Program. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Rachel Edelstein, Room 3012, ROB&hyph;3, 600 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C., 20202, telephone: (202) 708&hyph;9406. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, enacted on August 10, 1993, established the Direct Loan Program under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). See Subtitle A of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66). Under the Direct Loan Program, loan capital is provided directly to student and parent borrowers by the Federal Government rather than through private lenders. Borrowers under the Direct Loan Program are provided a range of repayment options, including an ICR plan. The HEA directs the Secretary to consult with members of the higher education community and to publish a notice of standards, criteria, and procedures for the program's first year in lieu of issuing regulations using the Department's usual procedures. The Secretary's representatives have consulted with representatives of students, colleges, universities, proprietary schools, and educational associations, as well as representatives of the financial aid community, in developing this notice. In particular, the Secretary's representatives have had extensive consultations with the other members of the Direct Student Loan Regulations Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee established to develop proposed regulations for the second and subsequent years of the program. See the Secretary's announcement of his intention to establish this Committee at 58 FR 68619 (December 28, 1993). The Secretary, in consultation with the above-discussed members of the higher education community, has determined that this notice is reasonable and necessary to the successful implementation of the first year of the program. This notice modifies the provisions of the ICR plan and the alternative repayment plan for the 1994&hyph;95 academic year. I. Background On July 1, 1994, the Secretary published a final regulation governing the Direct Loan Program for the 1994&hyph;95 academic year. That regulation prescribes the formula used to determine the repayment amounts under the ICR plan for borrowers whose loans enter repayment during the 1994&hyph;95 academic year. On August 18, 1994, the same formula was published in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking relating to the 1995&hyph;96 and subsequent years of the Direct Loan Program. The Secretary received 98 comments on that NPRM, most of which include discussion of the ICR plan. In response to those comments, the Secretary made several changes to the ICR plan for the 1995&hyph;96 and subsequent academic years. The changes provide borrowers with better repayment terms than are currently available for the 1994&hyph;95 academic year. For example, the limit on the amount of interest that will be capitalized (or added to principal) was reduced from 50 percent of the original principal to 10 percent of the original principal, thereby reducing the cost of borrowing significantly for some borrowers whose monthly payments are lower than the amount of interest accrued. The new ICR formula also lowers the required monthly payment for many borrowers who have lower incomes.
