How do you explain this situation, which inspires such hope? How do you manage to preserve peace amid the fires of war on your little strip of land? [Abashidze] I will answer with a parable. A father says to his son: When you buy a house from a man who built that house with his own hands, do not make the mistake of haggling with him -- whatever happens, he will not give in. He knows what the house cost him. If he did not build it himself, haggle away; he will lower his price, perhaps even give it to you for a song, because he has invested nothing in it of his own. I am the same. I know how we have kept peace by a hairbreadth. [Volkova] Is it true that you offered your own family -- your wife, children, and grandson -- as hostages for talks in Abkhazia? [Abashidze] There was a time when I thought that events in Abkhazia could be slowed down or halted. And I proposed that Ardzinba come here for talks. I felt that he was simply wary of traveling outside Abkhazia. Now, once upon a time in days of old, kings, in order to establish good relations among themselves, made use of family affairs -- they married princesses or gave their daughters in marriage to a king's son. And this was a very civilized form of establishing firm, friendly relations. I did not come up with any new idea. But do not imagine that I was prepared for this. I simply felt during my telephone conversation with Ardzinba that he might not agree to come, and I used my final argument -- that which is most dear to me, my wife, daughters, and grandson. I guarantee everyone safety, I said. If this is not enough, I will come to Abkhazia myself. Then he agreed. But I found no supporters in the Georgian parliament. There are forces interested in ensuring that instability is maintained in Georgia for as long as possible. For it is instability which keeps these people afloat. If the war ends, it will be time to build. And then they will prove to be superfluous, just as they were before. Take a look at this photograph: Who do you think this is? It is my father's youngest brother. A most powerful personality, a historic personality. He is a general; they write about him a lot. You know, when they did away with this class -- in both Russia and Georgia -- great harm was done to the nations. Generation after generation the race put forward its best sons. They had the opportunity to receive a brilliant education, brilliant training. The most difficult burdens lay on their shoulders. Both in our country and in Russia. They were all in the first ranks. And then they were destroyed; the flower of our nation was destroyed, decapitated. And how much of our moral life disappeared together with them. You know, they had a very firm framework which they could not overstep. They had honor, conscience, morality, a nation. Everything was destroyed. And now it is like this: A man comes along who knows nothing. He makes a speech in parliament: "Why do we need the Russian ruble? Why are we entering the ruble zone? Let us enter the hard currency zone!" Can you imagine it? As though the United States would open its banks right now and say: "How much do you want?" And hand out dollars to all and sundry. Only Russia is capable of such expansive gestures. For the sake of the relations which formerly existed. You can kill a Russian soldier, you can label Russia an occupier, and it will give you gas, bread, and money. [Volkova] It is precisely of pro-Russian sentiments that you are most often accused in Tbilisi. [Abashidze] They accuse me of all sorts of things. In just one article I was accused of selling Ajaria to Russia and Turkey simultaneously. I ask: Which part am I selling to Russia and which to Turkey? We have been called all sorts of names in Georgia. The fact that we are at peace is most important for business contacts between Russia and Georgia, and Georgia's constituent part, Ajaria. [Volkova] You get the sense that there are no anti-Russian feelings here. Neighbors live together as neighbors. There are many streets with Russian names -- Lermontov Street, Pushkin Street, and so forth. [Abashidze] We live together as one family, just as we always did, taking this communist slogan as our own. When the order came to use only Georgian, on Ajarian television we instantly set up Russian-language editions of exactly the same programs. This provoked misunderstanding among the Georgian leadership. We commemorated 23 February [Army Day], 8 March [Women's Day], and Border Guards Day. On 9 May [Victory Day] we marched with veterans to the Glory Obelisk and laid wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. This was against the tide. Anti-Russian sentiments did not get a grip on us. Of course, some things were felt even here: There were exchanges of fire, attacks on troop units; Major Kirillov was killed in front of his wife and child. I issued a statement and invited his wife to come here, offering her an apartment and money. Some people believe that I am swimming against the tide. No. I have always swum with the tide. And at the present time everything keeps within certain bounds. [Volkova] Do you not have too few rights personally, as chairman of the Supreme Council of an autonomous republic, to make independent decisions? Does this not have an effect on business contacts between Ajaria and Russia? [Abashidze] This does not depend on us alone. This also depends on our partners. Yes, I am the leader of an autonomous republic, but nothing has prevented me from making very bold decisions and assuming responsibility. Of course, I have seen no steps to meet me halfway. Neither inside Georgia, nor abroad. For instance, I go to Moscow. I want to step off the gangway. A border guard climbs onto the gangway and checks my passport. I have a Soviet passport. There are no new passports either in Russia or in Georgia. I tell him: Why are you checking, we have the same passports. He felt awkward and did not look me in the eye. And what happened next was this. The inspectors -- two women -- moved aside. We had been waiting, thinking that they would begin to search us. But they say: What are you waiting for, pass through, for God's sake. You know, a ballad should be written about these women. Two women protested the leadership's decision, which forcibly separates us. It is pitiful. For example, under the former Georgian leadership I received orders to make an inventory of the Russian garrison's property. But not only did I not do this, I even gave orders to shoot to kill anyone who approached the Russian unit. I knew I was making the right decision. And time proved this to be true. They did not help us to arm our own Ministry of Internal Affairs, which defended the interests of Russian troops here. But they handed out weapons to those who attacked the units of the Transcaucasus Military District. It is obvious why. But all the same we did not quit this road, knowing that afterward the Georgian central authorities would see that we were right. Which is what happened. We concluded a treaty independently with Udmurtia. And the Georgian central press wrote about this: Why is Abashidze going to Udmurtia? They have got guns there, surface-to-air missiles, and so forth. They draw their own conclusions: We are arming ourselves, they say. But if you are worried who will think or say what about you, you won't achieve anything useful. We make our own decisions, the ones we need. And time will judge us. There are very many artificial barriers and borders. Have you seen border guards mounting gangways and checking flights from Moscow in our country? No. I made the decision autonomously: Let them recognize that all this separation is artificial. We do not get the Russian press in Ajaria. We went to Moscow to purchase newspapers in order to distribute them at home -- let people read, let them know what is happening in Russia, our age-old neighbor. We were greeted rapturously in the Russian Ministry of Communications. We agreed that we would systematically import the press to Ajaria. We paid for the plane at the airport. But they did not let it take off. They told us: "You are allowed 10 newspapers. That is all." The print runs of the papers we bought are now lying somewhere in our friend's dacha. Barricades have been erected on all sides. [Volkova] This winter kiwi fruit, pineapples, bananas, and oranges from overseas countries were sold in Moscow. But we have not seen mandarins, oranges, or green vegetables from Ajaria. Why not? Surely it was not impossible to sell something from the last harvest to Russia and earn some money at least? [Abashidze] Unfortunately not. The railroad was blocked off. We chartered several ships and exported citrus fruits. We made several trips. But that is only part of the harvest. Citrus fruits are a highly perishable commodity. One train was detained for around a month in Tbilisi and the freight rotted. [Volkova] You are in a bad way as regards raw materials. Are you managing to establish contacts with Russian procurement agents? [Abashidze] Some stuff reaches us somehow or other by roundabout routes, and enterprises are able to work to 20-30 percent of capacity. But, of course, these are not the contacts which used to exist and which we need. For instance, we have the only plant in the former Union which produced transformers for everyone. We have a tung-oil refinery which produces high-quality oil from this subtropical product. It is used in aviation and the shipbuilding industry. These oils are highly stable and irreplaceable. We always used to sell them in the Soviet Union. Now Russian aviators and others get hard currency from the state and buy this oil abroad at three times the price. And we have barrels of it. We have the only caffeine plant in the former Soviet Union. Your pharmacology and medicine are also evidently suffering. And many similar things as well. The Western market will not take our products. Here is an example: We were unable to put together two wagonloads of citrus fruits of the same size. In the past you and I lived together as follows: We grew fruit however it would grow, we bought whatever was on sale. We talked a different language to the Western world; we lived on a different planet. Now we must climb into the same boat, called the market, together and learn together. We will fail if we go our separate ways. We wanted to purchase sugar; a businessman came, took the money, and left. They say to us, Interpol can find him, if you pay $50,000 per day. Pay for 10 days, and there's the stolen sum. And you still won't know whether Interpol will find him. But if someone deceived you in Russia, you could phone him and give him a dressing down: You made a mess -- clear it up. Here is a surprising fact which we have underrated: Right now you can phone any point in Russia or Central Asia from any of our telephones and say: I am the director of a plant, the unit you sold me has malfunctioned. And people will come here from Russia, they will pay no attention to these transparent borders or borders of reinforced concrete. We lived together -- that is what we are used to. It is like in the movies -- "Bound by One Chain." Russia needs Georgia like the air it breathes. And I think that Georgia needs Russia just as much.
