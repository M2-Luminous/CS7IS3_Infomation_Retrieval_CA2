These ties were boosted during the 1993 Havana summit between PRC President Jiang Zemin and Cuban President Fidel Castro. During an almost two-hour interview with PRENSA LATINA, Wu Jianmin, head of the Information Department of the Foreign Ministry, spontaneously broached the topic of bilateral ties and expressed his opinion of Jiang's November visit to the Caribbean island. "I was a member of the delegation that accompanied President Jiang Zemin on his Latin American tour," Wu said, and stressed that the visit to Havana and the talks between the two presidents played a very favorable role for the development of ties between the two nations. "Cuba was the first Latin American country to establish diplomatic relations with China and that is something we will never forget," Wu said. The Foreign Ministry spokesman added it is very important for Beijing to promote ties with Latin America because Latin American countries are developing countries and relations with them are based on equality. My personal experience of the trip to Cuba and Brazil is that the talks were held within a friendly environment. The talks were smooth and among equals, Wu added. "That," Wu said, "is very important and it encourages mutual relations because all barriers are eliminated through understanding." The head of the Information Department of the Foreign Ministry assessed the state of economic ties between China and the subcontinent, and recalled that the overall volume of trade in 1993 was greater than $3.7 billion, 20 percent more than in 1992. I see enormous potential in the development of our ties, Wu said, and added "there is only one obstacle: a lack of knowledge of each other's possibilities." In Brazil, Wu said, I could tell they did not have this information, and it is essential that we solve this problem so we can take advantage of the opportunities and combine our thriving economic development with the rich resources of that nation. The spokesman insisted there is a great outlook for cooperation between the PRC and the South American giant, and noted that "the same applies with Cuba, a country of 120,000 square km and 11 million inhabitants with very good natural conditions for economic growth. "A strong and vigorous cooperation force exists between China and Cuba," Wu said. I believe the first step toward cooperation is getting to know each other, learning about our respective situations, and seizing the opportunity for joint development.
