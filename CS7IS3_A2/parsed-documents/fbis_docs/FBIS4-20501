The Beijing Telecommunications Administration and the Kohap Group announced the formation of the Beijing Jing Koh Integrated Telecommunications Equipment Company Limited at a ceremony in Beijing. The new- and high-tech joint venture project has an initial investment of $2.1 million, with each side having a half-stake. It will introduce technology from the Integrated Network Corporation (INC) of the United States, called DDOV (Digital Data Over Voice), to produce UDVM (Universal Data Voice Multiplexing) equipment. Company technicians said that by installing UDVM equipment on a public telephone line, phone users will have easy access to public or private digital data networks such as Chinapac and DDN. The equipment is expected to have a big market in China, as the country's telephone system undergoes a spectacular expansion. China has also been working hard to expand and upgrade the national public packet-switching data network, known as Chinapac, to speed up information exchange. After joining the Chinapac network, computers across the country can exchange information with other computers at home or abroad. Three ROK ministers of telecommunications, commerce and industry, and science and technology also took part in yesterday afternoon's launching ceremony. Also attending were Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Tian Jiyun, Beijing Vice-Mayor Zhang Baifa and Telecommunications Vice-Minister Yang Xianzu. Yang said that since China and ROK established diplomatic relations in August, 1992, postal and telecommunications co-operation has grown rapidly and has a promising future. One example of close ties in this field between the two countries is the fact that Chinese Telecommunications Minister Wu Jichuan is Chairman of the Chinese Government reception committee for President Kim's visit this week.
