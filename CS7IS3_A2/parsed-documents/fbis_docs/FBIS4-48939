The State Administration for Industry & Commerce said that it would give a "green light" for foreign investors to join in the development of China's service industry. "Foreign investors will be allowed to start handling previously restricted businesses such as real estate development, large-sized retail centres, transport and communications, finance and tourism," said an official with the administration. The government's procedures for approving foreign-invested firms in these businesses will also be simplified this year, he added. The administration will give its approval if cash-sufficient financial companies want to set up non-financial firms or invest in other businesses. Existing service businesses and trust and investment firms, which have raised more than 100 million yuan ($11.5 million) in capital, will be encouraged to expand into other commercial fields. With the administration's approval, these firms can establish subsidiaries in engineering, construction and real estate. Since the country vows to fortify its service industry, the administration officials said, foreign and domestic suppliers of materials and marketing firms are now allowed to engage in more businesses. They can be involved in wholesale and retail business and act as commercial agents in buying and selling goods for others, according to administration officials. The administration will also lend support to technicians and scientists who have quit their jobs and want to set up firms of their own. It will streamline its procedures for granting these technicians and scientists permission to start consulting and service businesses related to information technology. The government, meanwhile, will extend similar treatment to encourage officials in its own administrative organs to enter business. These staff officials were essential under the previous organization, but with the government streamlining its structure the need for them is diminished. So now they can apply to run businesses on their own. But they must first resign from their government departments before jumping into the "sea of commerce." The State Administration for Industry and Commerce is also backing change in the countryside. With its blessing, the government's agricultural service centres are now free to explore lucrative businesses on their own. With the administration's approval rural technique popularization centres and household livestock veterinary stations can transform themselves into profit-seeking companies with farm and sideline processing factories and information consulting and service businesses. According to the State Statistics Bureau, the government's firm support has helped channel more foreign-invested companies and individual firms into Chinese industries. The bureau's figures show that China approved 100,000 foreign- funded projects last year, representing foreign direct investment in excess of $33 billion. By the end of last year, the country had nearly 17.7 million individual business households, up 16.2 percent from a year earlier. It also had 238,000 privately owned firms, up 70.4 per cent.
