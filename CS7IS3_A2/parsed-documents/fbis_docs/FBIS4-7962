Today, in Ljubljana, the document was signed by Dr. Bela Kadar, Hungarian minister for international cooperation, and Dr. Davorin Kracun, minister for economic relations and development. The ministers presented the contents and the significance of this agreement at the news conference. Tomaz Gerden reports: [Begin recording] [Gerden] Hungary is an important trade partner of Slovenia. The free trade zone agreement will, as of 1 July, abolish two-thirds of customs duties, while the rest will be gradually abolished by 1997, that is to say, by 2001 for the most sensitive articles. In three years' time, the agreement signed today will be reexamined and supplemented, if this proves necessary. Kadar was very pleased with the agreement signed. The agreement can be assessed from several points of view. In December 1992, Slovenia and Hungary signed a basic agreement on mutual relations. This was followed by several other agreements. Dr. Kadar believes that today's agreement on the formation of a free trade zone merely confirms good relations between two neighborly states. He touched particularly upon the issue of agriculture, as Hungary exports $20 million worth of agricultural produce and raw materials to Slovenia, which represents a fifth of all Hungarian exports to our country. The agreement signed today will allow a greater competitiveness of this Hungarian produce on the Slovene market. Slovenia and Hungary will continue to cooperate at the regional level within the Alpe-Adria community. Minister Kadar especially emphasized that such an agreement also means drawing closer to the European integration processes. Minister Dr. Kracun added here that, regarding integrations, one should not merely wait for the initiatives of the European Union. He assessed the agreement as follows: [Kracun] The agreement that we signed with the neighboring Hungary today is a very important milestone in the development of bilateral cooperation with Hungary and in Slovene orientation toward European integration. Namely, Slovenia has already signed some free trade zone agreements, however, on this occasion we have for the first time signed one with a neighboring country. [passage omitted] [end recording]
