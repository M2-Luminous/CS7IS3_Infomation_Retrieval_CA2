On the basis of a Central News Unit report from Beirut, a statement issued by Hizballah today states: The decision of the Lebanese Government contradicts the most basic social rights and freedom of speech. In respect of the critical situation that Lebanon is facing -- due to the Zionist regime's aggressions -- it is essential to safeguard national achievements, particularly the freedom of speech and the press. In another part of the statement, Hizballah supports the government of Lebanon's decision to dissolve the Lebanese Forces Party [LFP] which is accused of involvement in recent bombings.
