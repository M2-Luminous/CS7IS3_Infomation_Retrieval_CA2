Some publications are bluntly trying to convince the reader that ICBM's are unnecessary. Our correspondent turned for clarification to Colonel General Stanislav Kochemasov, chief of the Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff. Dolinin: Stanislav Grigoryevich, what is meant by Russia's Strategic Nuclear Forces today? Kochemasov: The term signifies first and foremost the Strategic Missile Forces, the basis of Russia's nuclear might, strategic ballistic missile submarine task forces, and strategic aviation. We have always been in favor of preserving this triad -- only the balanced development of all its components can provide the guarantee of high combat effectiveness and the capability to execute designated tasks. You know, each component of the SNF has its own advantages and the qualities attributable to it alone. But given the financial and manpower constraints, it will evidently be necessary to grant priority to the development of weaponry and troops alike, and to integrate offensive and support systems. There was a discussion of these questions in the General Staff in April. Dolinin: How do you envisage integration? Kochemasov: In order to centralize SNF command and control and to determine responsibilty, it would be expedient to set up an operations command authority [operativnoye komandovaniye]. Administrative leadership, however, would remain with the commanders in chief of the various branches of the Armed Forces. The preconditions for this already exist, as does the possibility of creating a unified system of military command and control. But you have to look before you leap.... Dolinin: What is the place of the Missile Forces in the structure of Russia's SNF? Kochemasov: The Strategic Missile Forces remain their basic component -- both in terms of quantity of warheads and in terms of a number of other characteristics. This is the objective situation now, and it will persist in fact until 2003-2005 -- something which is determined not by someone's wish but by the building and development of the SNF in previous years. Dolinin: It seems that in the future, too, the Strategic Missile Forces will remain the basis of the SNF. But already, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA readers are getting the impression that the troops are all but completely disarming. Which nuclear missile weapons will Russia still have in the years to come? Is it not the case that we have been bled dry by the well-known Russian-American treaties? Kochemasov: Several hundred launchers have been withdrawn from the effective strength of the Strategic Missile Forces. Basically, these are missile complexes [kompleksy] which have been in service for twice the warrantied service life. Not a single launcher has been removed from alert duty if its warrantied service life has not been exhausted. We have kept intact the grouping [gruppirovka] of modern missiles. We are continuing with the planned commissioning, albeit in a lesser quantity, of the Topol mobile missile complexes, which your newspaper has already written about. In order to preserve the armament and hardware of the two combined units from Belorussia [Belarus] we plan to redeploy them to Russia intact. We are including an RS 12M complex in the grouping. This complex will be the first created exclusively by the cooperation of Russian design bureau and plants. Preparations for testing it are progressing as planned. An experimental and test base has been set up at the Mirnyy test site. The first missile for testing systems and power units [sistemy i agregaty] was delivered to the test site at the end of 1993. In accordance with an edict by the president, the Missile Forces and industrial organizations have set about testing the complex. The system of military command and control is being improved and modernized. All this is being done so that combat potential is maintained at a level guaranteeing deterrence of any aggressor. Dolinin: Are the cutbacks affecting the combat readiness of troops? With the elimination of old complexes and the transfer to new ones the need for officers does not lessen but, on the contrary, increases.... Kochemasov: First, within the framework of the impending modernization of the grouping we plan to retain the existing position areas and their attendant infrastructure, accommodations, and social and cultural facilities, in order to ensure normal living conditions. Second, upon withdrawing missile complexes from the effective strength we are leaving some of the officer personnel in the newly formed units [chasti] or else relocating them to other combined units [soyedineniya]. The main problems concern a lack of accommodations, although we have steadfastly fulfilled the plan for housing construction over the past three or four years. Cutbacks may affect combat readiness to some extent if measures are not taken. But the main thing is that we preserve a system of centralized military command and control. This allows us to maintain the attained level of combat readiness. Dolinin: The program for developing the weaponry of Russia's SNF through the year 2005 stipulates that the basis of the Missile Forces will be the Topol single-warhead solid-propellant missile for the mobile off-road complex, and the Topol M for silo basing. How far does the missile meet this purpose, and how reliable is it? How are preparations for testing the Topol M progressing? Kochemasov: The future lies with single-warhead missiles. MIRVed missiles will be withdrawn from effective strength as their operational life expires, as envisaged by the START II Treaty on condition of its ratification. Moreover, 105 MIRVed RS-18 (SS-19) missiles will be reequipped with single-warhead nose sections and retained until their operational life expires. And 90 launch silos for the RS-20 (SS-18) heavy missiles will be converted to accommodate the Topol M fixed-site version. The composition of the SNF and the number of delivery vehicles must be brought to a level which guarantees the solution of the task of strategic deterrence, and it must be commensurate with the actual military threat. For the Strategic Missile Forces, this level has been set at between 900 and 1,000 missile launchers by the year 2003. START II allows for their number to be increased to between 1,000 and 1,200 missile launchers. Dolinin: Stanislav Grigoryevich, the continued development of missile technology is impossible without a solid testing base. In this connection, what is the fate of the Kapyar test site, and what are its functions today? Is the proposed reassigning of the rocket test site at Plesetsk (Mirnyy) to the military-space units an appropriate move? Kochemasov: Extensive and comprehensive ground-based test site trials cut the cost of the development [sozdaniye] of any complex, inasmuch as they drastically reduce the number of missiles required for actual launches. When the capacity of a test site is based on the number of missile launches, this has to be seen not as an advantage but as a serious shortcoming in the methodology of ground-based testing. At the Kapustin Yar test site, individual elements of a complexes are tested by firing over short distances using inexpensive series-produced carriers [seriyno otrabotannyye i deshevyye nositeli]. The main tests of systems and power units, the complex as a whole and the missiles, incorporating launches, are carried out at the Mirnyy test site. The methodology for developing a complex is such that up to 70 percent of the tests are conducted on the ground. The question of reassigning the test site is raised from time to time by the command of the Military-Space Forces. It would be an appropriate move if the existing structure and system of subordination disrupted or seriously hindered the execution of tasks in the new conditions. But it does neither. The problem has been studied in depth, and the president of Russia has been made aware of the situation. It was deemed advisable to preserve the existing system of subordination. The test site's 30-year history, and the last few years in particular, confirm the possibility of resolving all tasks in precisely this organizational-regulation structure [organizatsionno-shtatnaya struktura]. Dolinin: In May this year, missile launchers will no longer have any targets. There will take place the so-called zero targeting agreed with the Americans. Their missiles will be targeted on desert regions of the earth insofar as the system of military command and control of American ICBM's is somewhat different. What will this mean in practice? Kochemasov: In line with the accords reached and a directive from the Russian president, by 31 May the missiles will be on alert duty with "zero" mission assignments. Put simply, they will not have specific targets. The practical implementation of the nontargeting regime depends on the design characteristics of the missile complexes, and this will be determined specifically by us and by the American side for each type of missile. The common element for all, however, is the clear lowering of the sudden-strike threshold, inasmuch as a number of operational and technical measures will have to be conducted in order to reestablish each side's combat plans. This will take time, which the politicians can make additional use of to find a peaceful solution to problems if they emerge. However the circumstances take shape, the Strategic Missile Forces will perform their alert duty. Around 20,000 missilemen are at their combat posts around the clock. As they have been for virtually the past 35 years. The world is changing, but the need for alert duty has not disappeared.
