The sources said that this topic was discussed at the meeting between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and visiting U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry which was held behind the closed doors. The major leitmotif of the talks was the implementation of the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement signed in Moscow in January 1994, as well as the agreements reached during the recent U.S.-Ukrainian summit meeting in Washington. They call for Ukraine's "denucliarisation" and providing it with compensations and security guarantees. The second most important issue is cooperation between Ukraine and the United States within the programmes of economic cooperation and defence conversion. The U.S. will provide financial assistance to Ukraine to finance the conversion of its defence industry and build housing for the demobilised military. Kravchuk stressed that Ukraine is unswervingly observing its obligations under the three-party agreement -- it has sent the second train full of nuclear warheads to Russia. Perry stressed that relations between Ukraine and the United States are strategically important. He and Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy who also attended the talks signed an agreement under which Ukraine will be granted 50 million dollars in addition to 135 million it is to receive under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The means will be used to finance the dismantlement of SS-24 missiles. Radetskyy welcomed the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement as a "historic move and a way-out of the nuclear deadlock." "This step and the ratification by Ukraine of the START-1 Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol as a nuclear-free state virtually removes all juridical and other barriers for Ukraine's joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty," he said. At the same time, Radetskyy said that "the fulfillment of obligations assumed in nuclear disarmament is a costly process." He stressed the importance of U.S. assistance for carrying out disarmament and solving social problems facing the military. "We have also reached full understanding on issues concerning the Partnership for Peace Programme. We understand that Ukraine's future aims at full accession to European structures," Radetskyy said. The sides also discussed cooperation in space exploration. The talks were attended by U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Miller.
