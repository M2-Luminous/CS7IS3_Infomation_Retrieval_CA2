The soldiers will now have to face legal proceedings in connection with their participation in an attempted coup that took place on 27 November 1992. The coupists arrived on board a Venezuelan Air Force (FAV) Hercules C-130 aircraft accompanied by Colonel Luis Betancourt Infante, who accompanied them under orders from the Ministry of Defense. Meanwhile, 16 soldiers still remain in Peru, including General Francisco Visconti, one of the leading participants in the attempt to overthrow former President Carlos Andres Perez. The group of soldiers (24 officers and 10 subordinates) arrived at a military base, were taken to the Air Force Academy Headquarters, and will later be transferred by helicopter to the Army General Command in Caracas. From there they will be driven (later tonight) to the division in charge of military personnel awaiting trial at the San Carlos Garrison, also located in Caracas. After appearing before a military court, the group of soldiers will most likely be released under the authority of a presidential pardon. This "pacification," as it has been called, was one of the campaign promises of President Rafael Caldera. Yesterday, for example, Lt. Colonel Hugo Chavez, leader of the 4 February 1992 coup was released along with 14 other officers. Still pending is the situation surrounding those military officers remaining in Lima, including Gen. Visconti, who participated in the second 1992 coup attempt to topple Perez, which took place on 27 November.
