In the past, there was talk about Professor Geremek to the effect that, when he is on the stairs, you never know whether he is going up or down the stairs. This time, there was no such dilemma: Kwasniewski was obviously going down the ladder. Does his going down have a symbolic meaning? If one takes a look at political events of the past few weeks, one comes to the conclusion that, apart from the confusion (which in fact should not be taking place because a coalition is in power that has such an enormous majority that definitely no other coalition will have this type of majority in the years to come), there are a lot of other things as well. A few pieces are emerging that compose quite a definite picture. And the picture is not that new, by the way. It was clear from the beginning of the coalition consisting of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] that it is based on a lack of mutual confidence by the partners, and that acting in a way that would avoid deepening this lack of confidence will be one of the most significant problems. I dare say that nothing positive has been accomplished in that regard, but, instead, a lot has been done to increase the lack of confidence. Everyone is terribly excited about the president's refusing to appoint Dariusz Rosati deputy prime minister and finance minister, whereas I am surprised that Mr. Rosati wanted to be a candidate at all, after Prime Minister Pawlak reordered his office (an hour before going to the Belweder) by dismissing Witold Modzelewski of the Finance Ministry and appointing Mr. Jan Kubik of the PSL in such a hurry that the person concerned was not even notified. I can see no difference of merit between the situation that forced Marek Borowski to make his dramatic resignation and what happened recently. Back then, a deputy minister was dismissed behind the minister's back, whereas this time the changes were even more wide-ranging. This fact contradicts, of course, a popular theory that the president and the prime minister had a deal in Rosati's case. If they did indeed have a deal, what would be the goal of the prime minister (who usually procrastinates in signing various nominations) signing whatever came across his desk? The only goal was that he was rather sure of the nomination, and he wanted to have his own man in the Finance Ministry, who would take care of the PSL's interests, not just in the sense of party interests but also--let us be fair--the interests of the countryside electorate. Peasant activists were not thrilled at all by the fact that a large part of low-interest credits (established within the "1 Million Per Hectare" program) found themselves in Warsaw banks, where farmers tend not to do business. They were also not very happy about the fact that the candidate for deputy prime minister for economic affairs has not even met the PSL Parliamentary Club, despite the fact that the club asked for such a meeting. Rosati is definitely an excellent candidate for both posts for which he was chosen, but the way his candidacy was dealt with tends to shed a rather miserable light on politicians of the party that promoted Rosati. It is clear that a few lessons from the past were forgotten in all of this. Aleksander Kwasniewski, who studies the history of the Citizens Parliamentary Club so diligently, so as to prevent it from repeating itself with regard to his own Sejm deputies club, somehow ignored the past case of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who was the "main player" while the Jan Olszewski government was being formed. The main player soon became the prime minister's petitioner. It is a strange thing that the prime minister's post continues to be underestimated in Poland for some reason, despite the fact that it is the prime minister who has the instruments to exercise real power. After the PSL-SLD coalition was formed, it was not before the crisis associated with Marek Borowski's resignation that it was determined who really is the prime minister. From that moment on, it was clear that it is Waldemar Pawlak who is the prime minister. So, what should have been done was to reconsider once again the principles of cooperation within the coalition, and to put government and coalition ranks in order. But not a lot was done in that regard. An agreement has not been reached on ways of handling personnel changes, witness the case of Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, whose road to a post in the Defense Ministry [MON] has been so long and winding that one is entitled to feel that the road must indeed span the globe. More importantly, an agreement has not been reached on program-related issues, either. In all of his recent interviews, Aleksander Kwasniewski emphasized that the previous crisis resulted in the budget no longer being nobody's budget and becoming instead the budget of Prime Minister Pawlak's government. That is true. But we still do not know whether privatization is a completely private business of Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, especially given that, during debates on a draft of a privatization statute, quite clear differences of opinion emerged between Minister Podkanski (PSL) and Minister Pol of the Union of Labor on the one hand, and the Ownership Transformations Ministry's chief, who is from the SLD, on the other. It is not known whether the whole concept of changes in the so-called civil service, which was drafted by the Council of Minister's Office (and whose effect is making civil service political to the maximum extent possible), is Minister Strak's (PSL) business, or, alternatively, whether it is the coalition that is behind the concept and now supports it. If the latter is the case, the so-called coalition agreement concerning officials' professionalism and nonpolitical nature should go in the waste basket, and for good. These are some examples off the top of my head, which does not mean they are unimportant. Both problems pertain to the country's political system. For many weeks, the coalition held sessions, they decided on who-knows-what, but nothing practical came out of it anyway, apart from headlines in the press announcing that Siemiatkowski will take his MON post the next day, while the prime minister will present the president with his candidate for deputy prime minister and finance minister the day after that. But, in fact, the prime minister (in his usual style) temporized with the signing of the nominations, and he procrastinated with presenting his own candidate. There was unofficial talk that an intentional humiliation of Aleksander Kwasniewski was taking place. It must be true that right now, the SLD insists on Rosati's candidacy (which misfired, it can now be said) in order to humiliate the prime minister, who does not look unhappy at all about the president's decision (Minister Strak, for instance, was kind enough to have made several public statements to the effect that a lack of finance minister brings no harm to the country's economy). But it is beyond any doubt that Prime Minister Pawlak is in a tough situation because he clearly does not want to see a war with President Walesa. By the way, that is no surprise--if you have a coalition partner who has more votes in the Sejm, you still need another ally even if you cannot trust him, either. It is always more convenient to have two solutions rather than to be against the wall all of the time. Waldemar Pawlak experienced being against the wall before he was prime minister. But once he became the government's chief, he could see no reason for that to continue. Still, a question must be asked: Where is the endurance limit of the SLD ally, the kind of limit that, once crossed, will make the SLD say: "Enough," which can mean only one thing: the SLD leaving the coalition. At that point, Waldemar Pawlak, as chief of a minority government, even if it enjoys the Belweder's support, will become Aleksander Kwasniewski's petitioner because he will have to make efforts to gain Kwasniewski's support when it comes time to enact laws indispensable for the functioning of the country and its economy. It seems that that is about time the prime minister will ask himself that question in no uncertain terms. A further weakening of the coalition (which is extremely fragile to begin with) is not in the interest of the government, not to mention the country's interests. Incidentally, when it comes to the country, it seems that politicians have completely forgotten about it, while being preoccupied with their maneuvers in the upper echelons. Aleksander Kwasniewski should also ask himself a question like that. Getting the prime minister involved in a war with the president will eventually not turn out to the government's advantage. Because of his rejection of Dariusz Rosati's candidacy, President Lech Walesa received an enormous amount of criticism; Walesa is blamed for a continuous destabilization of the situation. It is said that Walesa's measures are associated with the beginning of the presidential campaign, which the president just launched. The truth is that a great many politicians have already joined the campaign, while the president himself has been taking part in it for some time now. In my view, the point is not about the campaign but about the president having always taken advantage of disagreements among politicians in order to gain something for himself. Everyone can see what the president is like, and he cannot be changed. I would be surprised if the president, while seeing so many cracks and disagreements in the coalition, did not try to maneuver them somehow, although, when it comes to the Rosati case, Walesa's success is dubious, unless his intention was to have everyone, from Bugaj to Hall, unite against him; this is what indeed happened. But, if the intention was to get rid of another serious candidate for finance minister--Leslaw Paga--the president succeeded in that marvelously. So I am not surprised with Lech Walesa's actions. What he will do about the budget will be a test of his real intentions. If he refuses to sign, which I doubt, I will regard the president as having acted against the reforms and having destabilized the economic situation for the first time. So far, he has signed a law on compensatory payments, even though he raised serious reservations. These reservations are reasonable from an economic standpoint. Using equally rational argumentation, he refused to sign a neo-popiwek [wage-controlling] law, which is a legislative little monster, having no chance of defending itself before the Constitutional Tribunal (possibility of introducing taxes through an ordinance by the Council of Ministers.) The president's refusal to sign the law may cause trade unions to be grateful to him, in addition to employees of big plants, and opposition members both in parliament and outside of it. So the neo-popiwek law was undoubtedly the coalition's gift to Lech Walesa. Therefore, there is no reason to constantly repeat the same scenario over and over again: The president says "No" in a situation, and he has a right to that, while the SLD immediately makes noise about limiting the president's constitutional powers. Spur of the moment tinkering with the Small Constitution is one of the worst possible ideas. Why does the Sejm simply not get down to work, prepare a draft of a constitution, and submit it to a referendum? If we keep announcing changes in the Constitution with every small conflict among politicians (this is not a conflict between the coalition and the president, but between the SLD and the president), we will lead Polish democracy astray, from where it will be hard to return. We had quite a start: Two Sejms whose terms ended ahead of schedule, and constant predictions--coming from different corners, by the way--that this particular Sejm will not survive the full term, either. So, instead of the ever-nervous atmosphere, which, unfortunately, is being created by all of the parties to those disputes, and instead of spectacular escapes using a ladder and insisting on a candidate who, as can be seen, is not desired a great deal by either the prime minister or the president, I would expect some reserve scenarios and talks among political elites before the damage is done, not afterwards. Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy has suggested to the president that regular summit meetings be held. Lech Walesa should respond positively to that proposal. Otherwise, the president-prime minister-chairman of the biggest parliamentary club arrangement will indeed turn into a Bermuda Triangle, in which Polish politics will get stuck completely, while being incapable of solving the real problems and concentrating instead on various maneuvers and ambition-driven games. What is the legacy of the recent crises so far? It is the lack of a director of economic policies and a future weakening of the finance minister's position. Whoever becomes the next finance minister will not have the position Marek Borowski used to enjoy in the government. What does a weak finance minister mean in our situation? It is better not to even think. Another legacy is the loss of popularity and social confidence by politicians of the governing camp. Jacek Kuron again leads in the popularity polls. And so we have a situation that resembles something out of the strangest dream. The opposition practically does not exist, while concentrating mainly on debates on what it means to be an opposition, while the government's performance is declining. It is indeed quite a difficult thing to do--to so effectively disorganize a coalition like this.
