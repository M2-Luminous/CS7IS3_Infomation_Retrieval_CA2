He said that the only possibility of doing this and at the same time respecting the opinion of neighbouring countries was to concentrate on the safety of nuclear power plant operations. "The project for completing the nuclear power plant in Mochovce, West Slovakia, is safer than the European average," Moravcik said. Cooperation with France provides the possibility for securing Slovakia's basic interests in the energy producing sector and completing the Mochovce plant in a manner that would "serve as an example" of a safe solution, Moravcik added. He stressed that the participation of the French and banking institutions in the Mochovce plant's completion was subject to the condition that operations would be stopped in the first reactor of another Slovak nuclear power plant located in Jaslovske Bohunice, West Slovakia. "The government has accepted the obligation," Moravcik stressed.
