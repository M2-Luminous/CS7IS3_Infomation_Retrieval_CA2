It asserts that this oversight is not the result of ignorance, because the Israeli nuclear enterprise is known to all intelligence services. In an editorial today, AL-AKHBAR refers to remarks made by U.S. sources that Israel will acquire 45 F-15E combat aircraft. It points out that this is the first time the United States has agreed to sell this sophisticated type of aircraft and says that these planes will enable the Israeli air force to carry out strikes against Libya, Iraq, and Iran. AL-AKHBAR remarks that this raises questions about the U.S. position on Israel and causes much astonishment. The paper asserts that the U.S. attitude to nuclear weapon proliferation is contradictory; while it pressures North Korea to open its nuclear facilities to international inspection, going as far as to threaten air strikes against it, it disregards any discussion of Israel's nuclear weapons, long deployed in the Negev. AL-AKHBAR denounces the Israeli Government's refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in clear defiance of the international community. The paper says the Israeli intelligence services occasionally leak reports about the country's nuclear weapons so as to frighten Arab countries near and far.
