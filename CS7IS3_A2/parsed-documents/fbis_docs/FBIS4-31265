Unfortunately, we here in Geneva are holding talks with those who have started fascism, and I think the United Nations should draw a parallel between these two days, today and the day that is being celebrated in Europe -- this is very euphoric -- the day when all forces united against Hitler. However, they have allowed the Belgrade fascism to promote its ideas here in the heart of Europe. Butrus-Ghali said that the United Nations has had many problems recently. Problems are appearing everywhere. Of course, we have stressed that this is, above all, the responsibility of the United Nations, which did not act preventively and did not stop the ethnic cleansing and genocide in Bosnia. They have verified and bred the virus of ethnic cleansing that is now spreading throughout the world. I think the situation is very alarming and that the United Nations must demonstrate consistency in Bosnia; it must stop fascism to somehow regain its credibility and do something in other parts of the world. The talks are continuing. Of course, the aggressor is using the tactics of freezing. It wants the United Nations to protect the territories that it has captured as well as its trenches on the front lines; its soldiers are tired and are demanding to be replaced. However, we will not agree to that. The negotiations are still going on.
