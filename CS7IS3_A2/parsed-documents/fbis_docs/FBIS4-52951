The once-dominant LDP will submit a no-confidence motion onto the floor of the House of Representatives "as the current administration controls only 40 percent of the House of Representatives' total seats," Kono told the ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper. Kono, whose LDP lost its 38-year lock on power last August, said the party will table the motion shortly after the passage of the long-overdue fiscal 1994 state budget program, now six weeks behind the start of the new fiscal year. The budget is widely expected to pass the Diet by the end of June. The current Diet session ends June 29. Kono said the LDP, which has 206 seats in the 511-member chamber, needs the support of its archrival the Social Democratic Party [of Japan], which has 74 seats, to push the motion through the lower house with a necessary majority of 256 votes. "The LDP does not single-handedly have the majority, so it needs the cooperation with a multiple number of political parties to exert a decisive influence," he said. "The LDP wants to collaborate with the Social Democratic Party... to scuttle the current administration if our two parties' perceptions of the current power balance coincide," he said. However, Kono acknowledged in the interview that there is a deep gulf between the policies and ideologies of the two longtime archrival parties. "Yes, there is a large gap. We need to hold further discussion within the LDP concerning the advisability of immediately initiating talks (with the SDP) for reconciling policy gaps," he said. Kono said the current political situation would give a definite advantage to the LDP in what he sees as an imminent general election, adding that his party prefers to contest it under the new single-seat constituency system, the daily said. Kono predicted, however, that Hata may respond to the motion's passage by disbanding his cabinet en masse and then having a new premier from the coalition call a general election under the single- seat constituency system, which first requires passage of an electoral redistricting bill.
