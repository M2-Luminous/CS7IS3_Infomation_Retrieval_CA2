NODONG SINMUN today says this is a grave infringement upon the sovereignty of Lebanon and a never-to-be-condoned terrorist act. The analyst says: Lebanon, bitterly denouncing this case as an encroachment on its sovereignty, strongly urged the United Nations Security Council to convene a session and Israel to release Dirani and all other Lebanese prisoners in Israel. Lebanon is a party to Arab-Israel bilateral talks. Israel is crying for peace talks, while continuing terrorism against its dialogue partner. Such an act can be justified with nothing. The United States, styling itself "a judge" in the problem of terrorism and "a fair mediator" in the Mideast peace talks, is now ignoring the demand of Syria and other Arab nations for denouncing Israel's terrorism. This is really unreasonable. Israel must stop terrorism infringing upon the sovereignty of Arab nations including Lebanon and the United States must refrain from doing things obstructive to the Mideast peace process, taking an impartial stand.
