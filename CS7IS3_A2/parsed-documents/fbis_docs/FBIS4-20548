Orders represented 5.2 billion francs, a more than 25-percent growth over the preceding year. These excellent results reflect export orders for equipment to be medium term delivered. As of 31 December 1993, order books also showed significant growth, having for the first time reached 9 billion francs (not including price revisions). Turnover of the Dassault Electronique parent firm was 2,770 billion francs in 1993, practically the same as in 1992 (2,791 billion francs) for booked orders worth 4,145 billion francs, a 40-percent increase over 1992 (2,970 billion francs). During the October 1993 meeting of the Board of Administration, the Chairman, Bertrand Daugny announced that the Group had returned to profitability in 1993.
