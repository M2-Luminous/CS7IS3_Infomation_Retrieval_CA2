FR941012-2-00189 FR941012-2-00117 There are three instances in which a higher than 80 percent Federal share would be maintained. First, in States with large areas of Indian and certain public domain lands, and National Forests, parks and monuments, the local share for highway projects is determined by a sliding scale rate, calculated based on the percentage of public lands within that state. This sliding scale, which permits a greater Federal share, but not to exceed 95 percent, is applicable to transit projects funded with flexible funds in these public land states. FHWA develops the sliding scale matching ratios for the increased Federal share. Additionally, commuter carpooling and vanpooling projects and transit safety projects using flexible funds administered by FTA may retain the same 100 percent Federal share that would be allowed for ride-sharing or safety projects administered by the FHWA. The 100 percent safety projects are subject to a nationwide ten percent program limitation. C. Other Funds Transferred to FTA Certain demonstration projects authorized under Title 23 are specified to be used for transit projects and are more appropriately administered by FTA. In such cases, FHWA has transferred the funds to FTA for administration. Since these funds are not STP flexible funds, they are transferred into the appropriate Capital Program category (Bus, New Starts, or Fixed Guideway Modernization) for obligation and are administered as Capital projects. IX. Capital Program (Formerly Section 3) A. Fixed Guideway Modernization Formula Fixed Guideway Modernization funds are allocated by formula. Statutory percentages were established to allocate the first $497,700,000 to 11 fixed guideway areas. The next $70,000,000 is allocated one-half to these 11 urbanized areas and one-half to other urbanized areas with fixed guideways which are at least seven years old on the basis of the Urbanized Area Formula Program fixed guideway tier formula factors. The remaining funds are allocated to all of these urbanized areas as one universe. For fiscal year 1995, $725,000,000 was appropriated for fixed guideway modernization. After the three-quarter percent set-aside ($5,437,500), $719,562,500 is available for apportionment to the specified urbanized areas for Fixed Guideway Modernization funding. Table 6 displays these apportionments. Fixed Guideway Modernization funds apportioned under this section must be used for capital projects to modernize or improve fixed guideway systems. All urbanized areas with fixed guideway systems which are at least seven years old are eligible to receive Fixed Guideway Modernization funds. A request for the start-up service dates for fixed guideways has been incorporated into the Section 15 data reporting system to ensure that all eligible fixed guideway data is included in the calculation of these apportionments. A threshold level of more than one mile of fixed guideway is required to receive Fixed Guideway Modernization funds. Therefore, urbanized areas reporting less than one mile of fixed guideway mileage under Section 15 are not included. B. New Starts The fiscal year 1995 appropriation for New Starts is $646,670,000. These funds are entirely earmarked for projects specified within the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act. After the three-quarter percent set-aside ($4,850,025), $641,819,975 remains available for allocation to areas. Table 7 displays the allocations by area and also shows prior year unobligated earmarks for New Starts. C. Bus The fiscal year 1995 appropriation for Bus is $353,330,000 for the purchase of buses, bus-related equipment and paratransit vehicles, and for the construction of bus-related facilities. After the three-quarter percent set-aside ($2,649,975) for project management oversight, $350,680,025 remains available for projects. The ISTEA earmarked $12,000,000 in Bus funding for two bus projects in fiscal year 1995. The Conference Report accompanying the 1995 DOT Appropriations Act earmarked an additional $316,330,000 to specified states or localities for bus and bus-related capital projects. FTA administrative commitment of fiscal year 1995 funds to one full funding grant agreement totals $1,700,000. Thus, $20,650,025 remains available for discretionary allocation by the Federal Transit Administrator. Table 8 displays the allocations of earmarked fiscal year 1995 Bus funds by area and also shows prior year unobligated earmarks for the Bus Program. X.
