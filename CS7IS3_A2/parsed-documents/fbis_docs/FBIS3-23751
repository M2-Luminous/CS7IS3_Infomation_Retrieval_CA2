Shaymiyev, president of the Republic of Tatarstan, at Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan 19th Session on 7 February 1994: "The Socioeconomic and Political Situation in the Republic"] [Text] Esteemed People's Deputies! Examining the results of 1993 in the sphere of the economy, it may be said that together with individual positive changes, many of the negative trends of 1992 persisted. Stability in the economy has not, unfortunately, come about. The financial position of practically all major commodity producers at the present time is critical. You all know the detailed results of the operation of the republic's economy--they have been published in the press. This January we held a whole number of working meetings with the directors of enterprises of all sectors, with the participation of the administration heads and the chairmen of the standing commissions of the Supreme Soviet, which made a frank analysis of the state of the economy and an assessment of the progress of the economic reforms. As a result the government charted paths of the gradual stabilization of production in particular sectors of industry. The results of 1993 show that the decline in industrial production as a whole compared with 1992 constituted 14.9 percent, which was somewhat better than in the Russian Federation, where the decline constituted 16.2 percent. It has to be considered here that the decline in the extractive sectors (oil and gas) was brought about by objective, natural factors and had been forecast by us. A telling factor in the decline in production in machine building was the situation following the fire at the Kama Truck Plant (the Kama Truck Plant accounts for 3.1 percent of the decline). In a number of sectors here, in the agro-industrial complex primarily, the decline was halted, as a result of which an increase in production of 5.7 percent, not counting alcoholic products, was achieved in 1993 in food production, and, counting alcoholic products, the growth constituted 7.3 percent. An appreciable increase in volume was achieved in sugar (13.8 percent) and meat (1.1) industry and in the production of animal oil (22.1 percent), cheese (18.6 percent), confectionery (4.7 percent), and nonalcoholic beverages (21.3 percent). At the same time, on the other hand, on account of reduced consumer demand there was somewhat of a decline in the production of whole-milk products and bakery and macaroni items. Some 984,000 tonnes of grain, 837,000 tonnes of sugar beet, 122,000 tonnes of potatoes, 82,000 tonnes of vegetables, 1.149 million tonnes of milk, 232,000 tonnes of livestock and poultry, and 752 million eggs were procured for state resources, which was considerably in excess of the volume of purchases in the preceding year. The volume of production and procurements which was achieved makes it possible to preserve the current level of consumption of the basic foodstuffs in the republic. It should be noted here that only two or three regions of Russia achieved an increase in the production and procurements of farming and animal husbandry products. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rate of Growth of Purchases of Animal Husbandry Products in 1993 (as a Per-| |centage of 1992) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Livestock and pou-|Milk |Eggs | | |ltry | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |85 |94 |99.5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Republic of Tatar-|107 |109 |104 | |stan | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Samara Oblast |86 |96 |101 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ulyanovsk Oblast |100.9 |107 |108 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Republic of Mari |88 |103 |106 | |El | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chuvash Republic |83 |105 |90 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kirov Oblast |88 |95 |96 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Udmurt Oblast |91 |97 |113 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Republic of Bashk-|104 |106 |104 | |ortostan | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The positive results in the agrarian sector were achieved primarily thanks to the labor of our villagers and the active assistance of the state. The budget assumed half the expenditure on an increase in the fertility of the land and the outlays on reclamation, the construction of facilities of the social infrastructure of the countryside, the support of seed growing and pedigree breeding, the building of enterprises of food and processing industry, the development of science, and certain other measures. Some R156 billion of budget appropriations were channeled to this end in the past year. As a result a gross product 2 percent greater than in 1992 was produced. Meat, milk, and egg production increased. The biggest harvest of grain crops in the republic's history (approximately 23 quintals per hectare) was obtained. Seeds and forage were laid in in the full requirement, and the requisite quantity of grain for food was sold on account of remuneration of the kolkhoz members and sovkhoz workers. Thus the efforts of the government and many outfits in the past year produced certain positive results in respect to the stabilization of the economic situation in a number of life-sustaining sectors of the republic. Sociopolitical stability, the basis of which is the active policy of social protection of the populace, which has been in effect since the start of the reforms and which has recently been specially targeted and perfected, has been preserved in the republic. Our approaches to these problems are being studied by many regions and are being perceived positively. The two years of radical reforms have shown that the course chosen by the federal authorities is incapable of extricating the economy from crisis, which has led everyone to the conclusion of the need for certain corrections. Now, as we all know, a new course is being devised. Whatever the corrections, it is clear that the reforms begun in 1992 have reached a depth at which they have become irreversible. And we must regard this as a positive result. What are the main landmarks of the reforms? First, a partial price liberalization was undertaken. The abandonment of government regulation of prices switched inflation from a concealed state to an open form, which afforded an opportunity for correctly evaluating the state of the economy at the macro- and micro-levels. Second, partial convertibility of the ruble was introduced. The fluctuations in the ruble exchange rate became an indicator and an actual instrument regulating the movement of capital and, partially, the dynamics of prices. Third, the privatization process began. A basic package of laws of primary privatization was prepared and began to operate. Approximately one-half of property has already been privatized, in fact. It is still too early to speak of the efficiency of the activity of the privatized enterprises on account of the short amount of time they have been operating under the new conditions. But it may be affirmed even now that neither price liberalization nor privatization will in themselves resolve the problems of efficiency and that they should merely create the conditions and motives for the change and adaptation of the structure of production to market conditions of functioning. The following additional conditions are essential for this, in turn: financial stabilization and the possibility of the unrestricted transfer of capital. But we do not have this yet. It is essential, therefore, to create a secondary securities market, expand the circulation of bills, and so forth. At the same time appreciable flaws have been discerned in the reforms: the reforms have been implemented mainly via instruments of macroeconomic policy, which has proven entirely insufficient, and have led merely to fragmentary changes in the conditions of the functioning of the economy, which has engendered a number of new problems. Thus it has become increasingly obvious that financial stabilization will not be achieved while the current policy is preserved since the struggle has been conducted not against the main causes of inflation but against its secondary factors. Inflation has assumed a steady, self-reproducing nature so that even were there a general mutual offsetting of arrears, the situation would in a very short space of time be what it was formerly, only at a new twist of the inflation spiral. Although there needs to be financial support for the priority areas even now, otherwise a severe recession and increased unemployment await us. Reality itself has brought about an understanding of the truth that without the profound structural reorganization of the entire economy it will be impossible to emerge from the crisis slump. Whence also another conclusion: A structural reorganization of the cumbersome monopolized economic system that has taken shape over many decades cannot be undertaken rapidly, by radical measures, with the use merely of financial instruments at the macroeconomic level. An escape from the impasse and real stabilization under the conditions of the evolved economy require an entirely different level of work of the state organs of administration. A surmounting of the cost-no-object nature of the economy and arrival at a sufficient level of competitiveness are possible only with the painstaking, persevering, and quite long-term work of the state at the macro- and micro-economic levels. The development of market reforms thus requires not a weakening but a strengthening of state influence on the economy, and it is production that is in need of this first and foremost. A certain amount of work is being performed in this direction in Tatarstan. A concept of structural transformations of the economy of the republic has been devised. True, it also requires considerable modification. Even today we can speak about certain experience of the interaction of the government authorities on the structural reorientation of enterprises of the military-industrial complex of the Republic of Tatarstan based on the competitive selection and realization of business projects for specific areas encompassing sectors of the agro-industrial complex, the construction complex, the production of health-care equipment, and certain others. We attempted for the first time to link structural changes in the republic's economy with work at the level of specific enterprises with regard to the economic expediency of the projects and the timeframe of their cost recovery and the return of invested capital. All these efforts made by the government of the republic unilaterally are undoubtedly insufficient for compensating for the wholesale reduction in government contracts for enterprises of the military-industrial complex. The reduction has proceeded at an increasing tempo: 22 percent in 1991, 44 percent in 1992, and 41 percent in 1993. The federal authorities have constantly reneged on their commitments pertaining to the funding of conversion measures. Use has been made even of a highly original method of "combating" inflation--the Government of the Russian Federation has simply not paid for the defense hardware product which it had ordered and which has been manufactured. The total arrears on the manufactured product in 1993 amount to more than R33 billion. We are at the present time continuing to work with the Government of the Russian Federation at various levels to resolve the accumulated urgent problems. In January 1994 the government of the republic concluded an agreement with the Mashinoeksport Association, which had expressed a readiness to invest and participate in the realization of 18 innovation and conversion projects. The agreement determined over 70 items of interest for sale on the external market. All this is exceptionally important for the survival of our major enterprises and design bureaus under the conditions of transition to the market. Market reforms have spotlighted the low efficiency of many industries. Thus the attempt to approximate the price of energy to the world price brought the price of oil to the present R50,000-60,000 a tonne. This is still less than half the average world price. But even here the price of the finished product of many sectors consuming energy as raw material is either very approximate to the world price or has already surpassed it. The main reasons for this phenomenon are low productivity and high unproductive outlays. It should be observed that there has been practically no growth in productivity since the start of the reforms and that it has declined even at many enterprises. In the republic's industry as a whole the level of productivity in 1993 constituted 89.7 percent of the 1992 level. Many people are preferring not to recall this indicator even. Yet only a replacement of fixed capital with higher productivity can ensure a way out of the crisis under the conditions of the market. Nature has simply not devised any other mechanisms of the economy reaching the phase of upturn. The sooner, therefore, that we abandon illusions in the mythical expectation of everything being "resolved of its own accord," the sooner the prerequisites of the start of an escape from the impasse will be created. The situation will not start to improve before enterprises learn to introduce more productive capital and can on the basis of increased efficiency really reduce costs and, accordingly, prices. Whence the competitiveness of the manufactured commodity. A difficult situation has come about at enterprises of the republic's oil and petroleum-refining industry. The Nizhnekamskneftekhim and Kazorgsintez stock companies and the S.M. Kirov Zavod S.K. Association are operating on the verge of the stoppage of individual works. This has been caused on the one hand by the crisis of arrears, the reduction in sales markets, the difficulties in purchasing raw material, and the further increase in the price of energy and, on the other, by the fact that the price of individual products has approached and even reached the world price. Even today the production of latex and ethylene oxide (stage one) has been terminated, and phenol, acetone, and divinyl will be next. One-third of the oil wells are unprofitable, and many of them are standing idle. This, in turn, is creating additional difficulties in the work of related sectors (the Kvart Stock Company, the Nizhnekamskshina Production Association, the Kazan Iskozh Plant, and so forth). For the purpose of stabilizing the production activity of these outfits the government of the republic has been forced to adopt temporary measures to regulate the price of oil and the tariffs on the electric and thermal power which they consume. Significant efforts are also being made by the work force of enterprises of the republic's petrochemical complex itself. Structural changes are being actively undertaken to reduce energy-consuming processes in the Tatneft Association and the Nizhnekamskneftekhim and Orgsintez stock companies. The creation of the Tatneftekhiminvestkholding financial and industrial group and the assistance of the government of the republic should contribute to the creation of the conditions for the assurance of normal reproduction for the entire complex. This is vitally important for the republic because it is they that provide the budget with the lion's share of revenue and that are life-supporting sectors. The financial and economic situation that has taken shape in the republic requires a careful selection of facilities for funding, in-depth expert evaluation of the projects which are submitted, and subsequent on-the-spot supervision of the targeted use of the allocated funds. The efficient functioning of the economy of enterprises and organizations under reform conditions demands a prompt and flexible response to the constantly changing requirements of the market. Where this has been understood and the conclusions have been drawn, there is evidence of positive results. We may include in this category the Kazan Terminal Production Association, where conversion is being undertaken successfully. At the end of 1992 even approximately 90 percent of the manufactured product here was composed of military orders, which were dropped practically simultaneously. But thanks to the presence of unique technology and powerful and multilevel production potential, the association rapidly switched to the manufacture of a variety of peaceful products which the public needs, has recovered from the shock of conversion, it may be said, and is getting back on its feet. It is gratifying that these are not just isolated examples. The experience of the work of the Vakuummash Enterprise, the Kvart, Elekon, and KMIZ stock companies, the Almetyevsk Submersible Pump Plant, and certain others shows how it is possible to organize the assimilation and production of new products in a short space of time. It is essential that the managers of the republic's enterprises study their experience and adopt vigorous measures for the restructuring of their production with regard to the demands of the market. Proceeding from the current situation, the forecast for 1994 is oriented toward selective support of the life-sustaining sectors of production: Support will be rendered to the agro-industrial complex and also the enterprises that are prepared to provide for the rapid recovery of resources invested in the interests of the republic's economy. A certain reduction in the production of oil and gas is planned--90.8 percent of the 1993 level. The output of a number of petrochemical products is to increase: polyethylene (104.2 percent), rubber (108.8 percent), and building materials (103.8 percent), including bricks (104.6 percent). We are expecting a certain growth in the production of consumer goods, both of the nonfood group and food, which is to contribute to the preservation of political stability in the republic. The Kama Truck Plant Stock Company is to be standing on its own two feet in the current year, and we are hoping for an appreciable growth in motor-vehicle production. As we all know, on 16 April 1993 the Kama Truck Plant Stock Company Engines Plant was destroyed as a result of a fire and shut down. Within two weeks following the accident the board of directors of the Kama Truck Plant and the KamGESenergostroy Concern had concentrated at this site more than 100 heavy cranes and more than 10,000 workers and had organized people's around-the-clock flexible-shift work without weekends or holidays. Within three months the mounds of metal structures with a total weight of 90,000 tonnes had been pulled apart and the replacement installation of the housing of the engine plant had begun. Despite difficulties over financing, the installation of part of the block with an area of 220,000 square meters had been completed, heating had been supplied and the manufacture of components had begun, and the manufacture of the power unit of the KamAZ vehicle had been resumed by 1 November 1993, and the final block of the roof at the engine plant with a total area of 420,000 square meters was installed on 25 January 1994. It would be unfair not to commend with gratitude today the work of these splendid outfits. Targeted development programs of various levels: interstate, interregional, republic, and so forth, could be a direction of the stabilization of the economy. Studies are currently being conducted with the Government of Russia on participation in the financing of a number of large-scale programs such as maintenance of the level of oil production, a resolution of the environmental and social problems of the oil regions, and the reconstruction of the petrochemical works, the Zainskaya and Urussinskaya state regional electric power stations, the Kama Truck Plant Heat and Electric Power Plant, and a number of others. I would like to make particular mention of the YelAZ. Its fate has been difficult since the disintegration of the USSR. The consistent steps adopted by the leadership of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation could produce positive results. The concept of the further construction of the YelAZ and the unification to this end of the efforts of Russia and the former Union republics is gradually being put into practice. The intergovernmental agreement "Joint Creation of a Complex of Machinery of the Automotive Plant in the City of Yelabug" was signed and the share of the contributions of each party was determined in April 1993 in Minsk. The participants included the Russian Federation, Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, and Ukraine and the republics of Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. The YelAZ-invest Consortium, whose main purpose is the concentration of the investors' resources for this large-scale construction project, was formed and registered last September in Tatarstan. The parties' first contributions to the original capital have now been made, and it is contemplated in the current year forming the capital fund in full. The government support for the YelAZ has revived interest in the project on the part of national business circles and foreign capital. Numerous proposals concerning participation in the creation of the automotive plant, on the part of the world's biggest automotive companies (DEU of South Korea, General Motors of the United States, Renault of France, and Volkswagen of Germany) included, are being received. All this affords an opportunity for a start on the creation of modern, competitive motor-vehicle production, and this opportunity needs to be realized. I would like to say a few words also about the procedure of the purchases of agricultural products and raw material in 1994. The point being that the Edict of the President of Russia of 27 October 1993 "On Regulation of Land Relations and the Development of Agrarian Reform in Russia" abolishes as of 1994 the compulsory supplies and other forms of the compulsory confiscation of agricultural products for state resources. We believe that such an approach corresponds to the requirements of normal market relations. But in agriculture, for a variety of reasons, market relations are taking shape extremely slowly as yet, and the conditions have not been created for the production of competitive products. Considering these circumstances, it would be expedient to preserve for the current year the system of procurements of agricultural products based on forward contracting agreements between the commodity producers and the procurement officers in the amounts of the 1993 level. I consider impermissible the formulation of the question of a reduction in the amount of the commodity product on the part of individual leaders of rayons and kolkhozes and sovkhozes since this would lead primarily to a reduction in the income of the rural population and also of purchasing power. In 1993 the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan raised the purchase price of agricultural products repeatedly, ensuring the minimum profitability of the sector here. At the same time, on the other hand, it is essential to emphasize that a sufficient level for realizing expanded reproduction was not secured. And in the future it will be necessary to systematically revise the level of procurement prices and subsidies for agricultural products with regard to the reduction in the extent of the direct allocation to agriculture of capital investments from the republic budget. Realization of land reform will continue in 1994. The number of peasant (private) farms will have reached more than 1,000 in the year. It is essential that the Ministry of Agriculture and Food complete reform of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes with regard to accumulated experience, with the allocation to all members of the work force of a property share and allotments of land. This will interest the villagers to a considerable extent in the end results of production. State of Affairs in the Republic's Construction Complex A decisive role in the accumulation not only of the production potential but also the entire national wealth of the republic belongs to the construction complex. It encompasses 615 construction organizations and 65 enterprises of construction materials industry. Its share of generated national income constitutes more than 10 percent, and it employs approximately 200,000 persons. Here, as in other sectors, changes are under way, and a transition to market relations is being effected. The privatization of enterprises and the formation of new structures have contributed to a redistribution of investment volumes. Thus the share of the investments of state-owned enterprises in the sum total declined from 78 percent in 1992 to 67 percent in 1993. At the same time there was an increase in the share of investments of stock companies--from 6 to 20 percent respectively--and it grew somewhat for individual builders also. The ratio of the amounts of capital investments in the construction of facilities for production and nonproduction purposes changed in favor of the latter from 25 percent of the total volume in 1985 to 35 percent in 1993. The volume of capital investments in 1993 declined 5.5 percent compared with the 1992. The decline occurred because of the reduction in capital investments in respect to production facilities (90.3 percent of the 1992 level). There was growth--103.2 percent--in terms of nonproduction facilities, and investments in housing construction remained at the 1992 level. The reduction in investments is occurring because of the decline in the investment activity of builders of all forms of property (on account of the high degree of inflation, evidently). A precise government program in respect to the most important investment projects, in which it is necessary to specify measures for their protection against inflation, should be adopted in this connection. The shortage of capital for investments is being made worse by the inadequate efficiency in the organization of construction. In 1993 builders of all forms of property commissioned R337 billion of fixed capital, which was almost R400 billion less than utilized capital investments. There are only 46 kopeks of fixed capital introduced per R1 of invested assets (99 kopeks in 1985). Market mechanisms in capital construction have yet to begin to operate to the full extent. As previously also, facilities are mainly introduced at the end of the year, the construction front remains, as before, extraordinarily wide, and capital investments are dispersed around a large number of construction projects. According to a preliminary estimate, the extent of incomplete construction as of the start of 1994 will have increased by a factor of 1.5 and will have exceeded the amount of utilized capital by 42 percent. Some R258 billion of capital investments were used for the construction of facilities of the social sphere in January-December 1993. The commissioning of nonproduction facilities exceeded the indicators of the preceding year as follows: by 13 percent for hospitals (beds) and by 15 percent for clubhouses and houses of culture. In terms of general schools, preschools, and outpatient-clinic establishments there was a reduction in introduction compared with the 1992 level of 37, 27, and 4 percent respectively. Of the total amount of nonproduction capital investments, 59 percent (R151.8 billion) were channeled into housing construction. Some 1.275 million square meters of total living space were introduced in 1993, which constitutes 88 percent of the amount introduced in 1992. Despite the repeated criticisms, the government proved incapable of rectifying matters in the construction complex, and the situation continues to deteriorate, what is more. In the course of preparation of this report the construction workers and their sponsors gave me, in my view, specialist material containing recommendations as to how matters may be rectified rapidly in construction under the conditions of transition to the market. Approving your advice, I would simultaneously ask you to put it into practice in the current year. There will very shortly be a republic construction conference, at which a detailed analysis will be made and at which measures to increase the efficiency of the construction complex are to be formulated. Progress of Privatization The progress of privatization in the republic was examined and the new tasks were determined recently with the participation of administration heads, the leaders of ministries and departments and major enterprises, and people's deputies of the republic. Some 43 percent of enterprises in industry, 35 percent in the construction complex, and 32.3 percent in the agro-industrial complex have been privatized at the present time. Plans for the privatization of 360 large and medium-sized enterprises with a total capital fund of more than R500 billion have been approved. They include such giants as the Tatneft, the Nizhnekamskneftekhim, Organicheskiy sintez, the KMPO, the KVPO, the Tatstroy, the Tatmyasoagroprom, and others. A further 1,200 enterprises approximately are in a privatization mode. As we can see, there are certain results. But small-scale privatization in the republic is proceeding markedly behind schedule, unfortunately. Whereas the large stores and wholesale depots retained as state property have already been converted, in the main, the privatization of small enterprises of trade, public catering, and consumer service is only at the start of the route. I would like once more to call your attention, that of administration heads primarily, to the need for the most decisive and assertive action to be taken, and no less than 60-70 percent of small cafes, restaurants, workshops, hairdressers, and stores should find new owners in the current year. A few words about IPV (registered privatization deposits). It is necessary that this mechanism of the noncompensable transfer of property to our citizens operate with precision. On the whole, there is firm confidence that all 100 percent of the IPV will be "materialized." The task locally is to describe and explain persuasively and intelligibly to everyone how to competently dispose of the privatization deposit. Today we are faced with one further task of enormous state importance--the privatization of housing. Two months have elapsed since this law took effect. In the majority of cities and districts of the republic this work has begun in organized fashion, precisely, and without red tape. But there are shortcomings also, unfortunately. Attempts are being made in places to complicate the process of the privatization of housing, and various restrictions are being invented and artificially devised in addition to the law, which is categorically prohibited. There have been instances of the citizens' lack of knowledgeability and of their having been kept in the dark both as to the essence of the law and the benefits accruing to an owner who has privatized his residence. It seems to many inhabitants of the republic for some reason or other that if they privatize their apartment, they are immediately inundated with incredibly high expenses for its upkeep and so forth. And such disinformation is coming from certain government officials, who are in this way simply attempting to intimidate people. The task of the local organs of power and administration is to do everything for the rapid transfer of housing to the public strictly in accordance with the law. A housing market has to be created. Concluding this part of my speech, I will say that privatization is a most important area of our activity in the current year. And we intend to implement it decisively. Execution of the Consolidated and Republic Budgets of the Republic of Tatarstan The republic budget for 1993 was executed in revenue terms to the extent of 284 percent of the plan voted by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan. The indicators of the consolidated budget, in respect to which execution for the year constituted 311 percent, were somewhat better. The excess of revenue over expenditure in terms of the republic budget constituted R2.6 billion or 0.5 percent of the overall budget. In respect to the local budgets these indicators are somewhat higher and constitute R9.6 billion or 2 percent of total revenue respectively. The plans were overfulfilled thanks, in the main, to unpredictable price factors. At the same time, on the other hand, the absence of a mechanism for curbing inflation brought about a slowdown in settlements in the economy, which, in turn, led to a growth of reciprocal arrears, a complication of the financial situation of many enterprises, and, as a result, to a budget revenue shortfall. In terms of the year's results, on account of the continuing trend of the growth of nonpayments, there was a budget revenue shortfall of more than R200 billion of value-added tax and profits tax in respect to four most important taxpayers (Tatneft, Tatenergo, Nizhnekamskshina, and Nizhnekamskneftekhim) alone. The problem of payment discipline remains acute. The basic tax arrears as of 1 January 1994 amounted to more than R42 billion. Budget expenditure grew at a more rapid pace (compared with revenue). Practically the entire overfulfillment of the revenue side was channeled into the sectors' growing need for financial resources. In this connection the expenditure of the republic and consolidated budgets was executed for 1993 at 256 and 264 percent respectively. There was supplementary expenditure from the republic budget in 1993 totaling over R300 billion, of which more than half was channeled into covering expenses connected with the pay increases in the nonproduction sphere. At the same time the budget was not drawn up or executed with the maximum austerity, nor was full account taken of the economic possibilities of the republic. The carryover indebtedness of the republic budget for 1993 in respect to sectors of the economy, capital investments, and other measures constituted more than R50 billion. In terms of the year's results the majority of local budgets (certain municipal budgets constitute the sole exception) failed to create a sufficient reserve of financial resources for the financing in full of pay, which was raised as of 1 December, and facilities of capital construction (aside from housing) and the creation of stocks of fuel and materials. This was caused mainly by the diversion of budget resources by the leaders of districts and cities for nonpriority expenditure and also the financing of activities and sectors which are not a part of the budget system, without regard to forthcoming budget expenditure. According to preliminary calculations, approximately R50 billion in terms of local budgets were diverted for expenditure not connected with a budget classification. Thus in Bugulminskiy and Tukayevskiy districts and the cities of Almetyevsk, Bugulm, and Nizhnekamsk substantial budget resources were invested in bank deposits, and credit was granted to various enterprises and organizations, some of which has still not been returned to the budget. A substantial amount of the revenue of the local budgets which had been obtained additionally was channeled into the purchase of automobiles, furniture, computers, and the provision of the district centers with amenities in Mamalyshskiy, Zainskiy, Bavlinskiy, and Mustyumovskiy districts. In addition, according to data of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, budget resources allocated for gas supply in Alkeyevskiy, Aktanyshskiy, Spasskiy, Tetyushskiy, Tyulyachinskiy, and Pestrechinskiy districts were used for purposes other than those specifically intended. The concept of the formation of the system of the budget of the republic for 1994 should be geared mainly to the survivability of the current network of social and cultural institutions, the social protection of the population, the completion of the construction, which has begun, of housing and other facilities of the social sphere due for introduction, and maintenance at the requisite level of sectors of the economy, prices and tariffs in which are regulated by the state. Preliminary calculations do not afford grounds for forecasting a marked improvement in the condition of the budget in the first quarter of the current year compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and despite the most modest expenditure, therefore, the budget deficit will reach 40 percent of revenue. In this connection it is essential, in addition to the accomplishment of the paramount task of reducing enterprise arrears, to take decisive steps for a reduction in unproductive expenditure and the economical and targeted use of budget resources. A further release of tariffs and a revision of allowances in housing and municipal service and transport are required. It would be expedient to adopt, on the basis of budget possibilities, a realistic program of capital construction for 1994 and to take the path of the restriction of the funding of particular large-scale projects and programs, adopted by the Supreme Soviet of Republic of Tatarstan included. Social Policy A principal task in social policy is that of a rise in personal income. In December the living standard in Tatarstan had practically reached the mark of approximately 3 (2.92, to be precise), and in the Russian Federation, 2 (more precisely, 1.89). This means that the per capita income of the inhabitants our republic is almost three times higher than the value of the subsistence minimum (per capita income in Tatarstan in December was R72,771, and the subsistence minimum, R24,918; in Russia per capita income was R84,000, the subsistence minimum, R44,352). I have to mention here that we need subsequently to take as the basis not the subsistence minimum but the minimum budget or some other concept with a higher expenditure plank. The average wage in the republic in December constituted R128,000 (R130,000 in the Russian Federation). A pretty good level, although December is not all that regular a month when it comes to monetary payments in connection with the annual and quarterly bonuses (the average monthly wage in 1993 in the Republic of Tatarstan was R52,600, in the Russian Federation, R58,600). As we can see, the gap has been narrowed. At the previous session we adopted a responsible decision--laws on the subsistence minimum and the minimum wage, on the basis of which minimum remuneration could not be below the subsistence minimum. In February the subsistence minimum is forecast at the level of R30,000, and this means that minimum remuneration also must be the same. I believe that this session will adopt such a decision. An increase in pay in 1993 was observed in all spheres of the economy, but the rate thereof differed considerably in both the sectoral and territorial respects. The situation involving the income of those working at many industrial enterprises, particularly at enterprises of the military-industrial complex, is causing serious concern. In comparable values, the living standard in terms of these enterprises is considerably below the republic average. And the average wage at some of them (not the most unfortunate, what is more) is approximately 60 percent of the average wage in the republic. Consequently, employees of industrial enterprises enjoy more compensation from the Social Support Fund. Enterprise managers are of the view that an increase in the minimum wage would entail a multiple increase in the price of their products. An analysis has shown that this would bring about an increase in price of no more than 11 percent, but would permit an increase in the employees' income. We are at the present time seriously reconsidering the policy of subsidies to a number of sectors. A phased transfer of the subsidies of housing and municipal services and transport to personal income has begun. An interesting picture is taking shape in these sectors, incidentally. That same indicator of the living standard of employees of these sectors is far higher than the republic average, not to mention that of industry. But to return to the problem of subsidies, as of the situation in February, with a value of the subsistence minimum for the populace of approximately R30,000, each urban resident is subsidized a further R39,000. Of these, 18 percent are composed of subsidies for food, 58 percent, for housing and municipal services, 23 percent, for transport, and the rest, for medicinal support. That is, transport is subsidized more than food, and the subsidies for housing and municipal services are almost equal to the entire value of the subsistence minimum. This is food for thought. It is necessary, evidently, to analyze the entire system of norms contained in the package of services of this sector. An example: There is an established norm of the consumption of cold water per person of 200 liters a day. That is, if there is central water supply, it is considered that a person consumes this quantity daily! But this is impossible. The norms obviously contain the entire actual consumption of the sector. But the interests of the residents need to be protected also, we cannot shift onto them payment for all expenditure, unsubstantiated expenditure included. An analysis shows that foodstuffs, and they are consumed by all inhabitants, are subsidized least of all currently. In addition, as I have already said, housing and municipal services are subsidized, yet they are enjoyed to a greater extent by those who live in apartments with conveniences. And the "slum-dwellers" are socially oppressed here also. We are continuing to direct huge subsidy resources haphazardly. It is essential that the government look into this and adopt the appropriate decisions as quickly as possible. There are many questions concerning preschools. The measures adopted at the federal level for the protection of the family and children are being transformed here in the republic with regard to the current program of targeted social protection. What is the situation here? In connection with the increase in the price of energy resources there has been a considerable increase in the cost of keeping children in preschool institutions (keeping one child in February will cost more than R50,000). The support of preschools is a heavy burden on the enterprises, which many of them cannot sustain. The government has adopted a number of measures to preserve the network of preschools, for example, approximately 500 preschool institutions catering for approximately 70,000 children will in the current year be taken onto the books of the local soviets. But some will, as before, remain on the books of the enterprises, and, lest we destroy the preschool system, we need to adopt a decision on the support of enterprises when it comes to maintaining preschool institutions by way of compensation from the budget for the cost of children's meals. The protection of our citizens against the inferior quality of goods and services is a cause for concern. There is now a need for the creation of a state committee to coordinate policy in the sphere of quality and the protection of consumers' rights. This committee would be entrusted with the coordination of activity in the solution of questions connected with the quality of goods and services, an analysis of the state and prospects of the development of the production of products which are environmentally clean and noninjurious to one's health, pricing, and the protection of consumers' rights. This must not be a toothless body. We need to accord the committee wide-ranging powers, including the right of inspections and the application of strict economic and administrative sanctions, the right to remove from production and withdraw from circulation substandard goods and services and to terminate operations, and the possibility of preparing and forwarding to the public prosecutor's office and the courts documents with the object of the institution of proceedings against the producers of substandard goods and services, including formulation of the question of their closure and liquidation. In connection with a tightening of the demands on the quality of goods and services problems of the development of medium-sized and small business require special attention, and the adoption of the corresponding prescriptive enactments in support of them needs to be speeded up here. Health care is in a transitional phase at this time in connection with the Medical Insurance Act taking effect. The concern of a number of deputies proposing alternatives of the activity of the medical insurances funds in the immediate period is understandable. I believe it necessary to study the experience of health care of Moscow and Moscow Oblast, which have retained questions of protection of the health of mother and child as publicly funded for 1994-1995. We should, possibly, do the same. State of the Fight Against Crime Considering that in January at an enlarged meeting of the collegium of the MVD and the Public Prosecutor's Office these problems were examined in detail, I would like to emphasize once again that the fight against crime has been and remains a principal direction in the activity of the president and all organs of state power called on to deal with this. While evaluating positively the efforts of all law enforcement authorities of the Republic of Tatarstan for realization of the Law "On Special Measures To Fight Crime" which we have adopted, we have agreed at the meetings that have been held to step up this fight even more and make it more effective. The main thing is that the law enforcement authorities are now confident that it is possible to curb this evil. I refer to the results of 1993. The crime detection rate increased from 52 to 64 percent. The growth of crime declined. It is very important that 11,000 more criminal cases were sent to the courts here than in 1992. The struggle to unmask top crime groupings is being intensified. The replacement and, I would say, improvement of the personnel composition in the law enforcement authorities themselves continue. The public demands protection of us, and we are required to provide it. Political Situation in the Republic Esteemed People's Deputies! The political development of the Republic of Tatarstan in the past year was marked by a number of important trends. They included continuation of the building of the new statehood of Tatarstan on the basis of the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Tatarstan; the formation of its own legal system and the creation of a multiparty system and a wide field for the interaction of various parties and movements; the effect of the mechanism of negotiations and consultations with the Russian Federation; the stimulation of international cooperation; and so forth. In our opinion, these will remain the priority directions in 1994 also. The most important task for us undoubtedly was and remains political and economic stability in Tatarstan, the infusion of its sovereignty with actual content with an orientation toward observance of human rights and liberties, economic reforms, and the formation of political and managerial structures in keeping with the requirements of the times. Much work has to be done. But the accomplishment of this task is not only essential but realistic also. The right to speak this way is accorded by the main, evolved factor of the republic's civilized development, development which is, I would say, conscious and has a sense of its own dignity. We are talking about civil peace and social accord, respect for the working man, and the harmony of the general and the national. For it is no accident that the words "Tatarstan is our common home" and "Tatarstan is my home" are today being spoken with pride by the representatives of all nationalities that live in the republic. And we see this as a guarantee that this home will in the future be more stable and richer both materially and spiritually. Yes, this home has, we know, its difficulties, its complexities, which home does not at this time? But the main thing is that we not only know our own problems but are resolving them also. This, most likely, explains the growing authority of Tatarstan in Russia, among the CIS countries, and in the far abroad. Esteemed Comrades! Present-day political life, with all its complexities and problems, requires that each of us be a pragmatist and realist and see things as they really are, not as we would like them to be. There are objective processes and phenomena, and they cannot be ignored. We are guided by such an approach when tackling problems of the building and reform of the relations of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation. It is no secret that these problems are central problems in the political life of Tatarstan and that, owing to their special significance, they will remain such in the future also. The Supreme Soviet and the entire community of the republic have constant information on the progress of the negotiations of official delegations of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation on the concept of a future treaty on the delineation of terms of reference and the mutual delegation of authority by organs of state power of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation built on the harmonization of the two constitutions and unconditional respect for the rights of the individual, regardless of his nationality, sex, or religious belief. The break in the treaty process, which had been protracted under the influence of a number of social events in Russia, is now over. At our January meeting with B.N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, aside from the consideration of a number of questions of the economy and the problem of oil production and the ecological situation in the oil regions of the republic, agreement was reached on the completion of the preparation of the treaty and intergovernmental agreements on foreign economic activity, the fight against crime, the budget and taxes, military organizational development, and the banks. The official delegations of the parties and their leaders (V.N. Likhachev and M.G. Saburov and S.M. Shakhray and Yu.F. Yarov) obtained specific recommendations. It may be said as a preliminary evaluation that an entirely new document, practically unprecedented, which proclaims the primacy of human rights and the principles of Tatarstan's relations with the Russian Federation, foreign states, and international organizations, is being engendered. Particular attention will be paid to the sphere of the joint competence of the parties' organs of state power. The formation of plenipotentiary missions of Russia and Tatarstan in Kazan and Moscow respectively is contemplated. The majority of articles have been harmonized and many questions that had previously given rise to arguments and different positions have been dropped now. I have to mention something else also. The atmosphere that reigns at the negotiations is cordial, and one senses a desire of the parties to understand one another and find a compromise. The entire work undoubtedly requires patience and intellectual effort. I believe there will soon be a treaty, on which we have worked for so long. It will be evidence of the reform of Russia and a renewal of the Federation on a democratic basis and will be a guarantor of the statehood of our republic. I am sure that this treaty will be accepted not only in the Russian Federation and in Tatarstan but by the international community also. Knowing all this, one is for the umpteenth time perplexed at how certain forces in the republic perceive the work that is being done. Some terms of individual publications of the so-called "democratic" press are something else: "haggling," "conspiracy against the people," "undermining of human rights," and some even more scathing. What is this--naivete or political calculation aimed at sowing confusion and introducing doubt in people's minds? Both, most likely. But how long is it possible to go on living according to the principle: "the worse, the better"? Speaking on behalf of the people, and many social and political movements are guilty of this currently, incidentally, we are entitled only to creation in the interests of our people. Nor can other types of statements coming from so-called national-radical groups be overlooked. Their meaning is clear, and you could not call them constructive. Truly, how is it possible to call for official relations or contacts with Russia and the political structures that operate there to be ignored, knowing that citizens of Tatarstan have citizenship of the Russian Federation and that a common economic space with the Russian Federation is preserved? There is a mass (I repeat, mass) of questions, which may be solved only with the closest connection and cooperation of Russia and Tatarstan for the good of their peoples. One has the impression that certain politicians, political intriguers more like, have been left here without subjects of political struggle and are attempting, once again not to people's benefit, to create them artificially. Such are certain political reference points of the Republic of Tatarstan. They have proven their relevance and will remain such in the future also. Grounded in reality, they demand strenuous work of all of us. Proceeding from the progress of the negotiations and the need for the realization subsequently of mutual relations with the Russian Federation established on the basis of a treaty, I consider essential the participation of plenipotentiary representatives of Tatarstan both in the State Duma and in the Federation Council of Russia. While paying tribute to the efforts of the organs of state power of the Republic of Tatarstan in the establishment of civilized democratic relations with the Russian Federation in the interests of our peoples, I am sure that the population of the republic will demonstrate support for this policy by actively participating in the repeat elections on 13 March. Speaking once again about the reform of the representative and executive authorities, I may emphasize yet again the need for reform via elections on a multiparty basis. As the progress of the reform of the representative bodies in a number of republics shows, the principles of the form of government which I have proposed and the procedure of elections set forth at the first sitting of the 18th session remain the most acceptable. This is, I believe, our ultimate destination. Esteemed People's Deputies! There was a considerable expansion and intensification of the Republic of Tatarstan's relations in the sphere of the economy, culture, education, agriculture, health care, and so forth in 1993 with countries of the far and near abroad. Just recently we could not have dreamed even that Tatarstan could have established direct contacts with foreign states or have concluded agreements and treaties oriented not toward ideological precepts and political or some other predilections but toward goals of vital importance to the republic and its citizens. The Republic of Tatarstan is becoming an object of close attention on the part of authoritative international organizations such as the European Parliament, UNESCO, OPEC, and so forth. And of considerable importance in this connection, in our view, is the fact that these organizations not only understand our republic's role and position in the current period but also approve many of the steps we have taken geared to the stabilization of the situation both in the Republic of Tatarstan and in the Russian Federation as a whole.
