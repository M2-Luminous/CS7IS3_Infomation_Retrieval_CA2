Molotilov, V.T. Ababkov, A.A. Brodov, Central Scientific Research Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy and Ferrous Metallurgy Economics Institute] [Text] In the foreseeable future, steels and alloys will remain the principal structural materials; this is dictated by the broad range of their physical and mechanical properties, relatively low cost, and a well-developed raw material and technological production base. The conditions of a market economy determine the characteristic features in approaching the development and production of new metallic materials,[.sup]1[/] improving traditional materials, and using new and improved materials in products. Moreover, the new materials play the role of a commodity which has the consumer properties satisfying the buyer and bring profit to the producer. A number of aspects of the movement of new materials to the metal products market is considered in the article. Stimuli and incentives for developing new materials. The new metallic materials can successfully reach the market under the following conditions: 1. there are no similar products in the existing market, and the use of new materials opens up new opportunities for developing products, i.e., a free ``niche'' exists. 2. existing similar metal products are inferior to the new products in quality, and production of new items is more profitable. Materials with a completely new set of properties open up the possibility of developing a new products market. Materials, as a rule, are developed simultaneously with designing a product, i.e., custom-developed. Examples of this approach are the simultaneous development of a new category of amorphous alloys and the most recent modifications of pulse transformers and the separation of the spheres of influence between metallic soft magnetic alloys and semiconductor ferrites. The opposite used to be true, i.e., the new material was ``looking for'' its applications or, in other words, the product was being developed for existing metal. This happened, e.g., when superconducting alloys and cryogenic power engineering and cryoelectronic products [2] were being developed simultaneously on the basis of the discovery of the high-temperature superconductivity phenomenon [1]. Production of the principally new materials often cannot be realized by traditional production methods using conventional equipment and calls for new designs. Oriented crystallization of eutectic alloys, impregnation of frame matrices with alloys, explosive impact methods, metal film sputtering, etc., can serve as examples. As we have already mentioned, these types of materials figure primarily in the new sector of the metal products market. Another sector of the metal products market is characterized by displacement of ``classical'' traditional metal products by new materials. In this case, a higher level of properties blazes the trail to the market for the new material thus ensuring a higher quality of products or their greater adaptability to streamlined manufacture, a decrease in production costs, an improvement in the product reliability, etc. IF-steels (especially deep drawing and without free interstitial atoms) and clad steels for the automotive industry are examples of such materials. Materials whose properties are at the level of classical analogs yet cheaper due to efficient alloying, e.g., nickel-free stainless steel and tungsten-free tool steels can also be classified as belonging to this group. These classes of materials are developed, as a rule, on the basis of improving their production practices (ensuring a specified chemical composition, steel purity, more stringent allowances, using heat treatment, improving the surface finish, etc.). Since materials, as a rule, are semi-finished products for making items while the products as a commodity have a certain life cycle in their market [3], the life cycle of the material also depends on it. For example, metallic and film memory elements developed for early-generation computers ceased their existence together with these types of computers. High-purity metals and alloys developed for designing vacuum tubes in early-generation radio and TV devices were also not used in subsequent generations of electronic equipment. As a result of the further development of these skill-intensive industries, metals were no longer used in new-generation products--the metal was displaced by semiconductors, ferrites, and other materials. The life cycle of a multifunction material, as a rule, is longer than that of the materials custom-designed for a specific product. Economics of materials with new qualities. The development and production management of new or improved materials are fraught, as a rule, with additional production outlays. In principle, the production process can be arranged in such a way so as to ensure a predetermined degree of approximation of the physical limits of this class of material properties. Yet the economic expediency of such approximation under market conditions is far from always justified. An analysis demonstrates that each unit of "gain" in properties calls for progressively increasing production outlays (Fig. 1). The cost of material whose range of properties is close to the physical limit C[.sup]0[/] is substantially higher than the cost of mass-produced material with a traditional range of properties C[.sup]1[/]. For the consumer, it is more profitable to deal with a commercial level of properties (the C[.sup]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/] range) which is higher than the traditional level but lower than the physical. Under market conditions, the commercial level forms as a function of the specific demand for the material, the product market opportunities, and the product's specific metal consumption. The commercial level of properties may not coincide with the design level of properties C[.sup]4[/] with respect to the material parameters on whose basis the engineering design of the product is made. The degree of discrepancy between the design and commercial property levels (the difference between the C[.sup]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/] range and C[.sup]4[/]) characterizes the material utilization level in the product: given C[.sup]4[/]<C[.sub]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/], the material properties are underutilized; given C[.sup]4[/]> C[.sub]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/], the specific metal content in the product increases since the shortfall in the property level has to be compensated for by an excessive amount of material (e.g., for increasing the net section in order to ensure a specified strength or operating magnetic induction of the product). In the case where C[.sup]4[/]> C[.sub]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/], we may be dealing with an economic paradox: despite the discrepancy between the design and commercial property levels, an elevated metal expenditure may turn out to be economically justified if the smaller quantity of metal with higher properties costs more than a greater quantity of relatively cheaper metal. For this reason, in particular, anisotropic electrical sheet steel exposed to laser treatment (the properties are improved by 8% and the cost rises by 15%) has limited applications [4]. Consequently, the use of a new material whose applications in a product ensures a decrease in aggregate production and operation outlays compared to the one it substitutes can be considered economically efficient. Operating properties, reliability, and competitiveness of materials. After the engineering analysis of the product is completed, the consumer, in the final analysis, is no longer interested by the primary physical characteristics of the material (ultimate tensile strength, density, magnetic permeability, etc.) but rather the ability of the material as a whole reliably to perform certain functions, ensure the serviceability of the product, and guarantee the lowest manufacturing outlays (adaptability to production). Naturally, these comprehensive characteristics are largely determined by the primary ones yet the final assessment of the material (the material fits or does not fit) is made only in conjunction with the product and by the product's market suitability, i.e., the product's consumer appeal and economic characteristics. The operating properties of the material and supply reliability must be ensured by the manufacturer technology level. The metal consumer must be confident in the producer's goods. Thus, as a result of many years of tradition at American automotive companies, a certain procedure developed in the relationships with metal suppliers. Each car part is made from metal supplied by only one vendor who managed to attain consistently high quality of metal products. Such producers are awarded quality certificates by the automotive plants. Such a quality certificate enables the metal supplier to hope that car manufacturers "will let them supply one more part." The USS Corporation is one of the first U.S. metallurgical companies supplying automotive sheets and it has received Ford and Chrysler quality certificates. In certifying metal products, the Ford Motor Company proceeds from meeting the four principles of interrelation with metal suppliers: - the quality of metal supplied (50 points on a scale of 100); - timely and predictable shipments (20 points) - metal product price (20 points) - supplier participation in jointly developing and finishing the metal products together with the user (10 points). - It is important that the price competition is assigned priority number three (20 points) while the shipment quality and regularity move to the forefront (a total of 70 out of 100 points!). Foreign (especially Japanese) automobile producers [5] are being increasingly transplanted to the United States in recent years. Japanese automobile manufacturers have established that the automobile body sheet produced by metallurgical enterprises in the United States and used by American customers does not meet Japanese requirements [6]. An assessment of 14 quality parameters shows that American steel is inferior to Japanese with respect to the seven most important parameters (the coat quality, surface finish, suitability for drawing, geometric tolerances, etc.). Thus, the automobile body sheet market becomes closed, and it is very difficult for nontraditional metal producers to penetrate it. It is expected that competition will heat up even more in the automobile body sheet market due to the fact that construction of units for applying coats in a number of countries (Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, and South Korea) has acquired elements of obsession according to the analytical report by P. Marcus to the Eighth Congress of ``Ferrous Metallurgy Survival Strategy'' held in 1992. Furthermore, in a short run, ``...a major battle will develop among plastic and aluminum sheets and various types of clad steels in the automobile body sheet market'' [7]. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Classification of Metal Exposure Types During Operation | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Type of exposure |Structural and other processes leadin-| | |g to metal failure | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Mechanical |Residual deformation, fracture, fatig-| | |ue, wear, creep, and magnetic aging | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chemical |Corrosion and change in chemical surf-| | |ace composition | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Temperature |Aging, creep, mechanical stress redis-| | |tribution, phase and structural insta-| | |bility, stress relaxation, defect red-| | |istribution and relaxation, shape and | | |configuration loss, and embrittlement | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Magnetic |Magnetic texture development and loss,| | | changes in temperature conditions, a-| | |nd loss of superconductivity | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Radiation |Loss of shape and configuration (swel-| | |ling), redistribution and increase in | | |the number of defects, residual radio-| | |activity, magnetic and structural rel-| | |axation, and radiation-induced cold w-| | |orking | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Combined factors |Combined processes | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A general assessment of the service properties of materials can be complemented by the concept of material reliability which is especially important for the material operating under extreme conditions. Reliability is a comprehensive material characteristic and determines its ability to ensure the product serviceability within a specified time interval under the effect of external damaging factors [8]. A classification of the external factors and the character of the resulting metal damage are summarized in the table. The character of the material damage development under a constant effect of a certain external factor (or a group of factors) where the operating parameter changes exponentially with time (Fig. 2) is representative. The product fails when the working parameter goes beyond the operating range P[.sup]1[/]-P[.sub]2[/]. The reliable material operation span (Curve 2) may be increased by stabilizing treatment, e.g., aging or thermal cycling. Ensuring reliability is the most important condition of guaranteeing the ability of the material to perform its operating functions. A guarantee of reliability calls for additional material producer and supplier outlays related to more stringent production practices, the need for stabilizing treatments, accelerated reliability tests, and reliability forecasts. Another important aspect of the issue of ensuring product reliability which depends on the material is its maintainability [8], i.e., preserving the necessary product performance level by changing the failed material. This problem is related to the supplier's ability to provide materials whose parameters are at the level of the initial parameters of the failed material. For the material supplier, solution of this problem involves adjusting the technology for producing metal batches with identical properties, improving the chemical, structural, phase, and geometrical homogeneity of the metal which leads to additional production costs due to the need to maintain a high level of production culture, stringent requirements for the raw material quality and homogeneity, etc. In this case, the question of what is more economically expedient--to tighten up the production process in order to prevent rejects or allow a certain amount of rejection but ensure that off-grade metal is taken out [9]--cannot be a priori answered unambiguously. The coincidence of the properties of the original (failed) material and its substitution has a probablistic character and is described by a material property distribution curve with a transition from batch to batch as well as within each batch. The narrowing of the distribution curve by technological methods or rejecting the metal which does not fall within the operating parameter range P[.sup]1[/]-P[.sub]2[/](P<P[.sub]1[/] and P> P[.sup]2[/]) also leads to additional producer costs. In the case where the practices are tightened up in order to optimize the material produced with respect to several parameters, we are witnessing the narrowing the volumetric distribution curve. For example, for the two parameters P and S (Fig. 3), optimization means that both parameters fall within area 1-2-3-4. Naturally, this problem is much more complex than optimization by a single parameter. At times, different parameters have opposite behavior trends in which case the optimization task becomes even more complicated. The problem of metal homogeneity is directly related to the issue of the product's specific metal consumption. The reliability of the entire structure depends not only on the specific characteristics of the material, but also on the cross section margin necessary for decreasing the metal damage probability due to local deviation of the characteristics from the mean specific value. The probability of local deviations is determined by the material homogeneity, i.e., the distribution curve and, in the final analysis, the degree of technological rigidity. As we have already mentioned, a guarantee of reliability is especially important for materials under extreme conditions. Thus, e.g., according to data in [10], the requirements imposed on the materials used in making sea-based aircraft are more stringent in a number of cases than those for space equipment (a high strength combined with a low specific gravity, resistance to cyclical loads in a corrosive medium at temperatures of up to 1,150�, etc.). Composite metallurgy methods (production of composites on the basis of intermetallic compounds), powder metallurgy methods (engineering ceramics and materials for specialty bearings operating in corrosive media under high loads and high temperatures), single crystal and quasisingle crystal metallurgy, and specialized coat application methods (heat protecting, corrosion resistant, etc.) are used for developing such materials for specific products. According to forecasts by the Japanese Ministry of Trade and Industry [11], the need for specialty materials for operation under extreme conditions will increase rapidly and by 2000 exceed the 1989 consumption level by several times. This is primarily true for the following classes of materials: intermetallic compounds with a high strength and heat resistance, alloys with a high resistance to biological and physiological media, and high-temperature superconductors. The demand for materials which determine energy conservation and microelectronics development [11, 12], i.e., amorphous alloys, microheterogeneous (including nanocrystalline) alloys, multilayer composites (including metal-ceramics), materials with an amorphized surface, and hydrogen accumulating materials for hydrogen engines, etc., will increase sharply. New modifications of traditional materials must also be developed, e.g.: stainless steel micrometer-thick fibers for woven materials and screens, reinforced concrete in seismically resistant structures and nuclear reactors, and reinforced refractory products [12]. The issues of developing the aforementioned classes of materials are resolved especially effectively in places where material producer and item producer integration has been achieved. An analysis shows that one can win customers in a saturated market only by offering a commodity which has advantages compared to competing products and which meets user demands at a higher level. Under these conditions, the metal product competitiveness becomes especially important [13]. The competitiveness of metal products as a commodity is a comparative comprehensive estimate of the totality of qualitative and economic properties (parameters) relative to the market requirements or the properties of a similar (or substituted) commodity. A quantitative estimate of the competitiveness level K is made on the basis of developed procedures [14] and, in the final analysis, is expressed through the free parametric quality index I[.sup]p[/] and the free parametric economic index I[.sup]c[/] (the difference between the quality parameters of this commodity and a similar commodity per unit of production outlays): K = I[.sup]p[/]/I[.sub]c[/]. Given K> 1, the commodity is more competitive than the analog while given K<1, it is less so. The metal product competitiveness level is especially sensitive to the range of consumer appeal (I[.sup]p[/]) at low outlays--small fluctuations in the value of the I[.sup]p[/] index require a high degree of customer satisfaction with quality in order to maintain a high level of competitiveness (Fig. 4). Thus, the nonprice competition factors come to the forefront at low outlays. This is taken into account by experienced material producers [15]. In practice, the situation with assessing the competitiveness is much more complicated since the I[.sup]p[/] and I[.sup]c[/] indices are independent. Thus, according to data in [16], an increase in the degree to which the metal product consumer requirements are met (the I[.sup]p[/] index) from 90 to 95% is fraught with almost doubling the metal producer outlays (the I[.sup]c[/] index). On the other hand, production of higher-quality items gradually leads to a decrease in production outlays due to an increase in the production quality and a decrease in rejections and outlays for additional product finishing [15]. In penetrating the free market, the new producers must take into account all possible factors. We can cite examples where given similar expenditure and consumer appeal levels, the materials capture markets due to traditional customer loyalties. Thus, the well-known can war led to a division of the metallic beverage container market: the Coca Cola Company prefers aluminum cans while Pepsi Cola--steel cans [17]. Material property standardization principles. As we have already mentioned, while possessing a broad range of diverse properties, the same types of metal products, as a rule, are used in items for very different purposes, i.e., are multifunctional. This determines the specific features of unifying the properties in standards and other regulatory technical documents. In standardizing production, the indicators used in all application versions must be mandatory (base); the remaining requirements are optional and become mandatory only upon additional agreement (contract) between the producers and consumers. Sometimes, it is sufficient to have reliable reference data on a range of properties cited in an appendix to the standard or a supplier company catalogue. This approach takes into account the mutual interest of the producers and consumers and ensures their constructive technical dialogue and, in the final analysis, metal product utilization effectiveness. This standardization principle is widely used in foreign standards and is reflected in all newly developed domestic regulatory technical documents. The set of properties for new materials for specific purposes (developed for the specific product) must be standardized and mandatory with respect to the service characteristics of the product indicating the procedures for measuring these properties. The chemical element composition standards for steel and alloy properties for specific applications must be strictly regulated. For multifunction metal products, rigid standardization of the chemical composition is unacceptable since in order to ensure a specific range of requested properties, one must be able to manipulate the chemical composition to a certain extent. Depending on whether the product is crucial, the requirements for the level to which the properties regulated by the standards are ensured differ. Thus, experience shows that for metal products used in construction, this norm is at least 0.95 but for more crucial applications--0.97 or more. In addition to the requirement to ship products in accordance with international or national standards of technically advanced countries, the manufacturer penetrating an external market must ensure that all contract requirements are met and guarantee the quality stability of the shipped products which, as a rule, is confirmed by the export production certification by acknowledged international or national societies (the British Lloyd Register, the German TGF, the American Oil and Gas Institute, etc.) One should keep in mind that certification of the product shipped is an initial phase of certification as a supplier warranty, while certification of the system ensuring the quality in effect at the manufacturing enterprise should serve as the concluding phase. The requirements for ensuring the quality system are described in ISO 9000 standards [18]. Summary The specific features of the development, production, and application of new metallic materials under market economy conditions are considered. Under the conditions where new materials become a market commodity, such market material characteristics as competitiveness, new property standardization principles, commercial quality level, life cycle, and the ratio of the material and product economics are significant. These categories determine the ability of the new materials to become a commodity profitable for both the producers and the consumers. Bibliography 1. V.Yu. Galkin. Stal No. 10, 1992, pp. 70-73. 2.
