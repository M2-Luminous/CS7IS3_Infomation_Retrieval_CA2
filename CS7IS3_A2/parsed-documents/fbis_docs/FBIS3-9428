In a letter to Italian Prime Minister Carlo Ciampi and Secretary of the National-Social Movement Gianfranco Fini, Kalapac said that he was addressing them on behalf of the 42,000 Serbs banished from Zadar who have met the same fate as Italians did after the Second World War, said the news agency ISKRA of the republic of Serb Krajina. Zadar and a considerable part of the Dalmatian coast were part of Italy until September 1943. Zadar is in close proximity to the republic of Serb Krajina which was formed by Serbs in their ethnic and historical lands in Croatia in 1991 in answer to its forcible secession from the former Yugoslavia and the downgrading of their national rights by the Zagreb authorities. Since the beginning of Croatia's war for secession, 14,000 Serbs have been killed and more than 300,000 banished from this former Yugoslav republic. Around 10,000 houses belonging to Serbs have been blown up all over Croatia in the past three years. Special rapporteur of the United Nations Human Rights Commission Tadeusz Mazowiecki in late February this year accused Croatia of human rights violations and terror over Serbs, especially in the coastal region of Dalmatia. The Helsinki human rights federation on Wednesday accused Croatia of forcibly evicting over 5,000 people from their flats and physical abuse of citizens, predominantly of Serb nationality.
