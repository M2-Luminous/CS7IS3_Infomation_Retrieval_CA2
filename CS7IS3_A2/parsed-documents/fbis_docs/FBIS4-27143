In talks with the opposition Democratic Party (DP) leader Yi Ki- taek, Kim said of 8,000 existing fuel rods, North Korea changed 4,000 and their whereabouts were unknown and that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections had hit a deadlock. "Therefore prospects for the North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, slated for June, are unclear and after IAEA report, the nuclear issue is expected to be referred to the UNSC," Yi quoted Kim as saying. Kim also told Yi that when referred to UNSC, both military and economic sanctions could be imposed together and that China, under these circumstances, could no longer oppose. Yi said the president will endeavour to kill the North Korea- Russia military treaty, which obliges Russia to side with North Korea in case of a war on the Korean peninsula. Kim also said the government had several scenarios preparing for the unpredictable North Korean situation, Yi said.
