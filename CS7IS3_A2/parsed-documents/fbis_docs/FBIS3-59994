Mr. Penza said the problem was real and was becoming so acute that some Western countries were referring to Zambia as the Colombia of Africa. President Chiluba says the allegations are unfounded. Several members of Parliament in the governing party, the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, have resigned in recent months, alleging corruption and drug dealing by government ministers. A correspondent for the BBC in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, says the president could face a fresh wave of resignations if he does not move quickly.
