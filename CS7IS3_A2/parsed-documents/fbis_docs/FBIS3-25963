Of that, a record 1.78 billion yuan ($204 million) worth of goods smuggled into the mainland were confiscated by customs inspectors, China's major anti-smuggling force, said Qian Guanlin, top official of the General Administration of Customs (GAC). The value of the two kinds of contraband were up 78 and 83 per cent over 1992 respectively, Qian said, indicating that smuggling still remained as a serious threat to the country's reform. But, Qian gave no details about where the contraband such as electrical appliances and cars came from and how many smugglers were involved in cases uncovered by the GAC and its local branches. Yet, a government official who declined to be named said the problem stemmed from businesses smuggling goods. "The government was suffering from a stubborn headache last year as more and more enterprises were found to have been involved in large-scale smuggling despite harsh crackdowns," the official said. Qian pledged that Chinese customs authorities will intensify the crackdown, beefing up its forces to investigate the biggest cases. The GAC is gradually establishing a centralized anti-smuggling headquarters in charge of special investigations on such stubborn cases, Qian said. And, this year, a customs' national internal intelligence network will be linked with other law-enforcement and intelligence departments. Meanwhile, China will further reform customs supervision this year by overhauling its external auditing system to follow international practices. That means, instead of simply examining imported and exported goods at customs' checking ports, supervisors will also pay more attention to the management and accounts of enterprises engaged in foreign trade. It will make imports and exports passing the customs' supervision more simple, fast and effective, and suit the needs of China's ongoing economic reform. Approved by the State Council, China's cabinet, the GAC will establish and carry out its own auditing system this year. Accordingly, the customs' current declaration practice will also be improved by setting up service-oriented customs brokers. It is expected that these brokers would be built into a kind of business entities holding responsibility for both customs authorities and enterprises engaged in foreign trade.
