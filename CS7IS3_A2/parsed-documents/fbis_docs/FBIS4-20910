Tarasyuk said that Russia sent the first convoy of fuel to be used to run power plants to the southern city of Zaparozhnye Monday after Ukraine threatened to suspend dismantling of its nuclear warheads. Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetsky told a news conference during a visit to Germany earlier this week that Ukraine would stop dismantling the weapons because of Russia's failure to provide the fuel. Tarasyuk, who returned from talks in Moscow, said he had received assurances from Russian officials that they would fulfill their obligations under the agreement signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. "Ukraine will not raise any obstacles in the implementation of this trilateral agreement if all parties involved fulfill their commitments," Tarasyuk said. Ukraine was the last of the four nuclear states of the former Soviet Union to agree to dismantle its nuclear weapons under the agreement that provided Ukraine with at least one billion dollars in financial compensation and nuclear fuel shipments to run the country's power stations.
