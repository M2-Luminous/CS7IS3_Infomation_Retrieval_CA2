Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation, said data provided by Russia shows the number of former Russian Military in Estonia at 10,570. A total 850 of them have been discharged and are part of Russia's military reserve. The rest are retired personnel. The Russian Military born before 1930, numbering 4,345 in Estonia, are eligible to apply for a permanent residence permit. The rest of the former military are younger than 63. "I contest the claims that a reserve officer of 50-60 years of age doesn't constitute any threat to Estonia," Tiiman said. He said Russia with the topic of retired military was attempting to create an artificial obstacle on the way of negotiations. The Russian side at the last round of negotiations, which ended Wednesday [2 February], refused to turn over to Estonia a timetabe for the withdrawal of troops, accusing Estonia of unwillingness to sign a social guarantees agreement for the former Russian Military living in the country. Tiiman said Russia was unable to understand Estonia's worries about the topic of the retired military. "When I told Russian generals that also Estonia was having its national interests, they opened their eyes wide and asked what sort of a thing was that," Tiiman added. He said Russia's conditions concerning the social welfare guarantees to retired military included a demand to make changes in the Estonian legislation. At the same time Russia doesn't agree to a scheme of determining the size of pensions for the military by indexation. Tiiman said the Russian Army pensioners in Estonia were getting big pensions, as Russia still continues payment of the money under the 1992 exchange rate of 10 roubles to the Estonian kroon. The current rate is more than 110 roubles to the kroon. If Russia starts payment under the current exchange rate, the size of pensions would drop below the subsistence minimum in Estonia and the Baltic country would have to pay an additional allowance to the former Russian Military.
