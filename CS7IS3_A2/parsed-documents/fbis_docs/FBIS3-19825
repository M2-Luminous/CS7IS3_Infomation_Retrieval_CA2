But this enlargement of the Europe of 12 to the Europe of 16 requires a reform of the institutions of the Union. In addition, the future of the blocking minority in decisionmaking will have to be determined. [passage omitted] Jean-Michel Mostart has met Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, who doubts the entry of the four nations in the Union on 1 January 1995 will take place as scheduled. Willy Claes thinks Europe is losing its credibility: [Begin Claes recording] We are losing some of our credibility, externally and internally. Last Friday I was in Washington. There I met colleagues who belong to governments that are candidates for membership. They said to me that they failed to understand any of our talks, and, above all, the opponents of the European Community in their countries will take advantage and launch a likely successful campaign. This is the external aspect. As for the internal aspect, I would like to see some parliaments looking again into their position vis-a-vis this European construction. Once again, I have the feeling that this is not just a detail, but a discussion on principles that are the basis of the fundamental orientation of Europe of the future. [end recording]
