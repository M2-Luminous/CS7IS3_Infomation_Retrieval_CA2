They reaffirmed the growing importance of the Japan-U.S. alliance in the meeting that temporarily set aside their continuing disputes on trade. In the first bilateral "two-plus-two" meeting of foreign and defense ministers, held at Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's official residence, they affirmed that the alliance "has grown stronger and has increased in importance in the post-Cold War period," a joint statement by the bilateral security consultative committee said. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Defense Agency chief Kazuo Aichi represented Japan and the U.S. side was headed by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, along with Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner on behalf of new Defense Secretary William Perry. Hata said there was "frank" discussion of security issues in the post-Cold War era in a good atmosphere and the two sides agreed to hold such meetings regularly in the future. Japanese and U.S. participants shared the view that the meeting was "meaningful," according to Foreign Ministry officials. Tokyo and Washington originally agreed on the ministerial "two-plus-two" security meeting in December 1990, but had been unable to hold it before now due to the difficulty of getting all four ministers together. Christopher told the meeting that relations with Japan are especially important in Washington's Asia policy, saying bilateral security ties are important for the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region. The two countries should not forget the importance of the bilateral security arrangements, officials quoted him as saying. The U.S. reiterated its commitment to maintaining a strong military presence in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region and thanked Japan for its host nation support and providing facilities. The two sides agreed to start consultations on continuation of an agreement on host-nation support, due to expire in two years. Wisner said the U.S. is studying issues involving strategic nuclear weapons and may make an interim report as early as this summer. Washington will also make clear its position on the U.S. presence in Asia within a few months, he said. Regarding U.S. forces stationed in Japan, both sides pledged to continue efforts to consolidate and realign facilities and areas, particularly in Okinawa, consistent with the purposes of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and U.S. operation requirements. They also agreed on the importance of boosting exchanges of defense technology. The security talks coincided with the arrival of the 91,487-ton U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier Carl Vinson at the U.S. Naval Base at Yokosuka in Kanagawa Prefecture, just south of Tokyo. On international affairs, they reaffirmed that a diplomatic solution is the best way of resolving the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program, the officials said. Christopher said that if there is progress in diplomatic efforts such as dialogues between Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and with South Korea, there could be a resumption of talks between the U.S. and North Korea on March 21. He called for close consultations among the U.S., Japan, South Korea and China, in case such diplomatic efforts fail and the problem is brought to the United Nations Security Council, they said. Hata replied that in such a case Japan would take responsible actions while keeping close contacts with Washington and Seoul. Aichi echoed Hosokawa's remarks in the Diet that Japan will take responsible actions within the constitution. The two sides also endorsed efforts to enhance regional political and security dialogues and welcomed the convening of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regional forum.
