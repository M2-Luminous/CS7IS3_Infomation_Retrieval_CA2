FBIS4-29491 "dreas118_m_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-118 Daily Report 19 Jun 1994 Thailand Military's Role in Politics Discussed Military's Role in Politics Discussed Anuson Kritsanaserani Comments BK1906144594 Bangkok THE SUNDAY NATION in English 19 Jun 94 p B7 BK1906144594 Bangkok THE SUNDAY NATION English BFN [Interview with Armed Forces Spokesman Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani by Watsana Nanuam, date and place not given; under the "Who Will Trust the Thai Military" rubric] [Text] Military leaders reiterate that there will be no more coups, so why does the public still believe a coup could occur? In the past, it seemed to the public that the military overthrew democratic governments. These days, the military worries whenever people suggest it will stage a coup. None of us thinks about coup; we don't want to talk about coups. Every time there's a rumour, we try to find out where it originated. If you see any military unit mobilizing, please inform us. There will always be rumours about coups, because of fear and the stock market. Investors in the stock market are always watching politics and the military. They check out information from several sources, in particular the press. If you have any such negative information, you should inform the military. I can assure you that there will be no coup. The military is not prepared (to stage a coup). According to my information, I can assure you that there will be no coup. But you can't say a Boeing will never again crash. I can assure you that at present there will be no coup. Army chief Wimon Wongwanit on June 7 warned Army officers not to listen to certain instigators. Did he want to warn certain people not to act wrongfully? The Army commander in chief wants the country to be peaceful. He wants his subordinates to be disciplined. He wants to warn his subordinates not to cause unrest. But I don't know whether he has any information about a possible threat. You can't call soldiers opportunists. At present, we are professional soldiers. We know what the people don't want the military to do; we know that from opinion polls. We will perform in line with what the people want. We consider ourselves the people's army. If we act against the people's will, we'll be viewed as dictators. We have to adjust our attitude to match the public's. We will not get involved in politics. If we take sides, the people will think military rule has returned; we have to be neutral. But the press always asks us about politics. Officers from the supreme commander to commanders of the Armed Forces don't want to talk about it. But when asked, they have to say something. The supreme commander and commanders of the Armed Forces support the government. We have to back the government because it's legitimate. The government is elected by the people. If we say we don't support the government, the people will be angry at the military. We don't want the people to hate the military, so we have to support the government. We don't want to criticize anything, including the government. If there was violence in the streets, would the military stay idle? The military has to listen to the government. The prime minister, as director of internal security, has the power to call out the military and police. The prime minister, who is elected by the people, knows what is right or wrong. We have to obey his policies. The military will not get involved if there is no order from the prime minister? That's right. We don't want to be offside. If we do anything without orders, the people will be watching us. What did you do when reports arose recently that certain military officers had met to form a plot? The supreme commander called everyone together and asked whether anyone knew anything. I told him some officers had gone to Hong Kong. You should know that when there are holidays, our officers like to go to Hong Kong: we play golf and our wives and children go shopping. This is a personal matter. What are "professional soldiers"? We are soldiers; we want to be soldiers; we receive a salary from the military. We have to be disciplined and do what we are ordered to do by our superiors. We don't want to repeatedly say `we are professional soldiers and we will not become involved in politics'. We have to act, not just talk. Did the military survey public opinion about coups? No, not directly. It would be like someone asking you how many wives you have. People don't want to answer that kind of question. We have regularly used public opinion polls to find out what people want us to do.
