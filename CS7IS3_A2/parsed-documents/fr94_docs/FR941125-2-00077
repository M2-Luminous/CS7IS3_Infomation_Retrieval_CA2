SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Great Lakes Asphalt Facility, was originally an asphalt production facility. In 1979 and 1982, the use of several tanks on the Facility were leased to the operators of the Enviro-Chem Site for the storage of ``synthetic fuel''. On May 10, 1989, the Emergency Response Branch of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management was notified of a release at the Facility. The release flowed north to contaminate the soil, a drainage system, a waterway and entered Eagle Creek. U.S. EPA was notified on the day of the release and conducted cleanup activities at the facility. Removal activities were completed by the U.S. EPA's Emergency and Enforcement Response Branch in the summer of 1990. The Respondents are the alleged generators of the hazardous substances that were transshipped from the Enviro-Chem Site to the Great Lakes Asphalt Facility. Each Respondent's share of the waste delivered to the facility is believed not to exceed 1.0 percent of the total waste delivered at the facility.
