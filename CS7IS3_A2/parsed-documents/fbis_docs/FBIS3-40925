"This is a newspaper canard which does not deserve any attention," Tuleutay Suleymenov said on Monday. The newspaper quoted Kazakh Ambassador in Tehran Myrzatay Dzholdasbekov as saying that Kazakhstan does not intend to eliminate or relocate its nuclear weapons to any other place until non-use of such weapons is guaranteed at the world level and the planet gets rid of them. It was stressed that this was the official position which was to be conveyed to the U.S. Administration during a visit of President Nursultan Nazarbayev to the United States which is to take place in two weeks. Kazakhstan "joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty last December and ratified it, as well as the Start I treaty," Suleymenov said adding that instruments of ratification will be exchanged with the United States during the visit of Nazarbayev in mid-February. "Moreover, Kazakhstan together with Belarus made a considerable contribution to the work which was completed in Moscow by Presidents of Russia, the United States and ukraine," Suleymenov said referring to the trilateral agreement according to which Ukraine gives up its nuclear weapons. "Our republic never strived to be a nuclear state. It has experienced its deadly danger. Five hundred nuclear tests have been conducted at the Semipalatinsk range which is closed now. Hundreds of thousands of Kazakhs are still suffering from their aftermath and we all view disposing of the weapons as a benefit," the minister said. He added that Kazakh official authorities are trying to probe all the circumstances which resulted in the publication in "JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI" which "rudely distorted the republican position on nuclear weapons." Most evidently, the newspaper is guilty of wishful thinking, but it is not ruled out that the words of the ambassador were distorted for some reason.
