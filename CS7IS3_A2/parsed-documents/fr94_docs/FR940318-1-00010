FR940318-1-00010 FR940318-1-00004 Since the changes described above expand the scope of the previously proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. Due consideration has been given to the following comments that were submitted in response to the previously issued supplemental NPRM: Hardware Nomenclature Several commenters suggest that the proposal be revised to include terms that would more specifically describe the valves that are affected by the rule. Certain commenters suggest that generic references to ``ball valves'' in proposed paragraph (a) should be replaced with references to ``Boeing Specification S417T105,'' which more clearly defines the configuration of the specific ball valve that must be inspected. These commenters also suggest that references in proposed paragraph (a) to the ``Shaw Aero Devices, Inc., drain valve that incorporates an integral inner door with a second positive seal,'' be replaced with references to the ``service panel valve per Boeing Specification 10&hyph;62213.'' On the other hand, one commenter requests that the terms used in the proposal to describe the Shaw Aero valve be retained, so that earlier models of the Shaw Aero valve (not configured per Boeing Specification 10&hyph;62213) would ``benefit'' from the proposed extended leak check intervals. Another commenter states that the earlier models of those Shaw Aero valves were upgraded because they leaked and, therefore, those valves should not be included with the valves specified by ``Boeing Specification 10&hyph;62213'' for purposes of receiving the extended leak check periods. The FAA has reviewed the data submitted with these comments and finds that certain of the requested changes are appropriate. The FAA concurs with the request to specifically identify those valves approved for the longer leak check intervals. The FAA has reviewed the referenced Boeing specifications, as well as the part numbers of valves that have been determined to meet these specifications and that have service history data approved by the FAA. The FAA has determined that the qualifying valves are as follows: 1. Valves meeting Boeing Specification S417T105: Kaiser Electroprecision valves having part number 2651&hyph;329&hyph;5 (or higher ``dash number''); 2. Valves meeting Boeing Specification 10&hyph;62213: Kaiser Electroprecision valves having part number 0218&hyph;0032&hyph;8 (or higher ``dash number''); and Shaw Aero Devices valves having part number 10101000C&hyph;N (or higher ``dash numbers''). Therefore, this supplemental NPRM has been revised to refer to certain of the affected valves as those having the part numbers indicated above. Valves having Kaiser Electroprecision part number 2651&hyph;329&hyph;5 (or higher ``dash number'') would be required to be leak checked at intervals of either 1,500 flight hours [per proposed paragraph (a)] or 5,000 flight hours [per proposed paragraph (b)]. Valves having Kaiser Electroprecision part number 0218&hyph;0032&hyph;8 (or higher ``dash number'') or Shaw Aero Devices part number 10101000C&hyph;N (or higher ``dash numbers'') would be required to be leak checked at intervals of 1,000 flight hours. To ensure that any valves developed at a later date are also reviewed first by the FAA for adequate service history, new paragraph (f) of the proposed rule makes a provision for the service history data of such additional valves to be approved by means of an alternative method of compliance with the rule. Ball Valves, General Several commenters suggest that, because of the history of the general reliability of ball valves, the proposed rule should be revised to permit installation of a ball valve in a drain system as terminating action for the leak checks of that particular drain system. Other commenters request that, based on this history of reliability, the proposed 1,500-flight hour leak checks intervals for drain systems incorporating ball valves, as proposed in paragraph (a)(1), be extended to 4,000 or 6,000 flight hours.
