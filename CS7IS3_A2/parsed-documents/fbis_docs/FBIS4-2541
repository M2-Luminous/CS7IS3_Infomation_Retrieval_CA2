We have strengthened the building of pricing monitoring network and enhanced the ability to cope with the changes in market prices. Liaoning Province's initially built price monitoring network has monitored the macroeconomic situation of the whole province and the changes in the prices of essential means of production, farm and sideline products, and consumer goods after pricing reform was carried out in various cities and counties. Through tracking and monitoring the situations in 14 large commercial enterprises, six wholesale markets, and 10 large production enterprises across the province, this network has provided reliable information and policymaking basis for governments at all levels to keep abreast of the local pricing situation in a timely manner, to grasp the price reform strength, and to select major pricing reform items. In March last year, the prices of eggs continued to decline and were lower than the production cost in some cities. On the basis of carrying out monitoring work, Shenyang and Yingkou Price Bureaus studied countermeasures, urged the governments to purchase and store eggs for future use, and succeeded in raising the prices of eggs within a short period of time and avoiding the situation of stopping to raise chicken. We have improved a guiding mechanism in which the prices are formed mainly by the market, and cultivated the markets to ensure their sound development. Our provincial pricing departments have regarded entering the market as a strategic task for establishing the new price regulation and control system. The pricing departments across the province have entered and stationed in 58 means of production, real estate, and farm produce markets. The price inspectors stationed in the markets have publicized the state commodity price laws and regulations, and pricing policies, promulgated and disseminated relevant pricing information, participated in market construction, and supervised units entering the markets and businessmen to observe the state pricing laws and regulations. Pricing departments at all levels have also actively coordinated the prices in various trades and guaranteed that commodity prices were kept relatively stable within a certain period of time. We have applied economic, administrative, and legal means to regulate and control the market prices. At present, price regulation funds have been established in 12 cities and 21 counties. Last year, we invested 50 million yuan in stabilizing the prices of some major nonstaple foods whose cost rose or declined suddenly, the market prices of major nonstaple foods during festive days, and the prices of commodities essential to people's life, stabilized the prices of the "vegetable baskets," and ensured that the prices are linked with the price index control target. Last year, following the decontrol of meat, vegetable and coal prices in the province, 14 cities across the province generally decontrolled the marketing price of grain. Most of the prices of commodities under the management of provincial and city authorities had been decontrolled. Considering the province's total purchase of agricultural products, 90.4 percent of the products were purchased at market adjusted prices, of the total retail sales of commodities, 96.6 percent of the commodities were sold at market adjusted prices, and of the total sales of the means of production, 87.4 percent of the products were sold at market adjusted prices, and these three figures were higher than the national average. Thus, we have initially formed a new price operational mechanism with market adjusted prices as the mainstay. The adjustment of prices of railway transport, freight transport, electricity, oil products, state-allocated timber, and of bus tickets and tape water supply of some cities has played an active role in alleviating the difficulties in our province's basic industry and promoting a more rapid development in the national economy.
