Ulyantseva, Khirurgiya Surgery Enterprise, Kemerovo] [Abstract] The ability of phosphatidyl-choline-cholesteric liposomes to suppress the growth of conditionally pathogenic microorganism and nonenzymatic self-oxidation of liposomal lipids which is facilitated by ultrasonic treatment and is accompanied by the formation of malonic dialdehyde (MDA) are discussed, and it is noted that the lipid peroxidation products (POL) are strong oxidants with a damaging effect on cell membranes. An attempt is made to investigate the accumulation of secondary lipid peroxidation products in liposomal and liposomal-bacterial suspensions and to study their effect on the growth of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture. To this end, liposomes are prepared from egg phosphatidyl-choline (by BIOS, Novosibirsk) and cholesterol (by Sigma, U.S.) in a 7:5 molar ratio and a 25 mg/ml lipid concentration in a 0l.15 M NaCl solution with subsequent ultrasonic treatment at 22 kHz. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2134 strain is used as the test culture. The dynamics of malonic dialdehyde accumulation in liposomal suspensions with various pH values, the malonic dialdehyde accumulation dynamics in the liposomal-bacterial suspension containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells with various pH values, and the dependence of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell growth on the level of lipid peroxidation product accumulation in the liposome suspension are plotted. The findings demonstrate that during 24 h of liposome incubation at a 37ï¿½C temperature, lipid peroxidation products are accumulated in the suspension while the accumulation dynamics in the liposomal suspension differ from their accumulation rate in the liposomal-bacterial suspension whereby the process intensity depends on the medium acidity. The lipid peroxidation products display a bactericide effect whose manifestation depends on the extent of lipid peroxidation product accumulation, liposome concentration, and exposure duration.
