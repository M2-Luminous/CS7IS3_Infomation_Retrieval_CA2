FR940803-0-00027 FR940803-0-00010 Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with §11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as required by §§11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with §21.101(b)(2). Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for that model be amended at a later date to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature, or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of §21.101(a)(1). Discussion There is no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems from high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF). Increased power levels from ground-based radio transmitters, and the growing use of sensitive electrical and electronic systems to command and control airplanes, have made it necessary to provide adequate protection. To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference, special conditions are needed for the CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11 (CL&hyph;415 variant) that would require the EFIS and LCD's be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption of function due to the effects of HIRF. High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF) With the trend toward increased power levels from ground-based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics systems, such as the EFIS and LCD's, to HIRF must be established. It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling to cockpit-installed equipment through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analyses of existing HIRF emitters, an adequate level of protection exists when compliance with the HIRF protection special condition is shown with either paragraphs 1 or 2 below: 1. A minimum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18 GHz. a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe shielding. b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis. 2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated. ␣ 1Frequency 1Peak (V/M) 1Average (V/M) 10 KHz&hyph;100 KHz 50 50100 KHz&hyph;500 KHz 60 60 500 KHz&hyph;2000 KHz 70 70 2 MHz&hyph;30 MHz 200 200 30 MHz&hyph;70 MHz 30 30 70 MHz&hyph;100 MHz 30 30 100 MHz&hyph;200 MHz 150 33 200 MHz&hyph;400 MHz 70 70 400 MHz&hyph;700 MHz 4,020 935 700 MHz&hyph;1000 MHz 1,700 170 1 GHz&hyph;2 GHz 5,000 990 2 GHz&hyph;4 GHz 6,680 840 4 GHz&hyph;6 GHz 6,850 310 6 GHz&hyph;8 GHz 3,600 670 8 GHz&hyph;12 GHz 3,500 1,270 12 GHz&hyph;18 GHz 3,500 360 18 GHz&hyph;40 GHz 2,100 750 The envelope given in paragraph 2 above is a revision to the envelope used in previously issued special conditions in other certification projects. It is based on new data and SAE AE4R subcommittee recommendations. This revised envelope includes data from Western Europe and the U.S. As discussed above, these special conditions are applicable to CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11 (CL&hyph;415 variant) airplanes manufactured by Canadair, Inc., of Montreal, Canada. Should Canadair apply at a later date for a change to the type certificate to include another model incorporating the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would apply to that model as well, under the provisions of §21.101(a)(1). Conclusion This action affects only certain unusual or novel design features on CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11 (CL&hyph;415 variant) airplanes. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane. The substance of the special conditions for these airplanes has been subjected to the notice and comment procedure in several prior instances and has been derived without substantive change from those previously issued. It is unlikely that prior public comment would result in a significant change from the substance contained herein. For this reason, and because a delay would significantly affect the certification of the airplane, which is imminent, the FAA has determined that prior public notice and comment are unnecessary and impracticable, and good cause exists for adopting these special conditions immediately. Therefore, these special conditions are being made effective upon issuance. The FAA is requesting comments to allow interested persons to submit views that may not have been submitted in response to the prior opportunities for comment described above. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25 Aircraft, Aviation safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The authority citation for these special conditions is as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1344, 1348(c), 1352, 1354(a), 1355, 1421 through 1431, 1502, 1651(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 1857f&hyph;10, 4321 et seq.; E.O. 11514; and 49 U.S.C. 106(g). The Special Conditions Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the following special conditions are issued as part of the type certification basis for the Canadair Model CL&hyph;215&hyph;6B11 (CL&hyph;415 variant) airplanes: 1. Protection from Unwanted Effects of High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF). Each electrical and electronic system that performs critical functions must be designed and installed to ensure that the operation and operational capability of these systems to perform critical functions are not adversely affected when the airplane is exposed to high-intensity radiated fields external to the airplane. 2. The following definition applies with respect to this special condition: Critical Function. Functions whose failure would contribute to or cause a failure condition that would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane. Issued in Renton, Washington, on July 14, 1994.
