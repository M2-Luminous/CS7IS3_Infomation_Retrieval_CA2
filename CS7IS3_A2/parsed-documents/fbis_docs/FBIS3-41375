Zambia Institute of Bankers (ZIB) president Mr Bill Fearon said in Lusaka yesterday the apparent unlimited liberalisation of the economy, especially on essential goods, had made Zambia a stepping stone through which traffickers converted "illicit dirty money" into hard currency. The converted currency was then ploughed back into the illicit business which enabled traffickers to finance further trade and repeat the "whole horrible exercise," Mr Fearon said. He was opening a Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) workshop on money laundering at Barclays Bank Training Centre sponsored by the Bankers Association of Zambia. He noted that the opening of foreign exchange bureau had contributed to the flourishing of money laundering because there was "nothing to effectively prevent unscrupulous person going from one bureau to another externalising and cleansing dirty money," he said. "It is obvious the use of scarce foreign currency resources in this way for a poor country like Zambia can only do further damage to the economy and eventually the living standards," said Mr Fearon who is African Commercial Bank managing director. Although it was widely believed that Zambia was used as a back-door entrance to drugs to the south, there was a "high" possibility there were manufacturers, suppliers and even couriers of drugs in Zambia. Such people were getting their profits back into the country in form of luxury cars and non-funds or under-invoiced imports. "It is frankly unlikely that we as bankers can easily identify such persons through a routine monitoring of their account activity," Mr Fearon said. He appealed to Government to review the Bankers Book Evidence Act because the present one did not protect banks from suit if they disclosed the information about customers' account without a court order. If drug traffickers succeeded in hiding and prospering behind the free market environment, "then we need to question whether we have not gone too far in the quest for liberalisation." Even in developed countries, monitoring and checks on money movement were still in force.
