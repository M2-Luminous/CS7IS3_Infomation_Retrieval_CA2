They were to start preparing the airport for the reception of humanitarian aid flights following a weekend agreement by besieging Serbs to allow two air corridors into Tuzla. Some 100 Swedish troops backed by armoured vehicles, including six Danish-crewed Leopard tanks, entered the base at 1:30 p.m. (1230 GMT) to replace the last elements of the mainly-Moslem Bosnian army. Earlier half-a-dozen Moslem trucks had left the airport carrying troops, documents and other equipment. The 2,400 metre (3,000 yard) runways, which can take heavy transport aircraft, are within range of Serb artillery, but the airport has not been shelled since last week.
