John Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, told the House of Commons the Government had never explained its assertion that union membership led to a "conflict of loyalties." He accused the Government of "mulish obstinacy" -- members of unions worked on sensitive, secret work at the Ministry of Defence, the Cabinet Office and Whitehall's Joint Intelligence Committee. The Labour/Liberal Democrat amendment to the Intelligence Services Bill fell at the start of the debate on its report stage. Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery accused the Government of "tilting at invented windmills." He referred to the case of John Cook, one of 14 GCHQ staff dismissed for refusing to give up their union rights. Mr Cook, a former cipher clerk, was later honoured for his work during the Falklands War. Labour leaders tabled amendments designed to strengthen the accountability of the security and intelligence agencies. Under the bill, a committee of parliamentarians is, for the first time, to monitor the three main security and intelligence agencies -- M15, M16 and GCHQ. It is expected to be chaired by Tom King, the former defence secretary, and will consist of five Tory members, three Labour and one Liberal Democrat. The committee has a limited role "to examine the expenditure, administration and policy" of the three agencies. It will not have the power to call for papers and persons, and witnesses will not be required to give evidence on oath. The Government has strict control over information provided to the committee, which will have no staff of its own.
