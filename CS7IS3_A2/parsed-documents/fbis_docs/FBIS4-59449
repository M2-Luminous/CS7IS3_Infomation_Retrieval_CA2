The latest of these missile is the one fired at Sanaa area on Wednesday which killed 23 martyrs and injured 30 others. The source added that this heinous crime demonstrates the sick minds of the YSP secessionists, the continuing bloody policy by which they have been known throughout their rule, and the oppression of our brothers in the southern and eastern governorates. This suicidal action demonstrates the level of despair of the YSP secessionists and their state of collapse. Concluding its statement, the source said that such criminal acts, which are not justified by any religious, conventional, or moral standard, cannot pass unpunished. We appeal to all citizens to keep calm and not to worry as a result of these actions, despite their ugliness. We ask citizens to make these actions a motive for further cohesion and unity among all. We pray to God to steer the country and Yemeni people everywhere away from harm and afflictions and to have mercy on the souls of the martyrs and speed the recovery of the injured. God is our supporter.
