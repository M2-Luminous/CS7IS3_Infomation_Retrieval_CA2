The destruction of the natural bases of life, however, also destroys the future of coming generations and thus any hope. In the interest of the continued existence of mankind and of our people, the global and regional protection of the environment in order to ensure the preconditions for existence is an outstanding international and national task. Even though Germany, as an industrial state, is one of the world's technically most highly developed countries and certainly has the necessary means, it is still engaged in environmental cosmetics instead of environmental policy. The degree of industrialization and the high density of the population produce growing tension with the justified and necessary ecological demands. The preservation of an environment that is worth living in for the coming generations of our people is, however, more important for us Republikaner than a short-sighted striving for profit and prosperity. The German people's bases of life can, however, be ensured only if the population density does not increase further. Therefore, one must put an end to the further immigration of foreigners to Germany. Successful environmental policy can be implemented only together with a sensible population policy! We Republikaner demand: -- Anchoring the protection of the German people's bases of life as a priority task in the Basic Law, in a way that leads to actionable claims for damages and claims to compel someone to refrain from doing something in case of environmental damage, in line with the polluter-pays principle. -- Legal definition of the common welfare mentioned in Article 14 of the Basic Law in the sense of safeguarding our people's bases of life in the long term. Short-term national economic interest must no longer justify environmentally harmful interference in private property! Environmentally conscious behavior must already begin in childhood and is to be included more intensively in school curricula. Air, soil, water, fauna, and flora form a densely interlaced network. In addition to pollution from the air, this network is seriously affected by waste disposal and by emissions from households, traffic, industry, and agriculture. Immediate measures, including legislative, are necessary to protect it. Therefore, we Republikaner demand: - Industry and consumers are to be stimulated to act more economically. - The minimum life expectancy of industrial goods and the recycling of used raw materials are to be increased drastically. - The legally permitted introduction of partly untreated industrial waste water into waters of all kinds is to be rescinded. - In agriculture, the area-related introduction of nitrogen must not be higher than the consumption of nitrogen so as to protect the ground water. Therefore, strictly area-related husbandry and tax incentives for using mineral fertilizers less generously are to be implemented without any further delay. - The use of agricultural chemicals is to be reduced further in a similar manner. They are an essential reason for the dying of species. Under the precondition that this is safeguarded effectively by means of foreign trade, it would also be possible for the farmers to receive higher prices for their products again while yield per hectare would be lower all over the country. - Not least because of the unbraked mass immigration, one needs more and more living space and usable space. Construction projects are to take into consideration more intensively the concerns of soil, water, and landscape protection. The transformation of arable land into areas for roads or housing construction is to be limited to the unavoidable minimum. - In case of industrial and public building projects, natural areas must be created in compensation. - Surface waters are to be increasingly fed into the ground water. - The ground water strata are to be preserved in construction projects. Environmental offenses are no minor offenses! We Republikaner therefore demand the strict punishment of environmental criminals.
