[Klaus] There is no simple reply to this question. The Environment Ministry's work is not satisfactory. However, it is necessary to carefully consider whether this is due to the complexity of the problems with which the ministry is dealing or a consequence of the minister's own work, whether it is due to the ministry's being too big and heavy-handed or whether some other factors might be at play. I do not ascribe primary importance to differences of views or to the exceptional complexity of environmental problems. I think, rather, that the reasons this ministry's activity has been very unsatisfactory for almost two years [since Frantisek Benda became minister] are of a subjective nature and do not rest with the minister alone. [Krejci] The annual rate of inflation fell below 10 percent for the first time in February. Is this a permanent trend? [Klaus] The rate of inflation is now nearing the level we consider probable over the long term. When we say that the last figure for the annual rate of inflation is 9.7 percent, it does not mean that I can pledge that, in the months to come, it will be 9.4 or 10.1 percent. Anyway, in this area we are moving in regions that are a world apart from the other postcommunist countries, and I think we are beginning to approach the Western level. Nevertheless, the rate of inflation is still at least double the European Union average, and getting near this average is still a question of a few more years. The adjustment of individual prices to their balanced level over the long term is still under way, and this process is pushing prices up rather than down. [Krejci] Czech Social Democratic Party [CSSD] Chairman Milos Zeman has supposedly contacted some politicians in Slovakia and proposed the creation of a Czechoslovak Union. What do you think about that? [Klaus] Milos Zeman, the CSSD chairman, is incorrigible in many ways, including, it seems, in this matter. Every sensible person in our country and in Slovakia knows that this issue is absolutely not on the agenda and that this is a mere shooting of arrows somewhere where there is no target and no spectators.
