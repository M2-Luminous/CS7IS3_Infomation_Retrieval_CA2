But no one knows whether peace has set in for a long time, or whether the war is just taking a short breathing space. Fighters on both sides of the Ingur are looking into the future through the slits of gun-sights and may at any moment come together in a destructive tornado. Where has happened to compromise? And what is more important -- the right of a state to territorial integrity, or the right of a people to self-determination, achieved through the blood of a battle of ethnic liberation? In a conversation with our correspondent, Professor Taras Shamba, doctor of juridical sciences and president of the World Congress of Abkhazian-Abazinian People, reflects on this. He reflects with partiality, sometimes with prejudice -- but is it easy to behave otherwise over the new graves of your fellow countrymen? Of course, PRAVDA is prepared to give the floor to the other side too. [Dementyeva] Taras Mironovich, do you think that the war in Abkhazia has finished? [Shamba] For Abkhazia, only the first phase of war has ended; it has fully rid itself of Georgian military formations. Admittedly, groupings remain, hiding in the mountains, in individual population centers, but by and large the active hostilities have ended. Abkhazian armed formations have stopped at the Abkhazian-Georgian border along the River Ingur. The main thing for us today is to prevent a new war from being unleashed. The point is that the Georgian government troops which won a victory over ex-president Gamsakhurdia, have gained full control of Western Georgia and concentrated an enormous quantity of weapons and manpower on the border with Abkhazia. In this connection, it must be said that the Russian leadership and the Ministry of Defense have fully reequipped and re-armed the Georgian government forces -- they have been given tanks, armored personnel carriers, helicopters, airplanes, artillery, and ammunition. This started straight after the liberation of Sukhum [Abkhazian version opf Sukhumi], when the Abkhazian formations approached the border with Georgia. It was done with the aim of giving assistance to Shevardnadze in the fight against the ex-president, and as a result, a huge military potential has accumulated in Georgia. Once again people are starting to look for reasons to unleash aggression against Abkhazia. Voices can also be heard saying that the main railroad route must be protected again, and that the return of the refugees will be attended by the need for the presence of Georgian troops on the territory of Abkhazia. We do not want to be dragged into war again, we do not want the Georgian government forces to be given a pretext for returning. [Dementyeva] What about the railroad? [Shamba] In all, 10-12 percent of freight was passing through the territory of Abkhazia on its way to Georgia and Armenia. And in the area where the Georgian population is mainly concentrated -- in Gali, there were six instances of attacks on trains or blowing up of bridges. All the other cases (over 70) were on Georgian territory. The Abkhazian Government has guaranteed, then and now, that freight would travel unhindered through Abkhazian territory. That is, the problem does not exist here. The desire to place Georgian government troops along the entire mainline route, in every area, means another occupation of Abkhazia. Naturally, the Abkhaz side cannot agree to this at all. [Dementyeva] Has any progress been made at the Georgian-Abkhazian talks? [Shamba] Peace in the region depends on how the Georgian politicians behave. It would be wonderful if Shevardnadze and his entourage had sufficient common sense to sit down at the negotiating table 11 January 1994 under the aegis of Russia and the United Nations. These should be held in Moscow or Geneva. We need to agree on what mutual relations between Abkhazia and Georgia should be like. Then we could start to restore the economy, the social sphere, culture, we would be able to create opportunities for the gradual return of refugees. After all, Sukhum and Ochamchira have been practically destroyed, and many villages have been completely obliterated. And difficult experiences would await those who returned there now -- because of the blockade by Russia, there is no light, water, bread, or other foodstuffs. The humanitarian aid which is supposed to pass through Krasnodar Kray to Abkhazia is also being blocked. [Dementyeva] So far no one has heard a lucid answer from the Abkhazian side as to why the Sochi agreement was disrupted? [Shamba] The point is that the Georgian side used this truce in order to move up its forces and get new weapons. But, even though we knew this, we waited. And we trusted them. But the deadline for the withdrawal of the equipment and the departure of the troops was violated for the 11th time! And when Shevardnadze claimed that by the time of the offensive by the Abkhazians, the Georgians in Sukhum were left empty handed, this did not correspond with reality, to put it mildly. Pehapse the only thing lacking there was nuclear missiles. Now that Sukhum has been liberated it is possible to familiarize oneself with the type of weapons that Georgia had at its disposal. They had an enormous quantity of tanks, armored personnel carriers, "Uragan" and "Grad" systems, howitzers, and state-of-the-art types of artillery -- 100mm and 120mm guns. Every cloud has a silver lining -- now the Abkhazian formations are equipped with state-of-the-art types of equipment which they managed to capture from the enemy. Plus the ones which the Georgians stored at dumps and bases in Sukhum and Ochamchira. The mass media in Russia and abroad have created every possible condition for the Georgian side to present the facts in a light that is advantageous to it. For example, the story about the airplanes brought down in Sukhum. They claimed that women and children were traveling in them. But who is this meant to fool? These "women and children" flying into the combat operations area turned out to be a landing party hurrying to bring assistance. [Dementyeva] How would you argue against the accusations of ethnic cleansing? [Shamba] I would like to recall that the ethnic cleansing was started by the Georgians; Georgia for the Georgians was their idea. And these were official slogans. Karkarashvili, the commander of the Georgian government troops in Abkhazia, promised that he would destroy all 97,000 Abkhazians, and he would not begrudge assigning 100,000 Georgians for this purpose. And after all, no one has repudiated this policy. Furthermore, Shevardnadze then appoints Karkarashvili as defense minister and general. That means that the chauvinistic policy remains. Would it otherwise really have been possible to arrange mass annihilations of Armenians, Greeks, Russians, not to mention Abkhazians? And if it were not for the personal request of the Russian president, I think that Shevardnadze would already have been captured and would evidently stand trial. [Dementyeva] Did the president turn to Ardzinba directly? [Shamba] No, the deputy foreign minister spoke to the Abkhaz leadership on his behalf. He asked for the possibility to get Shevardnadze out of the territory of Abkhazia alive. I will not hide the fact that the main hopes are pinned on Russia's peacemaking role. Although it has maintained neutrality throughout the conflict, and although we have not received the assistance that Georgia has received, the services rendered by Russia in establishing peace on Abkhazian soil is enormous. Boris Nikolayevich Pastukhov really did sincerely try to help resolve the conflict by political means. [Dementyeva] But nevertheless, how does Abkhazia plan to structure its relations with Georgia? [Shamba] For its own part, Abkhazia has decided that it must be a sovereign, rule-of-law, democratic state. A subject of international law which can and should, I believe, establish relations with Georgia, with Armenia, with Russia, with Turkey, with Greece, and with other states. At the moment it is hard to say what the nature of these relations will be, because a great deal depends on Georgia. And on the leaders who head it today. Will they realize that Abkhazia is not an appendage, it is not a province of Georgia, but a sovereign democratic state with which relations must be constructed on the basis of equal rights? Then all questions can be resolved. And there are a great many common problems connected with transportation, the development of industry, communications, and finances. If Georgia displayed good will, we could reach agreement and have a good relationship. [Dementyeva] But you do understand that Abkhazia is a remarkable land, and Georgia considers it to be its own territory. It will scarcely let it go... [Shamba] It is not their problem whether to let it go or not, because Abkhazia itself, by its own will, has reached independence and sovereignty, and it now depends on the citizens of Abkhazia what the republic's status will be. When this status is determined, the citizens will evidently elect a new parliament. A draft of a new Abkhazian constitution has now been proposed. It will be discussed at the Supreme Soviet, and if it is adopted, then the future will also need to be determined according to this constitution. And I believe that when the legislative organs are created, it may prove necessary to hold a referendum. The people of the Republic of Abkhazia -- Abkhazians, Russians, Armenians, Greeks, Estonians, and representatives of other nationalities are included here -- will be able to determine their own fate. Abkhazia has now officially appealed to Greece, Israel, and Russia for assistance in returning the refugees who went to those countries during the war. Representatives of the Greek diaspora in Moscow are already discussing and counting up the cost of mechanisms for returning the Greeks home. [Dementyeva] It has repeatedly been claimed, notably by the Georgian side, that the rights of representatives of non-Abkhazian nationality are being violated. I understand that the land is called Abkhazia, but a lot of different peoples live in it and they all have the right to resolve the future of this land together. What do you think about this? [Shamba] The future of Abkhazia should be resolved by all of its population. Abkhazia has always been an multi-ethnic [internatsionalnaya] republic. Even travelers in ancient times noted that you had to be able to speak 130 languages in Dioscurias [ancient name of Sukhum]. Sukhum is an international city, and it should remain that way. Ordinary people are not to blame for the flaws of the previous policy. After all, we all remember perfectly well how the population of Abkhazia increased by 160,000 Georgians in the space of 10 years. Many Georgians, who were forcibly resettled in our country in accordance with the "Abkhazpereselenstroy" program, would return to their homeland, but they were nevertheless sent back to Abkhazia by force. That is how the forcible assimilation proceeded. Up to half of the names of population centers were renamed in Georgian, schools were closed, as was the radio, and everything that was connected with the Abkhazian language, culture, and literature was destroyed. But our people have a thousand-year history... [Dementyeva] What will be the fate of the Georgian population? That is evidently the problem. Many Georgians who fled from Sukhum when Abkhazian troops entered the city, say that they have found out that their houses have now been occupied. What will be the mechanism for returning these Georgians home, and returning their property to them; will they be able to feel safe in Abkhazia? [Shamba] Following the liberation of Sukhum, unfortunately it did not prove possible to take control of the city straight away and establish firm law and order. Marauders and plunderers committed outrages. War always means crimes and violence. But the situation is now changing. Several groups of marauders and bandits -- international ones, incidentally -- have now been neutralized. Life is gradually settling down, and it is possible to return refugees, including Georgians. But of course the approach to those who want to return will be differentiated. The horror which the Georgian formations left behind in Abkhazia will not be forgotten in a hurry. After all, entire villages were destroyed. But when people of various nationalities write what was done to them.... In brief, it will be necessary to establish, for every refugee who wants to return, what was his personal role in the military conflict. Whether he fought weapon in hand against the Abkhazian people and committed evil.... As for the houses and apartments, yes, there really is a problem here. Many houses are standing empty, some people returning have found their houses burned down -- where are they to go? So they temporarily occupy the empty houses. This is not being done in an uncontrolled way, but with the permission of the administration, and strict registration is in effect. When the previous owners return they will definitely have to be given back their living space, but before then, we must try to restore the housing stock. Many of those who fought, for instance Cossacks and North Caucasus people, want to stay in Abkhazia. They are being authorized to temporarily live in the houses and apartments which are standing empty, so that later, when the situation has more or less stabilized, they can be allocated land and given assistance in housing construction. [Dementyeva] How many people has Abkhazia lost in this war? [Shamba] According to foreign information, the Abkhazian side has lost up to 5,000 people in this war, including around 2,500-2,600 Abkhazians. [Dementyeva] What will Abkhazia do if the Georgian Government troops nevertheless cross the Ingur? [Shamba] I very much hope that there will be no war. But if it does break out, I believe that the new war will bring Georgia to a state of collapse. It will end its existence as a state. After all, the Abkhazian formations could go further than the Ingur... I think that the Georgian rulers should assess the situation rather more soberly. They are dealing with not just Abkhazian people, but the entire Caucasus region. And peace must finally come to this region.
