He regretted that although crimes of racist nature such as those in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the lates one in occupied Palestine, have increased of late, "the horrifying aspects of the crimes are treated lightly by world news agencies." Verdinejad expressed hope that nanap members, bearing in mind the principle of free-thinking of the non-aligned movement and their own professional responsibilities would do their best to convey the message of the long-suffering people to the world and expose the criminals. The message emphasized that the murder and the massacre of civilians by the military, in the name of human rights and freedom, should be stopped as soon as possible. More than 60 fasting Muslims were gunned down in cold blood at the Prophet Ibrahim mosque in al-Khalil by Zionist agents last Friday.
