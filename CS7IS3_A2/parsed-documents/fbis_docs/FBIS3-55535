Safiyulin; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] Deputies in the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia faction are now holding their first meeting in the Russian parliamentary center. In his brief opening speech, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy once again described his party as one of the best in Russia. He said that the faction does not intend to enter any blocs and that at present it is not interested in what kind of republic Russia will become, presidential or parliamentary. He also noted that the party stands for reconciliation, liberty, and law, and that society should not now be divided into communists, blues and greens -- everyone should be equal before the law. After this, he asked journalists to leave, saying that thereafter, the faction's deputies would be tackling their own problems and tasks, which by all appearances we will be learning about in the next few days.
