By now multi-level property-right exchange markets of different sizes have been established in over 20 Chinese cities of 14 provinces and more are in preparation. Central China's Henan Province has set up more than 20 property-rights exchange markets and disposition markets for properties lying idle. Northeast China's Jilin Province had auctioned 436 local state-owned enterprises through property-rights markets by the end of last year. Mudanjiang City in northeast China's Heilongjian Province has got funds of about 57 million yuan by auctioning 10 enterprises to buyers from the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong. Sixteen enterprises were sold out to and five were leased by domestic individual businessmen or those from Hong Kong and Taiwan on a property-rights exchange fair held last September in central China's Hunan Province. Reform measures have also been taken to shift state-owned enterprises into collective enterprises through annexing or other ways, according to the survey. Utilization of foreign capital has seen a new boom. Quanzhou City in east China's Fujian Province introduced foreign investment to all of its 41 state-owned enterprises in the first three months last year.
