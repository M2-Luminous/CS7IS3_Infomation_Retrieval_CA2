Degni Adjama brings you the details. [Adjama] About 2,000 of these fugitives, mostly children and youths, arrived between 1 and 5 February, and their movement has increased since 6 February. According to the Ghanaian press, the Bimbila clashes between the Konkomba and Nanumba tribal communities have already claimed at least eight lives. Although the Ghana-Togo border has supposedly been closed since 5 January, customs officers have not prevented the fleeing Ghanaians from entering Togo. Anyway, most of the fugitives entered Togolese territory through uncontrolled areas.
