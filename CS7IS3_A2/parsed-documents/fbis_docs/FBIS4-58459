On the basis of this agreement, the PLO police are not authorized to arrest or question the Zionists living in these regions, even if the Zionists sabotage security. On the other hand, the Zionist regime forces are allowed to arrest the Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, without handing them over to the PLO police. It has been arranged that Rabin, the prime minister of the Zionist regime, and 'Arafat, the PLO leader, should meet in Cairo tomorrow to finalize the outcome of the two sides' talks. Our correspondent in Beirut has interviewed the secretary general of the Palestine Islamic Jihad Movement [Dr. Shaqaqi] in Beirut on this meeting and the possible agreements at the meeting. We draw your attention to his report: [Correspondent] Good evening, dear viewers of the Islamic Republic of Iran's television news. According to the remarks made by the secretary general of the Palestine Islamic Jihad Movement, tomorrow is the day of signing the final accord on Gaza and Jericho in Cairo. This will be classed as another day of defeat in the history of the Arabs and Palestine. During a telephone conversation with the Central News Unit office in Beirut today, he said: The issue of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho is nothing more than a tool in the hand of the Zionists; and establishment of such an autonomous government does not realize the aspiration of the Palestinian mojahedin and combatants to create a true Palestinian state and government. On the role played by the Palestinian forces opposed to the Gaza-Jericho accord, Dr. Shaqaqi said: At this stage the goal of all the combatants should remain continuation of the struggle and jihad for the unchanging Palestinian aspiration. It is up to the forces opposed to the peace with the Zionist regime to compile a comprehensive and calculated plan to fight the Zionist regime, even if such a struggle were to continue for another 20 years. On the future of the intifadah after implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord, he said: Far from being cxurtailed, the military operation will -- in my opinion -- intensify, even though continuation of the military operations under these circumstances will be difficult. We will, however, exert every effort.
