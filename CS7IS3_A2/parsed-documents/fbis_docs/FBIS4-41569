Last year, over 90 percent of machine export went to Iran, for a sum totalling nearly half-million dollars. As told the head of machine-production Administration in the Armenian Industrial Ministry, Vardgues Majaryan, appearance at the Iranian market has saved many machine- building plants in Armenia from bankruptcy, since the CIS market, due to blockade and transport problems, has become inaccessible. During the whole last year only 70 machines were exported to CIS countries. However, as thinks Majaryan, the relatively high demand for Armenian machines in Iran is not an escape from the hard situation in which the industry has found itself. The thing is that Iranian market has purely consumptional and mediatory character, rather than industrial purposes. Thus the milling engine, which costs 4 to 5 thousand dollars, is sold to Iran at a half-price. As thinks the head administrator, the production of heavy machines in Armenia is not justified, since their sale is difficult. The machine building industry passes today to the output of small universal machines, the demand for which is rather high.
