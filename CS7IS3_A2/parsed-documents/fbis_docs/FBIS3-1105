Here is the text of the speech: Brothers, presidents and heads of delegations, secretary general, representative of the African National Congress, representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress, ladies and gentlemen: Once again we meet in this ancient African city to ponder the recent developments in the southern part of our glorious continent and discuss the moves that we should make in the coming months. We need to ensure that we remain on the course that will bring us nearer to our righteous goals and reward the bitter struggle in which we all have taken part for the principles of freedom and justice. The fraternal people in South Africa have taken the heavier share in this struggle, but all African nations and peace-loving forces in the world have come to their support. To begin, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my brother and dear friend, President Robert Mugabe, and the brotherly Zimbabwean people for hosting this momentous meeting that comes at a crucial juncture in the history of African struggle for liberation and progress. It is propitious that we meet today in a capital that has witnessed many of Africa's historic achievements. I recall that our committee met in 21 August 1989. I and many of you had the honor to participate in that meeting in which we discussed ways of providing support to the South African people who were fighting a ferocious battle against apartheid and struggling for a just and safe society, one that is free from the shackles constricting the majority of this great people. At that time, my brother and friend Nelson Mandela was in prison and many looked upon the abolition of apartheid as a distant dream. The daunting obstacles were there all right, but the will of the people triumphed in the end. Our great people in South Africa, braving the difficulties, faithful to their ideals, made a sizable contribution to the history of struggle for justice and freedom. We are now only a few steps away from the establishment of a democratic state in this precious part of this tenacious continent. We are fully aware of the challenges we will have to face in the months and years ahead as we seek to build a strong and cohesive society capable of shaking off the painful legacy of the past and exploring the vast potential of its new horizons. We have no other recourse but to accept these challenges and plunge into the battle of building a democratic state with the same grit that marked our struggle against the unjust system of apartheid. It may be fitting here to point out the establishment of the Transitional Executive Council, which is working tirelessly to accelerate the march of democracy, create a pluralistic system, and supervise the holding of general elections within the next few weeks. We are confident that all the forces supporting legitimacy and progress will unite their ranks and come up with a formula for comprehensive national reconciliation that would spur and guide the current process. For this to happen, all national forces should take part in the elections, for the latter represents a first but crucial step in this historic transformation and the light that guides our hopes. We, for our part, will not hesitate to engage in every necessary effort to protect this process. We see our task, within this committee, as one that will continue until the fruit of this struggle, which we launched side by side, is harvested. We will remain prepared to get in touch with all parties and urge them to participate in a positive way so that a democratic state in South Africa will come into being on schedule and take its place within the larger African community. Long live the unity of African struggle. Long live the struggle of African nations for a new dawn of prosperity and construction, an end to hatred and grudges, and a deeper commitment to freedom, democracy, and justice. May God guide our efforts to achieve this goal. Peace and the mercy of God be upon you.
