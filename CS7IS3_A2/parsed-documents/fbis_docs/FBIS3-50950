This has wiped out a past in which a person came into the world with his destiny already laid out for him. A person was born either as a have or have-not, black or white, man or woman, and from that moment on, each individual was condemned to patterns of inequality from which only a few managed to escape with great difficulty. The revolution, after socializing the basic means of production, established the right to be born in a society that ensures access to education and health care services to all people. These are vital features enabling each individual to have the same opportunities to develop his physical and mental capabilities. Equality is not a gift from heaven, it is not a gift of nature; it is the result of a just distribution of the resources society produces through labor. Viewed in this way, equality is not sustainable if it does not become a stimulus to increased and improved production. In other words, equality is not only a fine ideal of humanism; it must also be a condition for economic development. If, today, Cuba can successfully meet the challenge of moving its economy into the changed world we are living in, this will largely be due to the fact that equality of access to education, health care, and work have, during all these years, created invaluable human resources. This is made up not only of a strong work force with a high educational level, but it is also composed of a pool of educated people unmatched in any other country with a similar level of development. One of the most valuable treasures of the revolution is the love for the ideals of justice and equality that the revolution planted in the people, especially in the young people who today constitute the majority of the nation. But during all these years, we must admit, our national consciousness has not always discerned with proper clarity the limits between equality and egalitarianism. We have frequently created rights of equality exceeding the nation's real economic possibilities; often practice has converted into egalitarianism an idea originally intended to stimulate production and efficiency based on differences in earnings. This lack of precise and realistic limits between equality and egalitarianism may be considered one of the deep-seated causes of our imperfect application of the socialist principle of distribution to each, in terms of both quantity and quality, according to his contribution. The full application of that principle, the foundation not only of the economy but of all true ethics and justice in socialist society, is a historic goal of the workers and their union movement. Labor must be the leveling force for measuring each citizen's merit, prestige, and standard of living in a society of workers. In expressing these aspirations, we do not forget that at the present time when, for reasons we all know too well, the nation's economy is experiencing a critical situation, the most just and rational thing to do is to share these difficulties among all the Cuban people, thus in fact reducing the margin of differentiation based on each person's contribution to society. Controlled, equitable, and rationed distribution, maximum support for employment, and the ample use of price subsidies have helped to save hundreds of thousands of Cubans from distress, bolstering our capacity for resistance and strengthening our national unity. We Cuban workers fully support this profoundly human and revolutionary policy, but at the same time we must create an awareness that each step toward economic recovery the country takes must be accompanied by a revitalization of the role of salaries and their influence on individual consumption. We support the idea that as internal financial order and equilibrium are restored, we must intensify the use of salary and monetary gradations, as well as other material and moral incentives. This does not contradict, but reaffirms, socialist ideology. We believe payment for work must take into account the importance of the particular economic activity in order to stimulate areas and sectors that contribute most to the nation at a given moment. We believe that salary decisions to be made in the future should be based on the particular features of each geographic area and provide the greatest incentives for the least attractive but most essential jobs for the needs of specific goods or services. We feel that in the future, decisions on the best rates, forms, and systems of payment should be more flexible and, as a rule, should be made in each entity. This must be accompanied with strict control of the use of the base salary and its relation to the goods or services made in terms of quantity, selection, and quality. Finally, we maintain that wherever a rigorous managerial climate and labor and technological discipline exist and achieve improved economic results, the workers should be appropriately rewarded. In this way, we will work to establish the principle deeply held by our workers that the inequality to be rejected is not that which differentiates well earned incomes, but equality based on equal treatment for persons of different behavior and ability in their work.
