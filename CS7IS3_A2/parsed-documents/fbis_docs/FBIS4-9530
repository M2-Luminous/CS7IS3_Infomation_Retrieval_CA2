The condition for the strike to be discontinued was the annulment of the decision on the transformation of mines into holding companies. This had taken place, but the strikers had put forward further demands, Pol said on Polish Radio Three on Wednesday. The industry minister stressed that he had decided to annul Decision No. 30 [on setting up holding companies] after talks with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who shares his opinion that transformations to modernize the economy are necessary. The minister also hopes that the workforce in the striking mines will come to this conclusion. Marek Pol said that it was not possible to prepare a schedule for resolving strikers' demands in 48 hours. The fulfilment of the demands from the mining sector by the government would mean that the state is being run by the trade union, and "such a situation is not considered normal anywhere in the world." The minister blamed the union for causing the deterioration of moods among the miners because the unions passed on incomplete information to the workforce of the mines about the conditions for transforming the industry. According to Pol, information about conditions should reach each miner individually.
