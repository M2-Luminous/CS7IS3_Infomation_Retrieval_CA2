FBIS3-53683 "drnes012dd_94014" FBIS-NES-94-012 Document Type:Daily Report 19 Jan 1994 Palestinian Affairs Islamic Jihad's al-Shaqaqi Interviewed PM1401140894 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 13 Jan 94 p 6 PM1401140894 London AL-HAYAH Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Report on interview with Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement, by Ibrahim Humaydi in Damascus; date not given] [Text] Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement, has stressed that the failure of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) or any other faction to boycott the self-rule elections would torpedo the "Alliance of Palestinian Forces" formed recently by the 10 factions opposed to the peace process. However, he pointed to the assertion by representatives of Hamas that it will not participate in these elections. In an interview with AL-HAYAH, al-Shaqaqi said he expects Fatah--the Revolutionary Council, led by Sabri al-Banna (Abu-Nidal), to join the alliance. He said: "I am not alarmed" at that. He said that Iran's "aid to us is much less than many people imagine." And that the money is transferred to the leaderships inside [the occupied territories] through trade operations between the inside and the outside. Dr. al-Shaqaqi said that he "strongly supports the idea of expanding the alliance so as to include the largest number of opposition forces possible," including Fatah--the Revolutionary Council (led by Abu-Nidal). He expects this movement to request to join the opposition alliance. "Or we may invite it to join us" in the future. "I personally am not alarmed at the existence of this color in the coalition." However, he stressed that the question "has not yet been raised at the 10 factions' meetings." The secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Movement said that he "played a special role" to avert the failure of the central meeting held recently by the 10 factions. "I managed to bring views closer among these organizations, due to our awareness of the seriousness of this stage. No one wants to be held responsible for obstructing the plan" opposed to the self-rule [agreement] signed between Israel and the PLO. He stressed: "None of the participants made any real concession, because all were winners. We deferred the influence question and left it up to reality, because it is reality which determines the influence of every faction" -- a reference to the deferment of the question of every faction's share in the "leadership committee." Hamas wants a 40-percent share of representation. Asked for his opinion of the alliance's ability to form an alternative organization to the PLO or to rebuild the PLO, al-Shaqaqi said: "I have no problem. What is important is the political program. And even when the PLO was formed on the basis of influence, it did not reflect the reality precisely." He added that his decision does not focus on a certain tendency's leadership of the alliance of factions, and its demand for a larger representation ratio "reflects our self-confidence, because the organization is not an idol we worship. What we are interested in is public welfare, hence our stress on the political program." He pointed out that the real role of any Palestinian organization should be played on the ground. He confirmed that Hamas representatives had stressed their refusal to participate in the upcoming self-rule elections. "If anyone deviates from this, we will pull out (of the alliance), and any deviation from the political program would cause us to abandon it." He said that the agreed political program "is a common denominator" among the views of all organizations, while there are some differences over certain questions. On the ability of these factions to topple the Gaza-Jericho agreement, al-Shaqaqi said: "We are aware of the difficulty of the matter in view of the absence of international support. However, the weakness of the agreement, the continuation of the intifadah, the people's rejection of the agreement, and the continuation of the jihad indicate that it may collapse." He pointed to the existence of "Arab and Iranian support" for those opposed to the agreement. He said that "there is an atmosphere of opposition in the region, and we must exploit it. This can be done by asserting our influence on the ground, thus prompting our friends to provide further aid. Our weakness would cause them to lose confidence in us." Al-Shaqaqi added that "the forces supporting us will be willing to offer more political support when we are united." On his relationship with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, al-Shaqaqi said: "There is no personal problem between us, and there has never been any direct contact in our history. The national criterion is the basis of the relationship, and the position is political." He pointed to "a war of circumvention and blackmail" which 'Arafat exercised against the Islamic Jihad. He said that the Palestinian president "traded in our movement's name by using some of the distorted names and models which he tried to manufacture for himself on the Palestinian scene." And that he "ordered one of his supporters to announce the Islamic Jihad's support for the agreement." With regard to the movement's relationship with Syria, the Islamic Jihad Movement secretary general said that Damascus "is open to all Arabs. It is in a state of war with the Zionist entity. It has no objection to the presence of Palestinian forces working from Syria to liberate their land, as this is in line with the general political orientation in Syria." He pointed out that one of the movement's deportees whom Israel allowed to return from south Lebanon refused to return to the occupied territories and is present now in Damascus. Al-Shaqaqi said that Iranian financial to the movement "is limited; we admire the Iranian revolution's ideas opposed to international arrogance and calling for the liberation of all Palestine." He said that aid is transferred to the inside through "trade operations between the inside and Europe and Egypt. It is an easy process. The aid is received by neutral parties inside." He added that the Jihad leadership focuses "primarily on the inside. So all our resources are sent there. We do not want to conduct any organizational development outside." He noted that coordination between the inside and the leadership outside is conducted through the normal communication means, namely telephone, fax, and personal representatives. "Our cadres total a few thousands while our supporters exceed this number by far." He pointed out that the movement is currently considering the idea of unifying the military wing in order to adopt one of two known names: the "Struggling Islamic Forces" [al-quwwat al-islamiyah al-mujahidah] or "Battalions of the Sword of Islam" [kata'ib sayf al-'Islam]. He also said that the movement had carried out several military operations inside; "we acquire our weapons through arms dealers inside, through smuggling from neighboring states, or through purchase from traders acting as brokers with Israeli soldiers." On his movement's relationship with Hamas, al-Shaqaqi pointed out that "there is coordination between us, and we will contest the engineer union elections in Gaza on one list in the next few days. We do not deny Hamas' distinguished role" in the occupied territories. He stressed that the idea of "unity with Hamas is not far off." And that time "has reduced differences between us, and political positions are similar now. We are aware that organizational accounts do not disappear easily, and we are currently working to end these sensitivities in order to achieve the cooperation and unity plans." He pointed to the existence of "security" difficulties obstructing the formation of the "National and Islamic Command of the Intifadah," which the opposition factions have agreed to set up, and "we will work to iron out the difficulties."
