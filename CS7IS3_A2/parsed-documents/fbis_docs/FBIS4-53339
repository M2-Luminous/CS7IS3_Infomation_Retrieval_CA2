We are at Niigata Port, situated on the western coast of Japan, at around 1430 on 20 April. Niigata Port is where the fellow countrymen who were repatriated to the North, are filled with regret. Right at this place, the ship Mangyongbong-92 came to anchor. It left Niigata Port on 11 April with the congratulatory group of Kim Il-song's 82d birthday and the visiting group to visit their families who were repatriated to the North. It returned after making a 1,000km trip from Wonsan to Niigata. At around 1330, one hour before the arrival of the Mangyongbong-92, one omnibus carrying a a white banner with the word "reception" in Korean, and one automobile upon which hung a large North Korean flag arrived at the pier. The only people welcoming the Mangyongbong-92 were five to six people in the omnibus and the automobile which came from the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon] Headquarters in Niigata Prefecture and the Niigata Central Branch of Chongnyon. The crowd welcoming the Kim Il-song birthday congratulatory group was also shabby. When the Mangyongbong-92 slowly came into the pier, the `Song of General Kim Il-song' was heard through the large speaker. Employees of the Niigata Port Maritime Security Office set up barricades at both ends of the pier and controlled people from coming and going. When the door of the ship's cabin opened, three Japanese customs officers went on board and then the passengers got off board headed by an old man in a wheelchair. The number of passengers amounted to 250 people. When leaving Niigata Port on 11 April, there were about 1,000 pieces of baggage, but now there was only one bag per person. They left with much baggage and returned empty handed. Some big figures including reporters from the CHOSON SINBO, a paper affiliated with Chongnyon, carried North Korean special products such as blueberry wine and ginseng liquor. These were not contained in shopping bags but in vinyl bags for one-day use. The customs procedure ended by attaching just one tag to their belongings. In connection with the North Korean nuclear issue, measures for economic sanctions in North Korea have been brought up. Thus, Niigata Port is once again attracting the world's attention. Among the economic sanctions, the greatest blow North Korea can suffer from is blocking the remittance of money to North Korea through the Mangyongbong-92. The easiest place to restrain the Mangyongbong-92 from going to North Korea is Niigata Port. Niigata Port is the original base of the repatriation ship. Niigata Port can be seen in our textbooks. The first repatriation ship left Niigata Port on 14 December 1959, carrying 975 Korean residents in Japan from 238 households. Since then until 1984, 93,339 Korean residents in Japan boarded the repatriation ship for North Korea at Niigata Port. Since there were no longer any Korean residents in Japan who wanted to go to North Korea, such a project was completely suspended in 1984. Nevertheless, the Mangyongbong-92's entry into Niigata Port continues. Along the 2km road from the Minami Plaza Hotel in Niigata Prefecture to the office of the Niigata Chongnyon Headquarters, many willows have been planted. They have been planted along the street every 50 meters. This is the 'willow street' which Chongnyon takes pride in. Chongnyon had planted these trees in commemoration of the first repatriation ship that left Niigata Port in 1959. The willows which were only the size of a child's finger, have now grown to be as thick as an adult's thigh, 35 years later. The willows are growing to be a symbol of time showing the history of the repatriation ship. It has been learned that since last autumn, when it began to discuss in earnest the problem of economic sanctions against North Korea, the Japanese Government has put under control Chongnyon's remittance to North Korea via Niigata port. However, we could not sense such an atmosphere on-the-spot at Niigata. The international terminal of Niigata port where the Mangyongbong is anchored was rather decorated as a tourist site. The terminal did not look like a chilly and quiet port as it was seen when Korean residents in Japan were repatriated to North Korea in the past. An observation platform and seats for spectators were installed in the terminal so that people can observe the Mangyongbong calling at and leaving the port. Even spectators were able to freely observe customhouse officers' inspection activities nearby. The information board installed in the terminal was written in Korean along with English and Japanese. In other words, the terminal has changed into a sightseeing spot for South Koreans. We could sense North Korea's serious food shortage even at Niigata port. When the repatriation of Korean residents to North Korea began in the past, North Korea's propaganda said that North Korea "will provide them with a tile-roofed house, silk clothes, rice, and meat soup," and the Mangyongbong intentionally prevented repatriates from loading their food on the boat. This was in order to show that North Korea "lives in opulence." However, entering the nineties, North Korea did not prevent the repatriates to North Korea from bringing food with them. Rather, in 1991 Chongnyon waged a campaign to send foodstuffs for the repatriates to North Korea. What cropped up in the wake of this campaign was so-called "foodstuffs sets for gift." The foodstuffs sets were divided into three kinds of "rice set," "rice-cake set," and "noodle set." The "rice set" contains 10 kilograms of rice, two cans of sesame oil, one bag (500 grams) of condiments, and one bag (one kilogram) of sugar. "Rice-cake set" and "noodle set" also contain foodstuffs such as ramyon noodles, condiments, and sugar. The price of each foodstuffs set is 11,000 yen. Korean residents in Japan who are not repatriated to North Korea, as well, can buy and send these foodstuffs sets to North Korea. The company which deals with this business is the Kyonghwa Business Company in Niigata Prefecture. The Kyonghwa business company is located one kilometer away from Niigata port and 50 meters away from the Chongnyon Niigata Prefecture Headquarters. The Kyonghwa company founded in June 1976 is operated by the Chongnyon Central Headquarters. The head of the Chongnyon Central Headquarters is Yi Chae-yong. In addition to the Kyonghwa company, there are the Chongnyon Niigata headquarters, the Chongnyon Niigata Central Branch Office which is in charge of repatriating Korean residents in Japan to North Korea, the Choun Credit Union which is a Chongnyon-operated Korean bank in Japan, and the Chongnyon-operated Korean junior and senior high schools in Niigata Prefecture. Korean compatriots in Niigata number about 2,700. Of those, Chongnyon-affiliated Korean residents are only about 960. The number of students at the Chongnyon-operated schools does not exceed 70. Mr. Kim Haeng-su, standing adviser to the (pro-Seoul) Federation of Korean Residents in Japan [Mindan], 71, said that "the number of seceders from Chongnyon is on the increase." Chongnyon's routine life in Niigata varies according to the moves of the Mangyongbong. On the day when the Mangyongbong does not put in at the Niigata port we can see the shutters of the buildings of Chongnyon Niigata Central Branch Office and the Kyonghwa business company pulled down. We can see no one in these buildings, as well as in the building of the Chongnyon Niigata headquarters. On the contrary, when the Mangyongbong calls at the port the shutters open again, and the buildings become a houseful of people carrying baggage. The Korean residents belonging to Mindan were not interested in the Mangyongbong calling at and leaving Niigata port. One day in early 1990 the Mangyongbong delayed its departure time for a couple of hours despite the fact that passengers and cargo were already on board and customhouse officers' inspections, as well, were finished. A couple of hours later, a taxi arrived hurriedly in front of the Mangyongbong. The person who got off in a hurry from the taxi was a certain Yi, vice chairman of the Chongnyon Headquarters. He carried a briefcase. The Mangyongbong departed as soon as he embarked on the ship. Later, a former Chongnyon cadre member revealed that the delay in the Mangyongbong's departure at that time was because of this briefcase which contained money. Cargo carried by the Mangyongbong is inspected at random by Japanese customs offices, which open and inspect about ten parcels selected randomly out of thousands unloaded at the port. They confiscate those things found to be uncleared, and clear everything that has no particular problem. This inspection system has been unchanged for a long time. Japanese customs inspection is not tight because of government policy. The Japanese Government thoroughly controls the introduction of drugs and murderous weapons in the country, but customarily hardly interrupts people from taking them out of the country. Japanese law allows anyone who stays in Japan to carry money not exceeding five million yen without notifying the Ministry of Finance when departing Japan. Passengers of the Mangyongbong are no exception. Some people, however, criticize that the Japanese Government does not control the illegal remittance via the Mangyongbong under the situation in which the North Korean nuclear issue has emerged to be a worldwide issue because it does not want to have the extra security burden imposed by possible protests by Chongnyon. However, a large amount of cash is hardly found inside the cargo. Chang Myong-su, 60, who was vice chairman of Chongnyon headquarters in Niigata and is working as secretary general of the Council for Treating Defectors from the Republic [North Korea] since he left Chongnyon as he felt conscientiously uneasy with the business of sending people to North Korea, said: "People do not attempt the dangerous gamble of hiding money inside packages because there are various ways to send money to North Korea." The Mangyongbong Is the Source of Money for the North Korean Regime According to a common view, Chongnyon funds are dispatched to North Korea through the Mangyongbong, banks in Japan, and third countries. Out of these three channels, the Mangyongbong is known as the best for the open remittance of large amounts of money. In 1975 North Korea began to ask Korean businessmen affiliated with Chongnyon to donate to the fatherland. The dispatch of money through the Mangyongbong also began that year. The late Mun Tong-kon, who was vice chairman of Chongnyon and was one of the special figures who made huge donations to North Korea. He built a 5,378-ton cargo ship worth approximately one billion yen and donated it to North Korea. Mun's donation was reported large scale in the August 1976 issue of KUMIRUI CHOSON, a Japan-based North Korean magazine for propagating North Korean affairs to Japan. The ship donated by Mun was used in transporting North Korean spies involved in the Aungsan Mausoleum incident. In November 1993, THE NEW YORK TIMES reported that millions of yen were flowing into North Korea, hidden in suitcases and plastic bags carried by the Mangyongbong. Sato Kazmi [as transliterated], head of the Hyundai Korea Research Institute in Japan, said that about six million yen come into North Korea each year through the Mangyongbong, thus astonishing the world. There are differences in opinion on the total amount of money dispatched to North Korea through the Mangyongbong. However, Japanese Government officials, the Institute for Studying Economic Issues in Asia, the East Asia Trade Institute, and the ROK Embassy in Japan are unanimously saying: "The estimate that the total remittance through the ship is six million yen is against common sense. The presumed amount is 1-2 million yen per year." A former high-ranking official of Chongnyon said: "The Chongnyon economy is influenced by the long-term economic slump in Japan. The annual donation by an individual reached several hundred million yen before 1980, but since the beginning of 1980 it declined and was finally reduced to tens of millions of yen at the end of 1980." The total amount of the remittance to North Korea through the Mangyongbong is still unknown, but no one denies that this ship is the source of money supporting the North Korean regime as well as the channel for smuggling advanced technologies needed by North Korea. This is proven by facts that most equipment used by North Korean spies is made in Japan, that a Japanese truck made by Nissan was rebuilt as a missile launching ramp in North Korea, and that Pyongyang Children's Palace is decorated with computers from Japan's NEC. A high-level source of Chongnyon has said: "The sending of compatriots to North Korea has greatly contributed to North Korea's munitions industry. To cite an example, Nikon lens-making technology went to North Korea in the sixties, and that of the semi-conductor industry went in the seventies. Such technologies have not been properly made use of because North Korea has not had its own technology to put those technologies into practice." There is no limit as to the number of personal items to be loaded onto the Mangyongbong. Back in the early eighties, North Korea limited the cargo to four items per person so as to block materials of vulgar Western culture, including pornographic magazines, from being imported along with other cargo. Items of personal cargo were once limited to only two. But, since the end of the eighties, the limits have been lifted. This is a sign showing the economic difficulties facing North Korea. A Chongnyon-affiliated industrialist in Niigata has once even carried a total of 16 pieces of luggage on his way to meet his child who had earlier been repatriated to North Korea. Chongnyon sometimes remits money to North Korea through banks in Japan. A typical bank of the kind is the Asikaga Bank. The bank is a regional bank in the Tochigi Prefecture and has about 160 branches across the country. It is a main bank with which the Chongnyon-affiliated Choun Credit Union is in a correspondent relationship. The Asikaga Bank has opened a legal correspondent relationship with the Choson Joint-Venture Bank headquartered in Pyongyang. Money Sent in Crisp Dollar Bank Notes on Kim Chong-il's Birthday The third method is the remittance of money through a third country such as China, Macao, or a Southeast Asian country. A former Chongnyon cadre bore testimony to this, saying: "The remittance through a third country is mainly done in Macao. Yamaguchigumi, a gang of thugs in Japan, has a base in Macao. Remittance is simple. A man willing to send money goes to Macao. He does not have to carry money when traveling. He borrows money from a gang of thugs on mortgage of his stationery assets in Japan. After the gang examines, through its organization in Japan, his capability for such mortgage, the gang lends money to him within the scope of his capability. In this way, a man has once remitted $500,000 at a time. This route was often utilized with the approach of Kim Chong-il's birthday (16 February). The money to be sent to Kim Chong-il should be in crisp dollar bank notes. If the bank notes are used ones, those involved will be blamed for blasphemy. Therefore, they go to Macao and withdraw brand-new bank notes from a Macao branch of a Chinese bank. The amount of money is limited to $2.16 million to match the date of his birth [16 February]. The money is wrapped in a thin cloth, put into Samsonite bags, and then sent to North Korea." He added that if a Chongnyon-affiliated industrialist complains of the difficulty in donating money, North Korea would even propose that "if you go to Macao, you will be introduced to a remitter." He went on to say: "As the amount of money sent in has dwindled since the early nineties, North Korea has forcibly demanded that Chongnyon-affiliated industrialists "donate money in return for being provided with North Korean zinc ingots and steels on a priority basis." When industrialists say "it is difficult to remit money due to Japanese Government surveillance," using this as an excuse to turn down such a proposal, then North Korea presented a method by saying "then, come to Macao, you will be introduced to a Japanese gang of thugs." Ogata Sigetake, Director General of the Japan Public Security Investigation Agency, said in answer to a question by a Diet member of the Liberal Democratic Party at the House of Representatives's Budget Committee on 30 March: "The ways of remitting money to North Korea mainly consists of payments in trade transactions; sending money to relatives or acquaintances in North Korea; paid-in capital in joint venture projects; and donations to the Workers Party. Major ways for the remittance are to remit money through banks, to hand-carry money to North Korea, and to ask those visiting North Korea to carry it." It is said that there are many other ways than using only the Mangyongbong route. For example, remittance can be carried out through Japanese people, not through Chongnyon routes. Because there are many ways like this, Japanese businessmen share the view that it is hard to expect any effect to come from an economic sanction against North Korea.
