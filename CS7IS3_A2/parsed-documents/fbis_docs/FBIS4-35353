The fighting was mainly at the al-'Anad front, 60 kilometers (36 miles) north of Aden and Abyan 35 kilometers (21 miles) east of the city. Several MiG-21 were spotted taking off from Aden Airport. The fighting continued as the UN Security Council was due later in the day to discuss the civil war that erupted on May 5 between northern forces of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and those of his southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid. Al-Bid proclaimed a breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic on May 20, but it has not been recognised internationally.
