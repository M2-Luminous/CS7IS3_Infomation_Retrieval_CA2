Foundation Chairman Fang Chien said the Council of Agriculture [COA] agreed to attend the meeting after being notified by committee Chairman Hank Jenkins, through Fang, that he had reached an agreement with mainland Chinese authorities to allow Taipei's participation. Beijing had previously said it would not allow Taiwan's participation at the meeting, ostensibly because it is not a CITES member. Jenkins, a conservation official in the Australian Government, said it is important for Taiwan to be present at the meeting because issues pertaining to wildlife protection and conservation in Taiwan are on the agenda. Both government agencies and private conservation groups in Taiwan are hoping to attend the meeting since it will detail the future direction of international wildlife management programs, Fang said. He said it would have been "unjustifiable" for Taiwan to be barred from the meeting, considering CITES has threatened it with trade sanctions for its failure to sufficiently stem the trade in rhino horn and tiger parts. The COA will be represented by Prof. Li Ling-ling from National Taiwan University and Prof. Wang Ing from National Normal University at the Beijing meeting. Fang said he would also be a member of the Taiwan delegation, along with Ted Ting, chairman of the Beautiful Taiwan Foundation, another local conservation group. The biennial meeting is a warm-up for the 1994 CITES parties meeting, which is scheduled to open in Florida this November.
