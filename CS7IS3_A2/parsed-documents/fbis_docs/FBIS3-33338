Doctor, we understand the meeting scheduled for Monday has been postponed. What can you tell us about this? [Caramana] Greetings to listeners of Radio Corporacion. Yes, what happened was we have been working to smooth out some small problems and obstacles to holding this meeting since last Thursday. That is why this meeting could not be held today. But I want to inform you and the audience of Radio Corporacion that the determination of the members of the Northern Front, the Army, and government remains unchanged. They are determined to peacefully resolve this issue through negotiations. The meeting is scheduled for the middle of this week in the Quilali area. [Announcer] Doctor, will you present specific points at this meeting? [Caramana] Basically the government and its institutions will present a series of broad proposals and programs to resolve or address the causes that result in the uprising of different groups and sectors of Nicaraguan society. I believe there is a clear awareness to go to the root of the problem this time so as to provide an in-depth and complete solution. We hope all sectors involved are seriously committed to this line of thought. This is not a matter of having a particular group surrender its weapons as a daily thing in Nicaragua, but basically tackling the in-depth problems. Among the basic demands is the issue of security, which is very important and fundamental to all this, and the issue of credits, production, social, health, education, and emergency fund projects, which are needed in these forgotten areas. [Announcer] Doctor, we understand the meeting was postponed due to the very military presence that will be used to settle this situation. [Caramana] Listen, that is not the reason why the meeting was postponed. In reality, we are coordinating the work and planning of this meeting, which is very important, with government authorities, military authorities, and members of the 3-80 Northern Front. I want to clearly state that all the parties are demonstrating goodwill to get to that meeting and agree to the requests made by the 3-80 Northern Front. [Announcer] Doctor, El Chacal's [Jose Angel Talavera] group seems to be ready to disarm itself. What is the situation of other groups, such as those led by Nortiel and El Charrito? [Caramana] Well, we have not received requests from those groups for a possible demobilization. Consequently, I cannot tell you what those two groups' intentions are. It has been said, however, that some of the rearmed groups you just mentioned may be included in this negotiation. I believe the possibility of peacefully resolving, not violently or militarily, the conflict in the northern region will be an important sign for all sectors in the mountains, especially the areas where the post-war population is residing. I think we must seriously work to resolve this problem in an honorable manner for all the parties involved, a solution with real social justice. [Announcer] Can you say whether there have been clashes in the north the last few days? [Caramana] No, thank God the truce has been respected. The cease-fire has been respected. Thank God there has been no incident or loss of human life to regret. I believe the truce and cease-fire are, in reality, the first step of the negotiations. They have an extraordinary value in the sense that no more Nicaraguans are dying. No Nicaraguans from the Army, rearmed groups, or civilian population -- many times people suffer from cross-fire confrontations in these situations -- are dying. [Announcer] Doctor, what can you tell us about the Cobra-93 clandestine group? [Caramana] Well, all I know about this group I get from the news reports and some reports from indirect sources. These groups and some other recompa groups are moving about the country. I think it is appropriate to call the authorities' attention to closely monitor these groups so they do not become an obstacle to the peace process under way in Segovia. I hope no incident occurs in this regard. [Announcer] Doctor, would you like to say anything else to the listeners of "Five O'Clock Sharp" newscast? [Caramana] I would like to add that we are facing a big challenge. I am optimistic about it. But my optimism is moderate in the sense that the resolution of this process does not depend on CIAV-OAS, it depends on the Nicaraguan players of the conflict, namely the government, Army, and members of the 3-80 Northern Front. I believe we have the basic raw material to begin these talks, which is the goodwill of these sectors to settle the conflict peacefully. We reject a violent solution of this dispute. In this regard, we are motivated to cooperate in a vigorous and complete manner in this process. [Announcer] I thank you very much, Dr. Sergio Caramana.
