FR940318-1-00034 FR940318-1-00013 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable; 3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM 10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM 10 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also must submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 which become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM 10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline (see section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512, 13543&hyph;13544). II. This Action Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (See 57 FR 13565&hyph;66). In this action, EPA is proposing to grant approval of the Sheridan, Wyoming, PM 10 SIP because EPA believes it meets all applicable requirements of the Act that were due on November 15, 1991. (Also note that EPA is proposing to approve the contingency measures submitted for the area). The SIP includes the original document submitted to EPA on August 28, 1989, and eight subsequent submittals containing additional information. The dates of these submittals are: October 24, 1989, November 21, 1989, December 20, 1989, February 16, 1990, March 29, 1990, August 21, 1991, November 8, 1991, and March 3, 1992. A. Analysis of State Submission 1. Procedural Background The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. 3 Section 110(1) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. 3 Also Section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the application provisions of section 110(a)(2). The EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1992). The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after receipt of the submission. The State of Wyoming held a public hearing on July 17, 1989, to entertain public comment on the implementation plan for the city of Sheridan. The State provided adequate notice of public hearing; the State requires 45 days notice. Following the public hearing, the plan was adopted by the State, signed by the Governor on July 17, 1989, and submitted to EPA on August 28, 1989, as a proposed attachment to the SIP. On March 8, 1990, EPA determined that the Sheridan SIP submittal was administratively and technically complete and proceeded to draft a Federal Register notice proposing to approve the SIP. However, upon enactment of the 1990 Amendments to the Act, EPA re-assessed the SIP for conformance with the Amendments and determined that additional information was required to comply with the new Amendments. Of the eight submittals made subsequent to the original document, four were received to address requirements of the new Amendments.
