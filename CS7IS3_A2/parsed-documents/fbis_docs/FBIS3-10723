According to a 12 February report in EL ESPECTADOR, Samper said whomever is elected in May will have the "immense responsibility" of pushing forward the economic reforms undertaken by "recent Liberal governments," and, more important, of ensuring that those reforms benefit all Colombians. Samper, a former Minister of Development, said Colombians have two clear choices: the "savage capitalism" proposed by Pastrana that would mean "returning to the past with the model of Reagan and Thatcher," or Samper's proposal of "social capitalism" with a "human face." According to Samper, Pastrana is "keeping strangely silent" with regard to unemployment and underemployment, which Samper described as the "most serious" problem affecting Colombians, especially women and youth. Samper reminded his audience that, just days earlier, he had presented a "serious and concrete plan" for creating 1.5 million "new, and better jobs." He also attacked Pastrana's proposals to address problems in the agricultural sector, saying Pastrana has in effect told farmers he will "abandon them to their fate" in the face of unfair competition from industrialized countries. Samper said he is offering a comprehensive plan of renewal for that sector, which could include "granting subsidies such as other countries do." With regard to social welfare spending, Samper said Pastrana is offering the "old style of assistance of the past" in contrast to his own proposal for a "comprehensive and modern social policy" that will "lift half of the Colombian population out of poverty," and increase productivity. According to EL ESPECTADOR, Samper further asserted that Pastrana's platform made no mention of increasing the availability of housing, in contrast to his own plan which promises to provide additional housing for 500,000 families. Pastrana rejected Samper's criticism of his economic program, according to a 13 February report in EL ESPECTAD0R, adding that "one should never give an opinion on something about which one knows nothing. I don't know if Dr. Samper has taken lessons in speed reading to be able to read, in a single night, the 270-page program that I am proposing for the country."

Navarro said this would restore the purchasing power of the minimum wage which, according to Navarro's estimates, has fallen 7 percent during the Gaviria Administration alone. During an 11 February speech in Cucuta, Navarro said Pastrana's seven-point platform contained "nothing new," according to EL TIEMPO, and he described the Conservative Party candidate as "more Gavirist than Gaviria." At another campaign rally, Navarro said Pastrana's platform offered no "in-depth" proposals for addressing the country's "three historic challenges": an end to violence; treating social justice as a priority; and renewal of the government, freeing it from "clientelism and corruption."

Samper made the comments in response to a letter from the two CUT leaders in which they expressed their opposition to Samper's proposal to privatize Telefonos de Bogota (ETB) in order to finance construction of a metro system in Bogota. The labor leaders said such a move would serve to "concentrate wealth, widen the gap between rich and poor, and threaten the democratic system," according to the article. In his response, Samper said that such "blind opposition" to privatization is "as reproachable" as attempting to use privatizations as "a panacea to cure all the ills and deficiencies of the state," the article states. He said further: "It's time, dear friends, to begin thinking in a different way. I am convinced of the importance of union representation in democracies, but the role of unions in a modernization process, such as Colombia is experiencing, cannot be that of becoming a permanent obstacle to the processes of change that are inevitable." Samper said the role of organized labor, like that of the business associations, is to be committed to improving the competitiveness "of our domestic industry in view the common challenge we face from foreign competition."

Recalling the peace and prosperity he had found in the region while traveling there several years earlier, he contrasted it with the present climate of fear, saying people are clamoring for a return to normalcy in the countryside.
