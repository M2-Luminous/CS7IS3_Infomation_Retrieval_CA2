It was at that time, when Brussels was simply evacuating expatriates and suspending deliveries of ammunition already paid for, that Paris sent a company of paratroopers to Kigali. The French soldiers, who increased in number to 680 men, remained in Rwanda until December 1993, their departure coinciding with the arrival of the first UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] Blue Helmets. Officially, their mission was to reassure and protect the expatriates, particularly French nationals. However, it was clear to everybody in Rwanda that the French military involvement went much further than this: Lieutenant Colonel Chollet, dispatched by the French Defense Ministry, was an adviser to President Habyarimana. Also, members of the four French companies sent to Rwanda were present at checkpoints and were involved in identity checks on the Rwandan population. Two companies were deployed in the north of Kigali, where the threat from the RPF [Rwanda Patriotic Front] was likely to come from. French military advisers also trained Rwandan troops, increased from 5,000 to 40,000 men following the outbreak of war. French advisers did not only create training centers but were also, according to many reports, directly involved in fighting by the government army to halt the RPF advance. At the time of negotiations that led to the Arusha accords, when there was talk of sending a UN force to Rwanda, France even suggested transforming its units already present in Rwanda into Blue Helmets, a proposal rejected by the RPF that considered that Paris had been the strongest ally of the Habyarimana regime. In addition to this military assistance, Paris also supplied the regime with arms and ammunition, and a report published at the beginning of 1994 by Human Rights Watch, a U.S. nongovernmental organization, stressed that France, together with Egypt and South Africa, was the principal arms supplier to Rwanda. Human Rights Watch also affirmed that [French Bank] Credit Lyonnais had guaranteed Rwanda's purchase of arms worth $6 billion from Egypt. The bank subsequently refuted this information, stating that it was simply a transfer of funds. Although France's political and military support for the Habyarimana regime was evident, many questions remain as to the reasons for this involvement. The official argument always put forward, in addition to defense agreements concluded between the two countries, has always been the excellent relations between President Mitterrand and the Rwandan president. Rwanda, where fewer than 10 percent of the population speak French, has always been seen as part of the French-speaking world, compared to English-speaking Uganda and Kenya. At first sight, it is not the natural resources of this overpopulated little country that could have explained its importance for Paris, but rather its strategic location: Rwanda makes it possible to monitor the eastern flank of the huge and very rich Zaire and France had allegedly planned to establish a military base there linking Bangui and Djibouti. Information given by the "Geopolitical Drugs Observatory" in its 1994 report speaks of French soldiers involved in cannabis and heroin trafficking. It was only after the outbreak of the present tragedy that France attempted to transfer the Rwandan issue to the United Nations until [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, due to the slowness of the UN procedure, decided to go ahead and launch humanitarian aid more than two months after the start of the massacres. But this tardy initiative is meeting with a hostile response from the RPF which, given the past events, refuses to believe in the good intentions of Paris.
