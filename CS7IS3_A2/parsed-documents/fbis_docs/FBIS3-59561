Nanocomposite structures consist of inclusions of an inert phase, such as 5 volume percent of 10 nanometer particles of silicon carbide, in a conventional ceramic matrix such as alumina or silicon nitride. The improvement in strength obtained can be dramatic the researchers say. For example, alumina can be strengthened from 300 megapascal to 1500 megapascal, and its toughness, hardness, creep resistance and Weibull modulus are also increased. The objective of the proposed work is to establish a more systematic understanding of nanocomposite structures in terms of mechanisms and processing paths so that full advantage can be taken of the property enhancements. Other partners in the programme are the University of Limerick in Ireland, the University de Valenciennes et du Hainaut-Cambresis in France, and the Centre de Recherche de l'Industrie Belge de la Ceramique in Belgium. The project will last for three years.
