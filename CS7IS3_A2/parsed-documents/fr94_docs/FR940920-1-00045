FR940920-1-00045 FR940920-1-00007 Those MWC's at plants with aggregate capacities below 35 Mg/day would not be subject to the emission limits or any other emission control requirements under today's proposal. However, MWC plants with aggregate capacities greater than 25 Mg/day and less than or equal to 35 Mg/day would be required to provide a one-time notification of construction, which would include their location, planned startup date, the types of fuels that will be combusted, and aggregate plant capacity and supporting information including calculations used to determine plant capacity. This one-time report would allow the EPA or State agency to enforce the lower size cutoff for applicability to the proposed standards. Plants with aggregate capacities of 25 Mg/day or below would not be subject to any provisions under this proposal. The proposed standards for MWC's are subdivided into two subcategories of air emissions requirements: The first for MWC's located at MWC plants with aggregate capacities to combust more than 35 Mg/day but less than or equal to 225 Mg/day of MSW (referred to as small MWC plants), and the second for MWC's located at MWC plants with aggregate capacities to combust greater than 225 Mg/day of MSW (referred to as large MWC plants). The 225 Mg/day dividing point was established because the population of plants with aggregate capacities equal to or below 225 Mg/day contains many modular MWC's, and there are concerns about how applicable technologies such as selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR) are to modular MWC's. The EPA projects that the population of new MWC's at plants with aggregate capacities above 225 Mg/day will account for about 93 percent of new combustion capacity, whereas the population of MWC's at plants with aggregate capacities greater than 35 Mg/day but equal to or less than 225 Mg/day will account for about 7 percent of new combustion capacity. F. Selection of Maximum Achievable Control Technology The following discussion addresses the EPA's selection of MACT. The existing technologies for controlling emissions of the designated pollutants from MWC's are first reviewed, followed by a summary of the EPA's approach for establishing the MACT floor. Finally, the discussion presents the EPA's selection of MACT for MWC's. 1. Summary of MWC Control Technologies The following discussion reviews the existing technologies for controlling emissions of acid gases, dioxins/furans, PM, Cd, Pb, Hg, and NO X from MWC's. a. Acid Gas/PM Control Technologies. Municipal waste combustor acid gas/PM control is a general term that refers to a group of MWC air pollution control technology combinations. These combinations control a wide range of pollutants, such as MWC acid gases (including SO 2 and HCl), MWC organics (including dioxins/furans), and PM and metals (including Cd, Pb, and a number of other metals except Hg). The two acid gas/PM controls most commonly used in the United States for new MWC's are: (1) GCP plus dry sorbent injection (DSI) followed by a fabric filter (FF); and (2) GCP plus a spray dryer (SD) followed by an FF. Discussions of these two acid gas/PM control systems were presented in the December 20, 1989 proposal preamble for the 1991 acid gas and PM NSPS in subpart Ea (54 FR 52251). Control of Cd, Pb, and Hg were not discussed in detail in the 1989 preamble. Since 1991, the performance of the acid gas/PM control systems for removal of Cd, Pb, and Hg has been investigated in more depth. Cadmium and Pb are volatile at temperatures present in combustion systems, but condense onto PM at temperatures associated with the operation of most PM control systems. As a result, the control of Cd and Pb is generally related to the control of PM emissions. However, because of the potential for adsorption of these metals onto fine PM that is less readily collected than larger PM, the control efficiency for these metals may be lower than that for total PM. Fabric filter-equipped systems (e.g., DSI/FF's and SD/FF's) generally have better Cd and Pb control because these devices are better able to collect fine PM than electrostatic precipitator (ESP)-equipped systems. For DSI/FF and SD/FF systems, data for controlled Cd emissions range from 0.001 to 0.010 mg/dscm. Emissions of Pb from MWC's with these systems range up to 0.10 mg/dscm, but the majority are generally less than 0.050 mg/dscm.
