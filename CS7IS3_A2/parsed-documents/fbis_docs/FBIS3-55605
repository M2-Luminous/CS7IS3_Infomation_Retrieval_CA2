They note that attempts to secure credits from the governments of Latvia and Russia to build settlements in the Pskov region where construction sites have already been provided for repatriates have been deadlocked. They tell Clinton that they would appreciate assistance from American businessmen to build a construction materials enterprise, a creamery and a meat packing plant in the area. "We do not want to be a blind weapon in the hands of nationalists like Zhirinovskiy and his party, playing skillfully on our feelings," the message says. As the Association's Chairman Vyacheslav Tikhomirov has reported to INTERFAX, about 5000 people are ready to leave Latvia for Russia. According to the results of a poll made available earlier in the week to Max van der Stoel, the CSCE high commissionaire for ethnic minorities who visited Latvia last week, 160,000 people want to go to Russia and 190,000 to western countries from Latvia.
