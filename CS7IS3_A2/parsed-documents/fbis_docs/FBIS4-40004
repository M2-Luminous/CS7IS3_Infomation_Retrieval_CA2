This idea is set forth in Kravchuk's election program, entitled "Through Civic Accord to a Stronger State and Faster Reforms." Observers believe that the recognition of Russian as Ukraine's second official language will win him additional votes in the predominantly Russian eastern and south-eastern regions. If elected, Kravchuk will work for the adoption of a new constitution. He favors a presidential-parliamentary form of government which, he says, excludes the monopolization of power by one of the authoritative branches. Kravchuk supports the concept of unitary state with a well-developed network of local governments and broad economic independence of the regions. He also favors a legal settlement of relations with Crimea. He comes out for the development of the CIS, for a more intensive economic integration of the CIS countries and for equitable relations with the neighbors, including Russia. Kravchuk attaches great importance to a radical improvement of the investment climate and will make efforts to ensure that Ukrainian and foreign entrepreneurs be equally interested in making investments to the Ukrainian industry. He is planning to accelerate the monetary reform and to introduce the internally convertible "hryvna." He favors the idea of lowering the bank rates, separating the finances of industrial enterprises from the state budget, and accelerating privatization under state control.
