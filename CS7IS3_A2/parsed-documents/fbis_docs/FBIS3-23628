There is every reason to assert today that we have chosen the directions of military development correctly. The basic laws on military issues have already been adopted, the Military Doctrine has been approved, and the conceptual development of two interconnected state programs is underway--the building and development of the armed forces, and the development of weaponry and military hardware. The efforts of the leadership personnel of the armed forces of Ukraine and the work of our military intellectuals facing the knot of problematical tasks pertaining to military organizational development are directed namely at that. The scientific development of the force composition of the armed forces within the limits of the size stipulated for us, and the organizational structure of command and control elements, large formations and units with the aim of the most efficient utilization of the weapons systems and military hardware, firepower and striking power of the troops (forces) has gained particular urgency. Questions of equipping the armed forces of Ukraine with advanced weapons systems and military hardware and reducing the variety of logistical mat√©riel have also not escaped the attention of military scholars and specialists. Keeping in mind the systematic restructuring of the economy of Ukraine that is underway, they are not failing to pay attention to questions of the structural convergence of the military-industrial complex and the armed forces. Paramount attention is being devoted therein to the use of our world-class achievements in the realm of missile and space technology, which will make it possible in the future not only to equip the armed forces of Ukraine with all types of modern missile hardware, but also for our state to take part in international space programs in the interests of the national economy and science. We can thus state with confidence that Ukraine can and will be a missile and space power. The search for solutions continues with regard to the problems of the Black Sea Fleet. We feel that the first and main task that must be resolved pertaining to this problem, and on which the success of all further work depends, is a complete verification of all of the property and military hardware of the Black Sea Fleet on hand, both on water and on land, as well as the assurance of regulation law and order in Sevastopol and the Crimea as a whole. The building of our own fleet for Ukraine is continuing at the same time. The small ASW ship Lutsk, whose crew is today continuing their teamwork, has completed sea trials and has been commissioned in the force composition of the Navy of Ukraine. Tasks pertaining to raising the combat readiness of the elements for technical and rear support of the troops (forces), at the same time, have not lost their significance as well. A constant search is underway for ways to increase the maneuverability and survivability of support and servicing units. A search is underway for sources of extrabudgetary financing for the measures being carried out in the armed forces. One problem in military organizational development was bringing the system of training and indoctrination of the military cadres into conformity with the considerations of the requirements of troop practices, the views of the nature and methods of waging modern possible wars, operations and battles. The Military Collegium of the Ministry of Defense met in order to solve this important problem, and reviewed problems and issues of military education and the rectification of errors. Concrete measures were instituted in accordance with their decisions with regard to improving the qualitative composition of the leadership elements of field education and the performance of paramount measures aimed at building an efficient system of military education and indoctrination, as well as the organized holding of graduating exams and the distribution of young officers among units and subunits. Work was continued to refine future improvements in the Army and Navy, the draft and the performance of military service by those obligated to serve. Attention has not diminished in this regard toward the activity of the military commissariats, through which all of the personnel of the armed forces pass twice--the first time during their conscription into active military service, and the second when they are discharged into the reserves. The principal interaction of the Army and the civilian population of Ukraine and the reservists takes place through the military commissariats. The reputation of the armed forces is thus formed in the citizenry based on how the military commissariats operate today. A council was held at the Ministry of Defense with the command personnel of the military commissariats, with the aim of further strengthening the local elements of military administration as an important echelon in military organizational development; the council discussed concrete ways of raising the quality of the conscription of the youth and improving mobilization readiness and the official activities of the military commissariats at all levels. The commanders and elements of educational and socio-psychological work and the chiefs at all levels have been conducting a search for ways of improving the socio-psychological climate among the troops, and for more effective forms for the indoctrination of the personnel with a regard for historical and national traditions in the interests of strengthening military discipline and order. Our planned work among the troops and measures to monitor it have shown, at the same time, that such deficiencies as excessive formalism in the organization of combat raining, education and indoctrination of the personnel, an inability to organize service and order under the new conditions and to know the most important things in work continue to exist in the units and subunits. The Military Council of the Air Forces has thus still not defined its place and role in preserving the battleworthiness of aviation and improving morale and the psychological conditions of the servicemen, and has gotten tied up in the resolution of secondary tasks, which has affected the activity and overall status of the military collectives. A certain sluggishness and inconsistency in the performance of work to strengthen military discipline has been typical in general of a certain quantity of larger formations and units; that has kept them from achieving any noticeable improvement, reducing the number of instances of non-regulation relations or absences without leave and eradicating other negative phenomena. The quantity of servicemen who have deserted their units also remains too high. We have taken concrete steps, aside from measures on a disciplinary plane, to improve the situation in the ranks by improving the food and everyday living conditions for all categories of servicemen and making a transition to a new style of dress, along with more active work with regard to improving standard legal documents and the organization of interaction with the bodies of internal affairs, as well as the entry into force of the Temporary Statute of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The state of military discipline and provision of good living conditions in subordinate units and subunits is considered to be one of the principal indicators of the professional ability of commanders and superior officers at all levels. The start of the new training year in the armed forces of Ukraine was devoted by and large to the practical rehearsal of questions of bringing the troops and forces to combat readiness, studying areas of combat application and routes of access to them, and improving engineer measures and the combat interaction of subunits. The Ministry of Defense also conducted several important measures over that brief period. The problem of training individuals for higher military-political leadership to fulfill their constitutional obligations under conditions of crisis and conflict situations has existed for nations at all times. This problem has gained particular urgency during the period of building our young state. Its resolution is complicated by the necessity of training higher personnel in the organizational unity and interaction of all power structures that constitute the military organization of the state. Joint strategic staff exercises were conducted in the interests of solving this problem, new to us, from January 24 through 28 of this year under the leadership of the President of Ukraine and Supreme Commander-in-Chief, with the involvement of the commanders of the Border Troops, National Guard, National Security Service, Minister of Internal Affairs and chief of staff of Civil Defense of Ukraine with the corresponding command and control elements. The fact that the improvement of knowledge and skills of the higher military-political leaders endowed with the functions of ensuring external and internal security was accomplished for the first time against a uniform strategic background and on a uniform plane and intent was a principal feature of the exercises. The results of the training confirmed the necessity of utilizing forms of strategic training, in the process of which questions of the joint resolution or elimination of crisis and conflict situations that affect the vital activity of the state and the administration of its power structures and regions are practiced. The organization of such strategic exercises will require additional scientific refinement in this regard in the interests of further improvements in them, which will provide an opportunity of devising the corresponding nationwide official documents. The great amount of training work that was performed by the Ministry of Defense, along with the other ministries and agencies, with regard to resolving problems connected with the deployment of the elements of the former strategic nuclear forces of the Union in Ukraine, as is well known, have already gained practical realization. The Supreme Soviet approved on February 3 the trilateral declaration of the presidents of Ukraine, the United States and Russia on the removal from our territory of all nuclear weapons. The declaration contains provisions for Ukraine pertaining to guarantees of the military security of Ukraine on the part of the United States, Russia and Great Britain, which voluntarily joined the declaration as a nuclear power and additional guarantor of the security of our state. The declaration also guarantees compensation for Ukraine for the value of the highly enriched uranium that is contained in the nuclear warheads that will be removed from Ukraine to Russia for dismantling. The political gain that was won therein has allowed us to make international activity, including in the military spheres, more active. Relations are being expanded, on a bilateral basis, with regard to military-technical collaboration among the military agencies of the CIS nations. Working meetings have been held over this brief period by delegations of Ukraine with delegations from Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. A military delegation headed by the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, over the brief period of February 8-9, made a friendly official visit to the Hungarian Republic, where they were received by prominent state and military figures and held negotiations on the further development of fraternal relations and mutually advantageous military-technical collaboration on a broad circle of issues. We will now have two battalions in Yugoslavia, each of which will have three special companies, one combat-engineer company and rear and medical support companies, owing to the fact that the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine adopted a resolution on 19 November 1993 to increase the size of the Ukrainian contingent in the peacekeeping forces there to 1,220 people. This decision was made by request of the UN Security Council. Work was performed over January-February of this year pertaining to manpower acquisition for the first battalion, training of the rotation personnel and its dispatch by aircraft and railroad. We expect that our soldiers will fulfill their peacekeeping duties in a worthy manner. The crisis situation in the economy, and the lack of a military-industrial complex in the country that could structurally meet the needs of the armed forces of Ukraine for weaponry and military hardware, continue to have a negative impact on the logistical status of the troops, and are reflected in the pace of their development. The personnel of the armed forces are utilizing all available opportunities to preserve the battleworthiness of units and formations of the command and control elements under the difficult economic conditions. I would like to emphasize overall that the difficulty of the problems that have arisen cannot diminish our persistence in the organizational development of the armed forces of Ukraine. The fact that the army needs help in other areas in these difficult times, and first of all on questions that pertain to the youth and, in particular, instilling in them a feeling of national pride and readiness to serve in the ranks of the armed forces of their Fatherland, also cannot be concealed. The new state has to have its own army. This is undoubtedly a state matter, a matter for all the people. I thus appeal not only to the leaders of state structures, but also to civil society, to the mothers and fathers of the pre-conscription youth. We must all together with the army, after all, prepare from among our youth the reliable defenders of the independence of Ukraine, prepare them with full responsibility. The results will then be substantial, and the benefits from them will be felt.
