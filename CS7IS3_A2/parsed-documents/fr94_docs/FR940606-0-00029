ACTION: Withdrawal of final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is withdrawing a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for the chemical substance generically described as an aromatic amino ether which was the subject of premanufacture notice (PMN) P&hyph;90&hyph;1840. EPA initially published this SNUR using direct final rulemaking procedures. EPA received critical comments on this rule. Therefore, the Agency is withdrawing this rule, as required under the Expedited SNUR rulemaking process (40 CFR part 721 subpart D). In a separate notice of proposed rulemaking published elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register , EPA is proposing a SNUR for this substance with a 30&hyph;day comment period. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action is effective on June 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51684), EPA issued several direct final SNURs including a SNUR for the substance described generically as aromatic amino ether, PMN P&hyph;90&hyph;1840. As described in 40 CFR 721.160, EPA is withdrawing the rule issued for P&hyph;90&hyph;1840 under direct final rulemaking procedures because the Agency received adverse comments.

The docket control number for the withdrawal is OPPTS&hyph;50612A. For details refer to the proposal published elsewhere in today's issue of the Federal Register . The relevent portions of the original docket for the direct final SNUR are being incorporated under OPPTS&hyph;50612B, which is established for the proposed rule. A public version of the record, without any confidential business information (CBI), is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC), also known as, TSCA Public Docket Office, from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
