As the bills for economic failure have mounted -- the inevitable consequence of high unemployment, slow growth and increased poverty -- so taxes have risen to pay them. Reversing these economic failures will be the priority for a Labour government. No one should be fooled into thinking that tax policy will cease to be an issue at the next election; only next time the options for the electorate will be very different from the bogus choice posed by the Tories in 1992. Voters will not decide on Tory claims on low taxation -- the Tories can never again pretend with any credibility to be a low tax party -- but between fair tax under Labour and unfair tax under the Tories. Most families are paying more of their income in taxes today -- more indirect tax and more income tax -- than they did in l979 under Labour. Taxes are set to rise continually over the next five years to levels higher than under any Labour government. But taxes are not being raised fairly. Far from it. It is time to ask who has done best out of Tory tax policies since 1979, and who has suffered most. The British people deserve to know who will suffer most from the tax increases already announced, and from proposed VAT [value-added tax] extensions in the future. The truth behind the Tory tax deceptions, as I have revealed this week, is that our taxation regime is more unfair than at any other time since the 1930s. It is more unfair than that of any other major competing European economy and becoming more unfair with every day that passes. It is not just the imposition of VAT on fuel which is hitting poorer families harder. The Institute of Fiscal Studies has shown, in a detailed look at the impact of all the implemented and planned tax changes on lower and middle income groups, that poorer households will be paying more in taxes by the time of the next election than they were in 1985, while better off households will be paying less. The poorest 10 per cent will still be 3 pounds a week worse off. The top 10 per cent will be 31.30 pounds a week better off. When the analysis is extended all the way back to 1979, the truth becomes even starker. The British tax system, in theory redistributive, has become -- in the hands of the Tories -- a powerful weapon in a very different struggle: to reinforce inequality, to further enrich very rich people who do not need this help. The 64,000 pound question the Tories must now answer is this: why is it that only those earning 64,000 pounds or more are paying less in tax than they did in 1979? The answer is that the rest of us are paying more -- and nowhere is the new unfairness better demonstrated than at the top of the scale. The top one per cent of earners have done extraordinarily well under the Tories. Thirty per cent of all tax reductions since 1979 -- worth around 75 billion [U.S. trillion] pounds in today's money -- went to them. But, with taxes rising again under the Lamont-Clarke budgets, the share of the top one per cent in the total tax pain amounts to only four per cent of the extra revenue raised. In other words, the unfairness of the 1980s tax bonanza for the one per cent is simply compounded by the 1990s retrenchment. They received a total of 75 billion pounds over 14 years and now they are being asked to give only 600 million pounds of it back. The rest of us are paying more tax than we did. But the highest income earners, even after the budgets of 1992, will still retain 99 per cent of the tax handouts they have gained since 1979. But who are the people benefiting from the extra tax that ordinary people will pay? The top one per cent earn an average of 120,000 pounds. Their average reduction in income tax from 1979 was 35,000 pounds. Now income tax increases will take back 1,000 pounds a year. Other tax increases including VAT will take another 1,000 pounds. The very rich are left on an average 33,000 pounds better off. The rest of us do far less well. There is no justification for this largesse to the already rich when so many are in poverty. The Brown report into tax incentives in the late 1980s found no case for such cuts on the grounds that they encouraged the one per cent or so to work harder. Further incentives were not needed. The evidence is that top rate payers were as likely to spend more time with their golf clubs as they were to work longer hours in response to retaining a larger fraction of their income. They still use tax havens abroad as a means of tax avoidance. Charities did not benefit, and spare cash went on imported luxuries rather than into investment in the economy. Claims made about the economic benefits of tax breaks for the one per cent simply do not stand up. With millions of people in poverty and unemployment, the resources could have been put to better and fairer use. A new approach to tax is now needed. Labour has pledged to build a new trust on tax between people and government. Labour will not promise one thing on tax and deliver the opposite as the Tories have done. I myself promise open disclosure, full consultation and proper accountability in fiscal policy-making which seeks to link what people pay in tax to the services they receive. In this context we are prepared to consider hypothecated taxation. Second, there needs to be -- and under Labour will be -- a fairer distribution of the tax burden. And that means not only rejecting the Tory VAT obsession that has bred unfairness, but judging every measure not just by the economic dynamism it can foster but by the fairness it can achieve. No Labour government would have tolerated the way in which the Tories have punished ordinary people by raising their taxes in order to fund massive tax cuts for very high earners who do not need the benefits. Nor will we in the future.
