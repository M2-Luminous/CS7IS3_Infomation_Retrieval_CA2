Kantor, traveling with W. Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic policy, is scheduled to meet with Hosokawa, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and other key cabinet ministers on Wednesday and Thursday. Bilateral negotiations on automobile trade, government procurement and other issues have been deadlocked over U.S. demands for rules to measure progress in foreign access to Japan's markets. The two countries are scheduled to hold subcabinet-level negotiations on key pending issues in Tokyo on Friday and Saturday. U.S. officials have said Washington hopes that a breakthrough in the framework trade talks will lead to increased U.S. exports to Japan and a significant reduction in Japan's vast trade surplus, which last year topped 120 billion dollars worldwide.
