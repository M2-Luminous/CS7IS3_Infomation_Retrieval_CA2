In a statement distributed here today, Jibril added that the savage massacre, which was perpetrated by the Zionist enemy against a gathering of Palestinian worshipers, is a fruit of the Gaza-Jericho agreement that gave the settler Zionist enemy a short-cut to legitimizing its occupation of Palestinian Arab territories. Jibril said: The determination of our Palestinian Arab people and Arab and Islamic nation will punish those who conceded our sanctities, territories, and history. He emphasized in conclusion that the Palestinian people inside the occupied homeland and in the diaspora will not forgive the killers their deed, and their revenge will be great. The savage massacre will increase our people's and our nation's firmness, determination, and confidence in the inevitable triumph.
