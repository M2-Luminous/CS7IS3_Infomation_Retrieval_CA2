You heard what President al-Asad had to say at the Geneva news conference. Are you satisfied or disappointed? [Sarid] First, I think we have to wait to hear more about what took place at the Clinton-al-Asad summit meeting. What we know so far is what is public knowledge. We all know that President Clinton's emissaries -- Dennis Ross and his colleagues -- will arrive in Jerusalem tonight. We will receive details from them, and sometimes the details are more important than what we hear at a news conference. On the other hand, the initial reports or signals we received from the news conference are encouraging. I think we heard things we have never heard before: First, we heard a Syrian readiness for full peace with Israel, and even more important -- according to the U.S. President's testimony -- al-Asad has made a commitment to normalize relations with Israel. I think that is something we very much wanted to hear, and now we have heard it. [Dan] Did we hear al-Asad's definition of the substance of peace, as we have been waiting to hear? [Sarid] Full peace is a good term. Of course, when full peace is mentioned we still have to see what it means. I assume that in a meeting between two presidents lasting three or four hours they did not make do with such a general term. I believe that underlines even more what I said previously, that we have to hear the details of the meeting and then analyze them. I believe that based on what we heard from the Syrian president, and even more so from the U.S. President, it is obvious that it was not a disappointing meeting. Quite the contrary. I have already mentioned full peace and a commitment to normalization of relations with Israel. There is one sentence, which to me appears very important: Syria regards full peace a strategic option. From that we learn that it is not merely a Syrian tactical move. We must compare that to the situation which existed only two or three years ago. At that time, when Syria referred to strategic considerations, it referred to strategic parity with Israel, which meant another confrontation with Israel. Now the strategic aim is peace. I believe that when we study the two concepts we are witness to the huge distance we have covered in the last two to three years in the geopolitical and geostrategic situation in the Middle East. [Engel] You therefore sound optimistic after hearing what was said in Geneva. [Sarid] I am definitely optimistic. [Segal] Minister Sarid, what does that mean for Israel? The ball is now in your court, you will have to make the difficult decisions. [Sarid] The ball has still not crossed into anybody's court. It is in both the Syrian and Israeli courts. I definitely agree with President Clinton's term that both sides will have to make tough decisions. I called those decisions the most important and difficult decisions any Israeli Government has made since the establishment of the state. I believe that the decisions facing the Syrian regime are no less tough. If we want peace, then both sides will have to make those decisions soon. [Dan] Let us put it all in a very concrete context. When the Israeli and Syrian delegations meet in Washington next week will they begin from a better starting point? [Sarid] I believe so. Since we heard the remarks from the horse's mouth, then I assume that the envoys will act accordingly.
