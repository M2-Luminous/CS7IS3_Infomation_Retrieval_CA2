When multiparty politics was introduced in 1992, only three parties were registered as legal, but there are a number of underground parties. The arrests seem to be linked with an appeal by the four at a meeting in Addis Ababa for the rebel war against the Hassan Gouled government to be intensified. FRUD [Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy], which is fighting the war, is a member of FUOD. With more details on the arrest, Christo Farar telexed this report from Djibouti: The four men were arrested this morning under Article 108 of the Penal Code. The most prominent among them is the chairman of FUOD, Mohamed Ahmed Issa, nicknamed Cheikho. His arrested colleagues are Mahdi Ibrahim Goud, Kamil Ali Mohamad, and Galal Abdourahman Ahmed. The four had just returned from a meeting of the FUOD coalition in Addis Ababa on Wednesday [26 January], attended by all its members including the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy, FRUD, which is fighting a rebel war against the Hassan Gouled government. At the meeting, the men appealed for the continuation and intensification of the armed struggle throughout Djibouti territory in order to, as they put it, overthrow the dictatorship of Hassan Gouled. Delegates responded by signing a declaration threatening to oust the government. According to a statement on Radio Djibouti, the FUOD chairman and his aides were arrested because their comments amounted to an incitement to the continuation of the war. According to a FUOD communique, lawyers and relatives of the detainees have been denied access to the men who are being held by the paramilitary forces of the Gendarmerie Nationale. It is expected they will be brought to the public prosecutor's office tomorrow. President Hassan Gouled Aptidon is currently on a private visit to France.
