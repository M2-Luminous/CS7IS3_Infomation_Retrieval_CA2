The meeting was part of the mission Charles Pasqua delegated to his close collaborator, state advisor Pierre Bordry (see LE MONDE, 14 November, 1993), to reflect on and make proposals concerning internal security issues. - MODERNIZATION--The minister unveiled the broad outlines of his draft orientation and program bill for the national police before a gathering of law and order organizations. His audience included the Independent Federation of Police Trade Unions (FASP, a left-wing organization that represents the majority of noncommissioned officers and police officers); the National Independent Police Federation (FNAP, a moderate association representing most "nonmilitary" police inspectors and superintendents); the Union of Trade Unions for Specific Divisions (USC, the second-ranking, right-wing organization of "police in uniform"); and all the directors of the national police. - MULTIYEAR PLANS--That same morning, the prime minister promised Charles Pasqua that his reform would be funded by a budget package of 8 billion francs [FR] over five years. Charles Pasqua wants his draft orientation and program/appropriations bill for the police to "not only highlight the social role of police officers and bring them closer to the French people, but to lay the foundation of a new, national police organization; change its working conditions; and provide it with the resources it needs in terms of personnel, equipment, and methodology to lay the groundwork for the police force of the 21st century." But the minister's ambitions are actually even grander in scale: the Pasqua plan affects all state or private employees that play a role in France's domestic security. This includes the national police and gendarmerie, customs, prison administration, municipal police, and security or fund-transfer companies. Indeed, although the plan's central focus is the national police, the minister's comprehensive approach aims to clarify the areas over which various players have jurisdiction. However, Pasqua was careful to put off until later detailed discussions of questions that normally stir up passions. The National Police and Gendarmerie The safety of citizens is the exclusive responsibility of the state, the minister asserted; his bill unambiguously confirms this as the sovereign mission of the national police and gendarmery. However, the prickly question of the respective territorial jurisdictions of the latter will be referred to a decree before the Council of State. For the last 50 years, the constabulary supposedly has had jurisdiction over communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants, but the accelerated urbanization of the last few decades has left that principle a bit worse for wear. Customs and Prison Personnel Customs officers have an acknowledged domestic security role to play in specific areas such as the fight against narcotics trafficking, "dirty" money laundering, and even illegal immigration. But the minister is opposed to their demand to become officers of the Criminal Investigation Unit (CIUO). Moreover, says the minister, the prison system will take charge of prisoners as soon as they are turned over to the justice system, thereby freeing police officers from "unnecessary tasks" (escorting and guarding prisoners) that consume police personnel. According to Pasqua, 1,500 penitentiary staff jobs--which fall under the Justice Ministry--will be created over the next three years. To get active police officers out of the station house, the minister also announced that approximately 1,000 administrative and technical personnel a year would be recruited over the next five years. Municipal Police and Security Companies There is no question of the state withdrawing from security, the minister insisted, thus quashing "remedies" proposed by boosters of the municipal police, especially from his own political camp. Municipal police force action will be limited to infractions that fall under local law and to the execution of decisions signed by the mayor. Certain tasks that until now had been performed by French state police, among them lost-and-found, animal impounding, lost identification papers, and proxy votes, will be transfered to the "municipals." A specific law concerning the municipal police will be presented to parliament at a later date, said the minister, who was probably anxious to end the debates raging within the majority, notably concerning Paris. The minister also postponed a separate bill on the status, jurisdiction, and recruitment of private security guard and money-transport companies, which also fall within the scope of the Pasqua bill. Five-Year Modernization Plan To successfully modernize the police, Pasqua extracted assurances from the prime minister that he would have a five-year program plan allocating Fr8 billion. This is less than what the police unions, who expected Pasqua to come up with a package of Fr11 billion over five years, had counted on. But the minister's office compares the Pasqua plan to the military program/appropriations bill, and says it will be adjustable and renewable every five years. A "watchdog committee" to monitor the budget plan will be set up for the Interior Ministry, which, unlike the Defense Ministry, will not have an ad hoc committee in Parliament. The Pasqua plan, which is comparable to the modernization bill launched in 1986 by then-Interior Minister Pierre Joxe, will target real property, vehicles, transmission, data-processing, and more protective gear for the CRS's [riot police]. Police Officer Professional Statute To stem grumbling among police troops, the minister has promised that a recognized "professional statute" will be written into the law. This statute, which partially repeals civil service provisions, will make it possible to jointly negotiate compensation and promotional opportunities--in other words, to escape the ax of the budget and civil service ministries--the FASP happily noted. The minister also mentioned that extra compensation would be awarded to street officers with difficult jobs in certain urban areas. Pasqua cited the anticrime squads, which specialize in "surprise sweeps." The FASP would like to see rescue officers--"a job that is at least as risky"--benefit as well. Discussion of specialized unit issues and of others, notably measures to provide low-cost housing for police, is still open; the minister invited the unions to an upcoming meeting in mid-May. Pasqua noted that his law would be debated during the ordinary session of parliament that has just opened. Finally, when it comes to the well-worn issue of a professional career track, the minister proposed a simplified system organized into three professional corps: a top management corps (superintendents); a command and supervisory corps (inspectors, commanders, and officers); and an enforcement corps (all other police categories, essentially NCOs and police officers). Pasqua's reform is pushing to break down the walls between "civilians" and "police in uniform," whose officers and commanders will be accorded to status of CIUO.
