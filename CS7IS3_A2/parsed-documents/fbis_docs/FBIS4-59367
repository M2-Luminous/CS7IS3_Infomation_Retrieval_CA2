The responsible official at the embassy told KUNA today that the newspaper's report, citing sources at the embassy to the effect that the predominant impression is that the Kuwaiti delegation's visit was coming at an unsuitable time and without being preceded by any coordination measures, was "entirely untrue and unrealistic." The source pointed out that the "intensive program that has been prepared for this visit clearly shows that officials at the U.S. Administration and the Congress welcomed the visit and expressed readiness to meet the delegation. Numerous high-level meetings have been arranged with the leaderships of the Senate and the Congress, in addition to meetings with high-ranking officials in the administration, be it at the White House or the State and Defense Department levels. The diplomatic official at the Embassy of the State of Kuwait in Washington said that the program of the Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation's visit, headed by Assembly Speaker Ahmad 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Sa'dun, includes press and media conferences with the leading U.S. newspapers and media institutions in the capital, Washington. [passage omitted] He concluded his statement by saying that "all these efforts are undoubtedly at variance with the newspaper's report, which regrettably has not contacted the officials at the embassy who are responsible for this visit to verify the truth of the statements that the newspaper published." The source said that "the embassy was not aware that any of its members had made statements to any newspaper or any other quarter that were contradictory to what we have said."
