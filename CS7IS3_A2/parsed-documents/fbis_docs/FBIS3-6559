"Too much impatience won't be good," Fujii said as he arrived in Honolulu for the finance ministers meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Fujii said open financial markets are important for the region but policy-makers should take economic realities into consideration in opening up their markets. "We have to take into account the matter of soundness. We should proceed in a balanced manner," Fujii told reporters on arrival in Honolulu. Fujii said he plans to talk about "the Japanese experience" during the two-day APEC meeting and underscore the importance of cooperation in the regional group. The meeting, which opens with an informal reception Friday evening, is expected to focus on ways to promote economic growth and foster the flow of capital in the Asia-Pacific region. Fujii has a series of separate meetings planned with his APEC counterparts Friday afternoon, including a bilateral session with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Japanese officials said. Fujii is also scheduled to meet with Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli, Australian Finance Minister Ralph Willis and Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Ibrahim Anwar.
