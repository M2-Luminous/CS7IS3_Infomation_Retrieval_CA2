Umanets, chairman, Ukraine State Committee for the Study of the Nuclear Power Industry] [Abstract] In 1992, Ukraine had 14 operating nuclear power plant units with a total installed capacity of 12,818 kW. During 1992, Ukraine's nuclear power plants produced 73,750.6 million kW of electricity, which constituted 29.4 percent of all electric power produced in Ukraine. Because Ukraine's atomic scientists have been able to maintain the necessary ties with Russia since the collapse of the USSR, it is certain that Ukraine's nuclear power industry will be able to develop and become a serious structural component of the country's power grid. It has become entirely clear that the apparent rejection of nuclear power in the West after the Chernobyl accident was either a myth or else the invention of technical and economic policy. It has become quite evident that even those countries possessing the overwhelming majority of natural fossil fuel reserves will not be able to survive without a closed nuclear fuel cycle, and construction of new nuclear power plants has continued throughout the world. Today, the absolute majority of specialists believe that the only way for Ukraine to create an independent nuclear power industry is on the basis of its two domestic energy carriers, i.e., coal and uranium. The following are among the results of policies instituted after the Chernobyl accident: Ukraine is now short a minimum of 12 nuclear power plant units with a capacity of 1 million kW each; attempts to maintain an acceptable level of operation of the country's existing power plant units are being foiled by one obstacle after another, including an inability to pay suppliers and flow of highly trained personnel to Russia because their wages in Ukraine are 3 to 5 times less than those offered in Russia; construction of six VVER-1000 units with a safety level higher than the existing 10 units of the same type remains unfinished; and opportunities to export electricity are being lost along with future markets and dollars that could be used to buy imported equipment or advance scientific-technical progress. The time has come to develop a new nuclear power policy that will guarantee safety. Its main components should be as follows: develop the nuclear power industry based on modern nuclear power plant units meeting modern safety requirements; create a domestic nuclear fuel cycle based on the use of existing uranium deposits; create a national system of scientific-technical maintenance of work in all points of the nuclear fuel cycle from uranium recovery to radwaste burial; increase and strengthen the prestige of workers in the nuclear power industry on both morale and monetary planes; and create a legislative base as quickly as possible. The moratorium on construction of new nuclear power plants on Ukraine territory that was approved on 2 August 1990 has been particularly damaging to Ukraine's nuclear power industry. Of the six nuclear power plant units left unfinished as a result of the moratorium, three can be put on line in 1-1.5 years and three in 5-6 years. These units already meet International Atomic Energy Agency safety standards for existing nuclear power plants and are on a par with the best nuclear power plants now operating abroad. Furthermore, before the six plants are actually put into operation, measures will be take to further improve their operating safety and reliability.
