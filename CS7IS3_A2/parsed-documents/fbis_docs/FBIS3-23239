In a statement to SHIHAN, Malluh said such rumors seek to harm Palestinian-Jordanian relations and to revive the past. Malluh said that tendentious parties are trying to link the bombings to the Palestinian factions in general to cast doubts on Palestinian-Jordanian relations, which are now being established on strong foundations. He said Dr. Habash came to Jordan on 23 February on a private visit and was not searched. He was treated with all the respect befitting a pan-Arab struggler, Malluh added.
