By withholding specific inalienable rights, a country is discredited as being a democracy. The main feature of democracy is that the government always exercises power on behalf of and in the interests of the people." Those statements were made by Foreign Minister Kooijmans in a speech at the University of Lund in Sweden on Thursday [17 March]. As a human rights specialist, Kooijmans took a stance, more clearly than before, against some Asian countries such as Indonesia, where he will be traveling with Prime Minister Lubbers next month. Indonesia is one of those countries that maintains that human rights are not universal. According to them, the rights of the people must be seen against the historical, social, and cultural background of the country or region concerned. According to Kooijmans, this actually means that "human rights are not identical for all." A government could then deny any accusation of torture or ill-treatment of its citizens by saying that people always have been tortured or ill-treated. Also, they could allege that torture is part of the local culture and that it thus should be seen as a national "particularity" which legalizes the "exception" to the rule according to which torture is banned.
