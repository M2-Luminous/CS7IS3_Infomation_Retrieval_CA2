He said in an interview that he had information proving that North Korea had prepared a statement on withdrawal from International Atomic Energy Agency. However, the secretariat of the agency has as yet received no similar official statement. Kozyrev underlined that if North Korea violated the Non- Proliferation Treaty, there would be no other way out but to impose sanctions. Kozyrev pointed out that the sanctions must be imposed gradually and be considered a last resort. Kozyrev spoke in favor of an international conference initiated by Russia so that China, Japan, Korea, Russia, the U.S.A., France, Britain and other members of the UN Security Council could make the issue clear for themselves since North Korea had put forward a number of explanations of its position. Kozyrev emphasized that North Korea must continue to participate in the Non-Proliferation Treaty and observe the conditions put forward by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
