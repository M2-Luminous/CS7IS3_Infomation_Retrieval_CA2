With regard to this incident, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry said today, the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement which, in a well-known manner, shifts responsibility to the Yugoslav side in an attempt to discredit the leadership of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia before the international community, although admitting at the same time that the incident had taken place on Yugoslav territory. According to an agreement between the two governments on measures to prevent and resolve incidents on the Yugoslav-Albanian border, a meeting of a local mixed commission for border incidents has been place. It was established at the meeting that the Albanian citizen concerned had on one other occasion been stopped by the Yugoslav border guards while attempting illegally to cross the state border and had been handed over to the Albanian authorities. The statement by the Albanian Foreign Ministry clearly shows that this is yet another attempt to abuse the tragic incident for an unprovoked attack on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Contrary to all international norms and standards, the government of the Republic of Albania has continued to underestimate the importance of its border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and also with its other neighbors with whom, as it is widely known, it has had serious border problems. Owing to the intentional policy of the Albanian Government, the victims have primarily been its own citizens. The Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to recall that at a recently held session of the main Yugoslav-Albanian commission for border incidents, the Albanian side took over responsibility to carry out more effective border control and prevent all illegal crossings outside the marked border crossings. This was not observed by the Albanian side in the aforementioned case. Therefore it bears responsibility for the consequences. For all these reasons, and also for the fact that Yugoslav bodies securing the border acted in accordance with the law, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs hereby rejects the unfounded accusations contained in the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement. The government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has on a number of occasions expressed a willingness for the normalization and development of relations with the Republic of Albania, and has launched initiatives for meetings and talks between representatives of the governments of the two countries on all issues pertaining to bilateral relations, including its willingness to open new border crossings in order to improve communication between the two countries. This has not been met by the same willingness from the Albanian side. The government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia remains devoted to the principles of good-neighborly policy and peace, and will continue to pursue such a policy.
