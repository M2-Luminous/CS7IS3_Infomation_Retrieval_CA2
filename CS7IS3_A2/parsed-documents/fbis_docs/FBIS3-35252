My brother, His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal; brother struggler Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine; brother leaders of sisterly Jordan; their excellencies the heads of Arab and foreign diplomatic missions: Allow me in the name of the steadfast Yemeni people to lavishly thank my dear brother His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal [applause], who exerted great efforts, along with his government and people and all the good in the Arab homeland, led, too, by my brother struggler Yasir 'Arafat [applause] and many sisterly and friendly states, including the United States of America and the EEC and others in the world, who were concerned about Yemeni unity, which was proclaimed on 22 May 1990 in a peaceful and democratic way. God be praised, we are here in sisterly Jordan to sign the document of pledge and accord drafted by the Political Forces Dialogue Committee of national parties and independent personalities. We -- the leadership, the government, and the people, led by the three coalition parties, the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Socialist Party, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping and the rest of the political forces -- hope that with this signing we will really move on to practical implementation, as stated in the document of pledge and accord. Your majesty, we highly appreciate your hosting of this large gathering of social and political personalities, national figures, and historic leaders, led by brother Field Marshal 'Abdallah al-Sallal, brother 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, brother 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Baydani, and many other national figures and historic Yemeni leaders. Our father, great struggler 'Abd-al-Rahman Bin-Yahya al- Iryani, was supposed to be with us, but he was delayed in Damascus for some reason. We thank you in the name of these forces and in the name of your people and brothers in Yemen for your eagerness to maintain Yemeni unity. God willing, we will not disappoint you or our people in Jordan and the entire good Arab nation, which is concerned about the Yemeni unity. We will measure up to the good opinion of all. We will break with all past pages, in all their forms, tragedies, rivalries, and problems. We make the promise of loyal men that with this document we will move to the stage of pledge, success, and implementation, God willing. From the bottom of my heart and in the name of these leaders, I once again thank you very much. God's peace and blessings be upon you. [applause]
