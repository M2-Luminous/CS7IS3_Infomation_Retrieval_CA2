FR940606-1-00060 FR940606-1-00008 a. Initial Notification. The proposed standards would require owners or operators who are subject to this subpart to submit an initial notification. As outlined in the General Provisions, 40 CFR 63.9, this report serves two basic purposes: (1) Notifies the EPA that an existing facility is subject to the proposed standards and (2) notifies the EPA of the construction of a new facility. 14 A respondent must also report any facility modifications as defined in ยง63.5. This report will establish an early dialogue between the source and the regulatory agency, allowing both to plan for compliance activities. The notice is due no later than 12 months before the final compliance date as specified in the proposed standards. Under the proposed rule, the initial notification is not required from any source that has submitted a permit application under title V of the Act, provided that the permit application has been submitted by the same due dates as for the initial notification and that the state to which the permit application has been submitted has a permit program in place and has received delegation of authority from the EPA. 14 Ibid. As called for by the General Provisions, each owner or operator of an affected source would be required to submit a start-up, shut-down, and malfunction plan. This plan would be submitted with the initial notification. b. Notification of Compliance Status. As adopted through the General Provisions, owners or operators who are subject to this subpart would be required to submit a notification of compliance status. This report contains the information necessary to demonstrate that compliance has been achieved, such as the results of performance tests, Method 24 tests, and design analyses, as well as the methods that will be used for determining continuing compliance as outlined in the General Provisions, 40 CFR 63.9. 15 Another type of information to be included in the notification of compliance status is the specific range of each monitored parameter for each affected source, the rationale for why this range indicates compliance with the emission standard, and whether each source has operated within its designated operating parameters. The report would be due within 150 days after the final compliance date as specified in the General Provisions. 15 Ibid. Although not specified in the proposed rule, a description of information specific to the aerospace industry that should be contained in the initial compliance notification for each of the affected sources was presented earlier in this preamble (see Section II.B.2, Reporting Requirements). The information presented in that section is not necessarily exhaustive. c. Periodic Reports. The EPA is proposing to adopt a standard basis for submitting periodic reports for each of the operations for which standards are being proposed. Semiannual reports would be required whenever an operation was found to be in non-compliance or whenever a monitored parameter exceeded its value. For example, for a primer application operation where averaging is used, a semiannual report would be triggered for any daily period covered by the semiannual report in which the daily primer volume-weighted average organic HAP content limit was exceeded. Semiannual reports would also be required whenever a change occurred at a facility that might affect a source's compliance status or that introduces a new element to the operation that was required to be reported in the notification of compliance status. For example, reformulation of a chemical milling maskant may change the organic HAP content of the maskant. If the HAP content increases, then the owner or operator may have to average different or additional chemical milling maskants together, or add a control device in order to maintain compliance. This change in compliance status would trigger a semiannual report. For operations that did not experience any exceedances or changes, the EPA is proposing that annual reports be submitted to this effect. In addition, annual reports are required where compliance is determined on an annual basis and exceedances of these annual limits occur. The EPA is proposing to adopt the above schedule of reporting because it provides a fair balance between the need to know certain information in a timely fashion and reduces the burden to industry and provides consistency within this regulation. The following paragraphs discuss in more detail the specific types of information to be included in these various periodic reports. The information being requested is that which the EPA believes is necessary in the enforcement of the proposed rule.
