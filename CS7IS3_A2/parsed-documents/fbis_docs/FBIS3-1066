"It means that a substantial proportion of Afrikaner conservatives will pursue the establishment of a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] within legal parameters and, sensibly, seek to make use of the Volks [people] Council to advance their objective." However, the FF's participation in the election is "bad news" for F. W. de Klerk's National Party (NP). "Had the FF stayed out, many CP [Conservative Party] voters might have voted for the NP as the next best bulwark against ANC [African national Congress domination. Similarly, in the absence of the FF, the NP is the most likely beneficiary of IFP voters who defy an Inkatha boycott call. The NP's loss will, however, be South Africa's gain. The more inclusive the election and settlement, the better." BUSINESS DAY Inkatha Leadership Not Searching for Solutions -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 18 March in a page-8 editorial warns that if President de Klerk is working on a new initiative with the IFP which might lead to some kind of breakthrough, "he had better work skillfully, because the signals from Ulundi tell a different story." "The Inkatha leadership is not behaving in a manner suggesting it is searching for solutions and for a way to contest the April elections." It has "sabotaged" the meeting planned for 18 March between Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Nelson Mandela. The speeches at the opening of the kwaZulu legislative assembly on 17 March "were aggressive and threatening, despite the calls for peace. King Goodwill Zwelithini's words were in a similar vein." BUSINESS DAY says it seems Inkatha President Buthelezi "fears allowing the king to be exposed to Mandela's powers of persuasion." Buthelezi invited "all and sundry" to the Zwelithini-Mandela meeting, and "switched the venue from inside the legislative assembly buildings to the grounds outside, so that it would become an Inkatha jamboree of royals, chiefs and subjects, with Mandela uncomfortably at the centre." "Inkatha has made valid objections to the interim constitution, and its obduracy has won concessions. It could still win more through international mediation. But this does not mean it can continue holding the country to ransom." RAPPORT Parties Must Heed Bophuthatswana Warning -- Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans of 13 March says in a page-20 editorial: "In the hurly-burly of events in Bophuthatswana this past week the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] stormed in with a performance which, tragic ending and all, caused much harm not only to themselves, but also to others who do not associate with them but whose cause they claim to serve." "The far-right must give serious thought to this and several other issues; they will realize that the old South Africa is gone for ever." "But the finger of the Bophuthatswana mess also points accusingly at the ANC, its leaders, and its unbridled followers. In Cape Town Major General Bantu Holomisa declared gleefully that Bophuthaswana had received a stiff dose of `Vitamin ANC', and that kwaZulu was next in line. His statement at an election event let the cat out of the bag. Worried South Africans now have reason to expect that the ANC `vitamins' form part of its election plan for the rest of the country." "It is time," warns RAPPORT, "that ANC leaders get it into their heads that South Africa needs no revolution but an orderly transition to a new constitutional dispensation, managed under strict Western democratic standards. But the ANC leadership does not concern itself with the brain drain or the millions of rands fleeing the country. All one hears is the old refrain that whites need nor fear the ANC." "If the AWB is guilty of hot-headed stupidity, the ANC's plundering hordes are just as guilty. Mr. Nelson Mandela is not doing nearly enough to curb his party's lust for power and its arrogance." "If a firm grip is not forthcoming, there will be no escaping the violence of the past few days. Would that all political parties read what the warning finger of Mmabatho has written, and take it to heart."
