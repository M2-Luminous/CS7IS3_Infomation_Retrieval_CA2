In a press conference, Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo and Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri also agreed on a "joint approach" to trade and commodity issues in international forums such as the GATT and the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), apparently to set an example for other ASEAN countries in adopting a unified stand. On political issues, Prasong told reporters that Thailand and the Philippines had agreed to support the move to include Myanmar [Burma] in the Asean Ministers Meeting in July, despite reservations by other member states due to the country's human rights record. Prasong said that as head of the ASEAN Standing Committee, his consultations with other ASEAN leaders on the issue had been "positive." He, however, refused to divulge details of his consultative meetings. During the 1 to 4 March talks of the Philippine-Thailand Joint Commission at the Manila Hotel, both countries agreed to establish business cooperation councils in their capital cities, to facilitate investments and joint ventures.
