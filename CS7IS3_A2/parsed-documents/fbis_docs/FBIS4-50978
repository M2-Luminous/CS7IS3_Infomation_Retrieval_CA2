The proportion was 37 per cent last year, with a foreign trade volume of $195.7 billion versus a GDP of about 3 trillion yuan. (The official exchange rate then was 5.7 yuan to the US dollar.) A conservative estimate puts China's 1994 foreign trade volume at $200 billion, which would be tantamount to 1.74 trillion yuan at the current exchange rate of 8.7 yuan to the dollar. Ji Chongwei, an official with the State Council Development Research Centre, says the country's foreign trade is expected to continue double-digit growth in the remainder of the 1990s, faster than that planned for the national economy. China's foreign trade accounted for only 9.9 percent of GDP in 1978 when the country first opened itself to the outside world. The export volume accounted for about 18 per cent of the country's GDP last year, compared with 10.4 per cent in 1988. "This high ratio is rare among the world's major countries," Ji noted. China's exports saw a heady recovery in the first four months of this year from the corresponding period last year. Experts are predicting that exports are unlikely to be so sluggish again this year because the hectic domestic market has calmed down. A recent report from the State Planning Committee said that more than 90 per cent of the country's commodities supplies balance or even outweigh demand. The report also said that investment in fixed assets -- a key factor affecting inflation -- has been brought under control. The latest statistics indicate that the country's commodity retail sales prices in April grew by 19.5 per cent over the same period last year. This was lower than in March, when the growth rate was 24.5 per cent. A more mild domestic market is generally conducive to export growth. Last year, a hectic market at home, compared with a sluggish international one, drew a lot of resources that should have been exported. Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi says that the adoption of the uniform rate 8.7 yuan to the dollar has also boosted exports. But analysts have expressed concern that a drastic price spiral at home has virtually offset all the benefits brought by the yuan's devaluation. Chinese companies are now facing prohibitive export costs and demands by foreign importers to cut their export prices. The State has made it a top priority to curb spiralling prices this year, but the battle continues. Another problem facing China's exports is that there are only a few kinds of money-spinning items available. The biggest generator of export income, textiles, faces strict import quotas in the United States, the European Union and other importers.
