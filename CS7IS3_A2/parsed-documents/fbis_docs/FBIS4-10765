Montero told journalists the topic was discussed during a meeting he had yesterday with General Barry McCaffrey, commander in chief of the U.S. Southern Command. Montero refused to comment on whether Colombia will permit the installation of U.S. military forces in its territory. "We cannot speculate on that, and I do not know if Colombia will accept it," Montero said. He said, however, the Venezuelan Armed Forces' position is contrary to a foreign military presence in the country. Montero said during his meeting with McCaffrey they discussed relations between both countries' Armed Forces and the drug-trafficking problem. Regarding President Cesar Gaviria's proposal of creating an OAS multilateral military force, he said: "Each country is sovereign, and we are not going to have a regional intervention force; we do not favor creating a multilateral force." Regarding the internal political situation, Montero said: "Venezuela knows it wants peace and to overcome the present economic crisis." He ruled out a possible new military uprising if the government does not overcome the present crisis, contrary to what Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez, head of the 4 February 1992 coup attempt, has said.
