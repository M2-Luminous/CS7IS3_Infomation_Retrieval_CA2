In the 12-month period ending July 1993, there were 171 new cases among women, an increase of 22 percent over the previous year. Among men, 1,408 new cases were recorded, a rise of only 8 percent. The figures do not, however, suggest that an epidemic of heterosexual AIDS is yet under way. Only nine women are recorded as having caught AIDS from a partner in the UK outside the high-risk groups, against ten in the previous 12 months. The great majority of sexually transmitted cases were caught from partners abroad (76) or by drug users sharing needles (32). The total of AIDS cases in the UK since reporting began in 1982 has reached 7,842 (7,264 male and 578 female), of whom 4,893 have died.
