These preconditions, said an IFP statement, were that the party agree to national elections being held on April 26, 27 and 28 and that any agreement on constitutional amendments not be implemented until after the elections. "The IFP has agreed to consider the possibility that the issue of the election date is not to be raised during mediation, but cannot agree under any circumstances to the imposition of this precondition in breach of all previous agreements related to international mediation." Regarding implementation of any agreement on constitutional amendments, the IFP said: "The African National Congress/South African Communist Party alliance and the National Party are now requesting that the IFP agrees on an implementation procedure which would effectively pre-empt and prevent the participationehf the IFP in the election process." Any agreement on constitutional amendments would be "delivered to a constituent assembly after elections, rather than being translated into constitutional amendments prior to elections". "The IFP would not be represented in such a constituent assembly and it would be forced to operate as an extra-parliamentary force," the statement said. It continued: "The IFP stresses the fact that the final purpose of international mediation is to create the basis for a political compromise which will enable the IFP to participate in elections."
