The crowd also booed the joint statement tabled during the meeting when it was read to them and one man, tears streaming down his face, wailed aloud. King Zwelithini, who was met with thunderous applause, calmed the crowd, telling them their patience would be rewarded. He called on his subjects to exercise restraint on their way home. The large crowd was expected to return to King's Park Stadium, from where they would be bused home. Before leaving, the crowd sang a farewell Zulu song to their monarch. Police maintained a strong presence throughout and channelled people to their destinations. Durban's litter-strewn West Street emptied within minutes.
