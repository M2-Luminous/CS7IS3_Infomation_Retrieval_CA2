FR941013-2-00151 FR941013-2-00103 [Docket No. 301&hyph;93] Initiation of Section 302 Investigation and Request for Public Comment: Barriers To Access to the Auto Parts Replacement Market in Japan AGENCY: Office of the United States Trade Representative. ACTION: Notice of initiation of investigation under section 302(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2412(b)(1)(A); request for written comments. SUMMARY: The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has initiated an investigation under section 302(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the Trade Act), with respect to certain acts, polices and practices of the Government of Japan that restrict or deny U.S. auto parts suppliers' access to the auto parts replacement and accessories market (``after-market'') in Japan. USTR invites written comments from the public on the matters being investigated. DATES: This investigation was initiated on October 1, 1994. Written comments from the public are due on or before noon on November 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of the United States Trade Representative, 600 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20506. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Burns, Director, Japan Affairs, (202) 395&hyph;5050, or James Southwick, Assistant General Counsel, (202) 295&hyph;7203. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 302(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Act authorizes the USTR to initiate an investigation under chapter 1 of Title III of the Trade Act (commonly referred to as ``section 301''), with respect to any matter in order to determine whether the matter is actionable under section 301. Matters actionable under section 301 include, inter alia, acts, policies, and practices of a foreign country that are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce. An act, policy or practice is unreasonable if the act, policy or practice, while not necessarily in violation of, or inconsistent with, the international legal rights of the United States, is otherwise unfair or inequitable. Unreasonable acts, policies or practices include, inter alia, denial of fair and equitable market opportunities. On October 1, 1994, USTR determined that an investigation should be initiated to determine whether specific barriers to access to the after-market for auto parts in Japan are unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce. The barriers subject to investigation include Japanese Government regulations such as the so-called ``critical parts'' and ``alteration regulations and the certification system for garages and mechanics. These regulations are vague and very broad in scope. They support and work in combination with market restrictive practices by Japanese auto companies and parts distributors substantially to limit foreign access to the Japanese auto parts after-market, particularly for foreign parts suppliers unable to sell original equipment to Japanese auto manufacturers. U.S. parts suppliers could significantly expand sales to the Japanese after-market if the critical parts and alteration regulations were made clearer and less restrictive. Investigation and Consultations Pursuant to section 303(a) of the Trade Act, the USTR has requested consultations with the Government of Japan concerning the issues under investigation. USTR will seek information and advice from the appropriate representatives provided for under section 135 of the Trade Act in preparing the U.S. presentations for such consultations. Pursuant to section 304 of the Trade Act, the USTR must determine within 12 months after the date on which this investigation was initiated (i.e., on or before October 1, 1995), on the basis of the investigation and the consultations, whether any act, policy, or practice described in section 301 of the Trade Act exists and, if that determination is affirmative, determine what action, if any, to take under section 301 of the Trade Act.
