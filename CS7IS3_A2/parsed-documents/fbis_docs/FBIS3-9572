There are certain signs from which one can assume that both the prime minister and the Czech Government are still a bit restrained in their contacts with the new Slovak Government. Do you think the reason for this might be that they are trying to keep a back door open in case Vladimir Meciar returns? [Moravcik] I was taking part in the European Banking Forum and used this opportunity to meet Prime Minister Klaus, whom I know very well from my previous activity. Our talks can be characterized, mainly on the part of Vaclav Klaus, as a kind of finding out how we [the Slovak Government] think and what this government intends to do in the short period of six months. I think we managed to agree that, in this period of six months, there is enough space to intensify our mutual contacts and that we are confident we are able to solve some still unresolved problems. [Tvarozek] Do you already have any idea how to keep contacts and resolve some of the pressing issues? [Moravcik] I am not going to talk about specific actions, specific proposals, and measures because all of this is in the stage of intensive preparations. I do not wish to jump the gun now and generate some media hullabaloo. [Tvarozek] Despite this, I would like to touch on one specific issue, which is the issue of the common border. It has not been finalized yet, and some points of contention exist. Are you going to change anything in the concept of possible mutual compensation for territories, or have some other options been prepared in this respect? [Moravcik] We are prepared to follow the results achieved at the interior minister level of the two countries. I think a certain basis offering solutions does actually exist here. At the same time, we must make sure, in a very vigorous way, that complete compensation for the territories is implemented. Quite simply, I think it is possible to discuss this issue or this problem so that the interests of our two republics are taken into consideration to the maximum possible, or full extent. [Tvarozek] It is natural that each prime minister or minister brings with him to his new office a circle of his colleagues on whom he can rely. But is there a limit to this? Some ministries are axing people who do not actually hold top jobs. The same can be said about some district councils. Prime Minister, is there not a chance that fears of uncertainty or of some kind of mutual settling of accounts might arise? [Moravcik] It would be very counterproductive to talk about a settling of accounts. I definitely oppose this kind of practice. I think we should follow the policy aimed at adopting a professional and expert approach. We agreed on this, we agreed on this in the government and during the coalition talks. Thus, we have a certain policy, and we wish to steadfastly stick to it. [Tvarozek] In this respect, would it not be a solution if the state secretaries were appointed by the parliament so that their appointments would not be the outcome of coalition talks, but that, as experts, they would form a permanent structure in the ministries and so on? [Moravcik] The state secretaries position must not be regarded as a constant in our constitutional system. They are a composite part of the executive power, and, in fact, they deputize for the minister to a considerable extent. Thus, from this viewpoint, if they were elected by the parliament, this would not be a composite part of the whole constitutional system. [Tvarozek] As early as at the first government meeting, you abolished the decision of the former government and dismissed the regional job center commissioners. What were the reasons that compelled you to do this? [Moravcik] These institutions were not legally justified, and, because we have put off the territorial division of the state until after the elections, they were not justified in material terms, either. [Tvarozek] Is this not a political issue then? [Moravcik] There is a political aspect to this issue because maintaining these offices would have contradicted Slovakia's interests. [Tvarozek] The so-called screening law has been a much discussed issue of late. Although this law is in force, it is not observed everywhere and, from time to time, as happened recently, contradictory findings surface. Prime Minister, do you have any idea what course of action you are going to take? Are you going to observe it and demand that it is strictly adhered to, or are you going to table an amendment to this law? [Moravcik] The screening law is a part of our legal system. This means that the government must respect it. That is one thing. At the present time, a proposal as to whether this law conforms to our Constitution and to our international undertakings has been lodged at the Constitutional Court. We will wait and see what the Constitutional Court verdict is, and then we might make a decision. [Tvarozek] It is reported that teachers are preparing protest actions for 27 March because this is Teachers' Day. Other professional associations voiced their dissatisfaction with social conditions, too. Are you preparing any measures of fundamental importance that would prevent such high escalation of dissatisfaction? [Moravcik] Unfortunately, the state budget does not allow for fundamental measures that would completely eliminate the problem that exists in this ministry or in this sphere. But we definitely want to do something. We have already started discussing this issue with the relevant trade unions. [Tvarozek] The budget can be replenished, above all, by the results of our work or by exports. What is being prepared in this respect? It is precisely at this time, when Defense Minister Pavol Kanis and some specialists are visiting Israel. Do you expect that developments of this kind will result in closer contacts with foreign partners? [Moravcik] We are currently defining our policies or, in other words, the policy statement of the government. It should be a very specific and matter-of-fact document. Written in it will be the basic measures we want to implement. We will make use of our diplomacy and our foreign contacts to gain aid from abroad. [Tvarozek] The government has been in office for one week now. How do you assess its work, and do you have any comments on or objections to the work of any ministries or ministers? [Moravcik] It is a very short time for me to pass any judgment, but, on the basis of the information I have so far, I can unequivocally say that there is a very strong will and enough enthusiasm to enable us to solve all of the problems we have set ourselves to solve. [Tvarozek] The government really consists of three elements, so to speak. The degree of consistency of these three elements will most probably depend on the goals. If we take those six months, for example, is the goal identical? [Moravcik] We are trying to define this identical goal, but we do not want it to be limited by six months. We said to ourselves that we must draft a concept for long-term development and decide which steps we have to take in order to implement this long-term concept over the six months because we are expecting this political grouping to retain an important influence after the elections, as well. [Tvarozek] Do you mean an important influence in the government, in parliament, or an important influence as a strong opposition group? [Moravcik] Well, our aim is to win a majority.
