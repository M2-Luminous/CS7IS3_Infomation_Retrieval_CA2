An SDP committee endorsed a draft policy outline on tax reform that argues the aging society demands a larger role of the consumption tax as a fund source. The draft outline calls for redressing the inequity in the tax system and removing shortcomings in the current 3 percent consumption tax as conditions for endorsing the raise. It noted the importance of creating a tax system with levies on income, assets and consumptions well balanced. In view of the rapidly graying populace, the weight of taxes on assets and consumptions are bound to increase, while the income tax should remain as a principal revenue source, it said. The times require a shift in weight to the consumption tax from the income tax, which places a lopsided burden on workers, it said. Support by the rank-and-file party members to the apparent change in the party's basic stance on the tax issue, however, is far from secured. The first vocal oppositions to the about-face may be voiced by local party executives at their meeting on Friday and Saturday, political sources said. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, mindful of the possible turmoil within the party, downplayed the importance of the draft outline. "We are still in the process of discussing the issue," he told a news conference. "(The policy outline) is only a very first proposal for the discussions. That doesn't mean we support a raise in the consumption tax." A senior SDP policy-maker sounded a bit more supportive to the proposal. "We are not dead set against a consumption tax raise," said SDP Policy Board Chairman Nobuyuki Sekiyama. Sekiyama was speaking at a meeting among senior ruling coalition officials and the Federation of Economic Organizations, the most powerful business lobby. "But there are a heap of things to do, like rectifying the inequality in the tax system before we talk about a raise," he said. The draft outline called for lower consumption tax rates on food and other steps to improve the 5-year-old value-added tax. It also recommended creating a local consumption tax to finance local projects in line with the growing calls for decentralization of power. The SDP's move received a warm welcome from other coalition partners. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who heads the new party Sakigake [Harbinger], said at a news conference it is a "very good news." The SDP, as the largest opposition party, strongly resisted the introduction of the consumption tax when it was instituted in April 1989 under the administration of then Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita of the Liberal Democratic Party. The SDP was also the main force for thwarting Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's attempt in February to introduce a 7 percent "national welfare tax," a new value-added tax to finance proposed income tax cuts. Hosokawa then cited the need to raise funds to prepare for the aging of the society and to offset revenue shortfalls from income tax cuts. The ruling coalition scrapped Hosokawa's new tax proposal and decided to set up a forum within itself which would make a final decision by the end of the current ordinary Diet session on how to fund the 6 trillion yen tax cuts included in the economic stimulus package unveiled in early February. The 150-day Diet session lasts through at least late June.
