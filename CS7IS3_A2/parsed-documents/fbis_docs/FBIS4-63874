Having Swallowed Sovereignty, It Seems the Central Asian Republics Do Not Wish To Set Up a Eurasian Union"] [Text] A meeting between [Kyrgyzstan President] Akayev, [Uzbekistan President] Karimov, and [Kazakhstan President] Nazarbayev at the beginning of May on the shores of Lake Issyk-Kul created much fuss and bother in the CIS, particularly in Russia. Moscow journalists tried to call their colleagues in Bishkek, but the latter had no idea themselves about what was happening in Cholpon-Ata -- the meeting was closed to journalists. Recently a number of Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] politicians have started thinking about the problem of reestablishing the former Union, stipulating that this new union will be quite a different sort of association. Unfortunately there cannot be another kind: It is either one or the other. Either we go back to the old unitary state, and in doing so shed the blood of all those who disagree with this idea. Or we must independently swallow the troubles and savor the joys of our new existence. The prospect of a Eurasian confederative state is still a long way off and will only be realized given very intelligent leaders and very patient peoples. And it must be agreed that this prospect is more of a wish than a possibility. Calls by various Kirghiz parliamentarians, and also by the leaders of the newly fledged parties, to at least begin this process by uniting the Central Asian states therefore sound extremely naive. Even these countries which are so close in ethnocultural and geographical terms have in the space of under three years of independence had enough time to go their separate ways. Let us ask ourselves whether the peoples and rulers of the Central Asian states want to establish a confederation with common borders and supranational organs of government and justice, and let us try to answer this question honestly. The situation is clearest of all in Turkmenia. What the people of this republic think is "a complete and utter mystery." In conditions of totalitarian censorship and the suppression of the slightest political activity, it is impossible to say anything about the expression of the popular will. For the time being the Turkmenbashi [President Niyazov] speaks for the people, and he is unequivocally opposed to uniting with anyone in the solar system. During a recent CSCE seminar a certain person "close to the emperor" let it be known openly that the commanding elite of Turkmenia had made a simple calculation: The money earned by selling off oil and gas would suffice until 2030. It would then be clear whether a market economy should be introduced and whether or not Turkmenia should unite with anyone. Everything is also clear as far as Tajikistan is concerned. Nobody in their right mind would take steps to unite with a state where a civil war is far from over. Clan feuds, the onslaughts of the intransigent opposition, refugees, Afghan infiltration.... Outsiders want to put an impenetrable wall between themselves and all these problems, they are in no mood for unification! Three countries remain: Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, and Uzbekistan. It was the presidents of these three states who attended the get-together at Issyk-Kul. Kazakhstan. Everyone knows that Nursultan Nazarbayev is a convinced supporter of any form of unification with former Union states. But he is more interested -- indeed principally so -- in union with Russia. Such an association would resolve some of Kazakhstan's economic problems. It would take the heat out of the problem of the northern oblasts, where the population is primarily Russian. This is an unbearable burden, despite the shared expenditure on maintaining Baykonur and reprofiling the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, a burden which is pressuring the Kazakhstani president and pushing him toward integration. However, Russia (or its present government, to be more precise) is not desperate to unite with Kazakhstan or with Central Asia as a whole. We will not dwell on Russia's reasons, but the Kazakhstani population is by no means entirely on its leader's side. The ruling elite has already had time to savor the sweet taste of independence, and is not keen to see the status quo changed just like that. Uzbekistan. Of all Kirghizia's closest neighbors, this is the most complex partner Karimov undoubtedly dreams of leading the region. He is extremely irritated both by the popularity of the pragmatic Nazarbayev and by the favors being shown by the West to Askar Akayev, "pupil No. 1" in the school of democracy; Karimov currently realizes that there is nothing he can do to oppose the strength and prestige enjoyed by the Kazakhstani leader, whereas he is perfectly well aware of Kirghizia's weak points: The Uzbek population in the south of the republic, which sets its watches to Tashkent time, and Kirghizia's dependence on deliveries of Uzbek energy sources. Like the wise politician he is, the Uzbek president is skillfully playing his trump cards in his contacts with Kirghizia, managing without too much difficulty to secure its silence and submission. But fear is not a basis for possible unification. So what about Kirghizia? Does it want a union of Central Asian states? Kirghizia needs transparent borders, freedom of trade, a common economic area, and stability. And no more. It is frightening even to think about the establishment of common supranational structures in the elective, executive, and judicial branches.
