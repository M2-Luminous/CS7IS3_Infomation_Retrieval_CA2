These measures will be implemented in the following directions: --prevention of sexual and blood transmission of AIDS; --diagnosis, treatment and screening; --legal and social safeguards; --refinement of epidemiological oversight system; --research on the AIDS problem; --furnishing information and personnel personnel. Prevention of Sexual Transmission of AIDS For the next few years, sexual contact will remain as the principal route for the spread of AIDS. For this reason, it is imperative to establish a system of purposeful information of the public about the AIDS problem and increasing danger of acquiring this infection, and providing to the public available means of preventing sexual transmission of this infection. The information must be understandable for different age and social groups. There are plans for: organization of topical radio and television transmissions, 25 video clips, 5 cinevideo and 5 video films, with organization of their screening in movie houses, translation and demonstration via State, agency and commercial radio and television channels; preparation and large-volume publication, as well as dissemination of educational materials (15 million flyers, 1 million posters and 5 million booklets per year), preparation of 5 general educational programs for sex and moral education for different age groups, their introduction in preschool institutions, general, vocational, secondary specialized and higher educational institutions; enlisting young people, religious and social organizations, leaders and activities in high-risk groups to participate in this work; expansion of the network of anonymous screening and psychological support offices, and organization of such offices in cities with a population of more than 200,000; performance of systematic sociological studies of the AIDS problem. In order to provide a sufficient number of contraceptives at an affordable price, it is planned to expand their manufacture at Russian Federation enterprises and to issue them to specific population groups among those with high risk of infection (drug addicts, individuals living in dormitories, etc.). It is assumed that the intensity of sexual transmission of the virus of immune deficiency will be lowered by 25-30 percent by 1996, as a result of implemented measures. Accordingly, there will be a reduction in cost of treating AIDS patients (in 1989, the cost per patient was 40,000 rubles, and in 1992 prices 500,000 rubles). The principal executors of this section are: --Russian Federation Ministry of Health; --State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight; --Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company; --Russian Federation Ministry of Education; --Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs; --Russian Federation Ministry of Culture; --Russian Federation Committee for Cinematography; --Russian Federation Ministry of the Press and Information; --Russian Federation Ministry of Justice; --Russian Federation Committee for the Chemical and Petrochemical Industry; --Russian Federation Ministry of Economics; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance; --Russian Federation Committee for Tourism. Prevention of AIDS Transmission through Blood The program provides for outfitting pertinent laboratories with equipment and diagnostic test systems, on the basis of the need to make 6 million tests per year, in order to upgrade the system of supplying safe blood, other biological materials and medical immunobiological preparations. In addition, it is planned to exclude by 1995 placental and abortion-related blood as raw material for the production of medical immunobiological preparations and change to use solely of donor blood for this purpose. In view of the danger of potential intramural AIDS infection, there is a set of steps aimed at training medical personnel to ensure sanitary and epidemic-control conditions, expand and update the manufacture of syringes, needles, catheters and blood-transfusion systems that could cause infection of the blood via blood. Due consideration was also given to the fact that supplying medical-preventive [medical and preventive care] institutions with other types of disposable and reusable medical instruments, that come in contact with blood is covered by the State program of the Russian Federation for development of modern medical equipment and increasing production thereof in 1992-1993, and for the period up to 1995, which was approved by Decree No 77 of the government of the Russian Federation, dated 10 February 1992, ``On urgent steps to develop modern medical equipment and increase its production in 1992-1995.'' The program also includes matters of furnishing medical-preventive institutions with sterilization equipment. Fulfillment of the above volume of work would provide a reliable level of safety of donor blood and blood preparations, as well as medical procedures carried out at medical-preventive institutions by 1996. The principal executors of this section are: --Russian Federation Ministry of Health; --State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight; --Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs; --Russian Federation Committee for the Chemical and Petrochemical Industry; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance; --Russian Federation Ministry of Economics. Diagnosis, Treatment and Screening AIDS detection in medical-preventive and sanitary-epidemiological institutions will be carried out with use of screening and corroborative diagnostic preparations, equipment for enzyme immunoassay and polymerase chain reaction (gene amplification method), at the rate of the need for 4 million tests per year when clinically indicated and for screening high-risk groups. It is planned to provide effective agents for the treatment of patients with AIDS and opportunistic infections that are not included in the list of vitally necessary drugs adopted by the decree of the government of the Russian Federation dated 26 December 1991 ``On urgent measures to provide the public and RSFSR health care institutions with drugs in 1992 and to develop the pharmaceutical industry in 1992-1995.'' Treatment of AIDS patients will be administered at the Russian Republic Center for AIDS Prevention and Control in the city of Moscow, and at the clinical infectious-disease hospital in St. Petersburg, where all types of specialized medical care are rendered to them, as well as terminal patient care. Treatment and screening of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients will also be carried out by territorial centers for the prevention and control of AIDS and medical-preventive institutions in the area of their residence. Offices for medicopsychological counseling are being organized in centers for AIDS prevention for individuals with this pathology, their families, as well as those in high-risk groups. Specialized centers are being opened for children who are HIV-positive and have AIDS. It is also planned to set limits on State capital investments for construction and reconstruction of infectious-disease hospitals, centers for AIDS prevention and control, laboratories for AIDS detection and Gossanepidnadzor [State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight] centers. Implementation of these measures will have a social impact by 1996 with respect to this category of individuals, by extending the period of their ability to work and prolonging their lives by 2-3 years. The principal executors of this section are:--Russian Federation Ministry of Health; --State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight; --Russian Federation Ministry of Economics; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance. Legal and Social Safeguards The program provides for preparation of a draft law of the Russian Federation ``On AIDS Prevention,'' which will reflect matters of legal protection of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients, as well as matters of legal and social protection of health care workers exposed to the risk of this infection. There are plans for the following: --legislate steps precluding discrimination against the sick and infected; --payment of State benefits to individuals infected during medical procedures; --free testing, treatment and upkeep of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients in health-care institutions; --free travel of these individuals to and from place of treatment; --priority provision of isolated housing for individuals infectedduring medical manipulations, as well as families with infected children up to 16 years old; --education of children and adolescents undergoing hospital care. There are also provisions for saving jobs for HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients for the duration of their testing and treatment, with the exception of health-care workers involved in their jobs in carrying out parenteral procedures. Job placement is provided for this category of health-care personnel. As a result of implementing these measures, the legal relationships will be regulated between the State, medical institutions, HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients, as well as individual juridical entities, which will provide for social and legal protection of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients, as well as health-care workers and other categories of the public. The principal executors of this section are: --Russian Federation Ministry of Social Protection of the Public --Russian Federation Central Committee of the Health-Care Workers Trade Union;--Russian Federation Ministry of Labor; --Russian Federation Ministry of Justice; --Russian Federation Ministry of Health; --State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight; --Russian Federation Ministry of Economics; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance. Refinement of Epidemiological Oversight System It is planned to elaborate a better system of epidemiological oversight for AIDS, including organization of monitoring of HIV-positive and high-risk groups for this infection, laboratory test findings and dates for such tests, reliable methods of short- and long-term forecasts of development of an epidemic process. There will be continued supply of computer hardware and software to centers for AIDS prevention and centers of the State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight, as well as telecommunication equipment, which will permit establishment of a unified and integrated, automated information-analyzing system on this problem, based on basic computer programs on the federal and regional levels. There will be a revision and improvement of the system of medical certification of the public, which calls for the change from large-volume, epidemiologically and economically unwarranted tests to testing samples of different population categories and retention of the volume of tests for individuals in high-risk and other groups. By 1996, these measures will permit achieving higher effectiveness in detecting sources of infection and pinpointing sites of the disease, with concurrent reduction by 10-15 million tests in volume of screening the public. With one test costing 50 rubles (in 1992 prices), these steps will save 500 million rubles. Epidemiological and mathematical models will be developed to provide high-level forecasting of epidemics and related economic expenses. The principal executors of this section are: --State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight --Russian Academy of Medical Sciences; --Russian Federation Ministry of Health; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance; --Russian Federation Ministry of Economics. Research on the AIDS Problem There is insufficient funding of research on the AIDS problem. This program provides for carrying out research on isolation and identification of viruses of human immune deficiency, investigation of their biological properties, mechanisms of interaction with cells in the body and onset of immunodepression in HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients, refinement and development of new diagnostic methods, optimum treatment programs, search for new compounds and products with specific activity, investigation of epidemiology of AIDS, development of specific prophylactic agents, methods of inactivating the virus in donor material and blood preparations, methods of protecting health-care personnel, investigation of distinctions of the epidemiological process with AIDS in different territories, research aimed at further investigation of symptomatology of HIV infection. Research will be carried out within the framework of the State research program of the Russian Federation, ``National priorities in medicine and health care'' (Section 6 ``AIDS''). Formulation of topics in this direction is done annually on the basis of competition, with expert evaluation of submitted projects. The principal executors of this section are: --Russian Academy of Medical Sciences; --State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight;--Russian Federation Ministry of Health; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance; --Russian Federation Ministry of Economics. Furnishing Information and Personnel Training The social importance of the the AIDS problem makes it necessary to have highly trained personnel to implement organizational, therapeutic, prophylactic and epidemic-control measures and to furnish them with information. In this regard, there are plans to do the following: --add matters of AIDS prevention to the syllabus of secondary general educational, vocational, secondary specialized and higher educational institutions; --train physicians and pedagogues at institutes for advanced training and courses for advancement, and specialists in sociopsychological counseling of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients at the Republic Institute for Advanced Training of Educators and its affiliates; --train leaders for youth organizations and activists in high-risk groups at territorial centers for AIDS prevention; --train researchers and clinical health-care specialists in the leading specialized research institutions of the Russian Federation (50 people per year) and abroad (5 per year). It is also planned to publish relevant scientific and educational literature (monographs, topical surveys, collections, textbooks, guides, etc.) and to subscribe to the principal international scientific periodicals dealing with AIDS. These measures will make it possible to train highly qualified personnel to administer specialized medical care and, at the same time, improve efficiency of the entire system of health care, education and information on this problem. The principal executors of this section are: --State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight; --Russian Federation Ministry of Health; --Russian Academy of Medical Sciences; --Russian Federation Ministry of the Press and Information --Russian Federation Ministry of Economics; --Russian Federation Ministry of Finance. Management and Mechanism of Implementation of the Program The effectiveness of implementation of this program will depend largely on constant and integral evaluation of its progress and subsequent correction (if necessary). For this purpose, there are the following provisions, to: --appoint program administrators and organize coordinating councils on the federal and regional levels; --carry out independent integral evaluation of research and measures, with appropriate correction of the program. The program will be implemented through the existing network of AIDS-prevention institutions and the State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight, on the basis of work plans of executor organizations. There are also plans to develop and implement regional programs with approval of their funding in pertinent State agencies of republics of the Russian Federation, autonomous oblasts, autonomous okrugs, krays, oblasts, cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is planned to implement international collaboration with the World Health Organization, within the framework of the global program for AIDS control, and other international organizations. Funding of this program from the federal budget is provided in an amount of 12.42 billion rubles and $20.85 million, including 6.52 billion rubles and $8.25 million in 1993. Of these amounts, limits of State centralized capital investments funded by the federal budget and investment credit will constitute 4.1 billion rubles for 1993. According to estimates, 96.8 billion rubles, including 32.24 billion for 1993, will be needed to implement measures to provide medical-preventive institutions of the Russian Federation with medical instruments (reusable syringes and needles, disposable catheters), sterilizers and laboratory equipment, protective gear for medical personnel, social and legal protection of HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients. The functions of State contractors are delegated to the State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight and Russian Federation Ministry of Health.
