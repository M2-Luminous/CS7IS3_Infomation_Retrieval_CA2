Yukong Ltd., an affiliate of the Sunkyong Group, recently ran an advertisement in a bulletin published by the Association of Korean Scientists and Technicians in the United States. Yukong expressed its intention to invite specialists in chemical engineering, bio- medicine and the environment. Kumho Co. ran a similar ad in the same bulletin, saying it hoped to attract scientists with doctorate degrees in mechanical engineering, computer engineering and polymer science. Kolon Co. is also seeking several polymer science and chemical engineering experts while Kia Motors Corp. wants experts on the environment and safety devices of automobiles. In an edition of the same bulletin late last year, SKC Co. sought to attract experts in chemical engineering and material science while Cheil Foods and Chemicals Co. wanted researchers in molecular biology and microbiology. "It was unusual for Korean companies to have direct contacts with Korean scientists abroad in the past, but now they want to have direct contacts only after recognizing their names on lists of scientists' association," an official of the Korean Federation of Science and Technology Society said.
