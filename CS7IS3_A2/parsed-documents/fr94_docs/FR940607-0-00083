FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David H.

(These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Single Family Property Disposition program (24 CFR part 291), which disposes of one-to-four family properties acquired by HUD or otherwise held by HUD, includes an initiative by the Department for the lease and sale of properties to governmental entities, tribes, and private nonprofit organizations for use by homeless persons (subpart E of part 291). Under the current regulations, applicants that have been preapproved by HUD are notified of the availability of properties for a 10-day consideration and inspection period before the properties are offered for sale to the general public. (See 24 CFR 291.410(d).) Properties are leased or sold to applicants on a first come-first served basis. No more than 10 percent of the total inventory, as of October 1, may be leased under the program; there is no limitation on the sale of properties. Applicants may purchase properties, at a discount, either through a direct sale or by submitting a competitive bid. Applicants that choose to lease properties may purchase them at any time during the leasehold. Leases are for a one-year term, renewable for up to four additional one-year terms, for $1 a year. Lessees are responsible for all utilities, taxes, and other costs associated with operating the property. Under 24 CFR 291.415(d), lessees are required to establish an escrow account, with HUD as a co-signer, and make monthly deposits to the account in an amount sufficient to reimburse HUD for any taxes on the property.
