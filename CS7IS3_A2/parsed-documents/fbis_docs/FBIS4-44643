The decision to place the aircraft carrier Foch on alert status has interrupted sea testing of the Rafale M01 and M02. Plans had called for catapult launches and decklandings of heavy configuration aircraft in maneuvers similar to those begun at the Lakehurst base in the United States (see AIR & COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No. 1455). A demonstration to Fleet Air Arm personnel of the Rafale's good maintainability was also scheduled. The two prototypes did manage to complete 10 catapult launches and decklandings before the time out was called. The testing reschedule will force program officials to revise the fighter's development timetable. Earlier plans had called for a half-year halt in the M01 prototype's development after completion of sea testing on the Foch at month's end, to comply with the government's decision to delay the Rafale's operational start-of-service date by six months. Barring any new changes brought about by the next military appropriations bill, the Air Force does not expect to take delivery of the first production Rafale (a "B") until late summer of 1997. The Fleet Air Arm will receive a Rafale M in early 1998 and should have a fleet up and running by mid-1999. The government officially proposed putting the brakes on the Rafale program for budget reasons when it presented its draft budget to Parliament. That bill eliminated 2 billion French francs [Fr] in appropriations that had been slated for the program as a whole in 1994. Industrialization and mass production phases have been stretched out, and development work slowed, as a result. Work to research, prepare, and fabricate production tools will be staggered, as will the study and manufacture of the assembly-line test benches needed to industrialize equipment such as flight control systems. The manufacture of production aircraft and associated equipment will also be spread out over a longer period. SNECMA will deliver just one engine in 1996, instead of the eight originally planned, followed by another 11 in 1997. In terms of development work, officials have agreed to delay the flight of the M01 prototype for six months, as soon as the round of sea testing is over. Moreover, the appropriations' cut will make it impossible to conduct all the research and test work to integrate equipment and weapons that had been planned for this year. This directly affects development of the navigation and attack system, including the RBE2. The Rafale A demonstrator, which made its maiden flight in July, 1986, completed its flights last month after effecting a total of 867 test missions. Despite the delay--which is more financially than technically motivated--Rafale has not lost its lead over European rivals. It is still ahead of both the Eurofighter 2000, grounded for fly-by-wire control problems, and Saab's JAS-39 Gripen, which was first flummoxed by similiar bugs in its fly-by-wire control system and is now unable to fly because its RM12 engine lost compressor blades. The four French prototypes are flying, including the last two (B02 and M02), which made their maiden flights in the first half of 1993. The Rafale program made several major strides in 1993, including the completion of three Navy Rafale test rounds (two in the U.S. and one on the Foch aircraft carrier). Essential technical milestones included the firing of Giat Industries 30-mm M791 gun; the first launch of Matra's Magic II self-defense air-to-air missile on 26 March; and the first flight of Thomson-CSF's and Dassault Electronique's RBE2 electron-scanning radar aboard a Rafale B01 on 7 July. In addition, the program's static test cell completed its first phase of endurance tests--involving the equivalent of 10,000 flight hours, 3,000 catapult launches, and 3,000 decklandings--at the Toulouse Aeronautical Test Center [CEAT]. This year the Rafale program will concentrate on continued testing of weapons systems and of the navigation and attack system (NAS). The trials will be conducted on both the Rafale B01 and M01, and on aircraft of the Flight Test Center (see boxed material). The NAS is built around two Sagem Sigma RL 90 gyrolaser inertial units, plus a Dassault Electronique mission computer that employs new technologies such as RISC (reduced instruction set computer) processors and ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) components. To allow for even more precise navigation, the NAS is equipped with a GPS receiver (incorporating a Sextant avionics receiver) for satellite navigation, a laser telemeter, and a Thomson-CSF AHV 17 digital radio-altimeter that can also correlate with the computer data of a digitized terrain. Finally, engineers will continue testing of the RBE2 electron-scanning radar, and begin trials involving SPECTRA electronic countermeasures and Sextant Avionique/Intertechnique's helmet-mounted sight. The latter is a real sight that displays flight and attack symbols to the pilot, enabling him/her to designate targets automatically with a simple motion of the head. Acceptance flights for Thomson-CSF's protected radiocommunications system will also continue. The Saturn (Second Generation Antijam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO) is still compatible with current "Have Quick II" devices, despite its use of very fast frequency-evasion and coding techniques. The same manufacturer is also developing classic V/UHFs, a new Tacan NC 12E, and a new TLS 2000 approach and landing-assistance unit that incorporates ILS/MLS and VOR/DME functions. Weapons will be an important part of test runs. The Rafale's 14 carry mounts (13 for the Navy version) will initially enable it to carry 6 metric tons of external load, a figure that will increase to 8 for the last standards. Five of the mounts are considered "wet"; that is, they can hold additional 1,250 or 2,000 liter tanks. Rafale's weaponry will gradually be put into service in accordance with the fighter's standards. The first, so-called SU0 "air-to-air" standard (user standard 0) involves a mix of Magic II and Mica (electromagnetic version) missiles, plus 1,250 and 2,000 liter tanks in three configurations. The second "SU1" standard features the previous configurations plus five new ones: three "air-to-air" configurations employing infrared Mica missiles instead of Magics (with electromagnetic versions under the fuselage and wing unit as well); and two "air-to-surface" configurations featuring AS 30 L laser-guided missiles (including a laser-designation nacelle) or Apache cruise missiles. The final "SU2" standard involves a new "air-to-air" configuration (interchangeable infrared or electromagnetic Micas) and several "air-to-surface" ones that include an array of classic bombs, laser-guided bombs (LGB), and ASMP nuclear missiles or their successor. Boxed Material: Over 1,560 Flight Hours for the M88 Engines Development of the Rafale engine is proceeding on time and within costs. Everyone involved in the program--collaborating manufacturers, official departments, and user armies--agrees that the motors are performing as expected. To date, nine development and 13 aircraft engines have logged in more than 6,800 hours of operation. The program's 13 "flight-worthy" engines have racked up over 1,560 hours of flight, nearly 500 of them with afterburning. "With two years to go before final qualification, these results show the maturity and availability of the M88," says Jean Mossot, the program's director at SNECMA. Since the 1992 qualification test (the so-called "T" trial) that showed the engine was already performing very close to specifications, several improvements have been made to the M88. The first is the development of an anti-icing (as opposed to de-icing) and corresponding control system on the inlet guide blade of the adjustable, low-pressure compressor. The system automatically regulates an air bleed blade that opens and closes as a function of engine speed and air temperature. Tests on the CEPr (the DGA's powerplant test center in Saclay) icing bench have established its programming law. It is very important that the Rafale have an engine with an adjustable inlet guide blade. By regulating the air intake as a function of engine speed and aircraft incidence, the guide blade boosts pumping margins, enabling the M88 intakes to more easily absorb the enormous air distortions created by Rafale's rapid travel. Another enhancement involved substituting the composite material PMR15 for the titanium used to make the cold duct (that is, the engine's outer envelope). Engine weight dropped 4 kilos, and 50 hours of endurance tests and flight experiments--including an aircraft simulation campaign that involved 50 simulated catapult launches and decklandings--demonstrated that the duct's performance was excellent. Engineers are now thinking about eliminating the large vent line of the intershaft ventilation system, also to trim engine weight and manufacturing costs. The long tube, which runs the entire outside length of the PC channel, would be replaced by a duct running directly into the PC channel. The other improvements underway have to do with afterburning (3-percent increase in efficiency) and control of the engine, which is in final development phases. Redundant full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) optimizes engine regulation without pilot intervention and handles maintenance tasks. Finally, technicians are still running endurance and aging tests to validate life and reliabiilty projections. Scheduled for completion before the qualification that will conclude the M88's development phase (late 1995), the tests will include a sand ingestion trial, a 700-hour endurance test conducted by Techspace Aero, and a 150-hour endurance test in a high-altitude simulator. Moreover, Jean Mossot's team must also devise methods for assessing various engine risks such as compressor stalling and chamber or afterburner shutdown. These are needed to cover the operation of an "extreme" engine, should the mass manufacturing under preparation produce one. Indeed, SNECMA has already received an initial order for eight mass-produced engines, the first of which will be delivered in December 1996. The enginemaker is putting together initial industrialization contracts, readying supplies for long cycles, and conducting its first discussions with suppliers. At the same time, it is drafting a production plan to select SNECMA plants and subcontractors and establish a quality-control scheme based on the new concept of "concurrent engineering." Boxed Material: CEV's Four Flying Test Benches Development of the Rafale and its weapons system is a major activity for the General Weapons Delegation's Flight Test Center (CEV). The program requires a permanent fleet of four flying test benches, a fleet of 10 other utility craft, new playback and flight path analysis devices, and several simulators. It also utilizes dozens of highly-skilled specialists (mechanical, computer, and electronics engineers), who, in just a few hours, can set up a complex rig on an aircraft or fix a programming bug. CEV, which is headed by general engineer Herve Groualle, has spent 20 to 25 percent of its time on the Rafale since testing of the fighter began. The four Rafale prototypes now flying will log in approximately 2,450 missions before development of the fighter and its weapons systems is complete. Over 2,000 of those missions will be test flights, including 190 inspection flights made by official departments and 175 by the two user branches of the armed forces. Prototype test flights are meant to help develop the platform and check its flight qualities (25 percent of flights), navigation and attack system (56 percent of flights), and various mounts and weapons/tank separation (19 percent of flights). Finally, additional flights (800 or so) will be performed to develop the M88-2 engines and the Mica and Apache missiles weapons. Together with the 2,450 test missions, most of which will be flown by Dassault-Aviation test pilots, the CEV will make nearly 5,000 other flights on its own aircraft. Over 2,000 will be aimed at fine tuning weapons system equipment; another 2,800 will be classified as "ancillary" flights. "Decoy" aircraft, for instance, will be set up to check the multitarget capability of the RBE2 radar, and acceptance flights will be made for small pieces of equipment such as the radio, GPS navigation, or digital links. To develop the weapons system that constitutes the bulk of the Rafale program (the RBE2 radar and SPECTRA defense system), CEV has four specially-altered airplanes. Indeed, engineers had to add a Mil-Std 1553 (Rafale standard) bus to the digibus (Mirage 2000 standard) of these aircraft, which consist of three Mystere 20s and a Mirage 2000B each of which averages 80 flights a year. SPECTRA will be developed on the M02 prototype. But before that, the CEV will try it out on a Mystere 20 that will fly in 1994, once the SPECTRA system now on a CEV integration bench in Bretigny is ready. The other equipment, notably the three RBE2 radars, is already flying on two other Mystere 20s and a Mirage 2000B. A new Mirage 2000B, nicknamed "Bob" (a two-seater, optronic bench), is being put into service to test FSO (front sector optronics) components. Its flights compliment those of another Mystere 20 that has been specially equipped to conduct optronics research. All these test flights aim to develop equipment and software. In the case of the radar, for instance, they verify that the sensor operates properly and that signal processing is accurate. The flights also validate such essential functions as air-to-air tracking, telemetry, navigation, and guidance, as well as the identification and memory storage of databases, such as those containing navigational terrain pictures. Finally, CEV has eight other aircraft in service to develop weaponry. They are: one Mystere 20 and two Mirage 2000s to develop Micas, and five others to develop the Apache cruise missile; a Puma (radar resetting); an AlphaJet (TRI 60 engine); a Mystere 20 (radioaltimeter); a Mirage 2000 (engine and fuel); and a 2000N for separation and firing tests. But in addition to aircraft, the Center employs three test facilities in its work. Bretigny houses the flying test benches; Istres features the four Rafales and the simulation benches that are vital to preparing complex trials and "playing back" flights; and Cazaux hosts the weapons tests. All these facilities had to modernize their test rigs and acquire new ones to adapt to the Rafale. Remote sensing is now coded (it used to be possible to pick up aircraft display images on your TV set!), and the aircraft have high-density Schlumberger recorders used by NASA for its shuttles. Likewise, more powerful flight path analysis devices are being installed. One based on differential GPS and a multistate system can monitor the flight paths of several moving objects. Finally, CEV is also renovating its equipment for monitoring radar and infrared signatures. It will be putting into service Dassault Electronique's "Hyper Brahms" system--a more refined version of the current Brahms system for measuring RCS (radar cross section)--as well as the CSEE's and Steria's "Hyper Cerbere" for measuring infrared signature.
