An official with the Ministry of Coal Industry told XINHUA that over the past ten years, a total of four billion U.S. dollars in foreign capital has been used to upgrade China's coal mines. This sum includes Japanese energy loans, World Bank loans, government loans from Sweden, Italy and other countries, and direct foreign investment. The official said the Japanese energy loans, granted by the Japanese Ex-Im Bank, were the principal source of foreign funds China obtained to build mines and import equipment. Three installments of the Japanese loans have already been contracted for the building of coal-production capacity amounting to 38 million tons, he added. China began seeking foreign funds for its coal industry, the country's prominent supplier of energy, in 1982. Acknowledging this sector's long construction period, huge capital demand and low investment return, the state has been managing the use of the foreign loans. However, the ministry has decided to expand the scope of foreign capital use, attracting foreign businessmen to directly invest in the industry by forming joint and cooperative ventures. These ventures will center on more lucrative projects involving the construction of mines, pit-mouth power stations, coal-gasification plants, cement factories and pipelines for coal transportation. The ministry believes that drawing foreign capital directly toward these projects will help to restructure the industry. "with limited capital sources, the state is unable to allocate massive investment in this regard," said Han Ying, vice-minister of coal industry, "so appropriate use of foreign funds is needed." Negotiations are under way for a number of initial projects, including coal-gasification engineering in Henan Province, opencast mines and power plants in Inner Mongolia, pipeline for coal transportation from Shanxi to Shandong, two neighboring provinces in northern China. The import of advanced equipment and technology started even earlier. In the 1970s, more than two hundred sets of fully mechanized mining equipment were introduced from western countries as well as some from Eastern European. This effort was strengthened in the 1980s to equip coal mines with more advanced imported facilities, such as shearers, road-headers, hydraulic supports and high-capacity conveyers. Now the index of mechanized mining in key state-run mines stands at 72 percent with fully-mechanized mining at 44 percent, the official said. He said China plans to introduce more equipment and technology from abroad in the coming years to further upgrade the production level as well as the productivity of the coal industry. China produced 1.14 billion tons of coal last year, ranking first in the world. Estimates show that by 2000, the coal output will reach 1.4 billion tons, providing 69 percent of the country's primary sources of energy. The official said that an international meeting to attract foreign funds is scheduled for autumn this year. "new channels will be opened and more foreign capital used to shore up coal enterprises' capability of financing and promoting the development of the industry," he added.
