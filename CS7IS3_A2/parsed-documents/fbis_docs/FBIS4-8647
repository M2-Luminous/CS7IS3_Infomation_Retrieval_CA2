The interview is presented by our Warsaw correspondent Miroslav Karas. [Begin recording] [Karas] Mr. President, recently you have called several times on Western Europe, and above all on the United States, to be more active and take speedier steps and more courageous decisions. You have also expressed your alarm over the situation in Europe following the fall of communism and the disbanding of the Warsaw Pact. You have described the countries of this part of the continent as a no-man's-land. Will you explain your words in more detail? [Walesa, in Polish fading to Czech translation] Everything I have done and I am doing is being done with a view to greater security in Europe; in one Europe -- not central Europe or eastern Europe or whatever Europe. It is clear that for such a Europe to emerge it is necessary to change its geography. The Warsaw Pact and the CEMA have disappeared and we have not formed anything new. The West has understandably stopped fearing communism and the Warsaw Pact, and is keeping us in a state of uncertainty. As you know, I am not scared by any difficulties and dangers -- I do not fear them if I know them. At present I do not know them. I do not know what can happen -- whether somebody will form a military pact here or whether we will begin to dispute our borders. This is why I found myself in uncertainty and this is the source of my objections to the West. Following the disappearance of the old structures the West has not attempted to change the continent's geography to include us -- I mean the countries which need it -- into the security zone. And this applies also to the economc sphere. The present period is not a period of confrontation, and therefore there is no need for the chain's individual links to be of the same strength. It is possible to create conditions for them and they themselves will take care of gaining the necessary strength. However, this is not the only reason for my objections. When I hear that we are forming the Partnership for Peace, and that one of the partners is to be bigger and that the other is given a chance to keep its nuclear weapons -- I have to say, sorry. For me this is something similar to the Yalta Agreement. With the help of the United States let's build one Partnership for Peace in Europe! Let's include Russia, with its nuclear weapons! And subsequently, let's push America out of Europe! -- and we will thus create the United States of Russia. However, what I want is a United States of Europe and thus observing all this I want to warn and call on all those who bear responsibility to pay attention to the fact that we have found ourselves at a crossroads, and if we make a mistake now it will be my grandchildren who pay for it. I simply do not want to commit any mistake. [end recording]
