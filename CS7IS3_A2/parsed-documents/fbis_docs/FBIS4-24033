However this is the right time to speak out. They should talk so that everyone's position is clear. It is clear that some OAU member countries still behave like colonized people instead of searching for the truth. These are for example countries which agreed to send their troops in the campaign to be led by France. The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] representatives in Brussels gave them the right message: Please find other ways to repay the French debt, not with Rwandan blood. The OAU agreed to sit with the leader of the killers, Theodore Sindikubwabo, the interim president of Rwanda. This has been said and forgotten but the OAU should not add one evil to another. The OAU should choose the right path and openly denounce the French aggression, because the consequences will be many. [passage omitted].
