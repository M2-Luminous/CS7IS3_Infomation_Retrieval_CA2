Bezkorovaynyy. He expresses thanks in it to the bankers for their patriotic attitude toward the problems of building the Ukrainian Fleet. The sailors also provide assurances that the funds sent by the bank will be utilized to build housing for Ukrainian sailors and provide social protections for them. The telegram from the vice-admiral is a reaction to the noble deed of the employees of the Prominvestbank administration, who at the end of last year allocated a hefty sum to one of the military units for the construction of housing and other needs of the sailors.
