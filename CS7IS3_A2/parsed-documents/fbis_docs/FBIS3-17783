"Russia adheres to the principle of dual citizenship, which in recent years has become a reality," the commission's proposals read. "To have it legally fixed, relevant bilateral agreements must be concluded." The commission claims that "dual citizenship doesn't preclude the formation of new states or violate their sovereignty," and emphasizes that the proposed measures "are not aimed at interference in the domestic affairs" of the Baltic states. The Baltic states' legislation, however, does not provide for dual citizenship. According to the commission's proposals, Russia must also strive for the preservation of Russian as "the language of inter-ethnic communication" in the entire information space of the former Soviet Union. The commission said its proposals are due to the fact that "hundreds of thousands of people in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have been deprived of citizenship, which causes infringement of their right to vote and the right to ownership, and even puts in question their right to live in those countries." The commission expressed concern that "disregard of human rights may give rise to social and political conflicts." "In recognizing the newly independent states formed on the basis of former Soviet republics, Russia expected the legislation of those countries to meet international legal standards," the commission stated. The Baltic states' policies stem from a different principle. Having restored their independence after the 50-year occupation, Latvia and Estonia reinstituted also the principle of hereditary citizenship. Lithuania, whose territory underwent considerable changes in the course of World War II, chose the so-called zero option of citizenship, under which all persons residing in the country are eligible for its citizenship.
