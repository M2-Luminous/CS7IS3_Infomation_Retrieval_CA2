Lesson number one in Danish politics: The way to power and influence is through the goodwill of the small center parties. This is how it has always been, how it is now, and apparently how it will be after the coming election. Just ask Poul Schlueter or Poul Nyrup Rasmussen what they would have done without the blessing of the Christian Party, the Radical Liberals, or the Center Democrats. The leaders of the current nonsocialist opposition, Hans Engell (Conservative) and Uffe Ellemann-Jensen (Liberal), appear to have drawn similar conclusions as to the indispensability of the small center parties. Even with a straight Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party coalition on the horizon, the two dominant nonsocialist political figures are in a hurry to invite the Radical Liberals, Christian Party, and Center Democrats to join the coalition after the next election. There are promises of big influence on policy. Why all this? Once the election is over, would it not be simpler for Ellemann-Jensen and Engell to make the central parties pay the price for their governmental romance with Nyrup -- and then conduct pure nonsocialist policy together with the Progress Party? The answer is that the more the Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party coalition evolves from a hypothetical fantasy into an entirely plausible outcome of the next Folketing election, the more Engell and Ellemann-Jensen have had to accept the unvarnished reality: A majority government with the Progress Party has limited potential. Tax policy, employment policy, and social policy are the only areas in which the Conservatives and the Liberals are likely to have sufficient common ground with the Progress Party to be able to patch together a government program. And what of those issues where they and the Progress Party are miles apart? In other words, what will a Liberal-Conservative government do after the election when it comes time to agree on European policy, immigration, legal issues, and military policy? Ellemann and Engell know they can hardly depend upon the Progress Party on these issues. But they also know that even a major victory will not give the Liberals and Conservatives an absolute majority without the Progress Party. And finally, the two leaders are very much aware that the Social Democrats, once they have forfeited their power, will not be easy to deal with. Moreover, the Progress Party -- no matter how presentable or power-hungry the party is -- still has some anarchical elements left in it. No Liberal or Conservative politician today would dare to rely 100 percent upon Pia Kjaersgaard's troops. Ergo: A future Liberal-Conservative government has no choice but to seek support from the center parties. The preparations have begun and can be studied like a textbook case in subtle political maneuvering. On the one hand, the Liberals and the Conservatives are interested in projecting themselves as the purebred nonsocialist alternative to the present government. On the other hand, they must not seem wholly nonsocialist. It is in this light that Engell's relaxation on pension fund investment in Danish industry should be viewed. Ellemann-Jensen has also been busy sowing seeds among the center parties, including the Radical Liberals. The reaction from Party Leader Marianne Jelved was prompt: Thanks, but no thanks. If the outcome is a Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party coalition, the Radical Liberals will step back and let the nonsocialist majority sail on its merry way, Jelved told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in no uncertain terms last Sunday [20 March]. Jelved's rejection should be interpreted largely as a tactical move -- many things look different after an election. After all, the Radical Liberals did take part in an earlier nonsocialist government that was partially built upon the Progress Party. The Radical Liberals will hardly have been endeared by the fact that the invitation was tendered by none other than Ellemann-Jensen. In recent months he has roundly rebuked the Radical Liberals for their alleged betrayal of the voters. This leaves the fact that Ellemann-Jensen and Engell can certainly not count on the Radical Liberals. The question remains whether the situation is any different in the case of the Center Democrats, who also have been courted by the Liberals. The situation here is somewhat different. Everything suggests that the ranks of the Center Democrats will be severely decimated in the upcoming election. This is because the voters, from all indications, are not in the mood to reward the party for its participation in Nyrup Rasmussen's government. In this event, it will be difficult for Mimi Jakobsen to refuse to release her votes to the nonsocialist wing. At the same time, the Center Democrats could turn out to be the deciding factor in determining whether Denmark gets a nonsocialist or a Social Democratic-led government after the next election. That will happen if neither camp achieves an absolute majority. However, the Center Democrats would hardly support a Social Democratic government that had to depend upon Socialist People's Party votes.
