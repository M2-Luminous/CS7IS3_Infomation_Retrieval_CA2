Besides his poor showing in the polls and the ever-increasing popularity of former President Jose Sarney, his rival in the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] primaries, Quercia will now have to defend himself in court. The new problem arose out of an old case, the import of $310 million in electronic equipment from Israel. After studying the case for 16 months, Federal Prosecutor Paulo Sollberger concluded that the former governor had participated in a "fraudulent transaction" that permitted two companies, Trace Company and Sealbrent, to profit from the importation, done "without seeking competitive bids and at excessively high prices -- as much as 20 times more expensive," to the detriment of the state. Sollberger charged Quercia under a well-known article of the Penal Code: Article 171, which defines the crime of swindling. The accusation will now be studied by 27 justices on the Superior Court of Justice, who face no deadline for decision. If the charges are rejected, the case is closed. If not, Quercia will be indicted and tried. He can still run for president, but would have to conduct a bizarre campaign, forced to spend a good part of his time explaining things to the court instead of seeking votes. Also charged are former Quercia Secretaries Jose Machado de Campos Filho (Finance) and Luiz Gonzaga Belluzzo (Science and Technology). Five businessmen are also on the list of the accused. Among them is Arie Halpern, owner of Trace Trade Company. Besides the charge of swindling, Halpern also faces a charge of diversion of foreign exchange. Quercia reacted to the accusation with a typical campaign-trail argument."That's the work of PT [Workers Party] infiltrators," he said. The day before, expecting that the accusation would not be made, Quercia described the same Federal Prosecutor's Office as "impartial" in an announcement published in the newspaper. Dummy Invoices Sollberger's charge, set down in 36 pages, were based on various documents. The main one is the "Technical, Scientific, and Technological Cooperation Protocol" signed in 1988 by Quercia and a witness at his wedding, then-Consul of Israel Tsvi Chazan. As the prosecutor sees it, that was when the plot was hatched. Based on a document he himself had signed, Quercia claimed the backing of an international agreement to do whatever he pleased. Another important document is an official communication sent by the former governor to then-President Jose Sarney. Although sent less than a month after the protocol was signed, the letter already announced the intention to import equipment from Israel, stating that "there was no similar Brazilian product available." Sollberger notes that Quercia's justification "was the same one cited as the reason not to seek international competitive bids" to equip the universities. The prosecutor concluded: "This shows that the governor was directing the state agencies to purchase the equipment offered by Trace." The prosecutor observed that the equipment purchase was completed with surprising rapidity. According to the charge, Sealbrent, which appears as the vendor of the products, exists only on paper. Its headquarters are in Dublin, Ireland, a tax haven, and it was founded with only two pounds sterling of capital. Its owners are the same as those of Trace, the Brazilian firm that brokered the transaction. Sealbrent hastily registered in Israel as a "foreign company." The prosecutor's conclusion is that Sealbrent was set up solely for the transaction with Quercia. As a foreign company, it could easily send money out of Israel. Further evidence are the "dummy" invoices issued by Sealbrent. They are dated 20 March 1989, four months before the company was founded. The case file states that the Trace Company tried to sell the same equipment to then-Governor of Parana Alvaro Dias, who thought it was not a good deal for his state. Finally, Trace sold a training system to Mercedes-Benz of Brazil for $12 million. Similar equipment cost the Sao Paulo government $55 million. Candidate-Defendant Quercia's attorneys have 15 days from the date of the charge in which to present their defense. VEJA consulted two of Sao Paulo's best-known lawyers concerning Sollberger's charges. They think the prosecutor did a good job. "The charge reveals with crystal clarity that there was a swindle," one of them said. Both thought it strange, however, that the prosecutor accused Quercia of swindling rather than another crime that, in their opinion, fit the actions better -- misappropriation of public funds. Misappropriation of public funds is when a government employee (which Quercia was) takes possession or permits others to take possession of public funds, as occurs in cases of overbilling. Swindling, however, requires a specific victim and, according to the lawyers VEJA talked to, Sollberger did not demonstrate this as clearly. Current Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, who at the time was secretary of public safety, has not yet been accused. According to the prosecutor, it was not possible to have an expert examine the equipment Fleury bought for the Sao Paulo police and there are no grounds for accusing him of overbilling, as happened in the case of the universities, an area for which Luiz Gonzaga Belluzzo was responsible. The exclusion of Fleury worked to Quercia's disadvantage. If the governor had also been charged, proceedings could only be initiated with authorization from the Legislative Assembly, where the PMDB has enough allies to block the investigation. With Fleury not involved, the accusation will go directly to the Superior Court for consideration. The court's decision, for which Justice Costa Leite is rapporteur, will not be handed down before the PMDB primary, scheduled for 15 May. And that has created a new problem for the party: the possibility that Quercia will win the primary and be indicted shortly afterward. A movement to cancel the primaries was already under way last week with the idea of postponing the decision until the convention scheduled for the end of the month, by which time the legal status of would-be candidate Quercia may be known. "We must not nominate a candidate-defendant," said Senator Gilberto Miranda (PMDB, Amazonas State).
