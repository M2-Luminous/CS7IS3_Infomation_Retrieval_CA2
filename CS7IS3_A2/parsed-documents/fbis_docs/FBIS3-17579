The famous addiction specialist also considers as perfectly illogical the supposition that Yeltsin acquired an abnormal yearning for alcohol while he was first secretary of the Moscow Gorkom [City Party Committee]. There is no genuine testimony to this effect from his colleagues. Had such testimony existed, it would have been inevitably used by Yeltsin's fierce opponents at the time. Both the Moscow Gorkom and the CPSU Central Committee, let alone the competent organs, were at that time peeping through all possible keyholes, looking for an alcoholic criminal. Our interlocutor went on to offer his explanation of the well-known situations which have engendered a mass of rumors. Of course, he remembers Yeltsin's strange speech and the mask-like expression on his face at the city party conference when he was dismissed from the office of first secretary. In his opinion, Boris Yeltsin, who had been taken there from the TsKB [precise expansion unknown -- possible Central Clinical Hospital], had been pumped full of medicines, possibly narcotics. This may not have been done with malicious intention (as it happened, according to claims by Tsedenbal-Junior, when his own father was dismissed from office), it may have been part of the prescribed course of treatment. Ever since Yeltsin took the path of war against the state-communist machine, and to this very day in fact, the incumbent president of Russia has been, according to the specialist's assertion, in a chronic psychotraumatic state [v khronicheskoy psikhotravmiruyushchey situatsii]. He finds it simply necessary to keep himself up with sundry tranquilizers which, incidentally, is recommended for many people of his age. As regards the Spanish crash [Ispanskaya katastrofa], our interlocutor's opinion differs somewhat from the official version. He believes that Boris Yeltsin suffered not only an injury to his spine but also a cranial-cerebral injury. There is no doubt that he suffers from acute pains, forcing him to take painkillers as well as tranquilizers. "You try and take something, if only a sleeping pill, at night," he added. "The next morning you will probably not feel quite yourself. Something like a hangover."
