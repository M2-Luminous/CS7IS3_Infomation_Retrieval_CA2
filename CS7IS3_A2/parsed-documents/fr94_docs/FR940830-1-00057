A BAF measured in the field; 2. A BAF predicted from a field-measured BSAF; 3. A BAF predicted by multiplying a laboratory measured BCF by the food chain multiplier; and 4. A BAF predicted by multiplying a BCF calculated from the log K ow by the food chain multiplier. 7. Literature Cited Cook, P.M., R.J. Erickson, R.L. Spehar, S.P. Bradbury, and G.T. Ankley. 1993.
