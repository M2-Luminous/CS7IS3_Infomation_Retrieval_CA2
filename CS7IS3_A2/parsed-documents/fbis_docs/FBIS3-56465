Sukhinenko, chairman of the board of the RINAKO investment company: One can only express sincere regret at Yegor Gaydar's decision to leave the government. "Gaydar could and should have fought to the end despite the setback at the elections and the complexity of mutual relations in the government." In the opinion of Sukhinenko, who together with a number of other representatives of private business calls himself a critic of Gaydar's team, in Russia's interests Gaydar should have continued working. Now we shall get a traditional government. The reformers' setback shows that economic problems cannot be resolved from above. A.V. Zakharov, general director of the Moscow currency exchange: It can be said unequivocally that Yegor Gaydar's resignation is destabilizing the currency market even more. In general this market has already reacted to the political instability in Russia: The lack of clarity as to what kind of government their will be and, most importantly, what its actions will be, has largely affected the rise in the dollar exchange rate since the beginning of the year. And on Monday immediately after Gaydar's resignation announcement, the rate changed again by nearly 50 rubles and was 1,402 rubles for one U.S. dollar. Of course it is perhaps very hard to speak in detail right now of any economic program. At any rate until the budget for the current quarter and for the year have been examined, at least preliminarily, in parliament. And in this situation the participants in the currency market link their hopes with specific individuals embodying a particular course. And we know what course Yegor Gaydar embodied and what hopes businessmen linked with him. M.B. Khodorkovskiy, chairman of the "Menatepa" council of directors: I think that right now we should not dramatize the situation in connection with Gaydar's voluntary resignation. The point is that we are faced with the objective need for a small change of economic course caused by the aggravation of the nonpayments problem and the need to implement the structural restructuring of industry. Of course this could cause the intensification of inflation processes and the further decline of the ruble exchange rate but at the same time structural restructuring will become the basis for subsequent financial stabilization, for the removal of social tension in the country. As regards fears that the government is now drastically altering its course, then I can say one thing on this subject: If investments are made sensibly, if money goes on specific, carefully worked through and well controlled programs, then it is absurd to speak of a change of course. If the funds invested are spent on "propping up" all weak and inefficient enterprises, then it will indeed be necessary to sound the alarm. And whoever is appointed to the post of minister of the economy will shed a lot of light on this question.
