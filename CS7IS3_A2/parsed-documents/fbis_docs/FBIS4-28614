During the week, the leading composite stock price index plunged 11.65 points from 930.26 on June 4 to 918.61 on Saturday. The week started with a crash, influenced strongly by the worsening nuclear issue. The index was down 8.54 points on Tuesday from the weekend (Monday being a holiday). The plunge was also due to ebbing player deposits. On the following day, Wednesday, there was a sharp rebound following two straight days of decline. The index jumped 11.30 points over the previous day to close at 933.02 Investors showed optimism as they thought much of the nuclear dispute's impact had already been absorbed. The rise continued on Thursday when the index picked up 2.77 points. Once during the day it soared 7.57 points on rumors that at the Hong kong stock exchange, players preferred Korea-related issues in the expectation of an early resolution to the nuclear question. The surge did not last long, however, as the index plunged on Friday in a wave of selling by wary players. A brake applied by the stock exchange to the concentrated buying of specific issues by institutional investors also contributed to the decline. On Saturday, the index crashed 10.33 points on reports that the International Atomic Energy Agency was adopting sanctions against North Korea. During the week, 144.44 million shares or 28.89 million shares a day changed hands. During the previous week, volume was 175.05 million shares. Institutional investors bought more than they sold in the week. Their buying amounted to 857.8 billion won and selling to 725.3 billion won, representing 27.6 and 23.3 percent, respectively, of the total. Players' deposits gained by 43.7 billion won or 1.4 percent in the week ending June 9, from 3,041.6 billion won on June 2 to 3,085.3 billion won. Market analysts said the market would be favorably affected by the continuing business recovery, the stability of market funds and expected heavy buying by institutional investors. Unfavorable factors facing the market would include the lingering nuclear question, signs of labor unrest and the recent trend toward increases in international raw material prices and monetary interest, the analysts said.
