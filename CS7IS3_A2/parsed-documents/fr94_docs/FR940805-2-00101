FR940805-2-00101 FR940805-2-00056 Specific Review Area Recommendations •Whether two separate policies, one for entering into an agreement and one for evaluation of existing state programs, are needed. The PAG has considered this issue and recommends that a single ``umbrella'' policy covering the NRC and Agreement State Program be issued. The existing policy statements that address entering into an Agreement and the evaluation of State programs will be modified or converted to procedures. •Evaluation of whether a formal transition period should be established during which new Agreement State programs could be phased gradually. The PAG recommendation, which includes a formal transition period for new Agreement State programs, has been incorporated as section IV of the draft Policy Statement. •Reevaluation of the criteria and elements used for adequacy and compatibility reviews so that the less significant items are eliminated and the focus is on those things which must be complied with to provide reasonable assurance of adequate protection of the public health and safety. The new compatibility policy and criteria are being developed. The pilot program under the Integrated Materials Performance Evaluation Program (IMPEP) will consist of gathering information on the common performance indicators in addition to the normal program reviews. Criteria for adequacy are contained in the IMPEP procedures. The PAG will maintain cognizance of these initiatives and serve as an integrative mechanism. •Identification of the information which NRC needs from the Agreement States and establishment of a requirement for the reporting of such information. In addition, why this information is needed and how it benefits health and safety. The PAG review of existing Agreements between the NRC and Agreement States found that the Agreements contain a commitment for the Agreement State and the NRC to use their best efforts to keep each other informed on regulatory changes to assure that the State and Commission programs are coordinated and compatible. Currently, representatives of the Agreement States and NRC staff in AEOD, OSP, and NMSS are evaluating options for the development of a database on events involving Atomic Energy Act-regulated materials. The database is intended to provide Agreement State and NRC staffs with information to assist in the evaluation of regulatory effectiveness, and aid in the prediction of safety trends. The PAG will consider the current initiatives to obtain information on events in conjunction with its examination of the merits of codifying State agreement practices in a new part of the NRC rules and regulations, including the need to codify a requirement for reporting of event data by Agreement States. The PAG will factor in the information derived from these initiatives when it examines the codification issue. •Identification of the minimum administrative-type provisions the NRC will consider necessary in assessing the adequacy and compatibility of Agreement State programs. This covers such things as: hearing opportunities, rulemaking procedures, environmental assessments, the separation of regulatory and promotional responsibilities, investigative capabilities, enforcement policies, criminal sanctions, and other similar provisions. In establishing compatibility criteria, the staff will address these issues. IMPEP is also considering a number of these areas. The PAG will maintain cognizance of these initiatives and serve as an integrative mechanism. •Evaluation of the present practice of placing Agreement State approved devices on the NRC registration list so that they can be used nationwide. OSP, NMSS, and OGC are evaluating the current practice and will provide recommendations to the Commission describing approaches which will result in improved effectiveness and efficiency in sealed source and device reviews.
