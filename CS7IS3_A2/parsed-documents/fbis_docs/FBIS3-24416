Except for Certain Skeptics From the CSCE?"] [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty]--The elections for the new parliament in Kazakhstan were not the most routine news of recent days. On 8 March such press agencies as ASSOCIATED PRESS, REUTERS, and ITAR-TASS greatly distressed women of the world community with the news that "the elections in Kazakhstan did not correspond to international standards of democracy." Men were also distressed. Particularly on the Central Election Commission of Kazakhstan. They were so upset that they lost the power of speech for the three women's days, and this whole time "enemy radio voices" (the enemies are all those who do not flatter!) tarred unimpeded the facade of young Kazakhstan democracy. It is impossible to take what happened seriously. It was foolish to expect in the parliamentary births the daughter of Democracy, not having conceived her in good time (surely the nomenklatura fathers of Kazakhstan understand this?!), and it was just as foolish (on the part of the CSCE observers) heart-rendingly wailing to the world that in Kazakhstan (ah, in Kazakhstan itself!!!), apparently, there is a tight situation when it comes to freedom and fairness. I personally am amazed by something else--the fantastic haste with which Jan Van Hauvelingen's delegation at the news conference on 8 March accused Kazakhstan of "the aims of free and fair elections not being met." The trouble with these Dutch and Americans and the miscellaneous world community is that, despite the imagination of the ladies and gentlemen, they are not given to understand the entire "distinctiveness," "youthfulness," and "individuality" of our democracy. Whence it transpires that what for them is nomenklatura willfulness is for us "the indisputable"--in N. Nazarbayev's expression--"success of young Kazakhstan democracy." What for them is staggering confusion is for us "difficult weather conditions." Earlier spring did not indulge the farmers, now (who could have thought it!) the climate is hampering democratic transformations also. In other words, the misfortunes of some are the blessings of others. The CSCE observers were extremely upset by the fact that Kazakhstan had not in its organization of the elections abided all that much by the Paris Charter. And a polling station of an Alma-Ata district could not even remember this charter when, prior to the counting of the vote, "extra" ballot boxes full of ballots miraculously appeared. In the opinion of the CSCE experts, the Kazakhstan elections were not in the best harmony with the Helsinki Final Act either. And at other polling stations the ballots were printed either only in Kazakh or only in Russian. But if there is a desire to be at one with the world community (which was why observers were summoned to the elections), there had to be some response to the critical passages of the CSCE broadcast to the world. And a response was forthcoming. The Central Election Commission of Kazakhstan called its own news conference and... tore to shreds the conclusion of the observers of the CSCE, and this was done with such assured self-satisfaction, what is more, as though Kazakhstan had accumulated a wealth of experience of life in the channel of international charters and acts. This was an odd news conference. The Central Election Commission pressed invitations on the ambassadors of Iran and Turkey (why not Britain and the United States?), and for some reason or other the presidium contained representatives of the General Procuracy and the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan, the ministers of the press and foreign affairs, and the deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers in charge of the press! Why had I, a journalist, to work in the presence of ambassadors of foreign states and, simultaneously, people from the General Procuracy?! Dissatisfaction with the elections was expressed by "individual" representatives of the CSCE. Why were the opinions of the ambassadors of France and Romania distributed in the cloakroom of the news conference? What, did they not agree with the CSCE in its evaluation of the elections in Kazakhstan? In short, the Kazakhstan Central Election Commission smeared findings of the group of observers of the CSCE on the wall, going so far as to say that they did not have the right to stage their news conference and "should have notified us." What can we say.... The ways of the former party functionaries of assessing themselves as the inspiration behind and organizers of all our victories remain exactly what they used to be. They never allowed and do not now allow anyone, the CSCE included, to cast doubt on their "successes." Yesterday they were foaming at the mouth, defending the sanctity of the CPSU and pushing into parliament milkers, plasterers, and slaughtermen. Today these same people are proud that in the "new" parliament there are one worker and three Jews--and all have higher education. The most distressing thing is that Kazakhstan's first contact with the CSCE ended, through the fault of local functionaries, in a row. A shame. It is time to break ourselves of the habit of pouting and bawling out dissenters. It is time to learn to listen closely to people, from a long way off included, and to thank them for their assistance, even if these people have in some respects artlessly erred.
