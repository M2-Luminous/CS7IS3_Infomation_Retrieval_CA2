Rabin said he did not believe that the government's policy in the political process was leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Our Knesset affairs correspondent Tamar Asalem reports. [Begin recording] [Asalem] Strident tones were heard at today's meeting of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. For the first time, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin presented the agreed upon map of the Gaza Strip, with the main roads clearly marked out, to the committee members. Knesset Member [MK] Beni Begin complained that although he had asked to see the map at an earlier date, his request was been turned down. MK Begin asserted that if Nabil Sha'th could view the map, the committee members should at least have the same right. This is the map that was signed in Cairo, the prime minister explained. Rabin nevertheless said he believed that the Palestinians would still make an attempt to change several details. I do not feel that what we are doing must necessarily lead to a Palestinian state, Rabin said. We are trying to let the Palestinians run their own lives without harming the security of the Israeli settlements. As for Syria, Rabin said that all Israel's attempts to launch either public or secret talks had been rejected. The Syrians must demonstrate their desire and readiness to reach an agreement. [Rabin] Syria's leadership is not doing what is necessary in order to demonstrate its sincere desire for peace to the Israeli public. I do not expect al-Asad to be as daring as the late Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat who visited Jerusalem; however, there are still many ways that the Syrian Government can show its desire for peace. [Asalem] Rabin nevertheless added that he had reason to believe that once an agreement was reached with the Syrians, it would be signed independently of the negotiations with the Palestinians or Jordanians. I will not divulge the reasons for my assessment, Rabin said. Against the background of the talks which are resuming today, the prime minister reviewed developments on the various negotiating tracks. [Rabin] As for Jordan, I believe there are practical issues on which we can make progress with the Jordanians, and I am sure that the fact that we sent water and environmental experts indicates that there are areas in which we can make progress. With Syria we shall wait and see. We can of course exchange views with the Lebanese, but I find it hard to believe that Lebanon will move forward without Syria. [Asalem] The prime minister also addressed the recent spate of terrorist attacks. He reiterated that Israel would continue to wage a ruthless war against the perpetrators of terrorist attacks while continuing to negotiate with those elements that had abandoned terrorism. As for the release of Palestinian prisoners, Rabin said that such a step would be implemented in accordance with yet to be defined categories and would be linked to progress in the negotiations. All previous defense ministers made goodwill gestures on national holidays, Rabin said, noting that he did not remember any holiday when prisoners were not released as a goodwill gesture. [end recording] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 15 February reports that "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said today that if the PLO attempts to conduct an independent foreign policy, he would regard this a violation of the agreement with Israel just as he would if the PLO announced the establishment of a Palestinian state. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Rabin made the remark in an appearance before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. ["Upon emerging from the session, the prime minister said that Syria is not even trying to show the Israeli public that it is interested in peace. According to him, the Israeli public would have considered it a sign of a Syrian desire for peace had Damascus accepted the request of Knesset Member Darawshah to head a delegation of Israeli Arabs who wished to convey their condolences to the Syrian president over the death of his son. ["Our correspondent notes that during the committee session there were sharp verbal exchanges between the Likud members and the prime minister over the affair of the settlements of Dugit and Netzarim."] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 15 February further cites Rabin as telling the Knesset committee that "those wishing to leave Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip and return to live within the boundaries of the State of Israel will not receive any compensation because the government is not interested in encouraging them to leave. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that the prime minister noted that recently, some 110 million shekels had been allocated for defense measures for the Jewish settlements in Judaea and Samaria."]
