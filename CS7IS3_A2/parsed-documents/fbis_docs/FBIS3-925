Major Andy Evans said the event was also intended as an exercise for the paratroopers, who had been in the ground in Mmabatho since the SADF moved in last week. The SADF troops would also assist in clearing up debris from the streets. The SADF will distribute pamphlets in Mmabatho on Wednesday thanking residents for their cooperation and encouraging them to return to their normal activities. On Tuesday an aircraft fitted with loudspeakers flew around the area with the same message. Petrol will be brought into Mmabatho, where fuel stations have been running dry, on a train accompanied by an SADF escort on Tuesday.
