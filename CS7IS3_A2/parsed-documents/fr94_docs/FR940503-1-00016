FR940503-1-00016 FR940503-1-00004 Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;23&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Flight Equipment and Engineering Limited (FEEL) Model 121 series seats that are installed on Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B airplanes. The CAA advises that several operators of Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB SF340B airplanes found fatigue cracking in the vicinity of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses. Cracking in this area may weaken the machined component that attaches the backrest of the seats to the main spars of the airplane and may lead to excessive movement and eventual failure of the backrest on these seats during aft loading. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the backrest of these seats, which could inhibit emergency egress. FEEL has issued Service Bulletin 25&hyph;20&hyph;1287, Revision 3, dated March 1993, that describes procedures for a detailed visual inspection to detect cracking of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses on the inboard section of certain Model 121 series seats; replacement of the inboard section with a section having the same part number, if necessary, and repetitively inspecting; and identification of the newly installed section. FEEL has also issued Service Bulletin 25&hyph;20&hyph;1294, Revision 1, dated May 1993, that describes procedures for repair by replacing the inboard section of certain Model 121 series seats with a newly designed, stronger inboard section, and replacing the front beam with a serviceable beam, if necessary; and identification of the newly installed section. This repair and identification procedure would eliminate the need to inspect the inboard sections repetitively. The CAA classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness Directives 006&hyph;03&hyph;93 and 017&hyph;03&hyph;93 in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. This airplane model is manufactured in Sweden and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a detailed visual inspection to detect cracking of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses on the inboard section of certain Model 121 series seats; replacement of the inboard sections with sections having the same part number and repetitively inspecting, if necessary; and identification of the newly installed section. This proposal would require repair (including the installation of stronger inboard sections) and identification of the stronger inboard sections (accomplishment of the actions specified in FEEL Service Bulletin 25&hyph;20&hyph;1294), which would terminate the requirement to inspect repetitively. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. The FAA estimates that 73 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours (1 work hour per seat to inspect and 1 work hour per seat to replace, with 34 seats per airplane) to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $273,020, or $3,740 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
