Kim also said he was dissatisfied with the way the administration handled the revision of the country schedule of the Uruguay Round world trade pact. "I had made it clear that this administration will not tolerate any illegality and wrongdoing in elections," the President said in a breakfast meeting with the cabinet members. Some people acquainted with past practices may commit wrongdoings, but (this administration's) commitment to clean elections should not be blemished under any circumstances, Kim said. Kim made the tough remarks apparently in reference to the controversies created by his own close associates, including Inchon Mayor Choe Ki-son and South Chungchong Province Gov. Pak Tae-kwon. Choe has already been formally warned by the Central Election Management Committee (CEMC) for distributing umbrellas to Inchon citizens in February. The election watchdog took the action after it concluded Choe, a former lawmaker, had conducted what amounted to campaigning for next year's local elections. The CEMC is also investigating similar alleged illegal campaign activities by Pak, also a former member of the national legislature. Choe allegedly sponsored mountain climbing and overseas trips for South Chungchong Province citizens. Both Choe and Pak were appointed by President Kim, and the opposition Democratic Party has been strongly demanding that Kim fire them. A top Chongwadae [presidential office] official, however, indicated yesterday that President Kim will not take any punitive action against either Choe or Pak. "The President's remarks emphasizing clean elections (at yesterday's meeting with the cabinet) should not be interpreted as meaning that he will take action against the two," said Yi Won- chong, the senior presidential secretary for political affairs. Regarding the dispute over the Uruguay Round country schedule, President Kim urged the cabinet to reveal the truth to the people. "I hardly understand why we should have this kind of a dispute," Kim said. The administration should either seek the people's understanding or make apologies in accordance with the truth, he said. Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang expressed his regrets over both the alleged illegal election campaign cases and the Uruguay Round controversy. Opposition parties and news media have been criticizing the administration on the assumption that the government modified the country schedule in secret, Yi said. "But the Uruguay Round agreement entitles each country to make some changes to the country schedule," he said. The administration did nothing dishonest or immoral because the changes were made in consideration of the interest of farmers, the prime minister said.
