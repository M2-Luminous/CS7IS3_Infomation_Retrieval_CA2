"That is not the way things happen," Vladimir Lukin, head of the Duma International Relations Committee, told your IZVESTIYA correspondent. There is a firm opinion that America won the cold war and that Russia lost and now America has to treat Russia as the vanquished side and dictate its terms. Even though the U.S Administration is trying to act tactfully this does not always come off and does not always succeed, he said. "What price, for example, the present discussion about who should be a minister in Russia and who should not? Just imagine a situation in which official representatives of Moscow began saying that we will not be friends with you if Lloyd Bentsen remains Treasury Secretary and if he is not replaced by Jeffrey Sachs because we think that Sachs is better suited to your interests and your reforms. Of if Warren Christopher remains secretary of state whereas we would like him to be replaced by Gus Hall, for instance. If the United States does not relinquish this tendency of trying to teach us what we should be doing in the government no good will come of it." Answering your correspondent's rejoinder that the United States is stating its terms not for the sake of "friendship" but for assistance and the payment of money which the administration is going to raise from its taxpayers, he remarked ironically: "They are giving us assistance equivalent to half a deputy minister but they are demanding the replacement of a whole government." Can America make a substantial contribution to the success of the Russian reforms? It can, Lukin believes. For that it needs to "make it possible to export to America the little that we can export right now." "Look at what is happening with uranium. During the summit meeting in Moscow we seemed to have concluded an agreement. But the U.S. Commerce Department is putting forward around 20 new conditions and is effectively trying to backtrack on this deal." Lukin is convinced that the best way that the Americans can help to ensure that "we have a more or less decent budget and a more or less decent ruble" is by not creating obstacles to Russian exports. "That is what we need, not talk about who is going to be our finance minister. Remember all that talk: If we have Gaydar we will have reforms, without Gaydar there will virtually be communism and totalitarianism. Gaydar was no more [Gaydara ne stalo] when Chernomyrdin came and the distribution of money did not increase. Then superman Fedorov appeared and the same refrain began again: Fedorov is the reforms, without Fedorov there will be no reforms. Instead of that, Lukin said as though addressing the Americans, do a number of practical things which will make our life easier. But let the sovereign country known as Russia make the choice of whom to appoint and where and how." When asked about the reliability of the persistent rumors about differences of opinion with the Russian foreign minister, Lukin replied by quoting Griboyedov: "I would be glad to serve but I loathe grovelling." He developed this idea in the following way: "I have done the job which the president gave me -- representing Russia -- and I did this as I thought necessary. As to whether anyone finds me convenient or inconvenient, that hardly bothers me." Although Lukin said that he prefers to talk about concrete problems rather than concrete people, the thrust of his criticism leaves no doubt about the active dislike of a number of principles embodied by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. "I am not sure that a diplomat's main task is to be constantly on the move, shaking hands, smiling, and sending telegrams from one country to another about how our leadership is respected in that country," Lukin said, terming this style of work the "ostentatious airport style of diplomacy" and the "legacy of Brezhnevite diplomacy." However, the former diplomat's most serious objections were reserved for the childish disorder of America-worship, which he calls "infantile pro-Americanism, which has been stubbornly practised by a number of our politicians." "The politicians of the era of infantile pro-Americanism were about 50 percent responsible for what happened in the recent elections," Lukin claimed. "I warned that in our country with its lack of political culture and its often black and white view of the world there would sooner or later be a situation marked not by an attitude of enlightenment but of chauvinism. "Today, when a number of our officials are hopping like fleas from Sakharov to Zhirinovskiy and back, all this does not create a sense of the worthiness of our policy. I, fortunately, have not hopped in that manner and I am not going to."
