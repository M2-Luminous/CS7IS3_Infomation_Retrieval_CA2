At one time Mr. Nenad Canak said that there was a danger of the conflict being carried over into Vojvodina if the DZVM [Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians] persisted and continued to seek realization of the concept of three-tier autonomy for Vojvodina Hungarians. This is now being repeated by the president of the Reform Democratic Party of Vojvodina [RDSV], says the leader of the DZVM, Andras Agoston, in commenting on objections to their concept of Hungarian autonomy, which contend that this represents an extreme danger to the stability of this region and could result in a conflict such as we have in Bosnia, as Dr Dragoslav Petrovic warned recently in BORBA. Agoston responds to his "critics": "The essence of the mistake both of them make is that the `Bosnian syndrome' in fact requires that both sides be armed. The Hungarians in Vojvodina are not armed. Accordingly, there can be no conflict, but only atrocities, that is, violence against one collectivity, difficult situations caused by an irresponsible approach of paramilitary units, or certain other forces. There can be no question here of the kind of conflicts that are involved in Bosnia and certain other parts of the former Yugoslavia. We think that the concept we are examining is a model acceptable to Europe which makes it possible to achieve equality of parts of nationalities in a particular region. We are prepared to fight for that, but in a political struggle and in a contest of arguments." [Serences] What do you say in response to the assessments of the RDSV president that the DZVM is actually "serving" the SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia] with its neutral position on certain essential issues, thereby weakening the opposition movement, waiting for revenge? [Agoston] We have always said, and it has been borne out several times, that the opposition is not united and that one cannot speak of it as a coherent force. Aside from that, the DZVM has been presenting its demands to the Parliament and Government of Serbia, seeking three-tier autonomy, and it must be borne in mind that achievement of that concept is not possible with the consent of just one party. What is essential to us -- that is the essence of this democratic demand -- is the support of forces in Parliament, since only in that way can we expect the concept to be realized in practice, can we expect a development in international relations, which will help to make it clear to all the leading political forces in the country that the DZVM concept is actually democratic and pulls all of us out of this crisis. It is with that in mind that we have always addressed Parliament, the government, and the presidents of the state, aware that only a certain kind of political consensus can bring us results. Incidentally, with respect to the democratic fight to change the entire system, we will always participate on the side of those who strive for that, consistent with our political strength. However, we nevertheless think that only the Serbs can adopt democracy for Serbia and Serbs, that is, those large political parties which have sufficient prestige and political legitimacy within that nationality. [Serences] With respect to the DZVM, what is the situation inside the organization? On the eve of the recent election conference in Senta, there was a danger that the DZVM would split. [Agoston] The most important thing is that in Senta we arrived at a democratic decision to support the democratic course pursued up to now by the DZVM, the essence of which is to constantly repeat demands for autonomy and at the same time the desire to enter into dialogue with the bodies of government and political forces which can take us to that goal. We received more than two-thirds of the vote, and this political movement has absolute legitimacy. In addition, and this is at least as important, we managed to get free of problems of a financial nature and to defend ourselves against an attempt to exert political influence on the DZVM from outside, meeting the challenge when financial resources were offered. [Serences] Your recent statement in Budapest, in which you allowed the possibility that perhaps that autonomy might not be achieved and that could then be grounds for a fairly large-scale expulsion of the Hungarians here, evoked considerable response. [Agoston] Our fundamental belief is that autonomy will come, since this is the only realistic solution based on principle. We also can see this from positions taken by the highest representatives in the U.S. Administration. But we are realists, we can also imagine a situation in which recognition of the autonomy of Hungarians simply does not happen. Since we consider autonomy the legal framework for preserving the ethnic identity of Vojvodina Hungarians, we think -- if that should not occur -- that probably a large number of Hungarians would think that there is no point in staying here. Of course there always is that worst-case scenario, the disastrous one: a general conflict, if war flared up even in these parts, and there would be atrocities against Hungarians in Vojvodina. We cannot preclude that possibility, but we are not reckoning on those dangers, we don't think them realistic, and we are aiming our political struggle towards democratic achievement of our objective. [Serences] Was the recent answer from Mr. Lilic, president of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], to your written request for the DZVM to be included in preparation of the new law on minorities the first time any letter of yours received an answer from the top level of government? [Agoston] Yes, the first time. [Serences] And did Mr. Lilic's response result in the actual inclusion of the DZVM in preparation of the law? [Agoston] We were not included in the proceedings. But that does not worry us too much, since the international factor is not looking to see whether such a law exists or not, but is looking specifically at the situation and listening to the legitimate representatives of the minorities. We think that no one can evade us on this issue since we are legitimate representatives of the Hungarians in Vojvodina, nor can any law be adopted without involving us essentially, and that means politically, in its adoption. We are continuing to seek dialogue with the authorities in Serbia and in Yugoslavia, and we believe that only on that basis will there be solutions satisfactory to both sides. [Serences] We hear rumors that you are preparing to leave the country with your family? [Agoston] Such rumors have not reached me, but, no matter, my answer is this: I am staying, and I believe that we will get our autonomy in the foreseeable future and that all these political conflicts will die down, and that we will live beside one another peacefully, and, I hope, contentedly.
