This was stated today by Vitaliy Churkin, Russian Federation deputy foreign minister, after talks between Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Alain Juppe, French foreign minister. Vitaliy Churkin stressed that Russia has not officially raised the question of special status for itself in the event that it joins NATO's Partnership for Peace program. At the moment, consideration is being given to an appropriate way of reflecting a special form of relations between Russia and NATO. The Russian side believes that these relations will be extensive and meaningful. The official name for this program of cooperation also has to be decided. The scope of the interdepartmental consultations on our side goes far beyond anything which the countries of Eastern Europe and the CIS states, which have already joined Partnership for Peace, are prepared to discuss with NATO. Among other things, Russia's nuclear status has to be taken into account, the deputy minister said. Vitaliy Churkin described Pavel Grachev's forthcoming visit to Brussels as unprecedented. The defense minister will meet the 16 ministers of defense of the countries belonging to the North Atlantic Assembly.
