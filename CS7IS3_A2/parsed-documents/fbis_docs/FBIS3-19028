Not only did it take place during a debate on the renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act but it came just hours before MPs voted to set up a select committee on Northern Ireland for the first time in Parliamentary history -- a move bitterly opposed by Nationalists. It also came on the eve of today's Anglo-lrish Conference talks in London between Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish deputy premier. The two men will consider the best way to move forward from the Downing Street Declaration after its effective rejection by Sinn Fein. MP's were speculating that the attack -- the most serious on the British mainland since the Downing Street Declaration -- will increase the pressure on Mr Major to end all efforts to bring Sinn Fein to the negotiating table. One said: "This just boosts the need to turn the screw on the terrorists." However, senior sources said last night that they would not allow the attack to "deflect" them from their search for peace. Last night's vote to establish the select committee, which was passed by 324 to 221 votes, met a key Unionist demand and is seen by them as an important step towards closer ties between Britain and Ulster. While all other departments have a select committee to monitor their work, ministers had resisted establishing one for Northern Ireland, arguing that without Nationalist support it could damage the peace process.
