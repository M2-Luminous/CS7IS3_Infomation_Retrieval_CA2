Kohima, March 11. In a significant political development, six members today withdrew support to the Nagaland People's Council and formed a new political party--the Nagaland Peoples Council Democratic Party, reports PTI. The six MLAs [members of Legislative Assembly]--Mr. P. Enyei, Mr. W. Eyong, Mr. R.T.P. Manlem, Mr. Sedem Khaming, Mr. Chenlom and Mr. K. Imlong--today informed the Speaker, Mr. Neiba Ndang, about the withdrawal of support and formation of the new party. The splinter group of the NPC fulfils the criterion of forming a new party under the anti-defection law as they constitute one-third of the undivided NPC. With the split, NPC's strength in the House of 59 has been reduced to 10. One seat is vacant following the recent demise of a NPC MLA, Shirhiu. Meanwhile, the Nagaland People's Council secretary-general, Mr. Shurhozelie, regretted today's split in the party saying that it had once again ignited instability in Nagaland. In a Press statement issued here, Mr. Shurhozelie, also the deputy leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly, said the split was not surprising as the breakaway NPC group was bargaining with a section of the Congress(I) for quite some time. UNI [United News of India] adds: the NPC (Democratic) Party sources claimed that their party enjoyed support from two more colleagues although they had not signed the letter to the Speaker.
