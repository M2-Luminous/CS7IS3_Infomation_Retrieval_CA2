The program, hosted by Nikolay Svanidze, contains excerpts of interviews with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, and Ukrainian Ambassador to Russia Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy, by unidentified correspondents. Places and dates of the interviews are not given. The program opens with an excerpt from Kravchuk who says that 14 January is New Year's Day according to the ``old calendar.'' Therefore, he wishes the people of Russia and everybody a Happy New Year. Kravchuk says, ``And on the whole, this month, is, let's say, a new beginning because today is the beginning of a new account. Because today's document is the beginning of a new page for Ukraine, for Russia and for the whole world.'' Svanidze then says that in Moscow today the presidents of Russia, the United States, and Ukraine discussed nuclear weapons and Ukraine agreed to withdraw to Russia 176 intercontinental missiles and approximately 1,500 warheads for dismantling. Next follows an excerpt of Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy's interview. He says: ``Ukraine is not backing down. I would call it a trilateral compromise. All three sides made some compromises. I would not say that the biggest compromise was made by Ukraine.'' In a further excerpt of the Kravchuk interview, Kravchuk says: ``To embark upon the path of confrontation or ambition is a bad thing. Most in Ukraine understand this, I know. Unfortunately, there are people who see things differently. Fortunately, such people are in the minority.'' Then Kryzhanovskiy says in his interview, ``The president, in this case, is carrying out, in full and in principle, the will of the people. Moreover, there are even certain, I would say, contradictions between him and the parliament, which wants these weapons to remain on the territory of Ukraine for a certain time, until certain conditions prevail.'' Svanidze says that Kravchuk is in a difficult situation. He has been performing a balancing act for the past two years -- balancing the temptation to be leader of a nuclear state and the impossibility of keeping these ``expensive toys.'' Kryzhanovskiy is then shown saying, ``We are not thinking of servicing of these nuclear weapons. We were counting on them being serviced by Russian specialists alone.'' Next is an excerpt from Kravchuk, who says, ``The nuclear weapons which we inherited from the former Soviet Union could not be used by Ukraine, speaking frankly, as a guarantor of security or as weapons of deterrence, because they were manufactured in Russia, the codes -- in Russia, the buttons -- in Russia. Therefore, that is all an illusion.'' An excerpt from the Kozyrev interview follows. He says, ``Against whom were the nuclear missiles in Ukraine, which were installed by the former Soviet Union, directed? Against the USA and NATO, and they are aimed at the USA and NATO. They are not aimed at Russia. And the missiles which are in America? They used to be aimed at the Soviet Union -- and now in Moscow... [pauses] and incidentally, that bilateral, Russian-American agreement is much more important for us. Why? Because American weapons used to and are still to this day aimed at Moscow. Nuclear weapons, each of which is capable of wiping out in a second what we have here.'' ``Well, the agreement reached on not targeting them, the flight assignment is to be canceled, and that process will be finished in about two month's time. That is what the Presidents of Russia and the United States agreed in Moscow. That is to say, you and I are no longer rabbits. At least, in two month's time we will not be in a situation where any madman may at any moment press that infamous button by accident and a missile will fly according to an assignment set years ago - namely towards us. It will fly, but most likely, into space. Do you understand [word indistinct]. That is a substantial thing. The Ukrainian missiles -- that is, those in Ukraine, are not aimed at us. Therefore, it may be important for the Americans -- the missiles are aimed at them.'' Svanidze, shown sitting on a sofa beside Kozyrev, asks if the missiles can be pointed a new target. Kozyrev replies: ``But it is not that easy to retarget them, and Moscow is the one who has to retarget them because that infamous button for these missiles is in Moscow. But naturally, we will not do that. We will not point these missiles at ourselves.'' Svanidze says that pressure has been brought to bear on Kravchuk from domestic and foreign forces. He was beset by crisis in 1993 and anti-Russian feeling is running high in Ukraine, but compensation is promised Ukraine for giving up its nuclear weapons. Kravchuk is shown saying, ``Taking account of the fact that there will be compensation for the tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, that there will guarantees of national security, financial, economic, technical and guaranteed aid. All of that is in Ukraine's interest.'' Svanidze then says that Ukraine has not managed to step out of Russia's shadow and embark upon independent dialogue with the West, but Kravchuk did what he had to do as president of a country beset by economic problems such as Ukraine's. Kravchuk is again shown. He says, ``It is not that one will be the older and the other the younger, that one is the older brother and one the younger brother, that one is the leader and the other is subordinate. The peoples will be equal. Equal in all their relations, one a bit more, one a bit less.'' A further fragment of Kozyrev's interview follows: ``The episode with Ukraine is the clearing away of Russia's old obstructions. Do you see? Essentially, the meeting on the Ukrainian theme, unfortunately, took place two years later than it should have done and this is the reason for the delay in the process of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine.''
