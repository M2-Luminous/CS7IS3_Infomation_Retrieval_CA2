Is that a surprise? [Popovych] I am surprised. It is further evidence that sociology is not an exact science. [Mathil] Were the Ukrainians not said to be disappointed and apathetic? [Popovych] Disappointed yes, but not apathetic. The Ukrainians seemed to be absent from public life because they did not identify with the existing government. Logically, they went to the polls to express that rejection. There was a surprising resurgence in the last two or three weeks. [Mathil] What was the reason for this resurgence? [Popovych] It is mainly what I call the "Canary Islands phenomenon." Dmytro Poyizd, a vulgar and populist leader, found an audience for his slogans which were very hostile to the whole political class: "We will find all these profiteers and traitors," he said, "even if they hide in the Canaries," a symbol of opulence in his eyes. For some people that was enough. He was elected in the first round. [Mathil] And who will vote in the second round? Do you have any forecast to make for the future Parliament? [Popovych] No. Only 49 deputies were elected in the first round, in other words there are still 802 candidates in the second round. Our electoral Commission was not capable of telling us, 48 hours after the election, who will run against whom in these 401 duels. That being so, my forecast is as imprecise as it is pessimistic. In short, the Parliament will not bring about many changes. Our democracy is very young, the political parties are very weak, and the politicians are not very mature, some are already corrupt. The government has neutralized some of its opponents, in particular by distributing apartments to deputies in the capital's fashionable districts. That area is called "Tsarskoye Selo [as published]," a reference to the residence of the czars near St. Petersburg. Our electoral law is harmful, it has really liquidated the political parties. Honest candidates could not withstand the assault of populist, nationalist, or communist propaganda. [Mathil] So who will govern this country? [Popovych] In general, the same people, those who are called "the government party" in our country. [Mathil] What about the presidency? [Popovych] Exit Leonid Kravchuk. His career is over. Enter Leonid Kuchma. It is he who will be president of Ukraine after the elections on 26 June. [Mathil] What will he do? [Popovych] Nobody knows. Not even him. But it is he, the former boss of "Yuzmash [as published]," the biggest missile factory in the world, and former prime minister who, if he keeps his promises, will perhaps implement a series of reforms, which Kravchuk has been incapable of doing. [Mathil] The West will miss Kravchuk... [Popovych] Yes, he has merits. He did not understand anything about economic affairs, but he created Ukraine's image abroad. He was able to avert the specter of Russian occupation. There are of course problems like the Crimea or the Black Sea fleet, but in short, he has removed the "Serbo-Croat prospect" from Ukraine. [Mathil] Permanently? [Popovych] Nothing is permanent. Russia will try to gain the right to examine all of Ukraine's strategic decisions. Of course, we would like to be closer to Poland, in other words to Europe; we have made various proposals, but, as you know, Warsaw is not very welcoming. There is the shadow of Moscow... [Mathil] Would you be prepared to give up half of the Black Sea fleet? [Popovych] I am prepared to give up the whole fleet. The problem is that that will never end. After the fleet there will be Crimea, then Donetsk, and so forth. Without Ukraine, there is no Russian empire. However, in Moscow people are dreaming more and more of a new empire. [Mathil] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has said that he will request the aid of the Black Sea fleet to achieve his separatist dreams... [Popovych] Meshkov is a dangerous imbecile. In comparison with Meshkov, Zhirinovskiy is a pillar of lucidity. [Mathil] What can the West do? [Popovych] The West does not understand anything about what is happening in our country. It has the Kravchuk complex, like it had the Gorbachev or Yeltsin complex. [Mathil] What does that mean in practice? [Popovych] In practice, our elite is virtually banned from radio and television. Why not help it to break Kravchuk's monopoly over radio and television? And then, we must be guaranteed that specific economic aid will accompany our reforms. If and when there are reforms... [Mathil] Meanwhile? [Popovych] Today, policy toward Ukraine is still only defined in accordance with policy toward Russia. That is beginning to change. Nothing specific, but we can see that the West is thinking... [Mathil] You are so critical of all the others. Do you, the former president of "Rukh,[Ukrainian Popular Movement -- UPM]" have your own political ambitions? [Popovych] Oh, no. I was president because a president was needed, but there are enough amateurs in our political class. [Mathil] You have a very black view of everything... [Popovych] And how are we living here? Do things look bright?
