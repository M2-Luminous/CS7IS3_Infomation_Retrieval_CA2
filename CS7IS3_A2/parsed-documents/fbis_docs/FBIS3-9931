During an interview following a meeting at the Foreign Relations Ministry, the general said that a "mixed" volunteer military service is being studied under which some "would be obliged" to serve. Discua Elvir said he met with the president on Monday to analyze the last proposal that he, as commander in chief, presented on 10 February to establish "constitutional military service." The general said he is waiting for the government's response to this proposal because "the president's political objective is to solve this issue, which has been a problem for the Armed Forces, the government, and the Honduran people. We hope there is a desire to recruit soldiers in a more humane manner." Immediately after the meeting, the commander in chief was asked if military service would remain obligatory. He replied: "We have neither the economic nor cultural capacity for an all-volunteer military service." Discua Elvir said only four nations in the world have volunteer military services. "We want to have a mixed military service in which there are both volunteers and those who will be obligated to serve," he noted. The general added: "We are trying to organize a mixed military service because a volunteer service is very expensive. Even if we reduced the number of personnel to a quarter of its present size, the Armed Forces budget would triple." Discua was then reminded that the Armed Forces is contradicting President Carlos Roberto Reina's campaign promise to have a "volunteer and educational military service." "I am afraid that at that time the president did not have advisers. Sometimes advice is not correct; maybe that was the case. Nevertheless, the president is doing everything possible. He must be given time. He definitely wants to keep his promise, and we -- who must help with ideas -- are cooperating as much as possible so he can find a solution to keep his promise." The general insisted that the new recruitment system will not discriminate and include only the sons of the poor. He explained that other options, such as students serving on weekends, are being studied. We are trying to do this "in an acceptable manner" so those who want to remain in the battalions can choose technical careers or receive special training as forest rangers, mechanics, and so forth. This would also include social services such as painting schools, sweeping streets, and other activities, he noted. Discua Elvir indicated that a plan will be coordinated with Education Minister Zenobia Rodas whereby all officers will help teach illiterate residents living around the battalions -- to be identified by a census -- to read and write.
