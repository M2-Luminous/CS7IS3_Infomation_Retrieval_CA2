Receiving members of the diplomatic corps, accredited to Moldova, in Chisinau on Thursday night for a New Year he mentioned among the country's main problems the unresolved issues on Transdniestria and Gagauzia (southern Moldova), the shortage of goods, growing prices, and falling population incomes. However, these setbacks, in his opinion, are compensated by obvious rewards, including the passage of democratic laws, the introduction of a national currency, and the population's growing confidence in irreversible reforms.
