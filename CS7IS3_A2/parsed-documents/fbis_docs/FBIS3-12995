The Likud, the NRP [National Religious Party], and Moledet are opposed to the evacuation. Moreover, the Tzomet faction, which the prime minister would like to include in the coalition, is "adamantly" opposed to it. There is a polarization of views even in Labor, where Ministers Shetrit and Tzur contest the issue with the doves of the Mashov circle. Our political situation would have been less calamitous had the government removed the 42 settler families and the 150 yeshiva students from their houses, which are located in the heart of the Arab city, right after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre and settled them temporarily in Qiryat Arba'. U.S. and UN representatives have informed the Arabs -- the Muslims and the PLO -- that they will not allow the Security Council to denounce Israel. The United States will not agree to anything other than a denunciation of the massacre itself. Furthermore, it is not looking forward to sending UN troops to territories administered by Israel. It will be another week before we know for certain whether the United States is a consistent champion of the stand taken by Israel, which agreed to a temporary international or outside presence "to be agreed on" in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area only. Since the crime was committed outside Gaza and Jericho, the argument that the United States should "protect the safety of the Palestinians" -- namely, everybody -- carries some weight. The removal of Jews from Hebron will not satisfy all the anti-Israel demands, which have been aired by exploiting the Security Council as a platform, but it can attenuate their magnitude. Beyond the problem that has arisen in the UN arena, the permanent Jewish presence in Hebron hampers the PLO's performance in the peace process. Yasir 'Arafat was willing to come to Washington in response to President Clinton's invitation, but he was unable to act on his wishes, and the peace process was discontinued as a result of the majority opinion in the PLO-Tunis directorate. If the Israeli Government wants the PLO leader to be able to impose his authority on his organization and on the Palestinian population in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, it should make a move of its own. Knesset Member [MK] Eliyahu Ben-Elisar has warned against evacuating the Hebron settlers because it might constitute a precedent for the removal of all the settlements; MK Rehav'am Ze'evi sees the evacuation of Hebron as "the first step toward the annihilation of the Zionist endeavor"; and one settler described the renewed Jewish settlement in Hebron as "the rectifying of old wrongs against the Jews." They should all be told that Israel did not engage in the Six-Day War in order to take land; the victory should not have been used to annul our historical consent to the partition of the country in 1947. Settling accounts with the Hebron Arabs of 1968 for the crimes their fathers committed in 1929 was a mistake to begin with, and it is certainly a mistake to perpetuate in 1994 an error made 26 years earlier. Israel does not need a permanent Jewish presence in Hebron for security or any other reason; all it does is cause severe damage. The glory of the Jewish people's spiritual heritage does not lie in the presence of a handful of Jewish families in a few houses owned by Jews in the distant past. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has tasks other than maintaining a vast deployment to protect that handful and stop it from provoking the Arab residents of the city.
