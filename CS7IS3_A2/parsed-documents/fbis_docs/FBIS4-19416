In the suburbs of Sarajevo, French soldiers were surrounded this afternoon by Serb troops backed up by a tank. The peacekeepers were guarding an arsenal where heavy weapons, handed over by the Bosnian Serbs a month ago to avoid NATO air strikes, are stored. [passage omitted] France is refusing to allow the UN forces in Bosnia to be accused of partiality, but French Defense Minister Francois Leotard firmly maintains his position, replying to Frederic Carbone: [Begin recording] [Leotard] There is indisputably a new kind of tension that has become apparent around Sarajevo following the air strikes by the allied aircraft on Gorazde, indisputably. This tension is bearing down on the French forces today, because we have many soldiers in Sarajevo today, and it manifests itself in many different ways. We are in the process of holding talks with the Serbs to ensure that the provocative attitudes, the refusals, the obstructions, disappear. [Carbone] Are you not tempted to say to the Serbs: Enough is enough? [Leotard] Yes, of course, when the allied aircraft carried out the air strikes on Gorazde this was indeed what we were saying, and France is of course participating in these operations, France is taking part in these observation flights, and some day you will perhaps also see, alas, operations of this kind that will be aimed at Serb targets if they continue with this unacceptable practice of insanely continuing with ethnic cleansing.
