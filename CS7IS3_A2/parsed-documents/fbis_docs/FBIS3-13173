The first is that the General People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG], the two northern partners in the ruling coalition, implement the Pledge and Accord Document in accordance with the interpretation and the measures agreed on by the YSP and the opposition, regarding which the GPC and the YRG still have some reservations or objections; or, that there be a return to the situation obtaining prior to 22 May 1990 and an announcement of the end of the unity experiment. The sources said that Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, deputy prime minister for internal affairs and member of the Political Forces' Dialogue Committee, which drafted the Pledge and Accord Document, late last month offered the YSP leadership the federation option as a way out of the crisis, along the same lines suggested last October by Salim Salih Muhammad, YSP assistant secretary general and Presidential Council member, but the party's Political Bureau rejected that option on the grounds that that suggestion had been overtaken by the recent military confrontations in Abyan and H rft Sufyan.
