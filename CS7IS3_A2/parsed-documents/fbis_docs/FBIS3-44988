In the course of building a socialist market economic system, we should regard as an important task supporting major grain and cotton production areas in developing their economies and ensuring a steady increase in grain and cotton production; we should ensure that this task is properly carried out. From 13 to 18 December, Wen Jiabao inspected the agricultural production and rural work and visited peasant households in Suqian, Shuyang, Hongze, Jinhu, and other cities and counties of Huaiyin City, and held discussions with local cadres on issues concerning the current rural reform and development. Over the last few years, while ensuring a steady increase in grain production, Huaiyin City, located in the heartland of northern Jiangsu, has made use of local resources to forcefully develop a diversified economy and the processing of agricultural and sideline products, opening up a path for rural economic development that is in line with local reality and bringing about big changes in local rural areas. Wen Jiabao fully approved Huaiyin Prefecture's experience in agricultural and rural economic development and offered his opinions on deepening rural reform. He said: Rural reform is an important part of our efforts to build a socialist market economic system. From the very beginning, China's rural reform has been market-oriented. It has two important characteristics: First, peasants are given full decision-making powers such as what to produce and how to deal with their products to rally the masses of peasants' enthusiasm. Second, the agriculture and rural economy have been made market-oriented to give play to market mechanism. Actually, these are a successful practice of building a new socialist market economic system in rural areas. To continue to deepen rural reform, currently we need to do a good job in the following three areas: First, while making the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output more firmly established and making efforts to refine the system, we should strive to budget rural economic resources in the optimum manner and to enable production elements to flow more freely. Second, we should develop rural markets, invigorate rural circulation, and take various measures to link the decentralized productions of individual households to a unified market. Third, the government should provide better guidance for agricultural production, give greater support and protection to it, strengthen regulation and control over it, and develop a better socialized service system. Wen Jiabao continued: Next year is a crucial year for our reform; various major reform measures will be instituted next year. We must place importance on rural work, strengthen agriculture's position as the foundation of the national economy, ensure a steady growth in grain and cotton production, ensure the supply of agricultural and sideline products, and ensure a stable market of these products to create a favorable economic climate and a stable social environment for the reform. Commenting on the fact that Huaiyin City had reaped bumper grain harvests in the past few years but its peasants' income had been comparatively low, Wen Jiabao pointed out: Major grain and cotton production areas are extremely important to the country's grain and cotton production; therefore, we should take effective measures to speed up these areas' economic development. First, we should regulate the current grain and cotton prices by implementing reasonable price policies, so to reasonably raise the relatively low prices and to improve the relative economic efficiency of grain and cotton production. Second, while ensuring a steady increase in grain and cotton production, we should make the rural industrial structures more rational; should forcefully develop a diversified economy and town and village enterprises in rural areas -- in particular, we should develop the livestock and poultry industry and the processing of agricultural and sideline products; and should choose the development path of combining efforts to increase production and to develop value-added processing industries. Third, governments at all levels should appropriately pool their financial resources to support economic development of major grain and cotton production areas. Wen Jiabao stressed: The key to deepening rural reform and to accelerating the economic development in major grain and cotton production areas is to have good leaders. Party members and grass-roots cadres in rural areas not only should take the lead in getting better of, but also should lead the masses to achieve common prosperity. He urged grass-roots cadres in rural areas to earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to carry through the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the Central Rural Work Meeting, to emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts, be self-reliant, work hard to pioneer new spheres of endeavors, and further advance rural reform and economic development. Those accompanying Wen Jiabao during his inspection tour included Cao Hongmin, deputy secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee; and Wan Baorui, vice minister of agriculture.
