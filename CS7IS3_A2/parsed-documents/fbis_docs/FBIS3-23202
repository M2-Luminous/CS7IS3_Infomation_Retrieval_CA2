The seizures were made possible by searches conducted as part of an investigation into the theft of a number of passports in the premises of the General Regulation and Administration Directorate (DIRAG) at the High Commission of the Republic in New Caledonia. In a communique, the state prosecutor said that the operation stemmed from the arrest, in France, of "two Caledonians in possession of securities stolen in Noumea as well as forged identity papers." Investigations revealed "the existence of two caches supposedly containing merchandise of shady origin. Investigators discovered the booty of several burglaries committed in the territory." Most administrative documents stolen from the DIRAG, as well as about 10 handguns, 50 rifles, and various explosive substances, have been recovered during a flagrante delicto procedure. Three people are being held for questioning and investigations are in progress in order to ascertain the exact origin of the seized items as well as the identity and motives of the persons behind all this. According to various sources and witness accounts from residents of the area (the Ducos industrial area and Ouemo residential community) -- including a video filmed unknown to the investigators and broadcast by television station RFO -- there were also heavy weapons, two-way radios, and ammunition among the weapons seized. Parts of the arsenal reportedly came from the United States and were paid for through the sale of passports which were part of the "administrative documents taken in DIRAG's premises" (2,000 passports had been stolen there). Worth pointing out however is the fact that the number of handguns and rifles indicated in the state prosecutor's communique match the number of arms stolen on 2 December 1986 in a local department store. The exact circumstances of the arrest of the "two Caledonians" have not been divulged. Sources close to the investigators say the two men were arrested in Metz on their way back from Luxembourg, where they had attempted to negotiate a 400,000-French-franc treasury bill. The bill came from a burglary committed in New Caledonia. One of the two men quickly made a confession and, probably to imbue his activities with a political dimension, reportedly confessed having been party to bombings in Noumea and told investigators about the two caches of weapons and war equipment.
