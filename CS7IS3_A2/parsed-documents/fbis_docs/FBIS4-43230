This is clear from a list drawn up at the end of last week by the three politicians who have been appointed by the Crown to assess the feasibility of the coalition. National budget cuts are set to produce savings of G6.9 billion. Depending on the interpretation, savings on social security expenditure are to produce a further G5.8 to G6.1 billion. These are all savings on which the parties have reached agreement. The parties are still seeking measures through which the amount available for tax cuts and reducing the public deficit would exceed this G13 billion mark. The Central Planning Bureau calculated the proposals over the weekend. They include plans to increase jobs and boost purchasing power. On the basis of these calculations the negotiators will determine how high the total amount of savings will be during the next term of government. All those involved accept that conclusions will be reached this week together with a final decision on whether or not a `purple' coalition is to be formed. Today the negotiators are discussing, among other things, tax cuts and how to finance them, together with employment conditions in the public sector. VVD leader Bolkestein described the negotiations this afternoon as "important but not yet crucial." The parties are still aiming to submit the government pact to the Second Chamber for debate in mid- July. PvdA [Labor Party], VVD, and D66 representatives are also busy considering elements of a government pact outside the social economic field. A total of eight policy areas have been allocated that cover the full range of government activities. These include the environment and planning, and security in large towns. At the CDA party council last Saturday [11 June], Brinkman was critical of the fact that the negotiators are working on the basis of excessively optimistic economic growth figures. "The negotiators are apparently mesmerized by the unexpectedly favorable economic growth," Brinkman says. "This is dangerous at a time of continuing high unemployment and public debt and this is why all the election programs cautiously counted on four years with an average growth of 1.75 percent." The CDA leader believes that the need for additional policy "is certainly true" because otherwise in four years time there will be 815,000 unemployed and 850,000 people on disability benefit.
