FR940802-1-00014 FR940802-1-00005 In addition to the actions noted above, NIH proposes to limit the citation of authority for issuance of the regulations to the Secretary's general statutory authority for the issuance of regulations set forth in section 215 of the PHS Act, rather than citing the statutory authority for each research project grant program. The latter provisions do not require or explicitly authorize the issuance of regulations and thus 1 CFR part 21, subpart B, does not require inclusion of those statutes in the authority citation. It is also proposed to make minor changes required by new statutory authority, simplify the language in §§52.2&hyph;4 and 52.6, update PHS Act section numbers referenced in part 52 as necessitated by enactment of legislation, and update the listing of HHS policies and regulations in §52.8. The purpose of this notice is to invite public comment on these proposed changes. The following statements are provided for the information of the public. Regulatory Impact Statement The Secretary has reviewed this proposed rule in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and has determined that it will not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order No. 12866. Therefore, the Secretary has determined that the proposed rule does not require: (1) An assessment of benefits anticipated from the proposed amendments; (2) an assessment of costs anticipated from the proposed amendments; or (3) an assessment of costs and benefits of potentially effective and reasonably feasible alternative to the proposed amendments. Regulatory Flexibility Act Because of the nonsubstantive nature of the proposed amendments, the Secretary certifies that the proposed regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis, as defined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. chapter 6), is not required. Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed regulations do not contain information collection requirements subject to review and approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).
