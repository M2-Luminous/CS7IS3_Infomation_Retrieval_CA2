The woman, said to be an Informal Commercial Importer (ICI), is suffering from the toxic effects of cocaine she was smuggling in her stomach. Reports are that the Jamaican, Cynthia Yvonne Barrett, of a Central Village address, in St. Catherine left the Norman Manley International Airport for Panama two Saturdays ago. THE GLEANER was told that on arrival at the airport in Panama, Barrett fainted. It is alleged that one of the packages of cocaine she was smuggling in her stomach had burst. When contacted, Jamaica's Ambassador to Mexico, Miss Evadne Coye, who oversees Jamaica's interest in Panama, said that Barrett is alive, but she has been arrested for trafficking drugs and is now recuperating under police guard in hospital. Miss Coye added that once released by the hospital, Barrett will go to jail to await trial, which could take place anytime, up to two years. She also stated that the prison term for drug trafficking in Panama is between two and 10 years. Since July 1991 to date, some 48 Jamaicans -- 28 men and 20 women -- have been serving prison terms in Panama. Earlier reports had indicated that Panama, with the assistance of the United States of America, had improved its drug detection system. Miss Coye was quoted as saying recently that at least one of the Jamaicans who is currently serving a ten-year term, had suffered a mental break-down. This was attributed mainly to the condition of the Panama prisons.
