An elegant touch: The names of the new ministers follow one another in strict keeping with the Latin alphabet: J (Jurgenson), K (Kannik, Kranich), and L (Luik). TOIVO JURGENSON. A man of pleasant manners, with a quiet voice and a shy smile. At 36, he is the oldest of the foursome. According to the parliament's deputy speaker, Tunne Kelam, he worked extensively and fruitfully in the parliamentary commission on the economy. Some of the results have been felt quite tangibly by Tallinn residents: It was at his initiative that the State Assembly cut to a minimum subsidies for public transportation in the capital. In the Isamaa he was considered a leading specialist and ideologist on the subject of agriculture. In the fall, when angry peasants staged a siege of the parliament building, he looked out of the window and said that Estonian agriculture was still in the hands of socialist structures, which had "lobbied" this action. INDREK KANNIK. Was considered an Isamaa ideologist but, in the public eye all the time, has not qualified for the fame of a "gray cardinal." Aside from the prime minister, he was affected by well-known scandals less any of Isamaa's other top people. After the most sensational of them--the "vodka scandal"--when the subject of changing of the faction leadership came up, he was rumored to be a prime candidate for the parliamentary leader of Isamaa. This did not happen, however. Perhaps even then he kept in his sights the far-reaching aim of a ministerial portfolio. Numerous remarks at parliamentary press conferences on issues of the national security concept are probably the only link between the name of Kannik, who has never served in the military--like his predecessor, as a matter of fact--and the job of minister of defense. That, and his obvious character trait of decisiveness. HEIKI KRANICH. While being a member of the ruling coalition, he was not a member of Isamaa faction of late, joining instead the liberals faction that recently split from Isamaa. One of the "fathers" of the current tax system. By the way, it was he who stubbornly insisted on the need to apply turnover tax to periodicals. Unlike the aforementioned, he was up to his neck in the "vodka scandal" since, together with Illar Hallaste, he was a member of Liviko's administrative council. He is still involved in litigation with the RAHVA HAEL newspaper on the subject of an item, which, he contends, inflicted moral damage on him to the tune of half a million kroons. He seeks to exact the half million from the offender in his lawsuit. JURI LUIK. This name is probably more familiar to the reader than the rest. Head of the Estonian delegation at the negotiations with Russia, he looked almost like a boy, albeit bearded, next to the cleanly shaven and experienced Vasiliy Svirin. His remarks to journalists after each round of negotiations were not always diplomatic, sometimes prompting even the usually restrained and polite Svirin to a verbal skirmish. As time went by, he became less overtly emotional, and learned diplomacy--not just a diplomat's polish but also experience--which even his rivals in the negotiations acknowledged. His tenure in the job of minister of defense was so short-lived, however, that it did not leave any publicly visible trail.
