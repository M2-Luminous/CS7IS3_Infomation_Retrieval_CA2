Cities, villages, and townships in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip witnessed a complete closure as a sign of rejection of the plans to liquidate the Palestinian people's cause and squander their legitimate national political rights. All this shows that the Cairo agreement does not express this people's will and does not fulfill their national and pan-Arab aspirations. This agreement has come as a natural result of the Oslo agreement which stipulates the perpetuation of the occupation, and Israel maintaining its control over the occupied Arab territories. There is no doubt that the agreement to implement the autonomy rule that Rabin and 'Arafat signed in Cairo yesterday will have many complications, dangers, and harmful dimensions for the Palestinian people and their cause, and will have complex ramifications not only on the state of affairs in the occupied Arab territories but also on the state of affairs in the entire region. In addition to the fact that the self-rule agreement does not give the Palestinians any prerogatives or responsibilities in the fields of defense, foreign affairs, and political affairs, it also makes the Palestinians dutybound to protect the security of the Israeli settlers and others. It also gives the Israelis the final say in deciding who who enters and leaves the self-rule territories, stipulates that the Israeli army will keep its complete control on the settlements, and that instead of withdrawing, the Israeli forces will redeploy and control roads, bridges, and passageways. Looking at all this, one realizes that this agreement does not in any way whatsoever constitute a step on the road to peace but further complicates the peace process and saves Israel from a burden under which it nearly collapsed in view of the escalation of the intifadah. Many Israeli officials admit that the signing of the self-rule agreement has guaranteed a partner for Israel and for its security and that a security alliance has been established between the PLO and Israel to confront and terminate the intifadah. By firmly and angrily rejecting the self-rule agreement, the Palestinian people reaffirm that they will never give up the goals for which they launched their intifadah against the occupation to completely eliminate it from their occupied territories. This is because they realize that any partial solutions, phased settlements, or partial deals cannot but be in the interest of Israel and its occupation and not in the interest of their national rights and that of rergaining them. All indications show that the wrath which spread throughout the occupied Arab territories while 'Arafat was signing the agreement is the best proof that Israel has dragged the Palestinian party into potentially dire consequences and to more concessions which first started with the Oslo agreement, continued to be made over a period of seven months, and finally resulted in a flimsy agreement that is not in the interest of the peace process, that gave Israel many gains, particularly in the security field, and that transformed the Palestinian police force into tools to protect the occupation and the settlements. We in Syria want just and comprehensive peace and have never accepted and will never accept separate and amputated solutions. We cooperated and will cooperate for the sake of such a peace. Only a just and comprehensive solution will bring about a viable peace that will be accepted by the people, that will last, and that will safeguard the dignity and interests of all the parties.
