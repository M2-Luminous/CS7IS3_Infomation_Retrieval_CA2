Determination of the Comparative Attractiveness of Regions for Embarking on Banking Operations by the Index Method 1.1. General Approaches In comparing conditions for banking operations in various regions, we may distinguish three key factors that determine a favorable outlook for embarking on banking operations within them. First, we should name a volume of financial flows that should be sufficient for it to make sense for a banking institution to be established to service them. However, the volume of financial flows in and of itself indicates nothing: Given an insignificant number of banking institutions, even small gross flows may turn out to be sufficient to ensure the prosperity of a new bank or branch. This is why it is not the absolute volume but rather the concentration of financial flows which is the most important factor, i.e., the average volume of such flows per one banking institution already existing in the region. The significance of this factor is associated with the fact that the banking institution being established will be able to operate only if it succeeds in attracting a proportion of the clientele of already existing banks and branches. At present, a paradoxical situation is observed in Russia as a consequence of the insufficient development of the banking system and the attendant low level of competition: the larger the bank, the greater the indifference with which it treats its clients, and the more easily the latter "break away" from it. Indeed, a small bank, as a rule, services its founders. It hardly has clients besides these. The provision of highly specialized services is the only point that may draw the founders away from the bank they fully control, but both the need for such services and the number of banks capable of providing them are relatively small. At the same time, a large bank virtually does not depend on its depositors and does not strive to keep them at any price. As a rule, relative indifference and comparatively high fees for services result (of course, there are exceptions; however, the headlong progress of banks that violate this rule goes precisely to confirm that it is correct with regard to the banking system of Russia as a whole). It would be fitting to recall here that, having gained considerable authority, some of the largest Russian banks mounted entire campaigns to get rid of small and, therefore, less profitable clients by deliberately creating unbearable conditions for servicing them. As a result, the greater the concentration of financial resources at the banking institutions of a given region, the more amenable these resources are to reorientation toward new banks and branches. The above rule is a general rule for all market economies, although in less rigid form: High concentration is inseparably linked to an entire complex of phenomena which create prerequisites for the development of successful competition. In the absence of this, any market economy would be crushed by monopoly practices. Going back to the banking system of Russia, we should stress that the described indicators--the volume and concentration of financial flows--do not reflect an entire complex of factors, some of which, in principle, cannot be quantified. Crucial factors, such as the level of development of infrastructure (virtually the most significant factor for banking operations!), the availability of skilled personnel, and the attitude of local authorities can be taken into account only through a resultant indicator testifying to their total, combined impact, rather than directly. The number of branches that have already been created in the territory in question is such an indicator. The latter makes no sense in the absence of accounting for the two previous factors because it shows solely the propensities that prevailed in the past without factoring in the economic foundation on which these propensities rested. As a result, the mistakes of the past will become self-sustaining: For example, the extensive establishment of branches in a territory with insignificant financial flows as a result of particular subjective mistakes will create an illusion of extraordinary attractiveness, despite the fact that these branches eke out a pitiful existence. The enumerated factors characterize either the operational conditions that are external to the banking system (the volume of financial flows and, in part, the number of branches), or the quantitative aspect of the system's own development (concentration of financial flows and, in part, the number of branches). The qualitative aspect of development of the system, i.e. the depth of specialization of the banking institutions and the complexity of operations performed by them, are actually left out of our field of vision. To remedy this shortcoming, it would suffice to recall that, as a rule, sophisticated specialized banking operations are not associated with the immediate servicing of tangible flows. Therefore, the proportion of operations associated with the immediate servicing of tangible flows in the overall volume of operations of banking establishments will indicate the level of qualitative development of the banking system. We will conventionally call this indicator "the proportion of nonfinancial operations." The above interconnected and interdependent factors which determine the conditions for banking activities in various regions make it possible to arrive at a generalized indicator of attractiveness of a particular territory even on the basis of existing imperfect statistics. 1.2. Indexes of the Scale and Concentration of Financial Flows, Level of Development of Branches, and Proportion of Nonfinancial Operations The greatest difficulties in undertaking the present effort are associated with the absence, in principle, of information on the strength of financial flows. Information on the size of regional bank assets provided by the Central Bank of Russia is suitable only with reservations because it applies to the assets of banks registered in a given territory, regardless of where they engage in operations. Distortions caused by this are most vividly apparent in the case of Moscow, to which the assets of former specialized and sectoral banks that have kept a considerable chain of branches and service territories quite far removed from Moscow are attributed. With a view to getting rid of this shortcoming, the size of bank assets has to be adjusted by taking into account a number of indirect indicators that point up various components of financial flows in the process of determining the index of financial flows. The index of concentration of financial flows, which describes the difference between volume of the average financial flows per one banking institution (bank or branch) in the region in question and the average Russian level, was determined in a similar manner. The indexes of the number of branches and proportion of nonfinancial operations were determined directly, by comparing the number of branches registered in a given region (or, respectively, the proportion of nonfinancial operations in the total volume of operations of banking institutions in a given region) with the average Russian level. All the described indexes amount to deviations of the relevant indicators from the average Russian level, which is assumed to be 100 percent. 1.3. Comparative Index of Attractiveness of Conditions for Banking Operations In working with the present publication, it is most important for the user to grasp the fact that, depending on the situation of his bank and its development strategy determined by this situation, the significance of some of the factors described above may vary. After all, the index of attractiveness of conditions for banking operations as determined by us is subjective in nature: It depends not only on conditions within the region, but also on the potential of whoever wants to develop the region. Only the indexes of the volume and concentration of financial flows amount to unequivocal indicators: A rise in them unequivocally indicates easier banking expansion in the region in question and, consequently, there is a direct correlation between their value and the value of the resultant index. However, we encounter the first exception right there. Understandably, the comparatively low number of branches is predicated on the effect of various counteracting factors--difficult climatic and geographic conditions, inadequately developed infrastructure, shortage of cadres, paternalistic stance of the local authorities, and so on. It is also understandable that, in principle, the negative influence of any of these factors may be overcome by making financial outlays. A bank that incurs such outlays and overcomes the counteracting factors will gain an exceptionally favorable position, virtually that of a monopoly in the region in question. This is precisely the kind of situation about which they say that "Paris is well worth a mass." For a bank that is prepared to incur the aforementioned outlays, it is the relatively small rather than the large number of branches registered in the region that is the sign of comparative attractiveness of the region (naturally, all other conditions being equal). The correlation between the index of the number of branches and the comparative index of attractiveness of conditions for banking operations is also inverse rather than direct. The index of the proportion of nonfinancial operations, which describes the depth of specialization in the banking system and thus the quality of its development, should also be considered an "ambiguous" indicator. On one hand, to most banks a high level of development of the banking system offers extensive potential for finding their own "ecological niche" and enhances the attractiveness of a region. For these banks, the correlation between the proportion of nonfinancial operations and the resultant index is inverse. On the other hand, banks that are capable of not just taking advantage of the results of a high development of the banking system but also of acting as locomotives of this development will gain the greatest advantage precisely in the course of penetrating regions with a low level of specialization of banking institutions (of course, all other conditions being equal). They have an opportunity to shape the banking system of the region "to their specifications" from the very beginning and to ensure their leading role in the region for a long time to come. In the present work, we proceed from the most typical case whereby a bank establishing branches sets the goal of taking advantage of already existing conditions for operations rather than purposefully transforming them. Given this strategy of establishing branches, the correlation between the indexes of the volume and concentration of financial flows, as well as the index of the number of branches, and the resultant comparative index of attractiveness for banking operations is direct, and between the index of the proportion of nonfinancial operations and the resultant index--inverse. Accordingly, the comparative index of attractiveness of conditions for banking operations amounts to a geometric mean of the first three indexes and a value inverse to the fourth index. However, we do not rule out the possibility that banks subscribing to a different approach to the establishment of branches will turn to the present work. We are including in Table 1 provided below not only the resultant indicator but also all the base indicators used to compute it in order to give such banks an opportunity to modify the calculations made by us in keeping with the needs of their organizations. Therefore, the table in a way amounts to a construction set proceeding from which each manager may independently calculate various scenarios of policy concerning branches. Table 1.

The higher the index of comparative conditions for banking operations, the more favorable these conditions are, and the more promising the region under consideration is from the point of view of establishing branches. Note 2. As the table suggests, worse than average conditions for banking operations have developed in most regions. The reason is found in the concentration of banks in Moscow, which has caused a gap in the level of development of the banking system and, accordingly, conditions for banking operations that have developed in these few areas and those in the entire remaining territory of Russia. II. Regional Dynamics of Development of the Banking System 2.1. Quarterly Dynamics of the Comparative Index of Attractiveness of Conditions for Banking Operations in the Economic Regions of Russia The assumption that the conditions for economic operations in various regions would gradually become uniform as market relations develop was one of the cornerstones of the economic reform. The development of many processes tracked by official statistics in 1992 and 1993, in particular in the areas of price setting and the incomes of the population, on the whole confirmed this hypothesis, which made it possible to voice suppositions about the broader extent of its applicability. However, even calculations of the comparative index of conditions for banking operations broken down by economic regions, which level differences between individual territories to a considerable degree, at the very least fail to support this. This is visible to the naked eye in the table given below. The use of the most basic statistical methods paints a more detailed picture: The standard deviation from the mean value of the index, which fell in the second quarter, grew in the first and especially the third quarters, and as of 1 October considerably exceeded the level at the beginning of the year. At the same time, the attractiveness of conditions for banking operations declined steadily, quarter after quarter, in the Northern Region and (beginning with the second quarter) the Central-Chernozem Region. Moscow and the Urals Region, in which the comparative index exceeded the average Russian level, were the most attractive from the point of view of embarking on banking activities. Despite the overall downward trend, the growth of this index was registered in Moscow and the Far East during the first three quarters of 1993. At the same time, the growth of differentiation in the conditions for banking operations in the various regions testifies to the emergence of both "financial centers" and hopeless and unpromising "financial boondocks" in Russia. The development is so uneven that the territories in question may be adjacent within the framework of the same economic region. As far as the government is concerned, this, like any strengthening of disparities in the development of various regions, testifies to the need to make new efforts aimed at providing uniform conditions for economic operations and preserving the territorial integrity of Russia. As far as the commercial banks are concerned, an increase in the disparity of the development of territories and regional differentiation in conditions for banking operations means that the need for preliminary estimates and for projecting such conditions will increase (at any rate in the foreseeable future), as will the "price of a mistake."

The higher the index of comparative conditions for banking operations, the more favorable these conditions are, and the more promising the region under consideration is from the point of view of establishing branches. Note 2. The index of comparative conditions for banking operations as of 1 October 1993 is different from that given in Table 1 because in Table 2 the results of calculations by simplified methods are given (since some of the statistical information for previous periods turned out to be inaccessible). 2.2. Quarterly Dynamics of the Assets of the Banking System of Russia in Real Terms by Economic Region Both enthusiasts who welcome the rapid development of the banking system of Russia and individuals who talk profusely about the excessive development of "speculative" capital or the need to reduce the money supply in real terms in order to restrict the growth of prices would benefit from learning about a reduction in the assets of commercial banks in real terms (adjusted for the level of inflation) in 1993. As the table given below indicates, the reduction in question has proceeded in an extremely uneven manner in terms of both time and territories. In one-third of the economic regions of Russia--Northern, Northwestern, Volga, and North Caucasus--this reduction, which is indicative of the retrogression of the local banking system, is continuous and systematic in nature (which, however, in and of itself does not necessarily rule out the opportunity for the emergence of new financial centers in the territories of some of these regions). It is notable that, paradoxical as it might be, a growth of assets in real terms was registered in 1993 during periods of high rates of inflation. In the second quarter, when the growth of prices slowed down, assets in real terms fell by almost one-fourth. The dependence in question is an important illustration of the fact that with inflation at an average level, business activity (of which the value of assets in real terms is an indirect indication) grows with a higher level of prices and drops with a lower level. Therefore, moderate inflation acts, in a way, as a "booster" of business activity under the described conditions. With this in view, it is possible to conjecture that a certain hardening of financial policy implemented in the fourth quarter of 1993 will bring about yet another reduction in assets in real terms. At the same time, an increase in the money supply after the New Year, which was virtually unavoidable because of the aggravation of the nonpayments problem and the growth of social tensions, will most likely cause not only an acceleration of the growth of prices but also a rise in business activity in the first quarter of 1994. According to available estimates, by 1 April 1994 this rise may bring about a restoration of the level of assets in real terms as of the beginning or even end of the first quarter of 1993. A comparison of data in the two provided tables shows that the growth of assets in real terms compared to the previous period, or the growth of the nominal assets of commercial bank outpacing inflation, is accompanied by the reinforcement of territorial differentiation in the conditions for banking operations. This is due to the fact that financial centers accumulate the bulk of the increment of monetary funds in real terms or, in other words, business activity grows primarily in financial centers that have considerably more developed production and, particularly important, financial infrastructure than other regions of the country.

Quarterly Dynamics of Assets of the Banking System of Russia by Area The indicator of dynamics of bank assets broken down by economic region is only significant in forming a general picture. A high degree of generalization ensures the clarity which is necessary to this end, but also renders the use of this indicator to solve specific problems virtually meaningless. After all, each economic region includes territories with the most varied conditions for banking operations; as has been shown above, the development of market relations does not weaken but, on the contrary, strengthens existing differentiation (at any rate, at the present stage of development). The dynamics of assets in real terms broken down by area are of practical significance in working out the policy of banks concerning branches. These dynamics complicate the perception of the overall picture but make it possible to track changes in the situation in each territory taken separately. The assets of banks in real terms increased only in six areas out of the 77 observed, and in another eight areas the drop in assets was smaller than the average Russian level. Therefore, only in 14 areas out of 77 did conditions emerge which favored the development of the banking system. From among the rest, we should note 40 areas in which a systematic fall in bank assets in real terms was registered quarter after quarter. The distribution of these stagnant territories among economic regions appears significant: --in the Northern Region--four areas out of five (80 percent); --in the Northwestern Region--two areas out of five (40 percent); --in the Central Region--eight areas out of 13 (62 percent); --in the Volga-Vyatka Region--three areas out of five (60 percent); --in the Central-Chernozem Region--two areas out of five (40 percent); --in the Volga Region--six areas out of eight (75 percent); --in the Northern Caucasus Region--eight areas out of nine (89 percent); --in the Urals Region--four areas out of seven (57 percent); --in the West Siberian Region--two areas out of seven (29 percent); --in the East Siberian Region--one area out of six (17 percent); --and finally in the Far Eastern Region--not one (out of seven). However, Voronezh Oblast, in which a genuine banking disaster occurred, stands out even against this background of depressed development. Assets in real terms, which grew by a factor of 1.5 in the first quarter, dropped by a factor of more than five in the following half of the year. 2.4. Complementing the Comparative Index of Attractiveness of Conditions for Banking Operations With the Indicator of the Dynamics of Assets in Real Terms The dynamics of bank assets in real terms give us an idea of comparative conditions for the development of banking institutions in the territories under review; in this capacity, such dynamics may be taken into account in determining the attractiveness of these territories for embarking on banking operations in them. The sharp quarterly fluctuations of bank assets in real terms which have been registered in many regions while the general development trend was pronounced prompt us to use periods of time longer than one quarter, looking to changes that occur over at least three quarters rather than one. In the table below, the standard comparative index of attractiveness of conditions for banking operations is complemented with the index of changes in bank assets in real terms in the last three quarters. The latter index introduces a dynamic component into the analysis and, as a comparison of results shows, virtually makes it possible to proceed in the course of analysis without calculating the comparative indexes of attractiveness of conditions for banking operations in the preceding periods (because the inertia of the rest of its components is rather high). The index of changes in bank assets in real terms shows how strong and dynamic local banks are. As a rule, considerable reductions in assets in real terms testify to "outside" expansion which is strangling local banks; in this case, a bank penetrating the market will no longer have to compete with local banks but with more aggressive and compounded [as published] banks which are ahead of it. Only a very strong bank may try to capture their market. For a majority, entering the "domestic market" of local banks is within reach; even if the latter banks are strong enough to carry out their own branch programs, their attention is, as a rule, riveted to the regions of expansion and is weakened with regard to the territories of their location. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4.

Certain Prospects for Development of the Banking System of Russia 1994 Promises to Become the Year of the "Great Repartition" of the Russian Market for Banking Services For now, it will be a repartition solely among Russian banks. Extensive redistribution of clients among banks will apparently become the most conspicuous direction of the development of the banking sphere of Russia in 1994. A tremendous number of large enterprises are still serviced by cumbersome and comparatively inefficient structures such as Rosselkhozbank [Russian Agricultural Bank], Promstroybank [Industrial Construction Bank], as well as the banks of former sectoral ministries which are in an intermediate position. As a rule, settlements are slow at banks of this kind, fees for services are high, and the scope of services provided is narrow. However, the main point is that the "state-affiliated" banks have preserved the noncommercial style of operation and demonstrate no ability to change it. Undoubtedly, as the market develops, inconveniences associated with this situation will become increasingly perceptible to clients, and will increasingly outweigh the sole advantage of the structures in question--easier access to state financing (including in the form of various preferential loans). This will cause a considerable number of enterprises possessing respectable financial resources to be "pushed" into the embrace of genuinely commercial banks in the immediate future, even if the banks are completely passive; this "push" is going to be protracted and massive. Neither the modernization of the present-day state-affiliated monsters nor the creation of their own banks by enterprises will be able to restrict this process in a major way. For the purposes of a genuine conversion to commercial operations, the "state-affiliated" banks are too closely involved with the distribution of state resources. The issue of attracting clients is not a life or death issue for them; to a considerable degree, these banks (for example, Promstroybank) associate their prospects with hopeless attempts to restore the prereform past. At present, the creation of new banks is increasingly difficult. A shortage of skilled personnel with integrity, mounting competition, and mainly the absence of guaranteed profits will make seeking the services of already successfully operating banks increasingly attractive compared to the creation of a proprietary bank. Let us recall that the banking "boom" of 1992 and the first half of 1993 was due to a catastrophic decline of the ruble against the dollar, as a result of which it sufficed for a bank to acquire "self-growing" foreign exchange assets to secure stable high profits. In the second half of 1993 the process of creation of banks was given a new impetus due to quite a number of mostly trading companies reaching a new stage of development. This impetus has virtually been depleted by now because the number and, most importantly, financial resources of large companies are already restricted by the market nearing saturation. This is why there are grounds to believe that 1994 will be the last year of "explosive" growth in the number of banks. A "critical mass" will finally be reached in that year, and the further process of development in the banking system will most likely take the path of increasing the number of branches. Attacks on trust companies, which are beginning to usurp some banking functions, as well as the unsuccessful struggle of the Central Bank against small banks performing only an insignificant proportion of banking operations, may be viewed as early symptoms of the forthcoming sharp complication and internal stratification of the banking system of Russia. As has been said above, such complexity and stratification will be accompanied by a mass repartition of the domestic market of banking services. The capture of clients by aggressive commercial banks from state-affiliated structures will be the main content of this process in 1994. However, it is estimated that the feast of Russian commercial "sharks" on the carcass of the sickly whale of the state banking system will not last long--no longer than 1.5 years. Later, foreign banks will break into the Russian market, which are now being contained by the absence of "threshold" stability rather than by state measures; Russian banks that do not manage to ensure support from large foreign structures, as Inkombank has, will experience major difficulties.
