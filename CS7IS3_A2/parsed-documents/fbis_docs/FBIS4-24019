A PWV region source said the offices of newly elected legislators were encountering "deliberate resistance", including the loss of documents and ignored requests for equipment and information from TPA department officials in Pretoria. "We thought at first it was just a few incompetent people, but the loss of strategic documents and problems in specific areas lead us to believe this is sabotage," the source said. TPA officials, however, claim provincial premiers and legislators have been appointing dozens of new people to posts not sanctioned by the Commission for Administration. They contend the filling of new posts must follow procedures laid down in the public service's personnel administration system. This involves a work study investigation to evaluate the post and its place in the grading system as well as minimum qualifications for applicants. TPA officials felt that while they were keen to support and assist the new provincial government as apolitical public servants, they could not agree to demands from people who had not been formally placed in the official structures of the public service as laid down in legislation. "Even premiers do not have the authority just to appoint people." Commission for Provincial Government chairman Thozamile Botha said mechanisms were being established that would better integrate public servants with newly appointed provincial officers and legislators. Strategic management teams were being established in all provincial departments to help bridge the gulf between the old and new administrations. These teams would assist in communications between departmental tiers, improve access to information and deal with employee grievances and uncertainties. A TPA official said, however, that new structures could not be set up outside the present official structures. The PWV source said the culture of secrecy still predominating in the public service, together with uncertainty over authority structures, had contributed to the problems. "Nobody knows who's the boss or how seriously they should take requests from people they have never heard of. Mostly we have to rely on goodwill, and this is not always forthcoming." Access to demographic and research information had proven particularly difficult. This was having a significant effect on the province's ability to get started, the source said.
