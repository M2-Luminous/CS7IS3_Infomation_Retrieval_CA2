Musa said if the work to lift the siege of Sarajevo succeeds, it is necessary and desirable that this also be done at other besieged towns. Thus, several aspects of Serb aggression can be dealt with and a settlement process can begin in a better atmosphere. Musa added that Egypt is closely watching the situation. It will continue its contacts with the states concerned. He explained that Egypt is maintaining contacts with the European states. It is also maintaining contact with the Islamic state [Bosnia Herzegovina] within the context of the Islamic Conference Organization's interest in this issue.
