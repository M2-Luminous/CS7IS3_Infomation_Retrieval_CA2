SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;31, contains three provisions which will make it easier for individuals to register to vote in elections for Federal office. These include: (1) the simultaneous application for or renewal of drivers licenses and voter registration (the motor voter part of the bill); (2) the adoption and use of a ``mail'' application form for voter registration; and (3) the designation of State voter registration agencies, including among others, all offices in a State that provide ``public assistance'' and ``State-funded programs primarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.'' As defined in the conference report, the term ``public assistance agencies'' include ``*␣*␣* those State agencies in each State that administer or provide services under the food stamp, Medicaid, the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) programs''. H. Rep. No. 103&hyph;66 (1993), p. 19. According to section 7(a)(4) of the NVRA, public assistance offices shall: distribute mail voter registration forms; provide assistance in forms completion; and provide a service to accept completed forms and to transmit them to appropriate authorities. These services are to be available at the time of application, recertification, or renewal or when a change in address is reported. The NVRA also contains provisions addressing how applicants and recipients of public assistance are to be informed of their right to request or decline in this assistance. Section 7(a)(5) of the NVRA indicates that these offices shall not: seek to influence a party preference; display party-affiliated materials; discourage registration; or imply in any way that the availability of services or benefits is dependent upon a decision to register or not to register to vote. Current regulatory provisions at 45 CFR 205.50(a)(4) and 42 CFR 431.307 (a)(2), (b), and (c) result in barring the distribution of voter registration materials to AFDC and Medicaid applicants recipients. Enactment of the NVRA mandates that State and local public assistance offices conduct such activities. In order to comply with these statutory requirements, we propose to amend 45 CFR 205.50 and 42 CFR 431.307 to remove the bar from the States subject to NVRA. The bar, however, would continue to apply to States that are exempt from NVRA. States that permit voter registration at polling places (since March 11, 1993 or pursuant to State law enacted on or before that date) or States with no voter registration requirements for any voter in the state with respect to an election for Federal office (since March 11, 1993) are exempt from NVRA requirements.
