The importance of this theme is characterized not only by the increasing instability in the world and the countless possible causes of conflict, but also in the strongly emotional and politicized discussion in Latvia about the signing of the agreement between the Russian Federation and Latvia, about which there are many different views and arguments. Whatever I say today, always bear in mind that Latvia's security may be and partly is a constituent and essential element of Europe's security and stability. That is the first position which is at the foundation of my deliberations. The second is a specific feature of Latvia, that is, that our foreign and domestic security are unusually closely connected. My main emphasis will be on the political aspect of international security, not on its mechanism or its military component. In other words, the subject of this address is defining the cornerstone of Latvia's security and the discovery of the causes of insecurity, as well as determining our responses to the reaction to developments in the international situation. That is why I, first of all, will talk about the practice of international politics at the end of the 20th century; secondly, I will examine Latvia's place in the New World Order; thirdly, I will characterize the basic dimensions of Latvia's foreign policy; fourthly, I will offer insights into the domestic aspects and coherence of Latvia's security. In conclusion we will evaluate the possible responses, actions and the consequences for Latvia of those or other actions. The Practice of International Politics For most of the Twentieth century, talk of a collective security system and a few real efforts to realize it were ignored, and precedence was given to doctrines of military security and corresponding applications of international power politics. Thus, in international practice the concepts of "security" and "national security" were used as synonyms for military security. To a certain extent that is understandable: Not only did confrontations occur involving the world's great powers and individual groups of states, but also an active struggle for the division and redivision of the world, expansion of spheres of influence, etc. The criteria for great power security and national security were chiefly oriented not toward domestic security, but actually toward averting potential threats to the sphere of influence and territory and satisfying hegemonistic national interests far beyond the state's borders. The best example for that is the realization of the USSR's interests in the Baltic states, the 1939 Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, the aggressive annexation of the Baltic states into the USSR in 1940. It must be said that at the end of the Twentieth century the principles of European security have both changed essentially and have acquired new dimensions. Today, Europe turns its attention to the institutional dimensions to avoid crises and to reduce instability. That means that the goal of the international community is to achieve stable collective security with the intermediation of institutions so that their decisions can become meaningful. Along with that the classical concept of guaranteed security has become old fashioned, and in its place as a guarantee comes participation in a collective security system. With that emphasis that Latvia's security is guaranteed in its own way by the fact of participation in the ECSC, ZASP [expansion not provided], the "Partnership for Peace" program or the Western European Union, for along with that we are becoming part of this process. The alternative to this sort of participation can only be isolation and remaining in a grey zone. A plan to create a mutually inter-connected network of institutions in Europe was already planned in 1990, to provide the opportunity to use various crisis management systems, let's say political, economic or even cultural, and, to a lesser extent, military methods. This resolution came at the right time and the Eastern European countries gave the necessary support so that the transition process in those countries would not stop. Realizing that the New World Order after the Cold War is characterized by disorder and countless possible causes of conflict, but that doctrines of security have taken on a new content, we may not return to the failures of the international system of the past, especially to those which followed the end of the First World War, when self-isolation and nationalistic principles of security took priority. The ending of the Cold War's strictly fixed positions and along with that the time of easily modeled situation, and the time of rigid doctrine have also gone. The situation in the world, in Europe, and also around Latvia is developing very dynamically. In the current circumstances obviously the most pragmatic approach to this question is to formulate clearly the basic orientation of Latvia's security policy and foreign policy, which, depending on the situation, permit us to choose solutions most appropriate to Latvia's interests. Latvia in the New World Order The Prime Minister, the Fifth Saeima of the Republic of Latvia, and the Cabinet of Ministers have come to the point of a significant decision, which is related to the Republic of Latvia's international and domestic interests. The cornerstone of the contemporary dilemma is the draft agreement between the Republic of Latvia and the Russian Federation. To conclude the treaty, which is essential to Latvia, we would swear that we support the most significant post-war achievements in the international arena: international cooperation and integration. The importance of this event puts forth the demand to coordinate national political decisions with the still changing situation in international security. In this context I would like to remind you that the teamwork principle operates at both national and international. Such a team has already successfully developed within the context of Baltic cooperation, though Latvia still has not developed a national consensus and remains politically fragmented regarding acceptance of this critical decision. The contemporary world may think that Latvia is too small to influence the events which develop the planet's political life. The world's great powers are paying increased attention to the conclusion of the Latvian-Russian agreement. Thus for the first time in the history of our country the opportunity is presented to Latvia to make an investment in the security and stability of Europe and the world. What, then, could this investment be? First of all, a successful conclusion to our economic reforms has become significant also to the European security aggregate, for economic and security policy increasingly overlap. To ensure long-term stability, the development of the economic character will dominate over traditional security institutions. So, for example, while the European countries still give priority to NATO as a security organization, in the furture this priority could be given to the European Union/Western European Union institution, which in the longer term may be viewed as having greater potential. Latvia's cooperation agreement with the European Union and the status of members in the European Union must be understood as testimony to Europe's faith in Latvia, which calls for adequate steps in response. Secondly, our foreign policy must be appropriate to the changing international situation. Of course in the realm of foreign policy, to prepare for the future one must have a long-term vision, which would give an insight into the level of capabilities, which is necessary to react appropriately to respective situations in the future. Only our foreign policy values system can guarantee that we do not find ourselves in the gray zone of European security. In regard to this we must agree on the resources which must be devoted to supporting our doctrine in this area. To the RL [Republic of Latvia] that means full integration of diplomatic, economic, and military capability, which will in the aggregate sketch out our strategy in the area of security. Thirdly, although we can view the intuitive logic of our values and our position as self-evident, we would not need to isolate ourselves from other views. The draft agreement on withdrawal of the army and the compromise on the Skrunda early warning system question is an example which attests to our value system being Europeanist. Signing the agreement about the withdrawal of Russian armed forces from Latvia is the only real guarantee that the Russian armed forces will be withdrawn from Latvian territory by 31 August 1994. In fixing the end date for the withdrawal of the Russian armed forces the likelihood of international controls over this process are greatly increased. Signing the agreement eliminates the possibility that the Skrunda early warning system radar will be left to exploitation, secondly, and permits this to begin immediately: The installation's most dangerous aspect, the disassembling of the parts. The Skrunda installation is found in Latvia's territory without a treaty which fixes the date when its operations will cease, which would mean not controlling this installation's functioning in Latvia for an undetermined period of time. The execution of the treaty will be controlled by a three-way commission which would include also ECSC representatives. ECSC control over execution of this agreement is not the only guarantee. It will also be ensured by Latvian participation in the the "Partnership for Peace" program. The agreement will enhance Latvia's opportunities to cooperate with the Western collective security systems, proving that Latvia is a politically mature country, which is able to carry the politics of compromise in the interests of both Latvia and also the international community. By signing the agreement the Russian side undertakes a supplementary payment for the Skrunda early warning system radar being located in Latvia to compensate also the damage done to the surrounding environment, if that is established. During his recent visit in Western Europe Latvia's President received international support to establish a special fund to eliminate the ecological costs of Skrunda and the dismantlement of the radar. The government issued an order to establish a special fund to finance the relocation of retired military personnel. The agreement on Russian military retirees and their family members does not determine the status of these persons in the Republic of Latvia. That will be determined by Republic of Latvia legislation. I acknowledge that these agreements include several difficult compromises for Latvia, but in my view there is no more important task than fixing the end point for withdrawal of Russia's armed forces, and with that achieving the withdrawal of this army from Latvia as quickly as possible. Now, thanks to the initialed agreements, the so-called Yeltsin error and the activity of some part of the people (who easily manipulate, using historical analogies and ignorance of inter-connections), we acquire a surprisingly large opportunity to free ourselves not only from the army, but also from discharged military personnel, for we will never again have a real opportunity to actively draw in Western money to encourage implementation. If we lose this historic opportunity, then we could finally also lose our country, for I would not want to see a future of Latvian provincial decay in Russia's shadow. And if, by not signing the agreement, there is still an army in Latvia after 31 August, then they will all be the godsons of Grinblats, Kirsteins and Straume, for their care also remains here, which, permit me, depends on patriotism and an erroneous evaluation of the situation. How easily I could support the corps of critics of the agreement and I would do it if I did not see the inter-connectedness of the whole process. I would like to ask you and myself: Why is the opposition's view of the agreement the same both in Latvia and in Russia? Why is the signing of the agreement being opposed by a united front of seemingly diametrically opposed powers? I clearly see the situations in the case of either the agreement being signed or in the event that it is not signed. It is important not to permit manipulation of oneself or or others. Against that I place an understanding of our historical perspective and unpostponeable action. With appropriate action we will confirm also that basic idea of the New World Order, that is that this order can be created on the road of negotiation, that large and small countries can can become equal partners on the road on negotiation. The Basic Dimensions of Latvia's Foreign Policy We must explain what critical global factors can influence our country in the mid-nineties of this century, as well as entering the Twenty-first century. The chief goal of our country's foreign policy is to guarantee our capacity to answer the future development of events, which could threaten our national interest. These threats, of a local or international character, also include developments in the demographic situation, social unrest, conflict over the status of minorities, and a one-sided decree's basic view of peacekeeping or strengthening security operations in other countries, political fragmentation, as well as economic decline. We must clearly ascertain that real foreign policy cannot be based on many models at the same time, which is why security policy, at least at the level of conceptual thesis, should stand above squabbling by political parties. But unfortunately discussions of foreign policy and security policy issues are being exploited as tools for increasing capital in domestic politics. What Are the Dimensions of Latvia's Foreign Policy? 1) We aspire to a new regionalism: In the broadest meaning this policy is crowned with Baltic cooperation within the context of European integration and has sketched in as a new element in European architecture, five plus three, which must be understood as beginning cooperation between the Scandanavian states and all three Baltic states within the context of a broadened European Union. The second element: A union of Baltic Sea states as a regional organization established in the Northeastern European Baltic region. 2) We want to place a growing emphasis on a mutually connected network of institutions in Europe. Still, we must think not only about what we want to receive from these institutions, but also what we will give them. The European Union In the recent past Latvia's inclination toward the European Community meant primarily that we distance ourselves from the former USSR, not approaching Europe. As Latvia's relations with the European Union developed, our security policy in Europe's dimension has acquired the greatest importance. Member state status in the European Union pays security dividends, which in a critical situation may turn out to be of decisive importance. Each step in the economic realm brings us closer to the European Union--a free trade agreement, which takes effect on 1 January 1995 already, and after that its logical successor would be associate member state status, at the same time is an investment also in strengthening Latvia's security. That is not a cost of "feelings of security." Economically, too, there is no alternative to such a direction for Latvia. Of course, right now Latvia could, without great effort, orient itself mainly toward the broad CIS market, although, in predicting Latvia's future development, I am convinced that that would ensure the backwardness of Latvia's industrial technology and we will encounter additional and unnecessary risks because of this disorderly and unpredictable market. That does not mean that we must decline everything which this promising market may offer, but still in my view it would be better to enter this economic space together with the European Union and not by competing with it. The European Union is our road and hope for the future. The discussions to conclude the free trade agreement between the Baltic states and the European Union is an important part of this section of the road. As I have already stated, if the discussions conclude successfully, a free trade regime between the European Union and Latvia will go into effect on 1 January of next year, and will not apply to agricultural production. In addition, a four year transition period is anticipated during which both sides will agree on adapting the domestic market asymmetric protection principle to trade. In the future the European Union hopes to activate a political dialogue with the Baltic states and, as soon as the essential prerequisites are established, to begin discussions and to conclude agreements on offering associate member status. In fact the political dialogue has already begun and in the next few days its results will become apparent. But the result of incorrect actions by us may be that the political dialogue goes quiet. By offering associate member status to the Baltic states the European Union is clearly defining the boundary of its political interests and that will certainly permit a more effective neutralization of Russia realizing her "near abroad" concept in Latvia. The Western European Union This is an organization, which is at once the European Union's military union and the NATO pillar in Europe. Latvia's active participation in the Western European Union is a possibility, acquiring associate member state status in this organization. In the future the Western European Union anticipates having the decisive role in the European Union's joint defense policy, which is why it is possible that the highest possible participation status for Latvia will give us the opportunigy to have a hand in developing this policy from the very beginning. Besides active participation in the Western European Union will be one other road--Europe, through which Latvia will be able to align itself successfully with NATO. NATO, the "Partnership for Peace," the North Atlantic Cooperation Council Latvia's policy with regard to NATO is oriented toward full member state status, the most serious security guarantee that Latvia could possibly receive. We cannot be only "security consumers." Changes in the international situation have influenced the NATO philosophy also. NATO established the "Partnership for Peace" program for cooperation in the military and security areas, with the help of which non-NATO countries could gradually develop individually, each country's wishes and possibilities appropriate to the dialogue with the NATO alliance. "Partnership for Peace" today is another one of the threads which must be woven into Latvia's security blanket. The government must find an appropriate path which will, in this difficult economic time, balance the division of resources in Latvia's resolving many of the country's problems. We must determine how much the country of Latvia is ready to pay for today's and tomorrow's security. We must understand that wecan discuss it only so long as this country stands. The European Conference on Security and Cooperation The ECSC is the basic element of the European security architecture. Our professional diplomats are actively working within the confines the the ECSC, to include this organization in resolving Latvian-Russian relations. When the agreements are concluded, ECSC representatives will also be able to participate in the joint commissions to verify implementation of the Agreement on the Skrunda early warning system radar temporary functioning and dismantlement, as well as the Agreement on social compensation for discharged military personnel. After the Skrunda agreement is signed ECSC representatives also will participate in inspecting this installation. In speaking about the European Stability Pact or its so-called Baladur plan, we see that it has transformed from an idea to a constituent part of the European Union's joint foreign policy. Latvia has undertaken to join this pact in its essential problem resolution. This process, as is well known, will be inaugurated in the second half of May in Paris, at nineth pact inauguration conference. It is anticipated that twelve European Union countries and nine countries to which this initiative directly relates (the Baltic states, as well as Eastern and Central European states) and will participate. In Latvia's view, without border consolidation and resolution of minority problems, round table discussions must be given broader scope, also touching on the most important security and stability in economic and social aspects. Since discussions will take place and resolutions will be adopted in accordance with the basic principles of the UN, ESCS and EU, that is, not altering borders with force and viewing them as inviolate, but that can be discussed, then, so that further discussion about these and other problems, essential discussions about exit points, about the occupation of the Republic of Latvia, and legal and political aspects of the ensuing annexation. In our view cooperation in the security realm must be realized through bilateral agreements. Latvia's security blanket is made stronger by mutual relations threads which, supported by mutual interests, tie us to different states. The road to Europe works as a catalyst for Baltic cooperation. The Baltic states in their leaning toward Europe ever more clearly comprehend and more successfully realize this cooperation. Mutual consultations on security matters occur regularly, both at official levels (at the Prime Ministerial, Defense and Foreign Affairs Ministerial levels), and at the informal (regular foreign policy and defense planning conferences. Currently mutual coordination of Baltic states participation in the world security process is quite essential, for example, in the aforementioned project, the "Partnership for Peace," the Stability pact, as well as participation in defining our status in the Western European Union. The successful cooperation of the Baltic states is an example to the world community and international organizations have commended the Baltic states' jointly established peacekeeping force batallion, which will be preparing to participate in the peacekeeping activities of the UN and other organizations. We are united with Scandanavia in our mutual interests in the area of regional security and an understanding of the independence of the Baltic states. The Scandanavian countries are actively implementing the "Sovereignty Support Program," which helps to ensure domestic order and stability in the Baltic states. After the visit to Latvia by Polish President Lech Walesa a new era has begun in relations between Latvia and Poland. Latvia, Poland and other "Visegrad states" have mutual goals both in relation to moving closer to European organizations and NATO. We value highly the positive roles of Germany and France in the development of the European Union. Germany is Latvia's closest neighbor among the European Union's great powers. Germany has given and continues to give us essential assistance, supporting and accelerating our moving closer to Europe. Domestic Aspects of Latvia's Security The first task in developing our country's foreign policy and security policy is that we, as a nation, among ourselves, must agree on very significant matters. The most important is the necessary national unity (consensus) and political desire to maintain long-term faith in the chosen strategy in the area of our foreign policy and security policy. In addressing this strategy, our national interests must first be clearly defined. These are Latvia's national interests and goals: 1) maintaining the Republic of Latvia as a free and independent state which respects democratic values, is developing a free market economic system and guarantees protection of human rights; 2) developing the Republic of Latvia economically, which would ensure the opportunity for individual prosperity; 3) healthy and cooperative relations with neighboring states. Regardless of how the world order and architecture change, our country's interests and goals remain unchanged. Political and ideological threats to national security are the most dangerous and critical of all threats. Various anti-state oriented organizations and groupings continue to operate in Latvia, which do not support the idea of an independent state and whose goals are contrary to Latvia's interests. We all remember the goals and actions of these organizations during the October 1993 Moscow putsch. Former USSR and Russian Federation retired military personnel are viewed as one of the sources of the threats from within Latvia. As is known, the Northwestern Army Group headquarters now pays pensions to 22 thousand people. In addition, their spouses and children also live in Latvia. Altogether they are about 100 thousand people, or close to three percent of Latvia's population. We should not look for the image of the enemy among these people, for the military personnel problem must be resolved in a civilized way. Many USSR and Russian armed forces pensioners are active in the Veterans Rights Protection Union. If these Russian armed forces pensioners truly wish to demonstrate their loyalty to Latvia, than these people must publicly acknowledge the fact of Latvia's occupation in 1940. What is most critical for a person to feel secure? It is essential that he have health, shelter and a job, which ensures necessary income. Threats to this social value creates not only a certain feeling of insecurity, but also increases opportunities to manipulate people's emotions, sense of security, increases instability and strife. In addition, the state of domestic security also is also determined by crime, the economic and ecological situation, and social welfare. Let's just remember what Swedish Prime Minister Karl Bildt reminded Latvia of during his visit to Latvia: It is not possible to reach 100 percent security from the zero level in one instant.
