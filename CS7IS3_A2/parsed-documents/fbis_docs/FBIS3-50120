The response in the five electoral units was massive, regardless of the fact that no invitations were issued on this occasion and that the weather was bad. More than 60 percent of the voters have voted in this part of the republic of Serbian Krajina. The electoral commissions are still sorting the data and it is not certain yet which of the two candidates for president -- Milan Martic or Milan Babic -- has won the trust of the voters. We have learned that it is definite that both candidates won numerous votes and that the victory of one or another will be very narrow. The president of the republic of Serbian Krajina will be the candidate who wins the majority of votes. The first unofficial results will be known tomorrow.
