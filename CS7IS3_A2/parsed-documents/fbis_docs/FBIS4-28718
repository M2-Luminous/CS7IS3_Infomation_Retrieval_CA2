In order to prevent abuses from occurring in Japan's bureaucracy, it is necessary to strengthen the role of the prime minister and other top officials within government. Reform should be undertaken to strengthen the audit system, institute thorough post evaluations of the budget process, and move government toward a "system of accountability." 2. With greater deregulation and decentralization of government, there will also be a need to strengthen the role of the judiciary. Questions will arise abaout the training and education of those in the legal profession, including judges. It is time to look into reforming government in its entirety. 3. The "maximum mobilization system" that has been a characteristic of Japan's bureaucracy has created sectionalism among ministries and other government agencies, pitting them against each other for budget appropriations. With Limited Personnel, Aiming for Maximum Effect Japan's bureaucracy operates according to what can be called a "maximum resource mobilization and deployment system." This is a method to obtain maximum results from the resources (personnel, budget, etc.) that an organization has at its disposal. Japan's bureaucracy has been overly strained under this system to meet the demands of an extremely heavy workload. At the core of this system is competition among the various government agencies and ministries. Policy proposals coming from the bureaucracy have in large part been a result of this competition. When competition exists among organizational units, the horizontal authority structure or relationship among these units is clearly defined. On the other hand, the so-called division of labor within these units is only vaguely defined. Even when authority legally rests at the "top," special provisions will permit the decentralization of this authority within the unit. Moreover, the next deputy down the line is permitted to exercise the authority which has been delegated to him to make decisions and put his own official stamp to them. Intense cooperation exists among the various vertical layers within a unit, and serves to mobilize all its resources and energy. The one large room where the unit chief and those under him work together without partitions and walls to separate them is the physical expression of this system of cooperation. Due to a heavy workload, it is not unusual for the workday to last well beyond 1700. Personnel management sustains this kind of devotion by maintaining a career-oriented system and scrupulous attention to career promotions. What makes this maximum mobilization system work is the scarcity of available resources. Compared to other OECD countries, Japan's administrative agencies not only employ a relatively small number of public servants in total but operate on relatively small budgets. They also have "weak" authority, according to an analysis by John Haley. Haley, an American university professor, points out that, even though regulations and jurisdictional authority exist, existing laws often fail to provide sanctions against violators. This writer also once pointed out that, despite the importance of eminent domain, this right was not exercised by government because it lacked the authority to carry out such laws. It should also be pointed out that, in addition to having to manage with limited resources, the bureaucracy has extensive responsibilities. This combination of scarce resources and broad jurisdiction compounds the need for maximum mobilization. Maximum mobilization also applies outside the central system of ministries and public agencies. First of all, there is the tradition of regional governments. These local units have made it possible to maintain a small central administration. Instead of having the central government create local branch offices of its own, it delegates its work to these regional units. Thus, though regional administration increases in size and scope, the aggregate cost of government is reduced. Second, the administration works in partnership with various groups. The bureaucracy has created a number of industry and trade groups through which it tries to have its intentions known and accepted by the various sectors concerned. That it can exercise administrative guidance without direct authority is due to this tradition. Recently, criticism has been directed at the bureaucracy, albeit only half seriously, to the effect that "[the system serves] the interests of the ministries, not the national interest." Of course, this criticism is fairly groundless. But it will be worth our while to pay attention to the frustrations that are behind this sort of criticism. Bureaucrats play a very important role in the policymaking process. "But," doubting Thomases will ask, "when a policy fails, who takes responsibility?" "Can bureaucrats effect major shifts in policy on their own?" These kinds of concerns are behind recent criticisms of the bureaucracy. In truth, Japan's policies are in need of a change. For example, many critics are now pointing to the weaknesses of "convoy fleet" policies; in other words, the administration's attempts to protect industries by way of regulations has come under attack. On the whole, there is a strong demand for [less government intervention and] more private [initiative]. Though the demand is slightly different in the case of decentralization, this too being talked about. These are demands for a basic shift in public policy. The age of "catch-up" modernization is over, and what critics are calling for is a basic change in Japan's existing value system. This trend can be seen in the recommendations of the Second Provisional Administrative Research Committee and later in the recommendations of the Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform. There are also the Maekawa and Hiraiwa reports, both apparently in disagreement with the government's prescriptions for the economy. These are all recommendations in effect to change the basic premises of current policy. Increasing Importance of Leadership Ability The maximum mobilization system has brought sectionalism to Japan's ministries and government agencies. It has also brought about the kind of competitive behavior in making policy recommendations that puts their authors' self-interest first. How can such abuses be prevented? The first step is to strengthen the top of the organizational pyramid, starting with the prime minister. In other words, it means making revisions in the maximum mobilization system as it applies to ministries and government agencies. Cynics say this prescription is unreasonable, the bureaucracy is too strong. But is this really the case? Whether the ruling group represents a single party or a coalition of parties, the truism applies: "where there's a will, there's a way." Proof to this effect already exists. We need think only of recent events. That a "solution" was reached at the Uruguay Round concerning the liberalization of Japan's rice market, that the Ministry of Construction is now attempting to switch to a general bidding system--aren't these in fact indications that the Hosokawa coalition government and its cabinet of "outsiders" have changed the direction of Japan's ministries? Compare this, then, to the period from the general elections on 18 July 1993 to 6 August, when [Morihiro] Hosokawa was nominated prime minister. Government during this period came to a standstill. Again, with the recent "fall" of the Hosokawa government, it was impossible to carry out budget deliberations for fiscal 1994, and government activities came to a long halt. There are probably people who would say the rice market agreement had already all but been concluded and that changes to the bidding system were less a matter of who was in charge than a sign of the times. But policy doesn't come about merely because it is backed by the times or by public opinion; the will of the government's top leaders must be there to support it. As in other industrially advanced countries, the importance of national leadership at the very top levels of government has become more important than ever. Reforming the way budgets are formulated--for example, having it done at the "top"--is an effective way [to strengthen the upper levels of government]. It is necessary to transfer the [Ministry of Finance's] Budget Bureau to the prime minister's Cabinet Secretariat or establish an entirely new process which links the prime minister's office and the Budget and Tax Bureaus. The second direction which reform can take is to introduce certain "appropriateness" [outcome] standards to the evaluation of policy. While this will, of course, promote changes in policy, it will also act as a deterrent to the kind of competition for fiscal funds and the competition among policy recommendations one sees where everyone is fighting for a piece of the pie. Currently, those who evaluate budgets and personnel reshuffling do so in light of future plans rather than evaluating administrative activities in terms of audited results. It is more important to come up with a proposal that has the outer semblance of a good plan than to produce good results. To cite a familiar example: A university researcher's past performance record will be of little use to him even for a grant to cover essential scientific research expenses. In the research application form, anticipated results seem to be the one and only standard. On the other hand, even if the applicant shows good potential, if his proposal is not well written, it will be rejected. There is no process whereby an applicant can get prior advice that will help him develop this potential. There seems to be only a "weak" willingness to pursue what is good or original. In other words, this is a system with very little sensitivity to quality--whether with regard to policy or research. Results are secondary. What matters is being persuasive about the "appropriateness" of a proposal at the time that allocations are being made. By contrast, by revamping the external audit, which is based exclusively on legal criteria, and introducing appropriate [outcome-oriented] evaluation criteria, one has a system that can be applied to post-budget assessments. The results of this audit can then be reflected in the next round of budget appropriations. In the present system, too, a method has been devised to rationalize one-time budget appropriations. The requester is made to establish a long-term plan and to provide a performance record for previous years. This is not, however, a thorough method for assessing the "appropriateness" of his request. The recommendation, here, is to revamp the various functions of the existing audit system and introduce a method to provide for an outside evaluation. There are the Ministry of Finance's audit, which concerns fiscal efficiency, and the Management and Coordination Agency's administrative inspections [gyosei kansatsu], but at the present time, both of these have limited roles. The mainstay of Japan's audit system (what may properly be called an outside audit) is the audit conducted by the Board of Audit. It is required by the Constitution and is connected to the Diet's settlement process. It would seem to be quite fitting to have the Board of Audit adopt the idea of an "appropriateness" audit. What is wanted here, in other words, is a system whereby the activities of our public administrators--i.e., the agents of government and society as represented by the Diet and the Japanese citizen and ultimately by the prime minister and Japan's national parties--can be assessed in terms of their outcomes and these results can then be applied to the work of government. System of Accountability Finally, I would like to touch briefly on the impact that such a system will have. Political scientists are constantly concerned about where authority is located. Where will decentralization or deregulation shift this authority? We must consider such matters very seriously. Former National Land Agency vice minister Jun Shimokobe once said to those advocating decentralization: "Handing down authority increases the role of lawyers and the judiciary." To withdraw authority from one party is to assign it to another party. It has been Japan's system in the past to entrust most of this authority to the central administration. Before cutting back on its role, we should explore the possibility that, as the legislative functions [of elected officials] are restored, the role of the judiciary will also be coming more prominently to the fore. That portion of authority relinquished by the central administration will be fought over in legal disputes pitting private citizens against each other and the private citizen against the public administrator. When this occurs, what becomes important is the educational background of the judge and his ability to make policy judgments. There will also be concerns, for example, about the quality of university education and the system that trains judges and the fact that the legal profession is represented by too few practitioners, including judges. This article has explored one course that reform may take--namely, the shift from a system to maximize the mobilization of resources to a system of accountability. Any reform proposal needs to strike a balance and avoid the danger of discarding the strengths and merits of an existing system.
