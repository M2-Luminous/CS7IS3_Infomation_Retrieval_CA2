FR940817-2-00069 FR940817-2-00043 When the larger body of all available and appropriate 42 long-term emissions data on High-Tech 3000 is evaluated using these previously used EPA tests, the conclusion is that these increases (averaging 0.02 gm/mi for HC) bring about failure of the ``cause or contribute'' test in only 4 (for HC) or 5 (for CO) of the 19 model groups tested by the applicant and others. Failure of that test 43 must occur in at least 13 of the 19 model groups examined before the additive is deemed to have failed the overall test with 90% confidence. Fourteen of 19 must fail before the test is failed at the 95% confidence level. 44 42 Appropriate data are considered to be those collected with Federal Test Procedure (FTP) testing using an experimental design with a control group and no obvious sources of bias. The data referred to here include the eight 1988 models tested by Ethyl, the two 1991 models tested by Ford, and the eight 1992 and 1993 models tested by Ethyl. 43 In order for a model to fail the test, emissions from the additive-fueled vehicles must be sufficiently high that then percent of the represented fleet of that model group using the additive is predicted to exceed the standard beofre the end of its useful life. The control vehicles must reach this failure rate at a higher mileage than the additive-fueled vehicles. 44 These ``confidence levels'' correspond, respectively, to the 0.10 and 0.05 significance levels. The significance level is the probability that a decision to reject the null hypothesis (and find an increase) will be a result of sampling error and thus be incorrect. If the newer technology 1992 and 1993 vehicles tested by the applicant are examined in isolation from the earlier test programs, the data (with an average HC effect of 0.002 gm/mi) pass the historical tests even more easily than is the case for the data combinations examined above. None of the nine models failed the ``cause or contribute'' test for hydrocarbons and only one failed for carbon monoxide. Seven of nine models would have to fail for the additive to fail the overall sign test at the 90 percent confidence level and eight would have to fail for 95 percent confidence. The overall conclusion from the above analysis, then, is that Ethyl's additive passes the most critical of the historical tests with a comfortable margin. D. Data on Newer-Technology Vehicles Meet More Stringent Criteria Notwithstanding the Agency's conclusion that it would not be appropriate to require Ethyl to satisfy new statistical tests concerning which it has not been given prior notice and the Agency's decision to evaluate Ethyl's application primarily according to the previously utilized statistical tests, the Agency nevertheless considers its existing tests and the criteria that they implement to be obsolete under current conditions. 45 45 The tests are extremely conservative in that they place most of the burden of proof on the Agency rather than on the applicant. The ``cause or contribute'' test is failed by an engine family only under circumstances where emissions from the family are so high that an additive_caused increase in some pollutant pushes more than ten percent of the vehicle fleet into violation of the standard. Moreover, the final sign test that is applied to the model-specific results is failed by the additive only when it may be concluded with high confidence that more than half of the models in the represented population would fail the model-specific test. In practical situations with relatively small samples, this sign test permits a high percentage of the models in the sample to fail before the additive is declared to have failed the test. These tests, then, may permit the granting of waivers in the face of substantively significant emissions increments attributable to an additive_increments that would tend to offset the benefits from an increasingly stringent regulatory program aimed at bringing the nation's most serious air quality problems under control. Agency concerns with these tests were addressed previously in its decision on Ethyl's 1990 application (57 FR 2535, January 22, 1992) and in (58 FR 64761, December 9, 1993). Therefore, EPA has gone beyond the historical tests to examine Ethyl's data on the use of the additive with newer technology vehicles under more stringent criteria of the sort that seem to be warranted by current conditions. For this analysis, EPA chose to examine the additive's performance against the most stringent of the possible criteria_a requirement that the additive cause no statistically significant increase in emissions. If one uses a one-sided null hypothesis that the additive causes no increase in HC emissions, one may employ various statistical tests to examine the credibility of that hypothesis in light of the test results. One such test is the computer-intensive ``permutation test'' in a form called an ``approximate randomization'' test. 46 Application of this test to the full mileage range of HC emissions data from Ethyl's tests of 1992 and 1993 vehicles results in a failure to discern any ``real'' emissions increase at all_that is, no increase that we may not reasonably attribute to sampling error rather than to an additive effect on HC in the sampled vehicle population. 47 46 The permutation test is built around the idea that, if the null hypothesis is correct, the increase due to the additive in the sample is only one member of a distribution of all possible such increases computed from assignments of vehicle emissions to fuel groups within models. Only if the fuel-related increase from the sample is an extremely unusual result in theis distribution of possible increases is it reasonable to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the additive actually brought about an increase in emissions. The way that this method works in practice is that, on each iteration of the computer program, the computer randomly rearranges the fuel group assignments among the emission results within each model group separately. The emission values assigned (for that iteration) to the additive fuel group are then summed over the entire sample to form the test statistic. This process is repeated a very large number of times (one million in this case) and the resulting test statistics are tabulated. Only if the same test statistic, as computed from the empirical sample, exceeds a pre-determined percentage of the simulated test statistics may we reject the ``no-difference'' hypothesis and conclude with the necessary degree of certainty that an increase has occurred. 47 This conclusion holds even when the test is performed at the 0.10 significance level used in conducting the statistical testing on the data from Ethyl's 1978 application. It is important to note that the original Ethyl test fleet of 1988 model year vehicles that are now older than those representing the newest Ethyl data set did not fare as well and, as mentioned previously, do demonstrate statistically significant increases in HC emissions. E. Finding Based on all of the information then available concerning the potential effect of use of MMT in unleaded gasoline on regulated emissions, as submitted by Ethyl and others, the Administrator of EPA determined on November 30, 1994 that, ``Ethyl has satisfied its burden under Clean Air Act 211(f)(4) to establish that use of HiTEC 3000 at the specified concentration will not cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device or system (over the useful life of any vehicle in which such device or system is used) to achieve compliance by the vehicle with the emission standards with respect to which it has been certified.'' The basis for this determination was described briefly in the Administrator's November 30, 1994 notice, and has been reviewed in detail above. The November 30, 1994 determination was specific to Ethyl's present waiver application. As the Administrator made clear in the notice announcing the determination, it does not apply to any new application concerning either HiTEC 3000 or MMT in the event that this decision to deny Ethyl's application on the basis of concerns regarding potential health effects is upheld in any subsequent judicial review. Although Ethyl may be able to sustain its burden under Section 211(f)(4) in the context of any future waiver application, any such application must include satisfactory data addressing the effect on vehicles in production at that time and will be evaluated according to the statistical methods and criteria for evaluation of waiver applications in effect at that time.
