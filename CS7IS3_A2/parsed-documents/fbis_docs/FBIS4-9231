"To arrive at this stage," said the PLO leader, "we have and still are conducting arduous, long, and difficult negotiations with the Government of Israel in many places, in Washington, Oslo, Paris, Davos, and Cairo." "Today, we are meeting at this forum in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, which was among the first countries that have worked forcefully and that made constructive proposals and creative initiatives to realize just peace in the Middle East region and to find a negotiated settlement and just peace to the cause of Palestine," said Yasir 'Arafat. The PLO leader added that since his arrival in Bucharest he had concluded important and constructive negotiations with President Ion Iliescu, negotiations which dealt among other things with fostering the peace process, its success and the implementation of the agreements signed between the PLO and the government of Israel. PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat concluded his speech with an appeal: "I call for the carrying out of the requirements of this agreement and its articles on all the Palestinian, Arab, and Israeli bilateral and multilateral tracks. Any delay in implementing this agreement will gravely endanger the peace process and will open the way in front of the extremists, no matter what their identity is or their beliefs are, to destroy the peace process, and to be the reason behind causing the fall of more innocent victims on both the Palestinian and Israeli sides."
