Speaking at a ceremony for the presentation of the credentials of David Madden, the new British high commissioner in Cyprus, the president said the provocative defiance of these resolutions by the Turkish side is likely to hurt trust in the United Nations. President Kliridhis again attributed the lack of progress in the Cyprus issue to the lack of political will by the Turkish side. Presenting his credentials, the new British high commissioner stressed that the division of Cyprus has lasted a long time and that the British Government desires to see Cyprus converted into a successful bicommunal and bizonal federation safe for all Cypriots. Madden said his priority will be a Cyprus settlement through negotiations between the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities and welcomed the constructive approach maintained by the president toward realizing this goal.
