The upward trend is strongest in Finland, which is finally coming out of a four-year-long recession and looks set next year to be the fastest expanding of the Nordic countries. The pace is slower in Sweden, while Denmark and Norway gained good direction earlier on. This is shown for instance in the Nordic Outlook survey compiled by economists from S-E-Banken. Strong increase of investments and hefty export figures are expected to give Finland a growth rate of 4.5 percent in 1995. The country's 1-percent inflation rate, now the lowest in Europe, is also expected to stay low next year. After this, it is less certain whether the Finns can keep cost increases under control. A dynamic domestic demand may tempt companies to raise prices, and better profitability in the export industry may induce the workers to demand high pay raises. But the 20-percent unemployment rate, which is only expected to increase marginally next year, limits the risk of an overly rapid pay-structure increase. On the political front, Finland has two elections coming up -- European Union [EU] elections this fall and general elections in March 1995. The outcome of the EU elections seems to be the easiest to predict, with all opinion polls indicating that the Finns will say yes to the EU. Full Speed Ahead in Denmark Denmark too is facing new general elections, whose result will be difficult to predict. The election date has still to be set, but the elections must be held before 10 December this year. The entry of the Social Democrats into the government following Poul Schlueter's abrupt resignation in January 1993 may be a short interlude. If the Social Democrats get renewed confidence, the explanation may be that the Danish economy picked up speed already last year and continues to grow at a good pace. Soft financial policy and lower interest rates, according to the economists of Enskilda Banken, are the main forces behind the Danish recovery. Unemployment, which was a huge problem in Denmark much earlier than in the other Nordic countries, now seems set to drop from 12 percent this year to 11 percent next year. The strong recovery of the economy may become visible in the inflation statistics. A much more stringent financial policy can therefore be expected next year as a measure to avoid overheating. The Mainland Takes Over Norway is also in a rapid-growth phase with strong exports and rising private consumption. While the oil industry in Norway has switched into a lower gear, mainland Norway has finally gained the momentum that has been expected for many years. The mainland economy is now expected to achieve a growth rate of 3 percent in order to keep pace with the country's overall growth rate -- for the first time in seven years. Unemployment, which is lowest in Norway, is expected to drop from last year's 6 percent to 5.4 percent this year. Norway is the only one of the Nordic countries that does not have general elections in the offing. The Norwegians got through those last year. But this does not mean that Norway can look forward to a politically calm period -- the coming EU elections may become a real thriller in our neighbor country in the West. As for Sweden, the S-E-Banken economists predict a 2.3-percent growth figure for this and next year. This is the slowest expansion rate among the Nordic countries considering next year's expected growth figures of 4.5 percent for Finland, 3.4 percent for Denmark, and 2.8 percent for Norway.
