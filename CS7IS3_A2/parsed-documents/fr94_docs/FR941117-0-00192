FR941117-0-00192 FR941117-0-00013 Commenters indicated a willingness by providers of bond insurance, letters of credit, and other liquidity facilities to deposit publicly available reports in a repository, or otherwise note where such reports may be easily obtained. 85 The issuer or other obligated person providing the undertaking may then refer to such reports in their annual financial information and indicate the location where any such current annual reports can be obtained. Based upon such representations, providers of bond insurance, letters of credit, and liquidity facilities have been excepted from the definition of obligated person to eliminate the need to separately obtain and disseminate annual information about such providers. 85 See, e.g. , Memorandum of August 10, 1994 Meeting with Davis, Polk and Wardwell and Various Banks; Letter of Kutak Rock on Behalf of Financial Guaranty Insurers. One commenter recommended that bond insurers and banks providing letters of credit, who are not subject to periodic reporting requirements of the federal securities laws, send publicly available reports to the repositories. See Letter of ABA Urban Law Section. The Commission encourages industry participants to work together to adopt appropriate disclosure practices, both with respect to information concerning the provider contained in primary offering materials and on an ongoing basis in the annual financial information. The Commission will monitor developments in this area regarding the nature and quality of information made available about credit enhancers and liquidity providers, and the manner in which information is made available to determine whether further steps are necessary to assure access to this important body of information. (2) Who must undertake. A related question to whose information must be given is who must provide the information undertaking; the person providing the undertaking may not necessarily be the person about which the information relates. The Proposed Amendments would have required that the continuing information undertaking be provided by the issuer. A significant number of commenters raised concerns about which of potentially several persons that could be considered an issuer of municipal securities 86 would be expected to provide the undertaking and who would make that determination. 87 This was a particular concern in light of the potential liability of the issuer providing the undertaking for the provision and the content of information regarding other issuers and significant obligors_persons not necessarily under their control. Commenters made a number of suggestions to address these perceived ambiguities, including requiring that each issuer of a municipal security and each significant obligor undertake to provide the information only with respect to itself. 88 86 The term ``issuer of municipal securities,'' as defined in Rule 15c2&hyph;12, includes issuers of separate securities as well. 87 See, e.g. , Letter of ALHFA; Letter of Hawkins Delafield & Wood; Letter of Kutak Rock; Letter of National State Auditors Association; Letter of the Treasurer of the State of North Carolina. 88 See, e.g. , Letter of ABA Urban Law Section; Letter of ALHFA; Letter of Kutak Rock; Letter of NABL. In response to these concerns, and consistent with the general approach to affording underwriting participants significant flexibility, the undertaking provision has been revised to provide that the undertaking may be made by any issuer of the municipal securities being offered, or by any obligated person for which information is provided in the final official statement. An issuer of a municipal security may provide the undertaking, regardless of whether it is obligated on the municipal security. In addition, obligated persons may provide the undertaking regardless of whether they are deemed an issuer of municipal securities. These obligated persons may be the main, if not the only, credit source for repayment of the obligations on the municipal securities. This approach should allow the governmental issuer to shift to the obligated person the responsibility to provide information on a continuing basis. Thus, a Participating Underwriter need only reasonably determine that an issuer of municipal securities or an obligated person for which financial information or operating data is presented in the final official statement has agreed to provide the information called for by the rule; it will not be necessary to obtain an undertaking from all possible issuers and obligated persons. Moreover, to respond to the expressed concern that separate undertakings should be permitted, the amendments have been revised to recognize that undertakings may be provided in combination with other issuers and other obligated persons. In all cases, however, the undertakings, either individually or collectively, must constitute a commitment to provide information with respect to all the persons about which information must be provided on an annual basis. The amendments have been revised to clarify that dissemination responsibilities may be delegated to designated agents or to indenture trustees. As commenters pointed out, there are circumstances in which third parties may be effective in assisting issuers and obligated persons in disseminating the information. 89 Moreover, indenture trustees have expressed concerns about being considered ``designated agents'' in performing any dissemination role, based on the scope of, and standards affecting, their responsibilities as indenture trustees. 90 The language has been revised in response to clarify that, in addition to designated agents, issuers or obligated persons may contractually empower indenture trustees to disseminate information that an issuer or obligated person has agreed to provide. The parties may authorize an indenture trustee to provide certain information through specific instruction or on its own initiative upon becoming aware of particular facts. 89 See, e.g. , Letter of Bond Investors Association; Letter of PSA; Letter of Texas Public Finance Authority. 90 See, e.g. , Letter of Bank One Corporation; Letter of Reliance Trust Company; Letter of State Street Bank and Trust Company.
