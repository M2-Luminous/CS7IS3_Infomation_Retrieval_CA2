FBIS4-2293 "drchi068_v_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 TAIWAN Premier Condemns Beijing for Handling of Boat Incident Premier Condemns Beijing for Handling of Boat Incident OW0704133494 Taipei CNA in English 1255 GMT 7 Apr 94 OW0704133494 Taipei CNA English BFN [Text] Taipei, April 7 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan on Thursday [7 April] harshly denounced the Beijing regime for its handling of the incident in which 24 Taiwan tourists were killed on board a cruise boat in the central China province of Zhejiang last Thursday. "We felt shock upon learning the news (about the incident) on April 2," Lien said. "Since then, we've asked relevant government agencies, through the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), to get help from the Mainland authorities." All efforts by Taiwan to get information concerning the incident have been met with no response by Beijing, and every reasonable demand has been categorically rejected, Lien said after hearing a report by Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council. "The treatment of the incident by the Chinese communists," Lien stressed, "is an indication of the Beijing regime's nature -- its ignorance of basic human rights and its acting with utter disregard for human life." Lien's condemnation was the harshest ever by a ranking government official on the mysterious deaths. The 24 Taiwan travelers, along with six Mainland crew members and two guides, were burned to death inside the lower cabin of the cruise ship that was ferrying them across Qiandao lake last Thursday. Many commentators here suspect the victims were set afire by robbers who first pillaged the boat. As of now, little has been revealed about the incident due to Beijing's censorship. Relatives of the victims, as well as reporters, were denied access to the boat and the bodies, and the relatives were forced to accept Beijing demand that all the bodies be cremated in Mainland China. "We can hardly imagine how a government could handle such a big incident in such a dumb way," Lien said. "Should the issue not be fairly and reasonably handled and the truth not unfold, it would definitely have a severe impact on private exchanges across the Taiwan Strait." Lien also ordered the formation of a special task force to investigate the incident, to be led by Vice Premier Hsu Li-the. Pressure also continued to mount at the Legislative Yuan, with legislators demanding that the government halt the scheduled fifth round of talks between the SEF and the Mainland's Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait until Beijing opens up about the case. Meanwhile, relatives of the 24 victims plan to hold a press conference upon their arrival at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport on Saturday. The relatives, who departed for the Mainland last Sunday, were detained at a hotel by security officials following the breakdown of negotiations between the relatives and Mainland officials over how the victims' bodies would be handled.
