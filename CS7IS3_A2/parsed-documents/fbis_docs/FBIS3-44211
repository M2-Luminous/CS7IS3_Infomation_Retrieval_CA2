Under international pressure, President Banda has allowed multipartyism. Elections are coming up, and Malawi will be looking for moral and material encouragement from Britain. But her visit also coincides with skeletons jangling in Malawi's cupboards. There is a chorus of demands for an independent inquiry into the death of three ministers and an MP 10 years ago. The government insisted it was a car accident. Now, there are allegations of assassination. Ajoa Yeboa Afari asked Baroness Chalker what message she would be taking to Malawi. [Begin recording] [Chalker] Well, I should be asking questions about their process of change, because I want to be sure that they are following the path of good government, respect for human rights, and the rule of law and that they are continuing with their economic reform program. And we shall actually talk about the elections, which we hope will be free and fair. If those things are going in the right direction, then I should be able to discuss further aid with the Government of Malawi. But such aid will only take place, of course, after the election. [Afari] Since this is your first visit since 1987, does this indicate a change in the British attitude toward Malawi? [Chalker] I think that what has happened is that with the referendum in Malawi, we have seen a change for the better by their government. I have wanted to go back to Malawi, but it was not yet given the right signal to go before that change had taken place. I am extremely happy that a change has taken place and that I can now go and have what I know will be fruitful discussions, not only with the president and his ministers, but also with members of the opposition. [Afari] Talking about the right signals, I believe you are aware that just recently a policeman is alleged to have confessed to having taken part in the murder of some politicians a decade ago, apparently on government instructions. What would you say to people who would see your visit as a kind of boost for the government at this very controversial time? [Chalker] Well, first of all, I think you will understand, I cannot comment on an internal Malawian matter. There is recent progress on human rights in Malawi, but I shall be urging the Government of Malawi that that progress on human rights and the proper policing of the country should be continued. But I cannot comment on individual matters. [Afari] Baroness, I appreciate that. But I think since you are also insisting on good governance, perhaps your support otherwise might send some signals to other countries. [Chalker] Well, I am consistent to the last on this, and I will not allow our aid program to be used where government is not in the best interests of the people. [Afari] Baroness, would you then lend your support to a call for a campaign in Malawi for an independent inquiry into the atrocities? [Chalker] I cannot comment on that publicly. I do not have the details. Certainly, the people of Malawi deserve open, honest government, and I should do all I can to encourage the Government of Malawi to make sure they do have open, honest government. [end recording]
