Chavan has said that Pakistan, which has been supporting and instigating terrorism in Kashmir, has no moral right to raise the issue of alleged human rights abuses by security forces in the Kashmir valley. Talking to newsmen at the Jammu airport before his departure to Delhi after his three-day tour of Jammu and Doda region, Chavan said that Pakistan has launched a massive disinformation campaign against India at the international level, whereas large-scale human rights violations are taking place in other parts of Pakistan, he said. The Union Home Minister admitted that India has not been able to effectively counter the false and motivated campaign by Pakistan. He said that the government has taken a number of steps to put across the Indian point of view on the Kashmir issue at the international level. "We even propose to send non-government organisations to other countries to put across our case in the wake of "wild allegations levelled against our country," he said. Chavan further said that after the strike call given by the Pakistan government on the Kashmir issue no further proof was needed to show the complicity of Pakistan in fomenting trouble in the Kashmir valley. On the question of alleged use of excessive force at Kupwara, Chavan said that clear-cut instructions have been given to the security forces to show utmost restraint in dealing with such provocative situations. He said that an inquiry has been ordered by army into the episode also. Asked about the demand for appointing political advisors Chavan categorically said, "We do not propose to appoint political advisors." He said that Kashmir was a national issue and he would expect co-operation from all political parties to frame a common "strategy." No political party should try to exploit it for its "political gains," he added. About holding elections in the state, the Home Minister said that he has never ruled out holding elections in Jammu and Kashmir but no time limit could be given. Chavan said that he did meet Farooq Abdullah in Delhi for half-an-hour but refused to give further details about what transpired. He also announced that the monthly relief to the Kashmiri migrants has been raised from Rs.1000 per month to Rs.1500 per month. "The decision was taken after I had a talk with the Union Finance Minister Manmohan Singh on telephone last evening," he said. He said that he would also take up with the Finance Ministry the problems of overdraft, deficit and security related expenditure incurred by the state government. He further said that unless more aid was given to the J and K it would be difficult for the state to meet its annual plan targets. About his perception of the situation, he said that security forces are handling it in a co-ordinated manner which has not only given confidence to the government but also to the common man." Asked to comment upon the reported statement of Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto that Kashmir would soon be part of Pakistan, he retored, "It is their wish only." *
