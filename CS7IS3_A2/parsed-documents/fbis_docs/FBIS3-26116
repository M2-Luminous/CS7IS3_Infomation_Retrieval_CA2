Chien, who is currently on a speaking tour here, made the statement shortly after the ROC and Burkina Faso issued a joint communique in Taipei on the resumption of full diplomatic relations. The ROC first established diplomatic ties with Burkina Faso, then known as Upper Volta, in 1961, but suspended such ties in 1973 after the African nation recognized Beijing. Chien said the ROC stationed an agricultural mission in Burkina Faso in the 1960. "Many Burkina Faso people still remembered the achievements of our agricultural mission in helping raise their rice production," he noted. The ROC and Burkina Faso began discussion of resuming diplomatic ties two years ago. The Burkina Faso cabinet formally agreed to resume ties with the ROC in January, Chien said. With an area of 274,000 square kilometers and a population of 9.5 million, Burkina Faso became an independent nation in 1960 after decades of French colonial rule. It is rich in mineral resources and produces large quantities of cotton and livestock. Its political situation is stable, Chien said. Moreover, Chien added, Burkina Faso has great influence on other west African nations. "The resumption of diplomatic ties with Burkina Faso will facilitate our effort to promote exchanges with that part of the world," he noted. The ROC now maintains full diplomatic ties with eight African nations -- South Africa, Swaziland, Malawi, Liberia, Niger, Guinea-Bissau, the Central African Republic and Burkina Faso. It has opened a consulate general in Calabar, Nigeria and set up representative offices in Madagascar, Zaire and Angola bearing the ROC's full national title.
