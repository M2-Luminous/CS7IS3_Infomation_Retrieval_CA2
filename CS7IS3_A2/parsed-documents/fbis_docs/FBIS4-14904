Talk of Russia's "neoimperial ambitions" is becoming increasingly current. No matter what form these recriminations take, they invariably boil down to one thing: Russia is allegedly stepping up strong-arm pressure on its neighbors and demanding the right to "interfere" in their internal affairs on the pretext of peacekeeping activity -- virtually bypassing universally recognized norms of international law, moreover. At the same time what is being perpetrated is not just an arbitrary interpretation of the facts but also the impudent or unwitting distortion of these facts. The idea that Russia is allegedly "unilaterally" sending troops to unstable regions is the main argument used by people who take that kind of view of Russian peacekeeping in neighboring states. It is thence concluded that involving the world community in peacekeeping efforts to settle conflicts on the territory of the former USSR should consist in supervising Russia's actions. We do not want to exaggerate the importance of this line being taken in certain political and social circles in West and East. Most countries' leaders demonstrate a responsible and sober approach, acknowledging Russia's positive role in curbing and settling crisis situations. Russia would like to see a more lasting, true partnership founded on equality, mutual trust, and respect established in the field of peacekeeping in the CIS countries in actual fact and not just in declarations of intent. To this end we consider it timely to draw attention to a number of fundamental political and international-legal elements of Russia's involvement in peacekeeping activity in the CIS. Russia's actions are designed only to stop armed clashes in a number of the new independent states, stabilize the situation there, and create conditions for a long-term lasting settlement. We take pride in the fact that, thanks to the presence of Russian peacekeeping forces in "hot zones," far more numerous civilian casualties have been avoided. Our efforts are being mounted against the backdrop of the dramatically complex economic and financial situation in Russia itself, diverting considerable funds into peacekeeping: In the last 10 months alone this expenditure has totaled around 26 billion rubles (notwithstanding the difficulty of precise calculations and our peacekeepers' inadequate supplies compared with the UN "blue helmets"). There are over 15,000 Russian servicemen in hot spots on the territory of the CIS states. Peacekeeping in the Commonwealth countries is not a "Russian initiative." In all cases without exception our actions are being conducted at the request and with the consent of the appropriate states and warring parties. Peacekeeping contingents are sent on the basis of bilateral and multilateral agreements that accord with the norms of international law. This fully squares with the provisions of the UN Charter, whereby the possibility of resolving questions of peacekeeping on the basis of agreements between the interested states is not only entertained but even welcomed (Article 52 of the UN Charter). The only exception being coercive operations, which must be carried out under the leadership of the Security Council in accordance with Article 53 of the UN Charter. However, all the current peacekeeping operations on the territory of what was the USSR do not fall under that provision since they are not coercive but are being conducted with the consent of all the warring parties. The United Nations and the CSCE are regularly briefed on the progress of all these operations. Russia consistently advocates very extensive UN and CSCE involvement in settling conflicts in the CIS countries. But there is no need for any UN and CSCE "permission" for the operations involving Russia and its neighbors that are being carried out on the basis of the above criteria. These operations are being conducted on the basis of the sovereign rights of the corresponding states as enshrined in the UN Charter and need no further legitimization. The fact that cooperation with the United Nations and the CSCE and their active, thorough support for the peacekeeping efforts made by Russia and its neighbors could really help to settle the conflicts more effectively and rapidly is another matter. We also advocate this by asking the United Nations and the CSCE to cooperate with the peacekeeping operations in the CIS countries in various forms, including by sending missions, observers, advisers, etc. Russia will also be willing to take part in UN and CSCE peacekeeping operations on the territory of the former USSR if the parties to a particular conflict ask these organizations to set up such operations there and if it is decided to carry them out. However it must be stated that reaction to the CIS countries' repeated appeals to the United Nations and CSCE for support (in particular with regard to the conflicts in Abkhazia and Tajikistan) is being dragged out. Therefore agreements between Russia and its neighbors, along with mechanisms set up within the CIS framework, remain the main peacekeeping instruments in the region. It is thanks to them that the tasks of maintaining international peace and security, an inalienable part of ensuring global stability, are now being resolved. The world community should recognize that objective reality and move on to to closer cooperation with Russia and its neighbors. That would incidentally help all "doubters" to see the "transparency" of these peacekeeping operations and the unfounded nature of the suspicions on this score. In firmly pursuing a policy of ensuring peace and stability around its borders and meeting its pledges under agreements with the corresponding countries and within the CIS framework, Russia is not pitting its efforts against anyone whatsoever. We do not demand a special status for ourselves or an exclusive role, but nor are we evading our responsibility for the situation in what is a key region for Russia. We are prepared for constructive cooperation on these matters with the United Nations, the CSCE, and the world community as a whole.
