FR940720-1-00002 FR940720-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 7 CFR Part 301 [Docket No. 93&hyph;135&hyph;1] Imported Fire Ant; Addition of Authorized Chemical Treatment AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: We are proposing to amend the appendix to the imported fire ant regulations to add the insecticide tefluthrin (FORCE ® ) to the list of authorized chemicals for the treatment of containerized nursery stock that is to be certified for interstate movement from quarantined areas. We are also proposing to add provisions regarding the proper use of tefluthrin. This action would give nurseries another choice of insecticides with which to meet the certification requirement for interstate movement of containerized nursery stock. DATES: Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before August 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 93&hyph;135&hyph;1. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are requested to call ahead on (202) 690&hyph;2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Robert L. Brittingham, Operations Officer, Domestic and Emergency Operations, Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, room 640, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8247. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren and Solenopsis richteri Forel, are aggressive, stinging insects that, in large numbers, can seriously injure or even kill livestock, pets, and humans. Imported fire ants feed on crops, and their large, hard mounds damage farm and field machinery. The restrictions in ``Subpart_Imported Fire Ant'' (7 CFR §§301.81 through 301.81&hyph;10, referred to below as ``the regulations'') prevent the spread of the imported fire ant (IFA) on articles moving interstate by quarantining IFA-infested States or IFA-infested areas within States and imposing restrictions on the interstate movement of certain articles, known as regulated articles, from these quarantined States or areas. Sections 301.81&hyph;4 and 301.81&hyph;5 of the regulations provide, among other things, that regulated articles requiring treatment before interstate movement must be treated in accordance with the methods and procedures prescribed in the Appendix to Subpart ``Imported Fire Ant''_Portion of ``Imported Fire Ant Program Manual'' (referred to below as ``the Appendix''). The Appendix sets forth the treatment provisions of the ``Imported Fire Ant Program Manual.''
