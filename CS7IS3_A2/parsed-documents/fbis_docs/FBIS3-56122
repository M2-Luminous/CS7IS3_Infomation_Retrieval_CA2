I am speaking sincerely. However, we see that the Clinton administration is paying tribute to Belarus, and this is being done, first and foremost, by U. S. President Bill Clinton. This is brought about by the fact that we do not lay claims to nuclear weapons and we do not make nuclear weapons the subject of political bargaining. This is the most important thing. I hope that during our short meeting -- Clinton will stay with us no more than five hours -- we will discuss issues related solely to economic relations between Belarusian and U.S. business circles.
