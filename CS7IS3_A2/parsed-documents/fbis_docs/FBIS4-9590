Momcilovic: "The Courage and Risk of Mesokombinat in Leskovac"] [Text] Leskovac, 5 April -- Mesokombinat of Leskovac has become the new boss of the sheep farm on Cemernik, above Crna Trava, whose capacity has been increased to 4,000 head following reconstruction. This move on the part of the people from Leskovac is risky and brave, to say the least, since that farm -- in which the republic invested immense sums -- has never operated as it should have. The original investor was the work force of Vlasine-Produkt of Surdilica, which at one time was raising a herd of more than 2,000 sheep there. Crnotravka of Sastav Reka, the only agricultural organization in Crna Trava Opstina, which is close to the farm, expressed a willingness to take it over, provided of course it was fitted out for the sheep to overwinter. The republic had nothing against that, and it opened its purse for reconstruction of the farm, but Crnotravka, which at that time was part of Delisec of Vladin Han, was not able to develop livestock raising. The farm was vacant for two years, neglected and fleeced to the point where now investments are being made to equip it for the third time. Inexpensive Source of Raw Materials A farm on Vlasina experienced a similar destiny. When brucellosis decimated the herd, the people of Surdulica threw up their hands, and Simpo of Vranje jumped in and is now undertaking the development of livestock raising along with other things. "We are going into the hill-and-mountain region of Crna Trava, we are taking over abandoned facilities in order to round out the process of primary production and processing. We are creating an inexpensive source of raw materials for the production of livestock feed; we want to make full use of the natural resources of this region," says Sreten Ristic, director of Mesokombinat and people's deputy in the Yugoslav Assembly. Mesokombinat, Ristic adds, intends to develop livestock raising which will include not only the sheep farm on Cemernik, but also small, private sheep and dairy farms, and plans also call for a small horse farm to meet the needs of tourism. Plans also call for production of seed potatoes and silage corn, for which the conditions are ideal, and in the abandoned fittings factory in Crna Trava they will open a plant for processing herbs and edible forest products. Plans call for building a drier and cooler in that facility, and in the future they will have an operation to produce fruit juices and jams. Crna Trava is ecologically clean, and we will adopt a clean processing operation that will not threaten the environment. We will be involved with mushrooms, blueberries, medicinal herbs, and other edible forest products, Ristic said. "We are investing in the natural resources, while Mesokombinat is investing knowledge and money. We want to preserve what has been achieved in the past, to employ new people, and to halt the migration," says Milos Jovasevic, manager of Crnotravka. There Is No Livestock Feed They do not seem to be very worried at Mesokombinat about going to a place from which others have fled. "The main problem is livestock feed. We have already undertaken to revitalize the neglected soil, and we have begun improvement of a 380-hectare pasture. We have also prepared 30 hectares of land for the production of seed potatoes and silage corn. In this area there are about 3,000 hectares of forests, pastures, and plowland. All of this is neglected, but it can be put into shape," Sreten Ristic warns. "Mesokombinat's advantage is that it has its own retail network, so that the route of the finished product to the customer will be shorter, and that also means cheaper. Aside from creating a source of raw materials for their processing plants, this well-known producer and processor of meat will also be involved in a health food program. The Crna Trava climate offers excellent conditions for the production of milk, yogurt, and Kackavalj cheese. When it completes all these projects, which are already underway, Mesokombinat will round out conditions for development of rural tourism in the area of Crna Trava.
