Regarding this, Mr. (Yi Genari), chairman of the Russian Branch of the Pomminnyon International Committee to Promote Korean Reunification, came today to our Moscow radio station and spoke as follows: [Begin (Yi Genari) recording, in Russian with simultaneous translation into Korean] First of all, I would like to remind you that there are approximately 500,000 Koreans in the territory of the former USSR. Among them, over 120,000 Koreans -- including scholars, artists, well-educated doctors, technicians, and agricultural officials -- live in Russia. All of them are now living and working in and greatly contributing to the economic, scientific, and cultural development of the CIS countries. All of them are deeply rooted in this land. Speaking of the Koreans living in Sakhalin, all of them are workers who were forcibly taken into Sakhalin by the then Japanese imperialist aggressors from North and South Korea between 1938 and 1945. After the Japanese imperialists were defeated during WW II, the Japanese people who lived in Sakhalin were the only ones able to return to their home, but the Koreans had to stay there without their jobs. According to data provided by the Korean Association in Sakhalin, there are 1,700 Korean households in Sakhalin whose members were forced to live there before 1945. They are separated from their family members. After receiving the statement issued by the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society, I have come to believe that the problems of Koreans in Sakhalin should be jointly solved by Russia and the DPRK, only after the Japanese Government makes an official apology for its past act of forcibly taking them into Sakhalin and makes compensations for it. Therefore, the issue of Korean immigration from Sakhalin is not a matter of humanitarianism as demanded by Seoul, but rather has emerged as a political matter. In conclusion, I would like to express my deep appreciation to the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society for the protection of the interest of all Koreans, those who live in North and South Korea, as well as in foreign countries, including the CIS countries.
