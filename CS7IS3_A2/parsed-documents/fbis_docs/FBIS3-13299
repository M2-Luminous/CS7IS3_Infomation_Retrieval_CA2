After the meeting Bucan said that he discussed with Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid the agreement concluded by Bosnia-Herzegovina's Muslims and Croats to establish a confederal union with Croatia so that the Muslim-Croatian "canton" would become an independent state, but at the same time linked to Croatia in matters of joint defense, markets, and a customs union. He added that he sensed during his talks with Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid that the latter shares his view that the agreement is essential to a peaceful solution of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the general crisis in the former Yugoslavia. The Croatian ambassador said he expects the agreement to succeed in view of the longstanding friendship between Muslims and Catholics in that region. He referred to the existence of a mosque and Islamic center in Croatia. Bucan said he hopes Russia will play a positive role in ensuring the agreement's success.
