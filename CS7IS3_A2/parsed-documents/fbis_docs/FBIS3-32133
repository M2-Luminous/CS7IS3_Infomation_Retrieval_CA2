Alejandro Pillar Borja, delegate of the Social Development Secretariat in Chiapas, explained that the new resources will be channeled for the exclusive support of the two sectors. Approached by NOTIMEX after delivering a report on priorities to Manuel Camacho Soils, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, Pillar Borja explained that the support does not include luxury projects. On 1 January, groups of armed Indians seized four towns in Chiapas State in southeast Mexico, thus prompting military intervention and a quick conciliatory action by the government to restore peace. In a general way, the Indians are calling for attention to their urgent economic, political, and social needs. Pillar Borja stressed that "only the peasants and the Indians will present projects to be carried out in their places of origin (...) to lay the groundwork for better development in Chiapas." The regional committees of the National Solidarity Program (Pronasol) will be responsible for delivering and supervising the funds. In view of the problems caused by the conflict, Pronasol sped up its working plan to meet the most urgent demands of the poor people, the official explained.
