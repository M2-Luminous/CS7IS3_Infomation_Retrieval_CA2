The Miners Trade Union, however, has withdrawn from the signing of the protocol. [Correspondent Adam Sojka] The agreement envisages a 7.2-percent pay increase for January, compared to December last year, and a 10-percent increase for February, as compared to January. Earnings will remain at the February level in March. Moreover, the union side has pledged that it will only use legal means of protest in the future, means that are provided by the law on trade unions. At the same time, the board announced that it will request the law-enforcement bodies to stop criminal proceedings against people involved in the blockade of the board's offices and radio broadcasting networks in collieries. Both sides have agreed that no pay is due for the period of the strike, and the financial compensation for people who did not work will take place after making up for lost output. The board of the company, however, stipulated that the agreement would come into force when it is signed by all the trade unions. Only the Miners Trade Union refrained from initialling the agreement. At the moment, negotiations are being held concerning this matter. Unofficially, we have learned that the strike may be suspended, possibly even today.
