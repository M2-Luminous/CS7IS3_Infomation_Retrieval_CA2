The top coalition strategist, Ichiro Ozawa, told a news conference, "whether (possible partners) include the LDP or others, we had better discuss (the possibility of forming an alliance) openly, if only we can narrow our policy gaps to reach an agreement." Ozawa said, however, the ruling coalition might not be able to integrate all LDP legislators into its fold, saying, "the LDP has a variety of legislators whose ideas on diplomacy and domestic policies differ completely with each other." "Primarily, I want to reconcile policy differences with the Social Democratic Party (SDP)" to form an alliance, said the secretary general of Shinseito, a key coalition party. The coalition must work out a "more specific agreement" than the April 22 policy platform accord among coalition leaders in order to counteract the increasingly tense nuclear standoff on the Korean peninsula, he said. In the April 22 common policy agreement, coalition partners used fuzzy language to gloss over sharp gaps on tax system reforms and Japan's response to North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development. Kansei Nakano, new secretary general of the Democratic Socialist Party, another coalition party, told a separate news conference the coalition wants to entice into its fold "the SDP primarily, but we are not limiting options of our possible partners to the SDP alone." Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa called for quick policy coordination inside the coalition, saying, "even if we tried to appeal to the LDP to come to our camp, we would not be able to do so without working out a (more clear-cut common policy accord.)" The LDP responded to these calls with conflicting voices. Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe said he perceived it as a good idea to bring together conservative forces inside both the LDP and the ruling coalition, saying, "I prefer to push an orthodox approach" under which people of similar political ideas form a political bloc. LDP President Yohei Kono urged the ruling coalition to "first declare" that they will stop talking with the SDP on a possible merger before seeking to entice the LDP into its fold. He told a news conference in Gifu, Gifu Prefecture, "I cannot believe their proposal deserves our serious response in view of their approach which appears to be (made through) deceptive tactics." Meanwhile, the coalition's secretaries general agreed that the critical criteria for forming an alliance with any partners should be whether the coalition and such partners can alleviate policy gaps on tax reforms and Japan's response to the North Korean nuclear issue. They also agreed to start discussions next week on working out a more specific policy accord on these two points, including the issue of how sharply the government should raise the rate of the consumption tax from the current 3 percent. The ruling coalition is under strong parliamentary fire from the SDP and some LDP legislators, including Kono, who urged it to take a softer approach toward North Korea over the nuclear standoff.
