We were interested in the purpose of the visit and the impressions he brought back to Prague. [Vondra] I attended a regular annual consultation between the Foreign Ministries. With the single exception of the parliament observer mission, there has been no official mission there from our country since the elections. We discussed the agenda for next year. I met with two Russian deputy foreign ministers, Churkin and Kirov. I mentioned the crude oil issue in the context of the planned joint commission for the economy, which is supposed to be headed by deputy prime ministers -- we are waiting for the Russian component to be formed, which will be possible only after the restructuring of the Russian Government. A protocol is signed annually on the supplies of crude oil and power plant fuel, and the new commission will also deal with this issue. Regarding the recent five-day interruption in supply, I can only say that I do not believe that it was caused by some political influence. Crude oil prices were declining on the world markets at the end of last year, and I have the impression that Chemapol and Transpetrol were eliminating their stock. They acted in a market-conforming manner, and did not think of the complications that could arise if reserves smaller than usual are maintained, as happened at the beginning of this year before the Russian Government was formed. The processing of the relevant documents was delayed in the still non-market environment in the Russian Federation. [Cervinka] What is the new political climate like in Moscow? [Vondra] I wanted to utilize the visit to Moscow to probe the situation in the Russian parliament. I met with the deputies of all the main political streams, and it is my impression that a somewhat new stage is beginning in the development in the Russian Federation, that the future progress of particularly the economic reforms will be limited by the political will of the parliament, and the support for a rapid transfer to capitalism and free market will clearly decline. [Cervinka] Can these changes lead to a change of the development initiated in Russia? [Vondra] It is difficult to predict. A complete retardation of this development backwards [as published] may not be possible, but it is likely that a slow down and a change in the style of the reforms will occur, and a trend will commence toward command methods in the management of the economy. The anti-inflationary policy and budget stabilization will no longer be a priority. It is possible that inflation will be reduced in Russia by the non-market measures, a price regulation at the cost of a budget deficit. [Cervinka] Can the changes you have indicated affect relations between Prague and Moscow? [Vondra] I believe that we completed the basic transformation steps long time ago, and the distance between Prague and Moscow -- in this respect -- has grown sufficiently.
