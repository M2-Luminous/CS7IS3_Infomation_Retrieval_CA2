FR940318-2-00268 FR940318-2-00134 Poly (69/31 ethylene/cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 50.7 percent by weight of the materials used in its production. Poly (96.5/3.5 ethylene/cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) HTS number: 3907.60.00.90 CAS number: 26100&hyph;86&hyph;7 Poly (96.5/3.5 ethylene/cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) is derived from the taxable chemicals ethylene and xylene. Poly (96.5/3.5 ethylene/cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate), a solid, is produced predominantly by reacting dimethyl terephthalate with ethylene glycol and cyclohexanedimethanol. Dimethyl terephthalate is produced by the air oxidation of p-xylene to yield terephthalic acid, and the acid is subsequently esterified to the dimethyl ester with methanol. Ethylene glycol is produced via reaction of ethylene with oxygen and water, and cyclohexanedimethanol is produced via the hydrogenation of dimethyl terephthalate. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for Poly (96.5/3.5 ethylene/cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) is: 103.5 C 8 H 10 (xylene) + 97.5 C 2 H 4 (ethylene) + 359.25 O 2 (oxygen) + 97.5 H 2 O (water) + 24.5 H 2 (hydrogen) __> C 2 H 6 O 2 (C 10 H 8 O 4 )96.5(C 16 H 18 O 4 )3.5 (poly (96.5/3.5 ethylene/cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate)) + 414 H 2 O (water) Poly (96.5/3.5 ethylene/cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 50.7 percent by weight of the materials used in its production.
