President Franco was in Leticia, Colombia, at the Brazilian border this morning. [Begin unidentified reporter recording] Tabatinga, in the Amazon, is a border town where Brazil ends and Colombia begins. It does not produce anything, and its life depends on the government. Leticia, in Colombia, is in the same condition. The difference is that Leticia is in a country where the inflation rate does not reach 2 percent a month. But as the two towns are so close, the people experience the same social problems. Therefore the only solution for them is joint economic development. This is why President Itamar Franco came to Colombia to install with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria a neighborhood commission. From now on businessmen and representatives of the two governments will meet periodically in the border towns to discuss and find solutions to improving the standard of living of the population of the two towns. For example, the commission will carry out joint actions to fight cholera, and even drug trafficking, because a large part of the cocaine that goes to Europe and the United States comes from Colombia to Brazil through the Solimoes and Amazon Rivers. In the speeches installing the commission, the presidents of Colombian and Brazil agreed that the union of the South American countries is the best way for development.
