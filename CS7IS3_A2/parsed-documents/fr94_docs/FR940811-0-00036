FR940811-0-00036 FR940811-0-00016 C. Regulatory Requirements Consistency With the Coastal Zone Management Act EPA prepared a Coastal Consistency Determination (CCD) document based on the evaluations presented in the Final EIS. The CCD evaluated whether the proposed action_designation of Alternative Site 5 as described in the Final EIS as an ocean disposal site for up to 50 years, and with an annual capacity of 6 million cubic yards of dredged material meeting ocean disposal criteria_would be consistent with the provisions of the Coastal Zone Management Act. The CCD was formally presented to the California Coastal Commission at their public hearing on April 12, 1994. The Commission staff report recommended that the Commission concur with EPA's CCD, and the Commission voted unanimously to concur on the CCD without revision. Endangered Species Act Consultation During the EIS development process, EPA consulted with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) pursuant to provisions of the Endangered Species Act, regarding the potential for designation and use of any of the alternative ocean disposal sites under study to jeopardize the continued existence of any federally listed threatened or endangered species. This consultation process is fully documented in the Final EIS. NMFS and FWS concluded that none of the three alternative disposal sites, including Alternative Site 5, if designated and used for disposal of dredged material meeting ocean disposal criteria as described in the EIS, would jeopardize the continued existence of any federally listed threatened or endangered species. Compliance With Ocean Dumping Criteria Five general criteria are used in the selection and approval of ocean disposal sites for continuing use (40 CFR 228.5). First, sites must be selected to minimize interference with other activities, particularly avoiding fishery areas or major navigation areas. Second, sites must be situated such that temporary (during initial mixing) water quality perturbations caused by disposal operations would be reduced to normal ambient levels before reaching any beach, shoreline, sanctuary, or geographically limited fishery area. Third, if site designation studies show that any interim disposal site does not meet the site selection criteria, use of such site shall be terminated as soon as an alternate site can be designated. Fourth, disposal site size must be limited in order to localize for identification and control any immediate adverse impacts, and to facilitate effective monitoring for long-range effects. Fifth, EPA must, wherever feasible, designate ocean dumping sites beyond the edge of the continental shelf and where historical disposal has occurred. As described in the Final EIS, SF&hyph;DODS was specifically selected to comply with these general criteria. The SF&hyph;DODS meets these 5 general criteria. First, as discussed further below in discussing the 11 specific site selection criteria, the SF&hyph;DODS is not a significant fishery area, is not a major navigation area and otherwise has no geographically limited resource values that are not abundant in other parts of this coastal region. Second, as also discussed further below, dredged material deposited at the site is not expected to reach any significant area such as a marine sanctuary, beach, or other important natural resource area. Third, the SF&hyph;DODS is not an interim disposal site. Fourth, the site has an appropriately limited size and has been selected to allow for effective monitoring. Fifth, the site is beyond the continental shelf and is located in an area historically used for dumping. In addition to the 5 general criteria, 11 specific site selection criteria are listed in 40 CFR 228.6(a) of the EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations for evaluation of all candidate disposal sites. The 5 general criteria and the 11 specific factors overlap to a great degree. The SF&hyph;DODS site, as discussed below, is also acceptable under each of the 11 specific criteria. 1. Geographical Position, Depth of Water, Bottom Topography and Distance From Coast [40 CFR 228.6(a)(1). The center of the SF&hyph;DODS is located approximately 49 nautical miles (91 kilometers) west of the Golden Gate and occupies an area of 6.5 square nautical miles (22 square kilometers). Water depths within the area range between 8,200 to 9,840 feet (2,500 to 3,000 meters). Bathymetric and sediment surveys indicate that the site is located in a depositional area with natural topographic containment features. The site's depositional nature and natural topography will minimize the extent of potential impacts to the benthos, and will facilitate long-term containment of deposited material as well as site monitoring activities. 2. Location in Relation to Breeding, Spawning, Nursery, Feeding, or Passage Areas of Living Resources in Adult or Juvenile Phases [40 CFR 228.6(a)(2)] The SF&hyph;DODS site provides feeding and breeding areas for common resident benthic species. Floating larvae and eggs of various species are expected to be found at and near the water surface at the site as well as the alternative sites evaluated. However, designation of the site will not affect any geographically limited ( i.e. , unique) habitats, breeding sites, or critical areas that are essential to rare or endangered species. Both in comparison to on-shelf areas and to the other alternative sites evaluated, the site has the least potential for adverse impact to commercially important species. 3. Location in Relation to Beaches and Other Amenity Areas [40 CFR 228.6(a)(3)] The SF&hyph;DODS site is approximately 49 nautical miles (91 kilometers) west of the Golden Gate, 30 nautical miles (56 kilometers) from Pioneer Canyon, 6 nautical miles (11 kilometers) from the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS) boundary, and 24 nautical miles (45 kilometers) from the Farallon Islands. Ocean currents flow primarily to the northwest in the upper 2,600 to 3,000 feet (800 to 900 meters) of the water column, although periodic reversals in flow occur. Currents below 3,000 feet (900 meters) are generally weaker than near-surface currents. Therefore, any residual suspended solids from the SF&hyph;DODS site will move primarily in the north-northwest direction. Water column modeling results using a conservative approach and assuming disposal of 6 million cubic yards of dredged sediments per year indicate that suspended solid levels would decrease to background levels by the time the plume reaches the nearest amenity area (GFNMS boundary). Deposition modeling using a conservative approach and assuming disposal of 6 million cubic yards of dredged sediments per year indicates that the bulk of the disposed material would be deposited within the disposal site. For the above reasons, EPA has determined that aesthetic impacts of plumes, transport of dredged material to any shoreline, and alteration of any habitat of special biological significance or marine sanctuary will not occur if this site is designated.
