"These sensational news stories are aimed at attracting world attention on East Timor," he told the press after accompanying the visiting German state minister of foreign affairs, Ursula Seiler Albring, to a courtesy call on President Suharto. The Australian SYDNEY MORNING HERALD recently published a report of an "Orgy of Killing" in East Timor following what came to be called the "Dili incident." The daily was quoting a BBC documentary producer whose original footage of the Dili incident helped incite international condemnation on Indonesia's treatment of its youngest province. The British Broadcasting Corporation film maker said he had lived illegally in East Timor for 3 months. On that claim, Alatas said: "Without our notice, it would be very impossible for him to stay there for almost three months." When asked about a foreign journalist's application to produce a film in the province, Alatas said his ministry was still considering the request. On the occasion, the minister also disclosed his plans to visit Myanmar [Burma] and Laos at the invitation of the two countries. He said his visit to Myanmar was aimed at finding out the latest development in the country, including discussing matters for the next Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ministerial meeting. Commenting on China's protest over the recent "vacation visit" of Taiwanese President Li Teng-hui to Bali, Alatas said no other official protests were lodged after the end of Li's stay. He reiterated Indonesia's "one-China policy" and said that Jakarta recognised only mainland China as a nation and state. He stressed that ties between Indonesia and Taiwan were maintained at economic and trade level.
