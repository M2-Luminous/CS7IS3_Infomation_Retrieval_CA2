In a hard-hitting lecture to Manchester Business School, Mr Davies said the dramatic upheaval over the past decade required better training, a radical shake-up of the tax and benefits system and policies to help the long-term unemployed back into work. The leader of the employers' organisation distanced himself from the laissez-faire approach followed in the 1980's and urged action to cope with the sharp increase in joblessness among unskilled men. He said the widening gulf between rich and poor had not been matched by a universal increase in living standards. Over the past 10 years "the poorest 10 percent and some others have become absolutely poorer." The Government has always argued that all income groups have become better off in the past 15 years. Mr Davies said the 1.3 million increase in jobs during the 1980's was entirely accounted for by part-timers, mostly women. Mr Davies canvassed the idea of a negative income tax, which would top up the pay of those on low wages and thereby drag them out of the poverty trap. Despite giving guarded support to the Chancellor's attack on excessive boardroom payouts, Mr Davies concentrated on the changes lower down the income scale. "It is clear that, for a combination of reasons not by any means all under our control, British society is becoming more unequal," he said. The CBI chief said society was being transformed in four distinct ways -- a greater prevalence of divorce, increased participation in the workforce of part-time women from generally better-off households, widening income distribution and higher poverty. "These four changes have occurred quite rapidly and the cumulative effect of them is enormous." As a result, Mr Davies said Government and industry needed to rethink their attitudes to training, child care, benefits and working practices. "We must try to upskill workers displaced from traditional industries. And we start from a long way back, with a workforce which is endowed, on average, with significantly lower skills than our competitors." In his 18 months at the CBI Mr Davies has been no stranger to controversy, causing a flurry in government circles last autumn when he warned that business was unhappy about the anti-Brussels rhetoric from ministers at the Conservative party conference. The CBI chief said he was pleased that the paper prepared by the Treasury and the Department of Employment for next week's Jobs Summit in Detroit had stressed the need for a close look at ways of using the tax and benefits system to improve incentives to work. "But what will the `close look' signalled by this paper produce? Are we ready to accept that the tax and benefit system should be integrated more closely, with concepts such as negative income tax? Or is that too much like socialism?" Mr Davies defended management from blanket attacks on their pay increases, saying there was little evidence that overall there was "one law for the rich and one for the poor." But he added: "It is -- sometimes -- difficult to understand the rationale for packages which include high basic pay, large bonuses and big tranches of options, all at the same time. And when I say it is difficult, what I mean is, it is too difficult for me and I am not even going to try." He added that income inequality was greater in some of the world's most dynamic economies such as the U.S. Many people would accept greater inequality if the concomitant was a dynamic economy in which everyone's living standards rose. "But in the last decade that is not the way it has been." Mr Davies said that during the 1980's the average income of the top tenth of earners rose by 62 percent, the bottom 10 percent saw a fall of 14 percent. The numbers on income support had risen from 3 million to 4 million. "The new poor are heavily concentrated among one-parent families and the long-term unemployed."
