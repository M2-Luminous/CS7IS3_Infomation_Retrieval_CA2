FBIS4-31887 "dreeu116__a94014" FBIS-EEU-94-116-A Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 ANNEX Hungary Ambassador to United States Resigns Ambassador to United States Resigns AU1506183894 Budapest MTI in English 1733 GMT 15 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1506183894 Budapest MTI English BFN [Text] Budapest, 15 June (MTI) -- Hungarian Ambassador to the United States Pal Tar has sent his letter of resignation to Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky. In the letter, the ambassador pointed out that he had accepted the honorable position three years ago, at the request of the Antall government; however, his term has ended with the elections in Hungary. In his reply, the Foreign Minister said he understands and acknowledges the reasons for the resignation, and he accepts it. The resignation comes into effect on July 5, 1994, until which time the ambassador will continue to perform his official duties. The cabinet chief of the Foreign Ministry, Ferenc Oberfrank, commenting on the resignation, told MTI that although there have been no precedents over the last years for an active ambassador to resign, a decision of this kind cannot be termed exceptional in a well-operating democracy. Steps of this kind, when someone decides he can no longer identify with the new situation, or does not wish to continue on in the position, are very honorable in democratic, law-governed states, the cabinet chief pointed out. Oberfrank said that while he is not aware of other diplomats considering similar steps, this cannot be excluded. The natural rotation schedule of ambassadors will mean that some two dozen ambassadors will end their tours. New ambassadors were appointed in greater numbers in 1990, at the time of the change in system, but there were relatively few political appointees among them. Ambassadors usually spend four years in their posts, but they can essentially be called back at any time. When Ambassador Tar's resignation takes effect, the senior diplomat in line after him will take over the embassy as charge d'affaires ad interim until a new ambassador is appointed.
