Morning newspapers alleged three Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] commanders were shot and burnt to death by members of the ANC's self-defence unit [SDU] in Katlehong on Sunday in what was claimed to be an ongoing "war" between the two groups. The reports claimed members of the police's internal stability division [ISD] broke up the fighting, which continued from 11 AM to 6 PM. However, East Rand police spokesman Lt Deon Peens said no such deaths had been reported from the area on Sunday. Furthermore, the ISD was not called out and detectives at local police stations knew nothing about the fighting, Lt Peens said. Law and Order Ministry spokesman Capt Craig Kotze said it was worrying that "out-of-control" ANC self-defence units, especially on the volatile East Rand, had once again been exposed as the root cause of political violence. "It is the height of hypocrisy for the ANC to blame the SAP [South African Police] for the violence when killer ANC SDU's are not only deeply implicated in murdering policemen and eliminating political opponents, but are involved in bloody internal feuding," Capt Kotze said. He urged the ANC to co- operate with police to bring the perpetrators of SDU crimes to justice.
