Moroz, chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council, by unidentified correspondent; date and place not given -- recorded] [Text) [Unidentified correspondent] Oleksandr Oleksandrovich, perhaps the only serious result -- from the public viewpoint -- achieved in the three weeks that the new Supreme Council has been working is that it has managed to extinguish the fire of conflict with the Crimea which nearly flared up. You are going there on a visit. What is the purpose of your visit, and what are the Supreme Council's and your own future plans as regards this matter? [Moroz] Talking about the Crimean issue, this situation has brought people, including the deputies, into a state of agitation. When considering this question they have shown their maturity, an ability to make compromises and tolerance; they have taken into account the interests of the other side, or rather of different sides. I have recently spoken to many leaders in the Crimea, Ukraine, and Russia, and it seems to me that the conflict can be brought to a less intense level. We can find a solution to which all would agree. I hope to be able to fly to the Crimea next week. I know many residents of the Crimea and will have meetings with many representatives of the power structures, with the military, and with officials in charge of economic matters, and I hope that we will be able to find a reasonable way of resolving the issue, which would take into account both the interests of the Crimean people and of Ukraine. I think the interests of the peoples of Russia will not be ignored, either. It seems to me that this is the only way -- to settle all disagreements through talks. [Correspondent] How important at the present stage are the talks on the future of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol? [Moroz] We do not regard this as a separate issue. Here a very important condition is necessary -- that both sides should be willing to resolve the problem and not to drive it into an impasse. It appears to me that some solutions to this already exist. There are many issues here which should be settled in a principled and determined way, keeping the main purpose in mind -- that we should remain good neighbors forever. I think if we continue our work in this mood -- the Crimeans, Ukrainians, and Russians, and the world community as well...[pauses] Playing the Crimean card at the time when certain interested forces are standing behind each player is risky and this ought not to be done. Therefore, I see my task in using all means available to the Supreme Council as a legislative body and to its commissions in order to relax and remove the tension. Everyone will profit by this.
