The group discussed the recent public opinion poll on the troop withdrawal and the prolonged functioning of the former Soviet radar at Skrunda in Latvia. According to the poll, 52 percent of respondents want Russia to withdraw the Skrunda base together with the other remaining troops. The situation may have two explanations -- either the people really protest the signature of like agreements or they lack information on what the favorable solution of the problem could give to Latvia. The participants of the meeting agreed that the government should work to better inform the public about its work and intentions.
