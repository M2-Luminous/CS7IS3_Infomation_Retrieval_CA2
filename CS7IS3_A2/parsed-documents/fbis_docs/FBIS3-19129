Before the FDP Executive meeting which followed, party chairman Klaus Kinkel said it is now time to "roll up our sleeves." Kinkel regards the FDP's difficulty as walking a tightrope between loyalty to the coalition and taking a position of its own: "The FDP has the problem that it is a coalition partner in Bonn and, as far as actual issues and style are concerned, it wants to bring this coalition to a respectable end and it will do so. On the other hand, we have to show independence. So we are caught in a bind."
