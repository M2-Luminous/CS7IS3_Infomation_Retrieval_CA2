Zadonskiy was reacting to news reports which alleged that Russia's Choice was "examining Mr. Poltoranin's case". According to the media reports, the supposed grounds for Poltoranin's removal was his comment on "Russophobia in our press", uttered in a TV interview with Andrey Karaulov. Zadonskiy declared that there was no Poltoranin "case". The committtee chairman explained to Russia's Choice deputies at a faction meeting that he talked with Andrey Karaulov for four hours, only 40 minutes of which were eventually shown in the TV programme, "Moment of Truth". At the meeting, Poltoranin admitted that his "seditious" phrase could be interpreted as being incorrect. Zadonskiy reported that the Russia's Choice deputies were satisfied with Poltoranin's explanation. However, they urged upon him the importance of carefully weighing statements before they are made public, since every word which issues from the mouth of a party member reflects upon the image of Russia's Choice.
