Many grievances were set out in the suit, but perhaps the most important was that the electoral districts had been incorrectly apportioned. "In the administrative-territorial districts the number of voters fluctuates between 10,335 and 173,665," the plea runs. "This contradicts the basic provisions...." In the democrats' opinion, this would lead to "more than 60 percent of deputies being elected to the legislative assembly from a rural population which constitutes 47 percent of the oblast's inhabitants, while the 53 percent of voters who live in the cities will elect only 37 percent of the deputies." The court hearing lasted several days. Meanwhile, in the local press, the idea was hammered home -- whether for the benefit of the court or that of the voters -- that the basic provisions on the elections confirmed by the president were purely recommendatory in character. As a component of the Federation the oblast has the right to make its own amendments to the statute. This argument was also heard in the hall of sessions. In response Oleg Timofeyev, presiding over the court, said clearly: "In the event of a contradiction between federal law and another act, the federal law applies." Claims that the president's basic provisions on elections are recommendatory in character were also ruled unfounded. The large disproportions in the numbers of voters apparent in the division of the districts were ruled "not in conformity with the law." The court's ruling was made public, but it has not yet been issued either to the plaintiff or to the defendant. I have quoted this document from a tape recording. It has yet to be edited and printed, as is the custom in these cases.... Meanwhile, only two days remain before the elections. In the evening, people seeking seats in the local duma vied with one another in eloquence on local television as if nothing had happened. The Ulyanovsk press appeals: "We hope that the citizens of Ulyanovsk will not allow the elections to be disrupted, and will confirm this with a high turnout...." On 25 March Yuriy Goryachev, head of the oblast administration, ordered the elections postponed to a later date. He also adopted an appeal to the oblast's voters. This says that everything was ready for the elections, but that a group of political intriguers under the banner of democratic forces had managed to torpedo the elections. The oblast court, in Yu. Goryachev's opinion, was also under their thumb.
