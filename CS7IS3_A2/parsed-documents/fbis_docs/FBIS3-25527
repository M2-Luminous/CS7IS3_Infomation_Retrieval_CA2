However, acts of sabotage disrupted the voting in certain constituencies right from the start of voting, during electoral operations at the polling stations, or right after the voting booths closed. In the Sokode municipality district constituency in the Tchaoudjo Prefecture, polling officers were forced to suspend the morning's electoral process, close their polling stations, and thus block access to polling stations to some voters in Sokode municipal district who, in their panic, could not vote for the candidates of their choice. In the Haho Prefecture, six polling stations were ransacked, ballot boxes were broken, and ballot papers were scattered about before the start of voting. Some ballot boxes were stolen away right after the polling stations closed before the votes could be counted. What became of these ballot papers? In the fifth district of Lome municipality, incidents were recorded in some polling stations. Armed men prevented the counting of votes, especially in Aflao-Toshivi and Batome. Armed gangs caused panic in several polling stations, thus forcing voters to return home without performing their electoral duties. In Wawa Prefecture the review of electoral reports and vote counting were suspended when armed gangs broke into the office of the Gbalou Prefectoral Council, where the local electoral commission was holding a working session. Election papers were taken out and burned and electoral commission members terrorized. These unfortunate and anti-democratic incidents have certainly influenced the manner in which voters cast their votes in the said constituencies, where a number of voters were unable to vote. Under these conditions many voters could not freely and properly exercise their voting power. They were simply prevented from doing this and the ballot papers of those who were able to vote could not be counted before the announcement of the results. Those who commit these unacceptable acts of intolerance in a state where there is a the rule of law, compromise the fragile basis of our young democracy. In any case, it is up to the competent authorities to question the validity of the voting that was carried out in the affected constituencies.
