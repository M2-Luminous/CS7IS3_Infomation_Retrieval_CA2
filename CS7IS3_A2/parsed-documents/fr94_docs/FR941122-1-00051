FR941122-1-00051 FR941122-1-00015 47 CFR Part 90 [PR Docket No. 93&hyph;144, PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253; FCC 94&hyph;271] Facilitation of Future Development of SMR Systems in the 800 MHz Frequency Band; Implementation of Section 309(j) of the Communications Act_Competitive Bidding, 800 MHz SMR AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Commission has adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Further Notice) aimed at establishing a flexible regulatory scheme for Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) systems in the 800 MHz band. The intended effect of this Further Notice is to solicit comment on assignment of blocks of SMR spectrum in defined market-based service areas that will facilitate the development of wide-area, multi-channel SMR systems that are comparable to and compete with cellular and broadhand Personal Communications Services (PCS) systems; how the needs of smaller SMR systems primarily seeking to provide local service can best be accommodated under the proposed licensing scheme; regulatory treatment of existing SMR systems; application and licensing procedures for both the wide-area SMR spectrum blocks and locally licensed SMR channels; continued licensing of SMR systems on 800 MHz General Category channels or on other non-SMR channels through inter-category sharing; and competitive bidding procedures for resolution of mutually exclusive 800 MHz SMR applications. DATES: Comments must be filed on or before December 5, 1994, and reply comments must be filed on or before December 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: D'wana Speight, (202) 632&hyph;7125 (Private Radio Bureau, Land Mobile and Microwave Division). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making, PR Docket No. 93&hyph;144, PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, FCC 94&hyph;271, adopted October 20, 1994, and released November 4, 1994. The full text of the Further Notice is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Public Reference Center, Room 239, 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, DC. The complete text may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, N.W., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800. Summary of Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making 1. The Further Notice is intended to build upon and refine the Commission's previous efforts to promote the development of wide-area SMR service in the 800 MHz band, particularly its 1993 Notice of Proposed Rule Making that initiated this docket (8 FCC Rcd 3950 (1993), 58 FR 33062 (June 15, 1993)). The proposals presented in the Further Notice also are part of the Commission's continuing implementation of the new regulatory framework for mobile radio services enacted by Congress in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 312, 392 (Budget Act). 2 . In implementing the Budget Act, the Commission previously determined that its SMR channel assignment rules should be revised to facilitate licensing in some portion of the 800 MHz SMR band on a Major Trading Area (MTA) basis. In the Further Notice, the Commission proposes to divide the existing 14 MHz of SMR spectrum into two categories for future licensing: (a) the 10 MHz ``upper block'', comprised of the 200 contiguous SMR channels (Channels 401 to 600), would be licensed on an MTA basis; (b) the remaining 4 MHz, comprised of the 80 non-contiguous SMR channels, would be licensed in groups of five channels on a local basis. The Commission tentatively concludes that the 10 MHz upper block of SMR spectrum is best suited for wide-area licensing because of its contiguity.
