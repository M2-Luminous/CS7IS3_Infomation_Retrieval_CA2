He holds the U.S. Government responsible for the current situation in the country: [Begin Jean-Louis recording, in Creole] All the actions being taken by my colleagues, including deputies and senators, have been dictated by the State Department. We know this very well. The State Department has already forced the parliament, including deputies, senators, and the president, to take a number of measures such as -- you recall -- the Washington agreement. These same men had the president sign it, and got the parliament involved. Once we arrived here, they gave us no support for voting on the agreement, which could have ended the crisis. Second, they had us go to Governors Island, then in an underhanded manner, sabotaged the Governors Island Agreement. Consequently, it could not be implemented. They had us participate in the New York pact for the normalization of parliament, then encouraged the 18 January parliamentarians to create all the disturbances you now see going on. You know what happened in the Senate on 9 March. [end recording]
