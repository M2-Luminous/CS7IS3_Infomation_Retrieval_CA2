The smooth implementation of these measures requires a stable economic environment as a guarantee. Compared to the previous stage, economic operations since the beginning of the year have seen a very great qualitative improvement. Can you provide an overall assessment of this in terms of the current economic situation? [Qiu] Seen from the macroeconomic level, the economy has already passed through a difficult period and is now moving in a positive direction. The most difficult time was the period before the central macroeconomic regulatory and control measures were put in place in the second half of last year, when economic operations saw overheating in some areas, the fiscal and banking situations were quite serious, and price increases were rather swift. After the macroeconomic regulatory and control measures were implemented, these situations saw a turnaround. With a turn for the better in the fiscal and banking order, inflation, which had been quite serious for a time, is controlled. It should be said that the current economic situation is developing in a good direction. [JINGJI RIBAO] Could you please be more specific about the signals showing that development is proceeding in a positive direction? [Qiu] I think that this is reflected in the following areas: First, the state economy has seen a change from a situation of excessively fast growth to appropriate growth. In the first quarter of this year, GDP was 862 billion yuan, growth of 12.7 percent compared with the same period in the previous year. If we take into account the seasonal influence, whereby the agricultural proportion was quite low (8 percent) and the industrial proportion was quite high, growth over the year will convert to about 10 percent. This shows that the current speed of economic growth is being kept within the anticipated macroeconomically controlled range of 9 to 10 percent. Second, seen from the industrial situation, the development trend is positive. From January to April this year, growth in industrial added value was maintained at between 16 and 18 percent, and the major fluctuations experienced at the beginning of last year did not occur. This speed of development is ideal if we are to maintain a 9-10 percent rate of growth in the overall economy. Seen from the structure of industrial growth since the beginning of this year, there have been some positive changes. This has been reflected in the product mix, with sustained and stable growth being seen in the production of energy, major raw and semi-finished materials, and materials for agricultural use. The production of consumer products which have ready markets, such as electrical appliances and foodstuffs, has seen quite swift growth. The growth in production of investment goods has been controlled. In terms of the regional structure, high-speed growth has been maintained in the southeastern coastal areas and the Chang Jiang Delta area, while growth has accelerated each month in the western regions. In terms of the ownership structure, at the same time as speedy growth has been maintained in the nonstate-owned economy, production by state-owned enterprises has also seen monthly growth. Calculated on a comparable basis, over the period from January to April, production by state-owned enterprises was 4.7 percent up compared with the same period last year, and in April growth was 5 percent. It is predicted that May's growth will be even higher. At the same time, the performance of industrial enterprises, and, in particular, state-owned enterprises, has improved each month. In the first quarter of the year, the sales revenue of state-owned enterprises was up 7.8 percent compared with the same period last year. In April, growth was 8.3 percent. The production-sales ratios over the four months from January to April were 89 percent, 91 percent, 94 percent, and 94 percent, respectively. Profits of state-owned enterprises also saw a gradual turn for the better. The performance of many state-owned enterprises, based on comparable figures, saw an improvement compared to the same period of the previous year, and, even when assessed using the new method of calculation adopted this year, there has also been a continued turn for the better. For example, in accordance with the new method of calculation, in the first quarter of this year, profits and taxes realized by state-owned enterprises grew 16.3 percent compared with the same period last year. In April, growth was 37.7 percent. In this figure, profits in the first quarter fell 42.4 percent compared with the same period last year. However, in April there was a profits growth of 7.7 percent compared to the same period last year. At the same time, the proportion of enterprise losses as compared to enterprise profits also saw a clear decline compared with the same period last year. Third, the trend toward excessively swift growth in investment has been controlled and there has been an obvious drop in the rate of growth. The supply-demand relationship in the domestic market has seen marked improvement. Fourth, agricultural production has seen a warming. Fifth, the financial situation has seen a change from the quite grim circumstances in the first quarter to basic normality this year [sentence as published]. The wild collection of funds, the arbitrary establishment of banking organs, the dip in residents' savings, and the payment difficulties situation seen in many banks has been greatly improved. Since the last half of last year, residents' savings have grown stably again, there has been a marked improvement in the banking order, and the payments capacity of the banks has been strengthened. This has guaranteed the needs of current economic development and reform and opening up. Sixth, the fiscal situation has seen a turn for the better, fiscal revenue has grown steadily, and revenue and expenditures are basically balanced. Seventh, the international balance of payments situation has seen a turn for the better, exports have seen quite swift growth, and in April, export growth exceeded import growth for the first time since September 1992. Foreign exchange reserves have grown, and in April foreign exchange reserves were $8 billion up on the figure at the beginning of the year. Eighth, the people's standard of living has been improved and the income of many people has grown. In the last four months, the growth in the livelihood income of urban residents has been higher than the 10 percent rise in prices. Incomes of rural residents have also grown markedly. In the first quarter, if we exclude price increase factors, they grew 14 percent compared to the same period last year. The above positive changes show that since the second half of last year, the series of measures implemented by the party Central Committee and the State Council in order to carry out macroeconomic regulation and control and deepen reform have been correct and have already realized obvious achievements. [JINGJI RIBAO] If we are to maintain the fine situation seen in economic development at present, what aspects do we need to continue to pay attention to? [Qiu] My personal opinion is that, at present, the major question we need to pay attention to is prices. Since the beginning of this year, while the trend toward inflation has been controlled, market prices have grown quite quickly. Since the end of last year, due to the influence of various factors and because of the delayed effects of overheating and the chaos which has occurred in various aspects of economic life, market prices have experienced a situation of strong increases. From November last year to February this year, the monthly national retail price index grew at an average of 3.4 percent. From March onward, as governments at various levels adopted measures to hold prices down, the trend of rapid increase was controlled. In March, the monthly index growth rate fell to 0.9 percent, while in April it was 1.3 percent. However, seen from the monthly index growth, the level of prices is still somewhat high. From January to April national retail prices were up 20 percent compared with the same period last year, and while price rises were controlled in March and April in medium-sized and large cities, the price rise situation was still quite strong in rural areas and some small cities. Seen in terms of commodity types, those products which saw the greatest increases were mainly centered on those commodities needed in daily life. Thus, they had quite a strong impact on low-income households. Second, it is worth pointing out that market restraints have become increasingly prominent. Since the beginning of this year, domestic markets in some spheres have seen the beginnings of cooling down through stability. From January to April, real growth in national retail sales, after excluding price factors, was 4.2 percent. This was 3 to 4 percentage points lower than in a normal year. The production-sales ratio for industrial products was 92.2 percent, nearly 4 percentage points lower than normal. The volume of means of production traded also declined. Although this trend is very beneficial to structural readjustment, in the short term it will probably be accompanied by some negative effects on the economic cycle. In addition, some deep, structural contradictions which affect the bringing into play of the vigor of state-owned enterprises have not yet been eliminated, and some state-owned enterprises are still in serious difficulties. The scale of fixed-asset investment in projects under construction is still quite great, and some disadvantageous factors in agricultural production have still not been completely eliminated. These are all disadvantageous elements which affect the fine cycle of the economy. Seen from the deep level, we can recognize that the problems which exist in economic life were not formed overnight. Thus, the resolution of the problems cannot be completely achieved within a short period. Macroeconomic regulation and control in the earlier period only resolved the superficial effects of the problems. Also, the various reform measures implemented this year have not been in place for a long time. Thus, if we want the economy to enter a fine cycle, we need to continue to make great efforts. [JINGJI RIBAO] In response to the new changes in current economic life, what new policies should we adopt? [Qiu] In terms of the macroeconomy, the new changes which have appeared in economic life at present are mainly changes, whereby the resource restraints of an earlier period--restraints in terms of energy, raw resources and transport--have been changed into market restraints. That is to say, whether or a not a product has a market has become an important factor in whether an enterprise's production operations are good or bad. This change was due to the control of the transitional, speculative, short-term demand of the earlier period and to contradictions where products were not suited to the market or were unable to keep up with market changes becoming increasingly prominent. To a certain degree this reflected the fact that attempts to optimize the deployment of resources lagged behind the development of the situation. The appearance of this situation required, at the same time as deepening reform, a further improvement of macroeconomic regulation and control. That is to say, there is a need to switch from mainly controlling overall volumes to considering both control of overall volumes and structural readjustment, and a switch from mainly considering the macroeconomy to taking both macroeconomic and microeconomic considerations into account. Regulatory and control measures must be shifted from mainly monetary policies to those where both monetary and fiscal policies are utilized. As for the targets of regulation and control, we must switch from mainly short-term targets to the consideration of both short-term and long-term targets. Short-term targets refers to stabilizing prices and controlling inflation. Long-term targets refers to the healthy and sustained development of the economy. As to what is specifically needed at present, first, we must ensure that fixed-assets investment is maintained at an appropriate scale and that the investment structure is rational. Second, we need to implement various agricultural policies and strive to achieve a good harvest.
