However, students at Beijing's prestigious Qinghua University saw the lighter side of the executive Vice-Premier a few weeks ago when he gave a speech at the university's economic management institute. Mr Zhu, who happens to be president of the institute as well as governor of the People's Bank of China and a member of the politburo's standing committee, demonstrated that he not only had a detailed and comprehensive understanding of China's economic and financial system, but also a sense of humour. In discussing China's complex tax reforms which are being implemented this year, Mr Zhu noted that changing the tax system was the "most unpopular" and potentially dangerous of all economic reforms. "Three Japanese governments have fallen because of attempts to reform the taxation system. In Britain, Mrs [Margaret] Thatcher was forced out because of the poll tax and I myself have already started preparing for my own demise," he said. "However, at the moment things are looking good and no major problems have emerged," he added, much to the relief of his fans in the audience. In a nearly two-hour address, regularly interrupted by enthusiastic bursts of applause, Mr Zhu covered everything from the stock market to loss-making enterprises and financial reform and even found time to throw in a few jokes. For example, have you heard the one about the Soviet financial system? "Our old financial system was transplanted here from the old Soviet Union and the main characteristic of that system's accounting methods was that you could never actually be sure whether you had made money or lost money," Mr Zhu said. On a more serious note, the Vice-Premier quickly pointed out that China's accounting system was rapidly being brought in line with international standards. Some Western observers may have found this last comment rather more amusing but no one at Qinghua appeared to be laughing. In spite of the jokes, Mr Zhu was clearly not amused with the way many enterprise managers were blindly climbing on board the stock bandwagon. "Several enterprises leaders are not concentrating on improving management, but are thinking up all sorts of schemes to transform their business into a stock holding company," Mr Zhu said. "The result is the blind expansion of production, Ieading to an oversupply of products and huge amounts of waste," he added.
