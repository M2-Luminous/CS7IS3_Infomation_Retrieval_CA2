Shushkevich"] [Text] An initiative group supporting Stanislaw Shushkevich has collected over 100,000 signatures. This was declared by Henadz Shcharbinin, chief of the group for collecting signatures, at a news conference on 13 May. The 100,000th signature was placed by Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich. Hence, the initiative group for support of S. Shushkevich has cleared the hurdle set by the law on presidential elections. According to Aleh Trusaw, chairman of the Belarusian Social Democratic Association, specific difficulties have arisen recently when signature lists had to be registered at the executive committees: Most of these administration bodies worked according to their usual schedule -- with a break for lunch -- making it very inconvenient for collectors of signatures who had to leave work to register the signature lists. In Byalynichi, Stolbtsy, for example, officers of executive councils would unexpectedly leave their offices. Collection of signatures was impeded in various ways: There were cases where authorities broke up picket lines of collectors of signatures in Minsk and Gomel. Usually collectors were not allowed to enter garrisons. The initiative group reported all these facts to the Central Election Commission for Presidential Elections. Henadz Shcharbinin added that already a few days before 15 May, regional election commissions began checking petitions supporting Kebich. When they discovered violations of legislation, they corrected petitions according to the law. Henadz Shcharbinin demonstrated some petitions in support of Kebich, on which one person signed for several people, which is a serious violation of the law on elections.
