The ceremony began with the singing of the national anthem followed by a minute of silence in memory of Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon who was CC president until Good Friday [1 April), when he was assassinated. In his speech, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said his mind and heart were filled with two conflicting feelings regarding memories of Gonzalez: The first memory is his participation as president of the Commission of 30, which drafted the Constitution, and his role as alternate president of the National Constituent Assembly, which issued the current Constitution; and the second memory is his regrettable and painful death.
