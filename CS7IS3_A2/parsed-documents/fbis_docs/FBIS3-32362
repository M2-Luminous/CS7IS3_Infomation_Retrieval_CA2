During an impromptu news conference a few hours before the start of this country's general elections, Figueres cited the need to evaluate the current state of relations between Costa Rica and Cuba "without deviating from the issue of human rights, which concerns all Costa Ricans." "By respecting each country's decisions and internal situation, we are obligated to analyze, review this case to ascertain whether our position responds to current world realities," the presidential candidate said. He dodged voicing an opinion about the U.S. blockade against Cuba, saying "what should concern us is our relations and policies toward Cuba, and that is what we are going to reevaluate." "At any rate, I believe every country on the continent that still does not have relations with that nation (Cuba) should also review their policies," he added. Figueres said "the world evolves. Nothing should remain static. I believe we all must evaluate the possibility of improving things, seeking, of course, that all our countries and people, including the Cuban people, may have a better future." With respect to the possible reestablishment of diplomatic or consular relations during his eventual administration, the presidential candidate responded "first we must review our policies in light of world conditions; afterward, we will decide."
