Beginning this year, an enterprise will be coached for six months before it is allowed to issue stocks. In 1995, to help businesses replace their operating mechanisms and regulate their operations, businesses with prospects of selling stocks will be coached for one year -- six months before and six months after they sell stocks. Liu Hongru, vice chairman the State Council Securities Commission and chairman of the China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee, chaired and addressed the meeting about the supervision of the securities market over the past year and what will be done next. The meeting maintained: Under the State Council's leadership and the guidance of its "Tightening Macroeconomic Control Over Securities Markets Circular," government authorities, securities commission member units, and securities supervision committees have given priority to drawing up a law governing the stock market and to supervising the law's enforcement and the stock market's performance, thus upholding the principle of "exercising control and supervision over the securities market according to law." A new order of the securities market, especially the stock market, has thus been established. Since 1993, businesses raised 22.6 billion yuan through selling 4.6 billion yuan of A-class stocks to individual buyers. Markets for B-class stocks have also developed. While developing the domestic stock market, calculated steps have been taken to develop stock markets abroad. Currently, eight businesses are now selling stocks in Hong Kong and other parts of the world. Of these eight, the stocks of seven are listed in Hong Kong. Fairly good results have been achieved in the great deal of work done in supervising the brokerage businesses' performance. Analyzing the stock market, the meeting maintained that China's market is still in an embryonic stage, the nation should proceed cautiously step by step in developing its stock market, and it should make positive efforts in exploring a course for developing its stock market -- a course which is in line with the nation's socialist market economic system -- through improving various regulations and rules, strictly enforcing the law, and regulating the operations. According to Liu Hongru, because of the coaching system, most of the public stocks will not be sold to individual buyers and corporations until next year -- with the exception of those stocks that have already been allotted to local authorities or departments. The meeting pointed out that the way to issue new stocks will be improved by requiring prospective buyers to open accounts at the stock market, by controlling price increases, and by lowering operating costs. To tighten supervision over the listed companies, certain regulations governing these companies' replacement of operating mechanisms will be drawn up. Moreover, to guard against manipulation and under-the-table deals, trading regulations and supervisory measures will be improved. Securities organs and brokers violating laws and regulations will be punished according to the law. To increase the number of long-term investors, positive efforts will be made to cultivate institutional investors, and investment funds open to society will be allowed to be established in China. Pilot projects for issuing B-class stocks will be expanded, and the marketing of H-class stocks and their supervision will be made more efficient. The meeting reiterated that businesses within China must have State Council Securities Control Committee approval before they can sell their stocks overseas. The meeting said that supervision over the stock market must be tightened, that the stock market must operate ethically, and that precautionary measures must be taken to guard against corruption. The meeting examined and approved the measures drawn up by the China Securities Supervision and Administration Commission for regulating and stabilizing the stock market. These measures will be carried out step by step after full preparations have been made by the commission as well as by other relevant departments and committees.
