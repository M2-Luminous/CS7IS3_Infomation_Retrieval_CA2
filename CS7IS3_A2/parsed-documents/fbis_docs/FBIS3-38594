Fedorov even spoke of an "economic coup" and predicted that Russia would collapse. Yet, German business people in Moscow, who are used to difficulties, are not impressed by these gloomy forecasts. They are keeping up their -- in many cases long-standing -- contacts with their Russian partners. The resignation of former Economics Minister Gaydar and Finance Minister Fedorov, and the victory of right-wing extremist "Liberal-Democrat" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in the parliamentary election are regarded by Andrea von Knoop, representative of the German economy in Moscow, only as an "additional risk factor in the overall Russian risk." No German enterprise represented in Russia has reduced or even stopped its activities as a result. On the contrary, her office has been swamped by written requests from enterprises wanting to open an office in Moscow. Many German business people welcome the "certain predictability" offered by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his deputy, Oleg Soskovets, and their "European orientation," which contrasts with Gaydar's and Fedorov's American orientation. Last week, the activities of German business people in Russia intensified despite the crisis. Last Tuesday, for example, the Viag-Bayernwerk-Gruppe gave a presentation in Moscow. Carl-Wolfgang Sames, Viag adviser for Eastern Europe, said that despite all difficulties, the group was trying to gain a foothold in Russia, for example in the spheres of energy management, the aluminum industry, the steel industry, and transport logistics. Viag was planning to conclude agreements with Russian regions worth at least 100 million German marks for a period of about three years. Under the management of a German consortium, metals, ores, and chemical products should then be sold in the West and the revenues used for modernizing Russian enterprises. The Kloeckner concern is arranging the establishment of a "German Compensation and Clearing Corporation" in the near future to stimulate economic contacts between Germany, Russia, and other CIS countries. The company Linde is planning to set up offices in Moscow and several Russian regions in the near future. Salamander AG just opened a new distribution office in Moscow. It is designed to concentrate Salamander's activities, which used to be divided up among various buildings in the Moscow area, and make them more efficient. Salamander has had business connections with the former Soviet Union since 1976, and in 1987/88 established joint ventures in Leningrad and Vitebsk. After three years of negotiations, the Henkel group last year signed a contract on a 39 percent stake in the ERA AG, Tosno. ERA manufactures washing powder and detergents and glues. It is Henkel's second joint venture in Russia. The first has existed since 1990 in Engels on the Volga. Only recently, the AEG electric concern signed a deal for billions of marks that will go beyond the year 2000 on the development and the construction of three-phase train engines. As of 1998, some 200 engines should be built, mainly for use by the Russian state railroads. Siemens is so far represented on the Russian market with eight joint ventures, including in the spheres of telecommunications and the production of turbines. Moreover, Siemens services medical and computer technology. Individually, the Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) has applied for a general license to carry out banking transactions for foreign and Russian legal persons. Should this license not be granted in the foreseeable future -- President Yeltsin has suspended such activities by foreign banks in Russia by decree until 1996 for reasons of competition -- WestLB intends to confine itself to foreign customers for its banking deals.
