FR940428-0-00040 FR940428-0-00014 (6) Periodic Inspection Requirements The IDEM has committed to adhere to the Enforcement Guidance that specifies annual inspections for the facilities with mandatory follow-up at stations with violations or the development of an inspection schedule approved by USEPA through IDEM's inspection program plan. (7) Regulated Facility Compliance With Program Requirements The Indian Code (IC 13&hyph;7&hyph;13&hyph;1, states that any person who violates any provision of this article, IC 13&hyph;1&hyph;1, IC 13&hyph;1&hyph;3, or IC 13&hyph;1&hyph;11, or any regulation or standard adopted by one (1) of the boards (i.e., Indiana Air Pollution Control Board), or who violates any determination, permit, or order made or issued by the Commissioner (of IDEM) pursuant to this article, IC 13&hyph;1&hyph;1, or IC 13&hyph;1&hyph;3, is liable for a civil penalty not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) per day of any violation. In that this submittal is a regulation adopted by the IAPCB, a violation of which subjects the violator to penalties under IC 13&hyph;7&hyph;13&hyph;1, the submittal is consistent with the policy established by USEPA in its Enforcement Guidance. In addition, IDEM has submitted a civil penalty policy document which accounts for various factors in the assessment of an appropriate civil penalty for noncompliance with IAPCB rules. Some factors accounted for include: severity of the violation, intent, frequency of violations, and other factors. IV. Rulemaking Action The USEPA approves 326 IAC 8&hyph;1&hyph;0.5 and 8&hyph;4&hyph;6 as revisions to the Indiana ozone SIP because the submittal meets all the criteria required for approvability, as cited above. The Stage II vapor recovery SIP revision for the Lake, Porter, Clark, and Floyd Counties ozone nonattainment areas will be complete following this action. The USEPA is approving this action without prior proposal because the USEPA views this as a noncontroversial revision and anticipate no adverse comments. This action will be effective on June 27, 1994 unless, May 31, 1994 someone wishes to submit adverse comments. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on June 27, 1994. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989, (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators). A future document will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables this action remains classified as a Table 2. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 27, 1994. Filling a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review not does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
