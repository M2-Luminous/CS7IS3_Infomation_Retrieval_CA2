FBIS4-57284 "drlat095_c_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 MEXICO Candidate Cardenas Meets With EZLN's Marcos Candidate Cardenas Meets With EZLN's Marcos PA1605164194 Paris AFP in Spanish 1423 GMT 16 May 94 PA1605164194 Paris AFP Spanish BFN [By Antonio Ortega] [Text] Guadalupe Tepeyac, Mexico, 16 May (AFP) -- During a meeting with center-leftist Mexican presidential candidate Cuauthemoc Cardenas, Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] subcommander Marcos warned that, "if there is not a peaceful path" toward democracy in Mexico there will be "a path of war" leading to "a transition government and a Constituent Assembly." Cardenas is the first presidential candidate to attend a meeting with the rebels who took up arms on 1 January. The meeting was held on Zapatist territory in the Lacandon jungle and under strict EZLN security measures. The location is difficult to reach, requiring five hours of travel on unpaved roads. Marcos, EZLN's military commander, harshly criticized the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD], whose candidate Cardenas is, according to Marcos not the best alternative for the transition to democracy. Marcos said that PRD "imitates what poisons the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], that is, government circles' plotting, betrayal, the existence of power groups, and neglect of the rank and file." In addition, the PRD does not offer a political project designed for the majority of the Mexican people. Marcos said that EZLN differentiates between Cardenas and PRD, but he criticized the PRD campaign saying that through it the party attempts to "again side with the powerful ones." On 21 August, close to 50 million voters will elect a new Mexican president from among nine candidates. In an event regarded as "historic" by the participants, Cardenas met with the EZLN general command and talked with Marcos at length on two occasions during a special meeting near Guadalupe Tepeyac. In a message addressed to some 200 delegates of Zapatist communities, the presidential candidate said he shares "with many Mexicans" the rebels' demands, particularly regarding democracy and social justice. During an impromptu news conference, Cardenas said if he is elected he will respect any agreement reached between the extant government and EZLN and that otherwise he would seek a peaceful solution of the conflict "in the framework of the law." Also, he heard EZLN command leaders say they "have hopes for but mistrust" the candidates' because, they say, "the government has always deceived us with promises." The rebels, wearing balaclavas or colored bandannas on their faces, warned Cardenas that they are determined to fight "down to the last round of ammunition" for their demands, but they asked Cardenas "to keep the homeland in mind" if he attains office as president. The meeting, which was held during a Zapatist celebration, turned harsh because, while Cardenas spoke of settling the conflict peacefully in the framework of the law, the Zapatists virtually ruled out PRD, PRI, and the conservative PAN as guarantors of the transition to democracy and the possible originators of social changes in Mexico. Cardenas said he is optimistic about the possibility of a shift to democracy in Mexico, a framework through which a solution to the Chiapas problem should be sought, because without this solution "it will be impossible to solve the country's problems."
