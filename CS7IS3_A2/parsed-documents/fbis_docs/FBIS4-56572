Further details on this by reporter Leonel Perez Moya: [Begin Perez recording] Using its own resources, at a cost of 690,000 pesos, the revamped plant operates by gravity and replaces the old, inefficient installation that has been corroded by inclement weather. The approximate five km of conduits and pipes of various diameters, leading to the main duct, replaces the pumping system, with an annual savings of 590 megawatts of electricity. This inexpensive technology provides for a continuous supply of potable water to residents of Punta de Maisi on the easternmost point of the nation; to La Maquina, the center of Maisi Municipality; and to eight other populated settlements. Water is also carried to the largest coffee plant in the zone and to the family doctors' offices, to schools, minifarms, agricultural areas, and other socioeconomic institutions. [end recording]
