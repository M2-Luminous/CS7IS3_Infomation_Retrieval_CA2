In an interview published by the Jordanian newspaper AL DUSTUR at the end of the 30th summit of African heads of state which was quoted by the Sudanese AL INQADH AL-WATANI newspaper, Abu-Salih added that Sudan's relations with some Western states were better than its relations with Iran. He accused Britain of conveying misleading information on Sudan to the United States, which portrayed the people's defense camps as places for training foreigners in Sudan. He said we still challenge any quarter to prove that a single foreigner has completed his training in Sudan.
