The suspension remains valid until the Constitutional Court reaches a decision regarding the way in which the chamber passed the draft bill empowering the executive to rule by ordinances and contract and guarantee foreign loans [during the parliamentary recess]. Also today, at the request of the chamber's Standing Bureau, the Chamber of Deputies decided, by 167 votes to 3, with 84 abstentions, to summon an extraordinary session over 4-13 January. Among the draft bills scheduled to be discussed during that extraordinary session we would like to mention the ordinances issued by the government that have not yet been passed by parliament, the draft bill on the setting up and functioning of the Romanian radio broadcasting company and the Romanian television company, the draft bill on Romania's national defense, the draft bill on the extension of the housing contracts concluded between the state-owned housing companies and private tenants, the draft bill on the setting up of the public corporation for irrigation, and the draft bill on the value of real estate and the stock exchange. The session is currently still in progress. The Senate's special standing committees are in session today. Our correspondent Victor Spirache has reported that tomorrow at 1400 the Senate Standing Bureau is to hold a meeting to examine whether it is necessary to summon an extraordinary session of that parliamentary chamber as well.
