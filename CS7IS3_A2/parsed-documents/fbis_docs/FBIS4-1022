So says ANC National Chairperson Thabo Mbeki. Sisako Nyaka has the story. [Begin recording] [Nyaka] Mr. Mbeki told journalists in Johannesburg today that violence could be curbed by improved intelligence gathering and proper deployment of forces. [Mbeki] We can't deal with the situation simply by patrolling up and down the streets in military vehicles. Something additional has to be done. [Nyaka] He also referred to the build-up of weapons in the area and said that most of them had come from Mozambique. He told the journalists that there had recently been an increase in military training in Natal/kwaZulu. Mr. Mbeki warned against the whipping up of panic and fear by forces opposed to the election. [Mbeki] We notice that the same forces that are opposed to the elections are putting out all sorts of rumors. It's happened in other parts of this region before, the elections in Zimbabwe, before the elections in Namibia. We must put out that in the aftermath of the elections, we will get all sorts of trouble [sentence as heard]. [end recording]
