Colombian citizens Luis Carlos Diez Diez and Moises Nader Vargas, as well as Costa Rican citizen Carlos Alvarado were arrested during the police operation. According to the authorities, the group had smuggled approximately 720 kg of cocaine to Europe through Costa Rica. Public Security Minister Luis Fishman said 17 Costa Rican nationals currently detained in Spain, Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, and Italy on drug trafficking charges could belong to this group. During the past six years, the Colombian drug cartels have used Costa Rica to transfer cocaine to the United States and Europe. It is estimated that between two and four tons of cocaine are being shipped monthly from Costa Rica despite government efforts to crack-down on drug trafficking. Between 1992 and 1993, anti-narcotics agencies seized approximately 1,500 kg of cocaine. More than 100 foreigners, including several Colombians, are imprisoned in Costa Rican jails as result of their links to drug trafficking.
