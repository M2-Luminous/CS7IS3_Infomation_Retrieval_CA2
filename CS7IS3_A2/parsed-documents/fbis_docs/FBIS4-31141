The statement says that, following an investigation, a commission established that mines and explosive devices were stored in the depot in line with the regulations on keeping and storing such devices, so that the explosion did not spread. The statement also stresses that the explosion occurred outside the warehouse, and was caused when an explosive device of an unidentified type fell on the ground, most probably during transport. The device damaged about 20 other mines. The Army's investigating judge is continuing the inquiry into the incident.
