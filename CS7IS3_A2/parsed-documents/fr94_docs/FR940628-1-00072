FR940628-1-00072 FR940628-1-00014 Based on this analysis, NHTSA has decided not to propose a vehicle stability rule, and is deferring any further action on this subject until such time as information becomes available demonstrating the cost effectiveness of such a rule. The agency may reinitiate such a rulemaking upon receipt of such information. This termination of rulemaking on vehicle stability fulfills the statutory mandate of section 2502(b)(2)(B)(i). However, through the consumer information proposal being published today, and the other actions mentioned above, NHTSA is continuing to take a comprehensive approach to reducing rollover casualties. B. Summary of Proposed Consumer Information Regulation While NHTSA is terminating rulemaking on a vehicle stability standard, NHTSA believes that the correlation between stability and rollover risk is significant enough to justify proposing a consumer information regulation to relieve the possibility of uninformed risk. The agency believes that informing consumers of the relative resistance of different vehicles to rollover will influence consumers to purchase more stable vehicles and encourage manufacturers to improve the stability of their vehicles. The agency believes that these results are possible based on its assessment of how consumers and manufacturers reacted to the provision of frontal crashworthiness information through the New Car Assessment Program. The consumer information regulation being proposed by the agency would require manufacturers of passenger cars and light trucks to label their vehicles with information relating to rollover stability. To that end, manufacturers would be required to report a stability metric for each vehicle make/model to NHTSA by January 1 of each year. Manufacturers would decide how to group vehicle make/models for the purpose of reporting stability metrics for those groups. To ensure that the information is neither understated nor overstated, the reported stability metric would be measured with a specified procedure and an accuracy tolerance on reported data would be required. NHTSA would use the information reported by manufacturers to provide the manufacturers with the ranges of metrics for both passenger cars and light trucks by April 1 of each year. For comparison purposes, these ranges would be included on vehicle labels. New vehicles manufactured after September 1, 1996 would be required to have a prescribed window label listing the metric of the labeled vehicle, the range of that metric for cars and the range for light trucks. In addition, prescribed language on the label would explain the significance of the metric, warn consumers that all vehicles can and do roll over, and remind consumers to always wear seat belts. The proposed regulation would also require manufacturers to include the information on the vehicle label in the vehicle's owner's manual. The agency requests comment on whether or not the proposed vehicle label should be a permanent sticker, in addition to the window label which would be removed after first sale. If a commenter believes the label should be permanent, NHTSA requests comment on whether the permanent sticker should be required on all vehicles, or only some subset of vehicles with lower rollover stability. Finally, NHTSA requests suggestions on placement and size of a permanent sticker. A permanent sticker would be useful to purchasers of used vehicles and drivers of rental vehicles. NHTSA is considering two metrics for providing information regarding rollover stability: critical sliding velocity and tilt table angle. Critical sliding velocity is a measure of the minimum lateral (sideways) vehicle velocity required to initiate rollover when the vehicle is tripped by something in the roadway environment, e.g., a curb. Tilt table angle is the angle at which the last uphill tire of the vehicle lifts off a platform as the platform is increasingly tilted. NHTSA is proposing two different options for specifying stability information using these metrics. First, NHTSA may select one of the two metrics to appear on the label. For example, if the agency selected tilt table angle, it would require that the specific angle for each vehicle be shown on its label. Second, NHTSA may require the label to include a nonquantitative statement concerning the vehicle's rollover resistance based on one or both of the metrics. For example, instead of stating a specific angle, the label might use symbols such as one, two, or three stars. V. Agency Analysis of the Vehicle Stability Metrics A.
