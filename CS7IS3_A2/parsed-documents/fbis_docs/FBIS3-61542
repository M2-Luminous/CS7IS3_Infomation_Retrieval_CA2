Already in the years of the developing New Economic Plan the rights to their inventions were actually taken away, patents being replaced by Author's Certificates, which to a full measure only the state could use at its pleasure. However, the collapse of socialism, marked by the breakup of the union, only increased their concerns. The new patent legislation adopted at that time was inefficacious, and beginning on 1 December 1991 Gospatent SSSR ceased to exist. The unified patent space was destroyed and the vacuum created in the system for the protection of industrial property, it goes without saying, could not go on for long. It then seemed most logical to establish national patent offices in the forming independent states. However, this logic was dictated primarily by considerations of a political nature. It was clear from the very beginning to the professionals working in the field of patent expertise, however, that neither they nor inventors would come out well with such a shape of things. First of all, what naturally happened was that all the specialists and patent archives were concentrated in Moscow. In the overwhelming majority of the new states there was no one to establish their own patent offices and it was known that the protection documents issued by them could make no pretense at authority. Second, the disintegration of patenting activity put before inventors a task that was not easy solved: in each former republic of the union the application had to be submitted in the national language and the same applied to correspondence with the expert. It is easy to imagine that all this entails considerable costs, to which corresponding fees also must be added. Third, foreign applicants found themselves in a completely improbable situation: for protection of their rights over 1/6 the surface of the planet, instead of one patent, they had to finalize 15, as already mentioned, not characterized by a solid reputation. In this very uncomfortable situation it was Rospatent, perhaps, which felt itself on the surest ground. It was the successor of the corresponding union structure, also inheriting from it both the personnel and archives. This circumstance, as well as the fact that most of the inventive potential is concentrated precisely in Russia, enabled the directors of this office to nourish hopes that it would be able to survive the crisis with minimum losses. In fact everything proved to be considerably worse. Whereas earlier the All-Union Institute of State Patent Expertise had annually received up to 200 thousand applications for inventions alone and among these more than 65% were those of Russian inventors, now the number of applications has fallen to 50 thousand. In Russia patenting activity is now experiencing an unprecedented decline, specialists and experts are threatened with cutbacks and unemployment, and all this is occurring at a time when patent legislation in the country for the first time has possibly approached the level of the best world models. It cannot be said that the organizers of the patent service have not attempted to get around the stumbling blocks and restore a unified patent space. Already on 27 December 1991 representatives of Armenia, Belorussia, Moldavia, Russia, Tajikistan and the Ukraine signed in Minsk an interim agreement on the protection of industrial property. This act was then regarded as a step toward the adoption of an Intergovernmental Patent Convention. In order for it to enter into force it was necessary that three of the states signing it meet three conditions: recognize validity in its territory of the norm-setting basis of the agreement, recognize the validity of the earlier issued protective documents of the USSR and send a representative and his deputy to an administrative council. The only state conforming to all this was the Ukraine. However, separatist strivings then seemed more attractive to the others, including Russia. Fortunately, the idea of intergovernmental cooperation for the protection of industrial property, whose viability has been beautifully demonstrated by the European Patent Office, was not buried even in the territory of the former USSR. In March 1993 in Moscow there was a conference of CIS heads of state at which an agreement was signed on measures for protecting industrial property and the organization of an intergovernmental council. Its first session was held in May and in September the draft of a patent convention was prepared which was called the Eurasian Patent Convention. This document was given high marks by the World Organization of Intellectual Property and it is expected that in late December-early January its finalized variant will be presented for signature by the heads of state. In the opinion of Viktor Blinnikov, chairman of the International Bureau for the Protection of Industrial Property, there are already real chances for restoring a unified patent space within a year. The Eurasian Patent Office will become the second major regional association and already on the eve of its birth it is attracting the interest not only of the former members of the union, but also neighbors, members of the former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. The interest of China, where, in contrast to Russia, there has been no dropoff of inventive activity, also is of special importance. In principle any interested country can become a member of this pool and no membership dues are required from it, but the activity of the Eurasian Patent Office will be on a pay-for-itself basis. Although the new structure will become an exclusively international organization--the specialists will even have diplomatic status--its organization will bring more than a little moral and material profit to Russia. The headquarters will be in Moscow, all documentation will be in the Russian language, but for conducting a patent search the services of Rospatent specialists will be drawn upon and its archives will be used. According to Viktor Blinnikov, all these services will be suitably paid for, which possibly will assist Russian patent specialists to survive difficult times, and the appearance of a universal patent will stimulate both national and foreign inventors. It goes without saying, if both of these groups hold out another year and the project is successfully implemented.
