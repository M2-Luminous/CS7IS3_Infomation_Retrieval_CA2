FR941012-2-00107 FR941012-2-00073 NUCLEAR WASTE TECHNICAL REVIEW BOARD NWTRB/DOE Meeting on Thermal Management for a High-Level Waste Repository Pursuant to its authority under section 5051 of Public Law 100&hyph;203, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board's Hydrogeology & Geochemistry Panel and Structural Geology & Geoengineering Panel will hold a joint meeting with the Department of Energy (DOE) on Thursday, November 17, and Friday, November 18, 1994, in Washington D.C. The meeting will be held at the Dupont Plaza Hotel, 1500 New Hampshire Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036; Tel (800) 841&hyph;0003 or (202) 483&hyph;6000; Fax (202) 328&hyph;3265. The meeting, which is open to the public, will run from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. on Thursday, November 17, then continue on Friday, November 18, from 8:00 A.M. to noon. The purpose of the meeting is to review thermal management issues related to the high-level radioactive waste repository proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Primary issues to be discussed at the meeting are the DOE's emerging waste isolation strategy, the key thermal decisions to be made and the decision-making process involved, and potential programmatic risks related to the DOE's thermal management strategy. Representatives from the DOE, its contractors, and other organizations have been invited to participate. Issues to be discussed on the first day include alternative thermal management strategies and the Yucca Mountain site thermal response. A round-table discussion will close the first day's activities. On the second day, participants will define and discuss the in-situ thermal testing needs and techniques for analyzing the performance of the proposed repository and the process for making a thermal management decision. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been invited to present its perspective on various safety issues. A wrap-up session with summary presentations from participants will end the meeting at noon. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Broad was created in the 1987 Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act to evaluate the technical and scientific activities of the DOE's civilian radioactive waste management program, including site characterization, storage, and transport. A site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, currently is being characterized by the DOE for its suitability as the possible location of a permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense high-level waste. Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria Reich, Board librarian, beginning December 30, 1994.
