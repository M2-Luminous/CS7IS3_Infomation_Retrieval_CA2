If they do so, they should not have come." Wu's remarks are aimed at U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, who is scheduled to arrive in China soon. Wu Yi participated in the opening session of the National People's Congress [NPC] this morning as a visitor. Wu was met by reporters when she arrived at the meeting hall. Wu Yi said that most-favored-nation [MFN] status is purely a trade matter, which should not be linked to politics. Therefore, we simply cannot accept the human rights question being raised by him (Christopher). This attitude of the Chinese Government is well known to the outside world." Wu continued: "The MFN issue is absolutely a trade matter, which should be resolved by trade methods. They (United States) want to link it to politics. This is totally unacceptable to us." Christopher will arrive in Beijing tomorrow.
