New Facts About the Subsidy Commission"] [Text] According to informal reports from government sources, Mikhail Poltoranin, current chairman of the State Duma Information Policy and Communications Committee, intends to head a subsidy commission (it will possibly be called more "democratically" a public council) which is being set up to distribute among the needy publications government funds allocated to maintain the domestic press. The sum of 111 billion is not very large and therefore obviously many chief editors will go hat in hand to Poltoranin like in the good old days, and he will be making eyes at some and thumbing his nose at others. An important question now being aired in the Russian Press Committee, which has lobbied for increased government subsidies, is the composition of this commission. It was expected that the commission would include primarily experienced journalists, enjoying the unquestionable respect of their colleagues, people with a name. It seems, however, that its bulk will be constituted by State Duma deputies who are already actively seeking to take their chance to direct and boss the media around. In all likelihood it will be Poltoranin himself who will be selecting subsidy commission members. It will be recalled that a similar, 1993-style, commission to distribute budget funds between the publications included two representatives of the State Press Committee, two deputies from the then Russian Federation Supreme Soviet's Mass Media Committee, and two deputies from the Supreme Soviet Budget Committee. It should be noted that the promised 111 billion is not available so far. At first the Finance Ministry was going to resolve this problem in April, but now it does not promise to provide the funds until the end of May. Actually the subsidy commission is to be established by the moment the funds come forth.
