All deputy defense ministers and many brigade commanders took part in this large training session [zanyatiye] of the Group of Russian Troops in the Transcaucasus. It was a very useful and well-prepared session, and there was a lot to see and learn there. It displayed many aspects of the soldier's life. We brought our brigade commanders with us here. We, I mean Georgian Army officers, have never been involved to such an extent in sessions like that. This is the most important thing about today's session. [Words indistinct] before we left for Batumi, I gave them an assignment to introduce such training into the Georgian Army. Before the end of the year we plan to hold a similar training session involving the 11th Brigade. We are now forming a model brigade with battalion personnel [sentence as heard]. As I said, we are planning to hold a similar session by the end of the year and invite our Russian friends to it, as they did today. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Nadibaidze, the Defense Ministry issued a statement yesterday [16 June] saying that following the Supreme Council session, the transfer of Russian troops to Gali Rayon was delayed. [Nadibaidze] There was no delay. As planned, sapper groups are now being formed. We will be represented by Colonel Kalandadze, the head of the Defense Ministry's engineer service. Preparatory measures to be taken ahead of the deployment of troops are being implemented on a full scale and according to plan. There was no delay and there will not be any delay in the future. Everything will develop as planned in advance. All tasks discussed by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev during his visit to Georgia are being implemented stage by stage. On the 19th or 20th June all troops will be in the region.
