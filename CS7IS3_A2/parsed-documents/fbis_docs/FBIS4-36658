FBIS4-36658 "drnes113_j_94027" FBIS-NES-94-113 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Minister: Saudi Arabia Providing Arms to South Minister: Saudi Arabia Providing Arms to South JN1106182594 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1700 GMT 11 Jun 94 JN1106182594 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Arabic BFN [Text] Sanaa today publicly and directly accused Saudi Arabia of involvement in the Yemeni war by helping the southerners and providing weapons to them, deeming Saudi Arabia a party to the dispute, as Yemeni Minister of Planning and Environment 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani put it. The northern minister said Saudi Arabia is supplying the south with weapons it is purchasing from certain eastern European nations, such as the Ukraine, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland via al-Mukalla Port, where southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid is staying. Al-Iryani said the Sanaa Government has conclusive evidence that al-Bid is being supplied with weapons -- which he described as limitless -- from Saudi Arabia. The Gulf Cooperation Council states, except for Qatar, have implicitly recognized the Democratic Republic of Yemen proclaimed by al-Bid two weeks after the eruption of battles. The northern official also revealed that the contacts made by Sanaa with some of the leaders of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] in the south have failed. This shows, in his opinion, that the politicians in the south no longer have any influence on military affairs. He added that Lakhdar Brahimi, the special envoy of the UN secretary general, did not propose anything new in his talks with officials in Sanaa and was satisfied with the suggestions made in the international resolution on Yemen. However, Sayf Sa'il, member of the YSP Political Bureau, said in Aden that he was optimistic about Brahimi's efforts, saying the main purpose of the mission is to enact a cease-fire because negotiations can never achieve anything as long as there is no cease-fire. The two parties are still divided over how to monitor the cease- fire. The northerners want a joint military committee to be formed. The southerners, however, insist on deploying international observers. This prompted al-Iryani to say that the southerners want to internationalize the crisis. Northern Yemeni Justice Minister 'Abdallah Ghanim said the southerners' demand for international disengagement troops is open aggression against Yemen's sovereignty and independence. Ghanim cast doubt on the credibility of the United Nations, which, he said, uses double standards and adopts its resolutions without heeding the right of peoples and countries to bar interference in their internal affairs. Ghanim said there are parties that support the position of the rebels. He said: We find it strange for these parties to offer such support and we ask them to stop it because it leads to more bloodshed, as he said.
