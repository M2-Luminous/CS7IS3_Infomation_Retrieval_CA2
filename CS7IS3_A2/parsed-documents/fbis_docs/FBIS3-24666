MOROCCO Moroccans Among Islamic Guerillas Killed in Eritrea Algerian daily LIBERTE reported on 3 January that, according to Eritrean President Issaias Afewerki, two of the 20 Islamic guerrillas killed in a recent skirmish with Eritrean forces were Moroccans. Afewerki claimed that the 20 guerrillas were Islamic fundamentalists of various nationalities who had crossed into Eritrea from Sudan and, in the manner of Afghani jihad movements, were conducting operations to "liberate the entire region. " Afewerki also claimed that guerrillas included "foreigners from ... Tunis, Afghanistan, or Pakistan." He further stated: "The source of the problem is found in Sudan; we are trying therefore to resolve the problem through collaboration with the Sudanese government and the other forces in Sudan. We do not wish that this war against Eritrea remain a secret; thus, we are making it public knowledge." (Algiers LIBERTE 3 Jan 94) UMA To Study Creation of a Maghreb Free Trade Zone The Ministerial Commission of the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) dealing with economy and finances recently adopted at its seventh session in Tunis a project to eventually declare the creation of a Maghreb free-trade zone. In a commentary on this "major event in the process of edifying the UMA," ALMAGHRIB declared this to be "an excellent opportunity for the industries of these countries to be assured that their products would flow into a market which, although not gigantic or possessing great purchasing power, is still capable of sustaining and absorbing a good portion of these locally made products." The creation of a UMA free-trade zone would, the paper claimed, "represent the dream of entrepreneurs in the region who would thereby be able to jointly face the challenge of globalization of markets and competition among regional economic blocks." Among the regional entrepreneurs working to achieve this are members of the Maghreb Union of Textile and Leather Industries (UMATEC) who, at a convention in Tunis 29-30 November 1993, articulated a program which included the intention "to see to it that the textile sector represent the first building block in the construction of the Grand Arab Maghreb market, after the fashion of the coal and steel sectors in the European market."

Food items saw the greatest decrease, dropping 2 percent, due in large measure to seasonal variations in fresh fruits and vegetables. Wholesale prices rose 0.6 percent in November to an index level of 320.7 from 318.7 in October, principally due to increases in clothing and textiles (3.6 percent), textile products and haberdashery (6.8 percent), metallurgic industries (0.8 percent), transportation materials (1.4 percent), vegetable oils (6.9 percent), and dried vegetables (3.1 percent). This rise in wholesale prices represents a 4.2 percent increase over their November 1992 level.
