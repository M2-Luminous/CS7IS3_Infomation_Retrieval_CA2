(a) Existing works include motion pictures, television recordings, video recordings, and other audiovisual works in any medium; sound recordings in any medium; musical, dramatic, and literary works; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; and, works of a similar nature. Usually, these or similar works were not first created, developed, generated, originated, prepared, or produced under a Government contract. Therefore, the Government must obtain a license in the work if it intends to reproduce the work, distribute copies of the work, prepare derivative works, or perform or display the work publicly. When the Government is not responsible for the content of an existing work, it should require the copyright owner to indemnify the Government for liabilities that may arise out of the content, performance, use, or disclosure of such data. (b) Follow the procedures at 227.406 for works which will be first created, developed, generated, originated, prepared, or produced under a Government contract and the Government needs to control distribution of the work or has a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the creation, content, performance, use, or disclosure of the work or from libelous or other unlawful material contained in the work. Follow the procedures at 227.403 when the Government does not need to control distribution of such works or obtain such indemnities. §227.405&hyph;2 Acquisition of existing works without modification. (a) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7021, ``Rights in Data_Existing Works'' in lieu of the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'', in solicitations and contracts exclusively for existing works when: (1) The existing works will be acquired without modification; and, (2) The Government requires the right to reproduce, prepare derivative works, or publicly perform or display the existing works; or, (3) The Government has a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the content, performance, use, or disclosure of such data. (b) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7021, ``Rights in Data_Existing Works'', provides the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works and publicly perform or display the works called for by a contract and to authorize others to do so for Government purposes. (c) A contract clause is not required to acquire existing works such as books, magazines and periodicals in any storage or retrieval medium, when the Government will not reproduce the books, magazines or periodicals, or prepare derivative works. §227.405&hyph;3 Acquisition of modified existing works. Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7020, ``Rights in Data_Special Works'', in solicitations and contracts for modified existing works in lieu of the clause at 252.227&hyph;7021, ``Rights in Data_Existing Works.'' §227.406 Contracts for special works. (a) Use the clause at 252.227&hyph;7020, ``Rights in Special Works'' in solicitations and contracts where the Government has a specific need to control the distribution of works first produced, created, or generated in the performance of a contract and required to be delivered under that contract, including controlling distribution by obtaining an assignment of copyright, or a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the content, performance, use, or disclosure of such works. Use the clause_ (1) In lieu of the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'', when the Government must own or control copyright in all works first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered under a contract. (2) In addition to the clause at 252.227&hyph;7013, ``Rights in Technical Data_Noncommercial Items'' when the Government must own or control copyright in a portion of a work first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered under a contract. The specific portion in which the Government must own or control copyright must be identified in a special contract requirement. (b) Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and unlimited rights in a special work under the clause at 252.227&hyph;7020, the contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that work. If the Government needs to restrict a contractor's rights to use or disclose a special work, it must also negotiate a special license which specifically restricts the contractor's use or disclosure rights. (c) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7020 does not permit a contractor to incorporate into a special work any works copyrighted by others unless the contractor obtains the contracting officer's permission to do so and obtains for the Government a non-exclusive, paid up, world-wide license to make and distribute copies of that work, to prepare derivative works, to perform or display publicly any portion of the work, and to permit others to do so for government purposes. Grant permission only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party work is included in the deliverable work.
