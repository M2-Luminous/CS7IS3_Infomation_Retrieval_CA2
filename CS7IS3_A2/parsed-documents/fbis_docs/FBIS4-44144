Kahraman submitted his resignation application to Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime minister. Kahraman stated that his reason for submitting his resignation was that a human rights ministry has not yet been established. Stating that he has been exerting efforts with great hope and patience for a human rights ministry to be established as envisaged by the coalition government agreement, Kahraman said: In view of the negative attitude shown by our coalition partner, the TPP [True Path Party], toward my human rights ministry proposal at the Turkish Grand National Assembly meeting, it was impossible to establish the ministry and make it operational. For this reason, and because I believe that under these conditions it will not be possible for me to favorably fulfill my duties as state minister, I request that I be freed from my duty.
