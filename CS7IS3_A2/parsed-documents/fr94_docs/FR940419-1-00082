Subpart D_Resident Management Corporations Operating Subsidy §990.401 Calculation of operating subsidy. Operating subsidy will be calculated separately for any project managed by a resident management corporation. This subsidy computation will be the same as the separate computation made for the balance of the projects in the PHA in accordance with this part, with the following exceptions: (a) The project managed by a resident management corporation will have an Allowable Expense Level based on the actual expenses for the project in the fiscal year immediately preceding management under this subpart. These expenditures will include the project's share of any expenses which are overhead or centralized PHA expenditures. The expenses must represent a normal year's expenditures for the project, and must exclude all expenditures which are not normal fiscal year expenditures as to amount or as to the purpose for which expended. Documentation of this expense level must be presented with the project budget and approved by HUD. Any project expenditures funded from a source of income other than operating subsidies or income generated by the locally owned public housing program will be excluded from the subsidy calculation. For budget years after the first budget year under management by the resident management corporation, the Allowable Expense Level will be calculated as it is for all other projects in accordance with §990.105(e)(5). (b) The resident management corporation project will estimate dwelling rental income based on the rent roll of the project immediately preceding the assumption of management responsibility under this subpart, increased by the estimate of inflation of tenant income used in calculating PFS subsidy. (c) The resident management corporation will exclude, from its estimate of other income, any increased income directly generated by activities by the corporation or facilities operated by the corporation. (d) Any reduction in the subsidy of a PHA that occurs as a result of fraud, waste, or mismanagement by the PHA shall not affect the subsidy calculation for the resident management corporation project. §990.402 Calculation of total income and preparation of operating budget.
