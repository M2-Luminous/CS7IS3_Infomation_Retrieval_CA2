FBIS4-10279 "drlat069_c_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 MEXICO EZLN's Marcos Identified as Jesuit Priest EZLN's Marcos Identified as Jesuit Priest PA1004013594 Mexico City SUMMA in Spanish 8 Apr 94 pp 1A, 3B PA1004013594 Mexico City SUMMA Spanish BFN ["Exclusive" report by special correspondent Ernesto Esparza] [Excerpts] Tijuana, Baja California -- Self-described insurgent Subcommander "Marcos" of the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN] is Jesuit Priest Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez, according to an investigation by a special federal government group that has its center of operations in Chiapas State. According to the results obtained from computerized tests, photographs, recordings of his voice, physical similarities, and videocassettes, it was possible to establish that the enigmatic figure who emerged on 1 January in the armed conflict in the mountains of Chiapas is a priest of approximately 36 years of age. According to confidential information obtained by SUMMA, Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez was sent to Chiapas State four years ago. However, for over two years no one has known in which community he lives. Photographs obtained by this newspaper corroborate the results of the investigation conducted by the specialized group, which reveals the considerable resemblance and body similarities shared by the priest and Subcommander "Marcos." Another piece of information that corroborates this is that "Marcos'" guerrilla comrades in the mountains of Chiapas call him the "Monk from Altamirano;" furthermore, in the jungle, mountains, or in combat, he constantly changed his code to avoid being identified. "Marcos'" alleged identity was obtained through operation "Identity," for which it was necessary to have a special agent infiltrate the EZLN. Through this agent the Federal Government's special group learned all of the insurgents' tactical moves, especially those of its spokesman who, it is said -- behind the [ski] mask he always wears when he appears on television or is photographed -- is a Jesuit priest who occasionally says mass dressed in white and without a "hood." [passage omitted] Jeronimo Hernandez Lopez' curriculum, the investigation states, shows that he has always been of a revolutionary bent and that when he was sent to Chiapas he welcomed the appointment. Conscientious Investigation SUMMA gained access to the investigation whereby the subcommander's alleged identity was established. The most interesting study of all was, unquestionably, the computerized physiognomical study because the eyes, forehead, mouth and nose of the enigmatic figure were compared with hundreds of faces that bore the same characteristics. The task was difficult and quite complicated because there was no room for mistakes. According to the federal government's theory, the Jesuit priest "meets all the requirements" to be Subcommander "Marcos." Another key feature in the establishment of similarities between both men was the pockmark or mole that both have between the corner of the eyebrow and the eyelid of the right eye. Likewise, the sharp and robust nose; skin color; eyes, which are light brown; the shape of the mouth; the breadth of the forehead is the same; and voice and arm movements. A comparison was made between "Marcos'" voice during the interviews he has granted to the electronic media and the voice of the Jesuit priest officiating mass. The priest's voice was [recorded] during a mass he presumably officiated in Ocosingo Municipality several hours after the armed uprising on 31 December 1993. In his homily on that occasion, Hernandez Lopez said: "We will never again allow the murder of a single Indian; to do this we must defend ourselves and always remain united at all cost, with God's help." State Secret This investigation, which the Federal Government considers a "state secret" and which was already disclosed to the highest ranking officials of the current administration, resulted from the arduous labor of almost three months. We do not know if, now that the negotiations for stable social peace are to resume in Chiapas, this investigation will be published, but for the time being SUMMA has done so, not with a desire to create confusion over the real identity of Subcommander "Marcos," but solely to attest to the veracity of this information, which is of national and international interest. We are hereby reiterating our desire to be at the journalistic forefront in order to serve our readers.
