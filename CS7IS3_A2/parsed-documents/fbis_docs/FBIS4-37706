It discussed topics on the agenda. Discussions focused on the supply situation in the republic and on the regulations governing the distribution of the necessary foods and consumer goods. The cabinet set up a working team to directly supervise all storing, distribution, and transportation operations in order to secure regular delivery of all these goods to all governorates. This is because supplying the necessary commodities to citizens will complement and enhance all military and political field activities. The cabinet stressed the need for contributions by all official and popular organizations and institutions. It also emphasized the need to pool all efforts in order to make successful the transportation and distribution operations, disburse the stored commodities, and solve the problems pertaining to transportation and distribution operations, in addition to organizing the monitoring operations, implementing strict measures against those who violate the supply regulations and laws, and addressing this issue with seriousness and high discipline on the part of the institutions in charge of control. The cabinet also discussed a memorandum submitted by the brother minister of planning and development requesting approval of an agreement between the Yemeni government and the Arab Fund [not further identified] on financing a project to rehabilitate the electric, water, and sewage disposal installations in Aden, the economic and commercial capital. The cabinet approved this agreement and asked the parties concerned to make all arrangements in order to accomplish this vital project for Aden, the economic and commercial capital. In view of what the forces rebelling against the constitutional legitimacy are carrying out in terms of subversive and destructive acts against the vital economic installations--the latest of which was the raid on the power station in Mocha, in the governorate of Ta'izz, which inflicted serious damage, martyred 17 citizens mostly women and children, and wounded 33 others--the cabinet expressed its indignation and condemned these continued crimes committed by the rebels against public property and vital facilities of the homeland and citizens. It also emphasized that those who commit these treacherous crimes will receive punishment sooner or later as criminals acting against the people and the homeland. Moreover, the cabinet saluted the valiant Armed Forces' great efforts to protect all national gains and achievements, safeguard the civilian and vital installations and public utilities, and maintain security and stability. It stressed the need to increase vigilance in order to foil all hostile and conspiratorial schemes designed to fragment the homeland and destroy its resources and capabilities. [passage omitted]
