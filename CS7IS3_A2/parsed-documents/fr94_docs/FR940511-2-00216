FR940511-2-00216 FR940511-2-00129 ``The consent form should provide information regarding the approximate number of people who have received the genetic material under study. It is also necessary to warn potential subjects that for genetic materials previously used in relatively few or no humans, unforeseen risks are possible, including ones that could be severe. ``Any possible adverse medical consequences that may occur if the subjects withdraw from the study once the experiment has started should be indicated. ``Part I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;a&hyph;(6). Costs. ``The subjects should be provided with information about any financial costs associated with their participation in the experiment and in the long-term follow-up to the experiment that are not covered by the investigators or the institutions involved. Comparable financial information for other available alternatives, including other investigational therapies, should also be provided. ``In the consent form, subjects should be informed about the extent to which they will be responsible for any costs for medical treatment required as a direct result of research-related injury. Part I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;b. Specific Requirements of Gene Transfer Research Part I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(1). Use of barrier contraception. ``To avoid the possibility that any of the reagents employed in gene transfer research could cause harm to a developing fetus, female subjects should be informed that they should not be pregnant during the course of their participation in the study. Both male and female subjects should be informed when barrier contraception is required during the active phase of their participation in the study. Part I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(2). Long-term follow-up. ``To permit evaluation of long-term safety and efficacy of gene transfer, the prospective subjects should be informed that they are expected to cooperate in long-term follow-up that extends beyond the active phase of the study. A list should be provided in the consent form of persons who can be contacted in the event that questions arise during the follow-up period. The principal investigator should request that subjects always keep the laboratory informed of a current address and telephone number. ``The subjects should also be informed that any significant findings resulting from the study will be made known to them and/or their parent or guardian including new information about the experimental procedure, the physical reactions experienced by other individuals involved in the study, and any long-term effects that have been noted. ``Part I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(3). Request for autopsy. ``To obtain vital information about the safety and efficacy of gene transfer, subjects should be informed that at the time of death, whenever that may occur, an autopsy will be requested and that they should advise their families of this request and of its scientific and medical importance. Part I&hyph;D&hyph;2&hyph;b&hyph;(4). Interest of media and others in the research. To alert the subjects that others may have an interest in the innovative character of the experiment and the status of treated subjects:
