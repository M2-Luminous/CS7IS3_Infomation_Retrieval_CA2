[Osipov] To what extent is Russia satisfied with Syria's position in the Near East settlement? [Ivanov] It is impossible to say that someone should be satisfied with someone else's position on this question. After the tragedy in Hebron, Syria, as is known, together with other Arab countries, stopped participating in negotiations; therefore, the main task now is to renew negotiations. Damascus is not satisfied at present with their progress, inasmuch as it does not see any specific results. At the same time, both Syria and Russia agree that there is no alternative to the negotiating process and, no matter how difficult the path may be, it is necessary to follow it. During the meeting with President Asad mutual interest was expressed in activating cooperation in this direction. The Syrian president noted that the negotiating process has a lot of enemies, and any disruption plays into their hands. He assessed the role of Russia highly, emphasizing that the presence of Russia is an important stabilizing element in the Near East, an element without which it is difficult to count on the achievement of a truly just and all-encompassing peace. [Osipov] The opinion exists among Syrians that the "peak" of our mutual relations has passed into history. Some are even saying that Russia has turned its back on Syria. Actually, Damascus of late has repeatedly received U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and his predecessor, while the head of our MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] has still not visited Syria. [Ivanov] I would put it differently. The "peak" in the fall of our relations has passed. I passed a message to President Asad from President Yeltsin that speaks absolutely definitely of our firm intention to develop full-fledged relations with Syria. A similar statement is contained in the reply that I am taking to Moscow. That is, there is a definite political will to take the path of building our relations. There really was a slump--for objective reasons associated with many factors in our country and with the international situation; however, it is impossible to say that someone tried to turn away from someone. Incidentally, the Syrian president did not dramatize this situation, and he perceived it as objective reality. He said: We have always believed that this was a transition period, and that the future of Russo-Syrian relations will be based on the past many years of history and not on the current state of affairs. As for the visit of the minister, such visits should be preceded by specific preparations. I do not rule out the arrival of Minister Kozyrev in Syria in the future, as well as the arrival of high-ranking delegations along other lines. I think that we will increase contacts in various directions. [Osipov] Including in the sphere of military-technical cooperation? [Ivanov] We are ready to develop this sphere as well. A Russian delegation was in Syria recently and prepared a draft intergovernment agreement, which we expect will be signed and will create the basis for cooperation. Military contacts at the highest level are also expected. [Osipov] Was the question of Syria's debt to Russia broached? [Ivanov] We inherited this serious question, and it is necessary to resolve it. We arranged with President Asad that a delegation of Russian experts from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations would come to Damascus in the near future in order, jointly with the Syrian side, to prepare such variants of decisions that would not infringe on the interests of either side. However, the task is not simple, and a quick resolution should not be expected. [Osipov] Is the Syrian side moving willingly to settle this question? [Ivanov] No one moves willingly to pay off debts, but I sensed a quite constructive mood and desire to resolve this problem--today, perhaps, this is the sole sore point that is a definite irritant in our relations. Considering that both we and the Syrians are interested in ridding relations of all irritants, it can be assumed that their attitude is quite normal.
