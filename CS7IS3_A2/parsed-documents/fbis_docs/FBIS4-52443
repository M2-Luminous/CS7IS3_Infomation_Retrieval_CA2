Revolutionary faith is a noble ideological sentiments combining faith in the justness of the revolutionary cause led by the leader and the inevitability of its victory and a firm determination and will to fight it out for the victory of the revolution. Only when loyalty is cherished as the revolutionary faith can it be true loyalty without pretence or inconstancy. The revolutionary outlook on the leader is the most correct view and outlook on the position and role of the leader in the revolutionary struggle, an attitude and stand of holding the leader in high esteem with sincerity. When the revolutionaries deeply grasp from theoretical and practical points of view that the leader holds an absolute position and plays a decisive role in the revolutionary struggle and the development of history, they can revere the leader unconditionally and devote their all to the leader and the revolutionary cause led by him, cherishing loyalty as their faith. Only when the loyalty to the leader is cherished as a revolutionary faith and, at the same time, as moral obligation, can it remain true and long. For the revolutionaries, the leader is a tender-hearted teacher and father who gives the most precious political integrity to them, brings them up and looks after them with deep loving care and trust and leads them along the revolutionary road. Accordingly, the relationship between the leader and his revolutionary soldiers is not that between right and duty, between domination and obedience, but that between loving care and obligation to repay it. Every one must grasp the truth that the leader is the centre of socio-political organism and feel grateful to the leader's loving care and trust in practical life. Only then, can he or she deem loyalty to the leader as the rule of conduct and mission of a revolutionary, not mere sense of duty, and remain faithful to the leader to the last. The Korean people are filled with a singlehearted desire to firmly believe only in the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and follow his leadership with loyalty no matter which way the wind may blow and how many times the world may change, the article declares.
