FR940124-1-00098 FR940124-1-00009 (4) The system has effective mechanisms for evaluating compliance with its standards and applying its standards consistently; and (5) The system's activities will meet the needs of the State and the Secretary in accomplishing the purposes of the SPRP and not unnecessarily duplicate the capabilities of a nationally recognized accrediting agency available to perform the assessment described in §667.24(b) of these regulations. The Secretary believes that a peer review system for purposes of this program does not, in effect, have to qualify as a recognized accrediting agency to be used under the SPRP. Nevertheless, the Secretary invites comment on these suggested criteria and alternative approaches for determining the competence of a peer review system. Section 667.25␣Termination of an Institution's Participation in the Title IV, HEA Programs In §667.25, the Secretary proposes the procedures a SPRE must follow to effect the termination of an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. Under those procedures, if a SPRE determines, based upon its review, that an institution is in violation of the State's review standards and should no longer continue to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs or violates one of the provisions proposed in §667.23(g), the SPRE provides the institution with the opportunity to contest that determination in accordance with procedures the Secretary has approved for that purpose under §667.26. If the SPRE concludes after affording the institution the opportunity to challenge the SPRE's findings and determination, that the institution should be terminated from participating in the Title IV, HEA Programs, the SPRE notifies the Secretary of those findings and that determination. Upon notice by the SPRE that the institution should no longer participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the Secretary immediately terminates that institution's participation in those programs and notifies the institution and the SPRE of the effective date of that termination. Further, the Secretary proposes that an institution terminated under this part may not reapply to the Secretary to participate in a Title IV, HEA program until 18 months have expired from the effective date of its termination. This proposal is consistent with the provisions in 34 CFR 668.96. Under that section of the Title IV, HEA program regulations, an institution whose participation in the Title IV, HEA programs has been terminated may not seek reinstatement in those programs before the expiration of 18 months from the effective date of its termination. Moreover, section 494C(h)(1) of the HEA does not authorize any appeal to the Secretary of a termination determination. Section 667.26 Due Process Requirements Section 494C(h)(3) of the HEA requires the Secretary to prescribe in regulations minimum procedural standards for the disapproval of institutions by a SPRE. Thus, in §667.26, the Secretary proposes due process criteria that a State must satisfy when permitting an institution to challenge a SPRE's finding that the institution is in violation of the State's review standards and should no longer continue to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. Specifically, the Secretary proposes to approve the State's procedures if those procedures satisfy basic due process requirements. Therefore, the Secretary proposes procedures that require the SPRE to_ (1) Notify an institution of any required action and the basis for that action; (2) Permit the institution the opportunity to challenge that adverse action in a hearing or in writing; (3) Notify the institution in writing of the result of its challenge, and the basis for that result; and (4) Follow other applicable procedural requirements of State law. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Because these proposed regulations would affect only States and State agencies, the regulations would not have an impact on small entities. State and State agencies are not defined as ``small entities'' in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 Sections 667.3, 667.4, 667.12, 667.15, 667.21, and 667.22 contain information collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of these sections to the Office of Management and Budget for its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) These proposed regulations contain information collection requirements for States that apply to the Secretary to receive funds under this part and for States that develop review standards and submit those standards to the Secretary for approval. The Department needs and uses the information collected to determine whether to approve a State's application for funds. Annual public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1480 hours for each of the 57 States that prepare plans to perform SPRE activities, prepare budgets that account for those activities, develop review standards, and submit those plans, budgets, and standards to the Secretary for approval. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. Invitation To Comment Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding these proposed regulations. All comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will be available for public inspection, during and after the comment period, in room 4318, ROB&hyph;3, 7th & D Streets, SW, Washington, D.C., between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federal holidays. Assessment of Educational Impact The Secretary particularly requests comments on whether the proposed regulations in this document would require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States.
