Russia has taken the date for completing troops withdrawal -- 31 August 1994 -- out of the draft agreement, but has not proposed any other date for discussion. According to Svirin, head of the Russian delegation, in discussions on the sea borders during the talks, disagreements were revealed concerning the point where they should be linked up with the border on land. Estonia insisted on the 1920 borders, whereas Russia is for setting the border line from the place where the present land border comes down to the Baltic Sea. According to INTERFAX, the next round of talks will be held in Tallinn tomorrow.
