As DIENA was told by LG Vice President Girts Stalbovics, gas that has been pumped into the Underground Reservoir at Incukalns (IPGK) in fact belongs to Russia, and Latvia has to pay for its usage. In summer of last year, the debts were almost paid, but as the heating period of this year has started, the debt to Russia for consumed gas, through the fault of irresponsible debtors, has risen from 500,000 lats on 1 November 1993 to 16 million lats on 16 January. In addition to these debts, there is also a considerably high fine to pay, the amount of which G. Stalbovics did not wish to reveal. As a result of this, the output of industrial plants which are using gas in their production, will decrease. Owing to the fact that one of the greatest debtors is the state joint stock company "Latvenergo," the population also will suffer -- the enterprise uses primarily gas for heating. Due to Russia's action, it will be forced to change the terms of heat deliveries. Among the biggest debtors, G. Stalbovics also mentioned the municipal heating enterprises and several building administrators. Until now, Russia was being appeased by promises, said G. Stalbovics. To give Latvia a chance to settle its debts, Russia is ready to take over a part of the IPGK and gas pipeline system. A similar scheme was accepted by Estonia, which thus made itself utterly dependent on Russian conditions for gas deliveries. LG will take pains to pay so much that it will not be forced to sign such an agreement, because Russia can also be dependent on IPGK -- if there is any gas damage, the amount of gas pumped into the reservoir would be sufficient to deliver it, within reasonable limits, to Russia as well.
