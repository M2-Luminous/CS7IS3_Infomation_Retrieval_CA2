FBIS4-35240 "drnes104_m_94006" FBIS-NES-94-104 Daily Report 31 May 1994 JORDAN Prince Hasan Addresses London Institute Prince Hasan Addresses London Institute JN2805080794 Amman JORDAN TIMES in English 25 May pp 1, 3 JN2805080794 Amman JORDAN TIMES English BFN [Text] (J.T.) -- His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan said Tuesday [24 May] that although making peace in the Middle East has been arduous and fraught with dangers, "we appear to be over the worst" in the search for a negotiated and comprehensive settlement. But the Crown Prince warned that much remains to be done if the Arab-Israeli conflict is to be resolved to the satisfaction of all parties. "We are past the point when symbolic gestures, televised worldwide, carry currency," the Crown Prince said in a lecture he delivered at the London-based Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies (RUSI), a professional body founded in 1831 and dedicated to the study, analysis and debate of issues affecting defence and international security. "We have arrived at the point when the substance of peace must be negotiated in detail; when the foundations of a new Middle Eastern order must be laid, block by block." "In a world that is still seeking a new rationale and order for itself after the end of the cold war, the search for peace in the Middle East assumes great symbolic and practical importance," the Crown Prince told the audience, which included the Duke of Kent, patron of RUSI, as well as members and other invited guests comprising politicians, government and military officials, members of parliament, academicians and representatives of the British, Arabic and international media in London. But "peace cannot be piecemeal," the Crown Prince said. "It must be comprehensive, and it must be just, if it is to be lasting. All must be given the chance, and the tools, to play their part in building a new Middle Eastern order." "Jordan signed a common agenda for peace talks with Israel last year," the Crown prince said. "The common agenda represents a significant achievement, but it is no more than a first step on the road to peace. There is still much to be achieved, and much to be negotiated, before the attainment of a comprehensive peace. Jordan is prepared to enter a peace treaty with Israel, once the issues listed in the agenda have been fully discussed and settled to the satisfaction of all. We seek to strike a balance between the need to address the agenda items on the one hand and the need to implement interim agreements and arrangements to sustain the momentum of peace on the other." After the lecture, Prince Hasan responded to questions related to Arab intelligentsia and the media, anti-Semitism, racial discrimination and extremism. Voicing his rejection of all forms of anti-Semitism and extremism, the Prince called for solutions to humanitarian issues through agreements by the followers of the three monotheistic religions in a spirit of equality and co-existence. Following is the full text of the lecture which was entitled "Making Peace in the Middle East": It is an honour and a pleasure to address the Royal United Services Institute on the complex topic of "Making Peace in the Middle East." Many of you are familiar with the study and logistics of warfare as well as the politics of making peace. I am in a position to assure you that the later is far more difficult to achieve. It is simple to wage war but it is not so easy to conclude a just and lasting peace. Our experience in the Middle East has shown that making peace is constantly fraught with hidden dangers. The search for peace in the region has been arduous and at times intractable. I am pleased to state that we appear to be over the worst. I have come before you today to speak of Jordan's quest for peace. I will speak of peace in the Middle East, for that is my region and my history. But what I say of my region holds true for other regions, other situations. The Middle East is strategically located at the cross-roads of the world. In a world that is still seeking a new rationale and order for itself after the end of the cold war, the search for peace in the Middle East assumes great symbolic and practical importance. For if the peoples of my region can find the will and the courage to live together, then surely no conflict is insoluble. The events of the past year have opened the door to peace in the Middle East. The mutual recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation) PLO and Israel gave the region an unprecedented opportunity to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, a conflict that has taken its toll on us all. The recent implementation of their historic agreement over Gaza and Jericho is another step in the right direction. But we must be under no illusions about the difficulty of our task. Future war must be made inconceivable, the wounds that have kept Arab and Israeli apart must somehow be healed. There is a tendency in the news media to focus on the most recent and dramatic developments in discussing the Middle East. For many of you, the massacre of Muslim worshipers that took place in Hebron earlier this year may be yesterday's news. But for those who live in the occupied territories, for those who have for generations lived and died with this conflict, it is still a matter of grave concern. It highlights the need, above all, for individuals on the ground to participate in the process of peace-making and confidence- building. Much remains to be done if the conflict is to be resolved. We are past the point when symbolic gestures, televised world-wide, carry currency. We have arrived at the point when the substance of peace must be negotiated in detail; when the foundations of a new Middle Eastern order must be laid, block by block. Concepts for fresh patterns of inter and intra-regional relationships must be thought out, so that they can be put in place to the benefit of all. This is not the stuff of headlines. But this is the stuff of which true peace is made. Jordan has demonstrated its commitment to this kind of peace-making time and again over the years. Though we were not directly involved with the outbreak of hostilities, from the early days of the U.N. Gunnar Jarring mission in 1967 to the Madrid Conference in 1991, Jordan's approach to making peace has been clear and consistence. We were the first country of the region to advocate a negotiated settlement to the conflict. Jordan played an active role in formulating United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, which calls for an end to the conflict and the exchange of land for peace. Jordan has consistently supported the U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for peace in the Middle East. We promoted the genesis of the Madrid peace process, and enabled the Palestinians to assume their proper role, firstly by disengaging from the West Bank, and then by providing an umbrella for Palestinian negotiators to participate in the bilateral and multilateral negotiations. Jordan signed a common agenda for peace talks with Israel last year. The common agenda represents a significant achievement, but it is no more than a first step on the road to peace. There is still much to be achieved, and much to be negotiated, before the attainment of a comprehensive peace. Jordan is prepared to enter a peace treaty with Israel, once the issues listed in the agenda have been fully discussed and settled to the satisfaction of all. We seek to strike a balance between the need to address the agenda items on the one hand, and the need to implement interim agreements and arrangements to sustain the momentum of peace on the other. Foremost among the outstanding issues are the questions of boundaries, refugees, security and water. These issues are of the essence in the making of peace. We feel that there is a desperate need for a mechanism to effect the delineation and demarcation of our boundaries. It will be extremely difficult to make arrangements in other fields before the issues of borders and security are resolved. What sense can it make to speak of Jordanian and Israeli interests and concerns when neither "Jordan" nor "Israel" have been defined? The question has direct relevance to the recent events in the occupied territories and in Israel. Within the security framework, the problem of Israeli settlements must be resolved. Their questionable legality notwithstanding, the settlements represent a time-bomb which may be primed whenever a group of settlers, or any other organisations opposed to peace-making, wish to derail the peace process. Peace cannot be made and should not be made under such circumstances. We have submitted several proposals to deal with such issues, and stand ready to undertake project studies in these fields. We believe that a Boundary Commission will help to resolve the issue of boundaries, and we have put forward this proposal as a concrete contribution to the architecture of a lasting regional peace. On the issue of refugees, we are negotiating within the parameters of international law. Another issue that will demand considerable attention is the final status of the holy city of Jerusalem. A city revered for its shrines and its history by Muslims, Christians and Jews alike must be the ultimate symbol of peace. It is our belief that the religious significance of Jerusalem is such that its status is a truly international concern. It cannot be settled by Israelis and Palestinians alone, for the holy city should not be subject to the exclusive political control of any state. In determining the future of Jerusalem, Jordan believes that a vital distinction needs to be made between religious and political sovereignty. We have formulated detailed proposals to effect such a distinction, for we believe that a proper resolution to the Jerusalem question is essential in the search for peace. We have also implemented several substantial confidence building measures. We have re-opened Jordanian bank branches in the occupied territories, in order to assist in the development of the Palestinian economy. To the same end, we have signed an economic cooperation agreement with the Palestinians, and participated in the training of Palestinian police officers. We have established the Trilateral Working Group to look at issues of interest to Jordan, the U.S. and Israel, and this group may now be promoted to ministerial level. We are optimistic about the prospects for a Middle East economic conference and for a Jordan Rift Valley development concept, but are awaiting positive developments in this field. We are, of course, prepared to consider other mechanisms to build confidence regionally. While engaged in the substance of negotiation, Jordan has been considering more long-term mechanisms to deal with the legacies of the conflict in a reciprocal manner. We have evolved a vision of a new regional order under-pinned by a number of political and economic mechanisms that could help render future conflict unthinkable. Attention has been focused on practical measures to generate a process for regional security and cooperation. The promotion of sustainable modes of negotiation to resolve all outstanding regional disputes is increasingly necessary when the ultimate goal is a peaceful Middle East without barriers. An example exists in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). While this organisation has faced its share of criticism, particularly in dealing with conflicts such as that in the former Yugoslavia, it has successfully articulated a code of conduct for times of peace. This is precisely what the Middle East requires. We in Jordan believe that this conceptual framework can contribute to lasting peace in the region, and we have accordingly long called for a Helsinki Process, a conference on Security and Cooperation, for the Middle East (CSCME). It should be made clear that the CSC process is not envisaged as a substitute for the peace process, but as a natural compliment to it, and one that can remain in place to the benefit of all after the achievement of a negotiated peace. We do not propose the wholesale adoption of a one-off blueprint, but the adaptation of a flexible paradigm. We are entirely open to alternatives, so long as they can provide us with what we desperately need: neutral and low-key fora at which the common and inter-connected challenges of security and cooperation can be discussed in a global idiom. Within the context of a regional security regime the size, role and function of armed forces in the individual states of the region are likely to undergo radical changes. The transformation would be in favour of peace keeping. Jordan's armed forces have led the way in this respect. Our personnel are already serving in this capacity under the U.N. command as far afield as Mozambique, Liberia and in former Yugoslavia. More significantly, Israel's military superiority and the organic bond established with the U.S. through the doubtful syndrome of "arms for flexibility," or "hardware for software," which was devised by Henry Kissinger, would have to be considered and reassessed under a regional security system. Regional security must be so both in scope and substance. As shared values and aims take root, the notion of favoritism will become increasingly invidious and increasingly insupportable. Clearly the region comprises a diverse collection of peoples, who nevertheless share many historical experiences and perspectives. The European Union has conceptually divided the Middle East into three main areas: The Maghreb, the Mashreq and Turkey. From Jordan's point of view, at the epicentre of the region, the Middle East straddles and extends beyond the frontiers of Europe and Asia. It is integrally tied to both continents, with the Mediterranean serving as a link, rather than a barrier. In the long term, the future of the Middle East and that of Europe cannot be separated. In this ever more inter-dependent world, the interests of our two regions are increasingly at one. It would therefore be wise, in formulating strategies for the future of the region, to consider the European experience; for we in Jordan believe that the Middle East can have no future unless it evolves a global vision, backed up by subregional and regional instruments. The next step would therefore be to consider which instruments would be appropriate. A free-trade zone across the Middle East, allowing for the free movement of labour, goods, capital and services, would represent a significant achievement to this end. Arrangements for a Middle East Free Trade Agreement--a MEFTA along the lines of EFTA or NAFTA-- would allow the region to play a more creative role in the world economy. In aspiring to this goal, it will be necessary to consider the freedom of movement of all factors of production. In this context, a dialogue on the rights of migrant labour must be a vital prerequisite; for the existence of surplus labour in the north, and capital in the south, immediately suggests a viable regional trade regime. Of course, many outstanding issues must be resolved before such a vision can be realised. Even under conditions of peace, the disparity between the Israeli economy and those of the other regional parties, particularly the core parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict, demands appropriate measures to fashion a balanced relationship in a graduated manner. The examples of Spain and Portugal within the EU are worth considering in this regard. A GATT-EU approach may be the best way to deal with the economic legacies of the conflict, and to put the region on a viable, sustainable economic footing. Jordan believes that in seeking to evolve a healthy trade and investment regime, the experience of other countries--such as the Zone Franche arrangements between Geneva and France--will be invaluable. The European Commission has recently stressed the need for a common regional vision as a basis for cooperation in the Middle East. In a communication on this subject, it states: "Partnership requires balanced economic development. If cooperation is to succeed it is essential to reduce excessive disparities in income levels between potential partners in the region." It adds that: "Cooperation should go in two directions: the pooling of common capacities and the tackling of common problems...implying, at some stage, freedom of movement for goods, services, capital and labour." It is clear, then, that international investment in development projects which serve the region and its peoples is the way forward. it is equally important that such projects be founded upon sound concepts, and that they receive the support of international financial institutions, governments and multinational corporations alike. A basketing approach, covering human cooperation, resource cooperation and security, must be evolved. Peace requires an enduring structure that can tackle the over-arching problems of the economies of the region: disparities created by conflict, over-extended public sectors, addiction to aid and oil revenues. An economic framework is needed to deal with such problems. Many other instruments could play a part in forging such a framework. For example, regional bodies and charters are needed to ensure equity in resources-related areas such as energy and water; while incentives for local sustainable development programmes can support policies that guarantee a future for all. A regional debt sinking fund, and a bank for Middle East reconstruction and development, will promote stable and open financial practices, improving the chances for the region to play a dynamic part in the world economy. The concept of reconstruction is particularly vital. The Arab-Israeli conflict has exacted a severe toll on the region. With the promise of peace in the region, the international community looks increasingly towards the occupied territories. Jordan fully supports the effort to give the Palestinian people the tools they need to realise their historic dreams. We will do everything in our power to ensure the success of arrangements for Palestinian interim self-government. But although the Palestine question has always been the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the entire region has suffered. Vast debt burdens have been accumulated as a direct result of the conflict; unimaginable demographic strains have been imposed on countries with scarce resources. Peace, then, cannot be piecemeal. To use those famous words, I put it to you that peace must be comprehensive, and it must be just, if it is to be lasting. All must be given the chance, and the tools, to play their part in building a new Middle Eastern order.
