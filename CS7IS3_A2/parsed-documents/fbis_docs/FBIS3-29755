"Rice demand from Japan is artificial. It will go on for a while, not forever," said a source. Japan allowed rice imports for the first time in decades this year after an unusually wet summer damaged its crops. Under a new Gatt accord, the country is also required to import four per cent of total domestic rice consumption starting in 1995. Thai rice farmers enjoy high prices due to Japan's demand for at least 800,000 tonnes of premium grain, said the source. Demand has steadily pushed up global prices for the product. To ensure supplies, Thai exporters helped bolster the domestic price of premium rice. Tokyo agreed to buy 457,000 tonnes of 100 per cent and sticky rice in four lots. Last year's price for the first lot started at US$273 per tonne and soared to $450 for the fourth. Thailand plans to expedite delivery of the latest 194,000 tonnes at a freight-on-board price of $495 to Japan. Currently, the domestic price of rice is Bt510 per 60 kg, while it is normally Bt490 at this time of year. The source warned that if Japanese demand for rice increases, "Thais, perhaps, could be forced to pay more for the same rice." But if Japan halts its orders, the price plunge would cause havoc primarily among farmers, the source said. Japan's rice imports mainly benefit large Thai companies, the source added. Under Japan's system, rice import quotas are allocated to 11 major Japanese trading firms. Amounts assigned depend on each company's performance since World War II. These semi-cartels are then paired with major Thai rice exporters to facilitate orders. Small and medium-sized Thai exporters are barred from competing. Among the pairs are Japan's Mitsui with Thailand's Hong Yiah Seng; Mitsubishi with Capital Rice; Marubeni with Thai Hua; Tomen with Huay Chuan Rice; Seto with EPC Rice; and Nichiman with Soon Hua Seng. The same source told THE NATION that Capital Rice's venture with Mitsubishi resulted in a 60,000 tonne order for the former when Tokyo agreed to import an additional 194,000 tonnes. "It is believed that a company could have a profit of $100 per tonne," the source said. Small and medium-sized Thai rice exporters have rushed to Japan to lobby for quota allocation changes enabling them to share in the wealth, the source said, as Tokyo plans to import 200,000 tonnes from Bangkok in addition to its 800,000 tonne order last year.
