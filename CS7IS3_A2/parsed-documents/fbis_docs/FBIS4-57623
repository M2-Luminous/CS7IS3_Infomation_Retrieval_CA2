This was said by National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman, who is just back from Washington, D.C., where he met with congressmen, as well as with high-ranking officials in the Agency for International Development and other international financial organizations for discussions of Nicaragua's foreign debt. When asked about statements by the Violeta Chamorro administration's "strong man," Antonio Lacayo, on the amendment that the president's son-in-law believes concerns only the "big-footed American caitudos [pejorative term for some Nicaraguans who are naturalized U.S. citizens]" but that will not affect Nicaraguan programs, the National Assembly leader said the U.S. legislature is studying the possibility that the U.S. President might deem the law unenforceable due to a conflict of interests in that nation." [no opening quotation mark as published] Guzman said that several of the people he met in Washington, D.C. "told me they lack the authority to prevent enforcement of the law." Although the government has tried to minimize the effects that the "Helms-Gonzalez" Amendment may have on the country, Guzman stressed the difficulties that enforcement of this U.S. law may create with regard to foreign aid. The parliament leader pointed out: "Regardless of the U.S. congressmen's and Government's positions, the property issue is a very delicate and important issue for all Nicaraguans, who must resolve it on our own." Expanding on the case of the "American caitudos," Guzman recalled the existence of several guidelines of international law which stipulate that the owners' nationality at the time of confiscation should be the benchmark. "Therefore, the number of U.S. citizens claiming property will be reduced to only those who were U.S. citizens in 1979, not after that. Otherwise, we would never resolve this issue because every day there are more Nicaraguans who acquire U.S. citizenship."
