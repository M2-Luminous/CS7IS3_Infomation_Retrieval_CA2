The coalition cabinet headed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to decide on the government's budget proposal on Tuesday and submit it to the Diet for approval. In the meantime, the Finance Ministry will hold last-minute negotiating sessions with other ministries and agencies on possible minor revisions. But government sources said the ODA element is not expected to rise any higher than 4.6 percent in the budget for fiscal 1994, which starts April 1. The rate of increase in the ministry's draft ODA budget, which compares with the previous fiscal year's 6.5 percent hike, is the lowest ever, undercutting a 5.8 percent boost in fiscal 1987. It is the fourth consecutive decrease since an 8.2 percent hike in fiscal 1990. Ministry officials attributed the low rate of increase to severe fiscal constraints. They said it reflects efforts to strike a balance with the rest of the government's general account budget, in which a mere 1.0 percent increase was proposed, the lowest rate in seven years. But they pointed out that the low rate of growth would be significantly offset in dollar terms by the high yen. Fiscal 1993's proposed ODA budget was calculated at the rate of 122 yen to the dollar, while this year's was figured at 106 yen, they said. The Foreign Ministry had sought a 7.9 percent increase in August for its own aid budget for fiscal 1994, but the Finance Ministry proposed a mere 0.9 percent rise. In fiscal 1993 the Foreign Ministry accounted for roughly half Japan's overall 1.01 trillion yen ODA budget. Finance Ministry officials said the proposed budget maintains the overall line of Japan's ODA program, while greatly expanding funding for projects that can be implemented at the grass roots level. To that end, officials noted that the ministry proposed a 50 percent increase in small-scale project grant assistance and a 22.7 percent increase in support for nongovernmental organizations engaged in development and humanitarian efforts overseas. But although 1.5 billion yen is devoted in the budget proposal to small-scale project assistance worldwide, it is less than other proposed ODA expenditures such as an allocation of 1.9 billion yen to build an "international center" on Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido. The ministry proposes a 10 percent decrease in Japan's contributions to international organizations, down from fiscal 1993's 147.7 billion yen to 132.9 billion yen. But it allocates 54.9 percent more funding for environmental conservation activities coordinated by the United Nations. The budget proposal called for a 1.1 percent increase in bilateral grant aid from 243.1 billion yen to 245.8 billion yen, while recommending that bilateral technical assistance should grow by 4.9 percent from 210.2 billion yen to 220.4 billion yen. The most massive increase in the proposed budget is in development aid for Palestinians, a 300 percent hike to 100 million dollars, reflecting progress made in recent Middle East peace negotiations.
