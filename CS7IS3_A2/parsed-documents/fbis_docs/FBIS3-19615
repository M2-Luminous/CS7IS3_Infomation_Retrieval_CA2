This applies in particular to Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen who in the early hours of yesterday brought home a fisheries agreement that in every important respect protects our vital interests. But the real job is only now beginning for him too because it is his task to convince the fishing population that it can feel secure that our responsible management of fish resources in the north will continue even after the period of transitional arrangements runs out. There can be no objections to the agreement. Now that the final piece is in place we have -- as Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland has pointed out -- achieved an agreement that guarantees Norway an equal place in the shaping of Europe's future. We should therefore seize "this historic opportunity to take part in the political cooperation on our continent, alongside our Nordic neighbors." The prime minister is right when she says that by doing so we will be able to achieve greater influence over political cooperation on employment, the environment, and social security. And -- no less important -- it is within this community that we will best be able to defend out foreign and security policy interests. There can be no doubt that we have a contribution to make to the shaping of tomorrow's Europe. But the government should not think that the completion of the negotiations means that it has done its bit. It is now that the real work will start, for the prime minister, for the fisheries minister, and -- for that matter -- for all the others who are convinced that our future must be based on full participation in committed European cooperation. For we will not become members of the EU unless the majority of the Norwegian people is persuaded -- and persuaded among other things that membership will "increase our right of self-determination in relation to the forces that we today have too little control over." At the start of the battle for the soul of the Norwegian people -- for this is what the battle will basically be about -- the prime minister should not entertain hopes that the debate will be very different from the debate 22 years ago. Predictions that we are moving toward catastrophe are already lining themselves up. The more measured evaluations of EU membership in which many people are putting their faith are not as yet dominating the debate. On the one side there are the fundamentalist opponents of EU membership who claim without reservation that the choice is between continuing as an independent state or being swallowed up by a new and monolithic state that is coming into being. Hopefully the majority will not take this distorted picture of the committed cooperation among independent states as the gospel truth. After all, to the very end of the at times extremely difficult and dramatic negotiations we now have behind us, we have seen crystal clear examples that show that member states know how to defend their special interests. This is true of the negotiations on fisheries issues in particular. Further confirmation of this is provided by the fact that the EU also has to sort out its own internal conflicts and its voting rules before the Community will be in a position to admit the four applicants nations that have now completed their negotiations for membership. Despite the prospect of forthcoming membership, it still remains to be seen whether the majority of the Norwegian people will allow themselves to be persuaded that the EU is something very different from what its opponents claim it is. This battle can only be won through an active and accurate information campaign about what we are actually facing, and about the unique opportunities that are now emerging. After all, the view the opponents of EU membership like to take of things is inaccurate -- that the choice is between stepping into an unknown future and continuing as if nothing had happened. The fact is that we applied for membership in part as a consequence of the fact that our neutral and nonaligned neighbors applied for membership as a result of a recognition that it was a completely new Europe that was taking shape after the demolition of the Berlin wall. We have already had painful experience of the international trends that have washed over Norway with full force. In our dealings with the problematic real world it will be of crucial importance that we are there to plead our cause when important decisions are to be made. The most dramatic choice we could make in this new situation would be to opt to remain outside. It is not difficult to undertand that people might have wanted a different situation in Europe. However, the fact is, as Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal pointed out in Brussels the other night, that all the other countries of Europe are now taking their bearings in relation to the EU. Regardless of how many people may emerge as opponents of the EU, Norway cannot create its own alternative world. We must relate to the Europe of which we are part when, after a thorough debate, we go to vote in a referendum. As far as the timing of the referendum is concerned, we should take the time we need. An additional consideration is that what Sweden and Finland do will probably play a decisive role for the majority of the Norwegian people. The worst thing that could happen would be that the border between the new Europe and Norway were to be drawn between Norway and Sweden. A common date for the referendums in the Nordic countries would conflict with our national interests.
