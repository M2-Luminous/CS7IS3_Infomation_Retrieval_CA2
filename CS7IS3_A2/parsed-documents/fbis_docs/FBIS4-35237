House Speaker Tahir al-Masri said Sunday he hasn't yet looked into ways of dealing with the request, which was made by Anis Hasan Yahya, president of "the Provisional Assembly for National Salvation" the caretaker parliament in the "Yemen Democratic Republic." In the letter, which was faxed to Mr. Masri Saturday evening, Mr. Yahya called on Jordan to intervene to "end the bloodshed and the destruction for our people and country" by demanding an end to the war and the withdrawal of northern Yemeni forces to the borders that existed between South and North Yemeni before they merged in 1990. Mr. Yahya also called on the Kingdom to work with other "Arab brethren" to launch unconditional negotiations between the warring parties in Yemeni under the auspices of the Arab League. The southern Yemeni official said Aden welcomes a prominent role for Jordan in negotiating an end to the war, especially that Amman hosted the signing of the Yemeni reconciliation accord in February. Civil war erupted in Yemen on May 4 after Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his then Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid failed to find a peaceful settlement to their conflict. Mr. al-Bid later declared an end to the merger between the north and the south, forming the Democratic Yemeni Republic. More than three weeks of fighting have failed to produce a military victory for either side and observers expect a protracted civil war. Mr. Salih has rejected foreign mediation efforts, including those by the Arab League, saying the war is an internal Yemeni affair. The official Jordanian media has taken what seems to be a pro-north Yemeni stand, referring to the government in Sanaa as the legitimate government and calling the forces of Mr. al-Bid secessionists. Parliamentary sources said Sunday that Jordan opposes the fighting and supports unity, accepting whatever the Yemeni people decide for themselves. "We will not impose anything on any side," one lawmaker said.
