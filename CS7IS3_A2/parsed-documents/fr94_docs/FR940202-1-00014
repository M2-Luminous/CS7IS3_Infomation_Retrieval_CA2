(c) If any corrosion is found during any inspection required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this AD, prior to further flight, rework the affected area and perform a non-destructive testing (NDT) inspection to detect cracks in the MLG wheel axles, in accordance with Appendix A of Dowty Aerospace Service Bulletin F100&hyph;32&hyph;63, Revision 2, dated September 23, 1993 (if corrosion is found during the initial inspection required by this AD); or Dowty Aerospace Service Bulletin F100&hyph;32&hyph;64, dated September 23, 1993 (if corrosion is found during a repetitive inspection required by this AD); as applicable. After rework, continue to perform repetitive inspections of the affected area in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD.

After replacement of the affected sliding member, continue to perform the repetitive inspections in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD. (e) As of the effective date of this AD, no person shall install a Dowty Aerospace MLG, part number 201072011, 201072012, 201072013, 201072014, 201072015, or 201072016, on any airplane unless the requirements of this AD have been accomplished on that MLG. Following its installation, the repetitive inspections required by paragraph (b) of this AD shall be accomplished on that MLG. (f) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113.
