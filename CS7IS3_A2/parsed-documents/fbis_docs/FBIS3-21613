Confessed drug trafficker Carmelo Dominguez, aka ``Meco,'' in a statement to authorities of the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN), linked Paz Zamora and his closest aids with the most important Bolivian drug traffickers. Acting MIR leader Oscar Eid said that a congressional commission will determine whether or not the party as an institution was linked to drug trafficking, and added that if there is evidence involving one or another of the leaders, "we will promote the appropriate legal proceedings." Eid also asserted that "there is no reason for the former chief of state (Paz Zamora) to be subject to any investigation." So far the Bolivian media have published about half a dozen photographs of Paz Zamora accompanied by former Army Captain Isaac Chavarria, aka Oso, who is regarded by the FELCN as one of the greatest alleged drug traffickers. Dominguez asserted that Paz Zamora personally "closed a deal" during a meeting in 1987 with Chavarria and Jorge Roca Suarez, aka "Techo de Paja [Thatched Roof]"--currently in prison in California, the United States, charged with drug trafficking--for $500,000 in financial aid for the MIR's electoral campaign.
