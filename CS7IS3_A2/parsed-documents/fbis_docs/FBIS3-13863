The compromise proposed by Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Terje Larsen would allow between 300 and 500 lightly armed observers to be deployed in the West Bank town of Hebron, they added. Between 600 and 1,000 other observers would be deployed in the Gaza Strip, while between 1,100 and 1,200 men would be dispatched to Jericho. PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat agrees to the plan so long as it is implemented quickly, the diplomats said. The observers, totalling between 2,000 to 2,700 men, would conduct joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols under Israeli command. The diplomats said Arafat would likely go to Paris Thursday for talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and for discussions with European donors to the financial aid plan for the future self-rule authorities. The PLO suspended talks to launch autonomy in Gaza and Jericho after a Jewish settler shot dead 30 Arab worshippers at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron last month. The PLO has vowed not to resume the talks until it receives adequate security guarantees from Israel.
