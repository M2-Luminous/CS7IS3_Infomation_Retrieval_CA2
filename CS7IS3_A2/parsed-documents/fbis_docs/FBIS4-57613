She denied that the Guatemalan Government is not doing anything about the situation and said that efforts have been made both in Washington and at the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala. The minister said the interested parties should be aware that this warning is not aimed at Guatemala alone, but that such directives generally include several countries. That is why the Guatemalan Government has presented the necessary social and economic arguments for a favorable resolution, although this warning is a unilateral U.S. decision. She said the hunger strike declared by a U.S. citizen in front of the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City is something that Washington should take into consideration when a new decision is made.
