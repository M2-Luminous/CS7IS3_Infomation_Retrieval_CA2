It has gone beyond the confines of individual regions and can no longer be considered one of the social problems or forms of crime outside the general economic and political context. The narcotics business is actively invading the sphere of international politics and world economics as a dominant factor. That is the opinion of the International Narcotics Control Committee expressed in the report of the director of the regional representation of the UN program UNDCP, Arkadius Meydzhik. In a most direct way it affects Uzbekistan, which at this time is one of the major consumer states and transit zones through which narcotic substances are transferred from Asia to Europe. Despite the fact that, according to official data, only 4,400 drug addicts and 3,700 people potentially willing to use a drug are registered in Uzbekistan. But the percentage of narcotic substance users is much greater than the state statistics. Incidentally, even governmental circles acknowledge this. Unfortunately, UNDCP representatives do not have complete information. Thus, according to Mr. Meydzhik, a characteristic feature of some law enforcement organizations of Uzbekistan is the unjustified top secrecy of the information they have. As a result, UNDCP is forced to work with official statistics which, alas, too often pass off wishes as fact. At the same time, however, according to a sociological survey by independent experts and from sources close to law enforcement services, 1 out of every 100 of the republic's residents may be classified as persons who have tried narcotics at least once. The percentage of those who regularly use these drugs is also high. Drug use is most widespread among public transport drivers, workers, college students, and vocational-technical school students. Cannabis is one of the main types of narcotics found in Uzbekistan. Moreover, in some corners of the republic the use of opium, especially its derivative koknar, is quite widespread. Undoubtedly, the government of Uzbekistan is taking concrete steps to resolve the problem, in particular regularly conducting "Black Poppy" operations to destroy plantings of opium poppies and developing programs to preserve industrial fields of hemp. But the development and application of new criminal procedure laws as well as ones now in operation which do not yet satisfy the existing convention are needed. Contemporary information systems and many other things must be introduced. And most importantly, consolidation of all interested organizations is needed rather than secrecy.
