So when it became necessary to create such centers in Belorusia [Belarus] and the Ukraine [na Ukraine], it was no wonder that they turned to the missile troops in particular for their experience, and there is no denying that such experience exists there. Suffice it to recall that since the founding of the support center -- this dates back to the time of the implementation of the Treaty on Intermediate-and Shorter-Range Missiles -- 826 deployed and nondeployed intermediate-range RSD-10, R-12, and R-14 missiles, 608 launchers for those missiles, 60 missile operational bases, and dozens of auxiliary installations have been scrapped under the organizational control of the Strategic Missiles Forces High Command and officers from the center and with their direct participation.... The forthcoming work involved in the reduction of strategic offensive arms is even larger in scale. The intensity of the center's activity is now determined by the fact that missile men began the planned destruction of obsolete missile complexes last year without even waiting for the ratification of START-I and START-II. More than 200 silo-based missile launchers were removed from service and then destroyed. A lot of work, notably by the center's specialists, went into the creation of the Russian destruction bases in Surovatikha and Pibanshurye and the preparation of sites for the reception and stationing of U.S. inspection groups at Strategic Missile Forces installations.... Colonel General Aleksandr Petrovich Volkov, first deputy commander in chief of the Strategic Missile Forces, who heads the entire destruction project, believes that "the missile troops are absolutely ready to ensure the successful fulfillment of all the commitments made under the treaty." Who are they, these people who bear the burden of the destruction program on their shoulders? Colonel Anatoliy Murashenkov, the center's chief, now takes up the story: "Officers of the Support Centers for Implementing Arms Reduction Treaties are real missile men. They only employ people who have a wealth of military experience, who know missile work and technology inside out, and who have years of alert duty behind them." Col. Murashchenkov himself, incidentally, was chief of a combined unit's operational department prior to his appointment to the Support Center (it was called the Center for Destruction Management [Tsentr upravleniya likvidatsiyey] then). Prior to that he had a learned all there is to know about missile service from many posts. Like all the other officers he learned the science of weapon destruction "from scratch" and by practical experience. No one in the missile forces at that time knew as much as he did. I met with other specialists at the center. Colonel Valentin Romashev, Colonel Georgiy Khristoforidi, Lieutenant Colonel Anatoliy Pavlov, Lieutenant Colonel Nikolay Shpirko, Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Yakunin.... They, like other officers, have clearly defined duties. Some are responsible for the planning and coordination of destruction work and monitoring the fulfillment of treaty obligations, others are busy with the arms-destruction related problems of the military economy [voyskovoye khozyaystvo] and the use of the funds thus released.... Much time is spent on preparing and providing support for the inspection work. During the center's six years' existence 316 inspection groups have visited the Missile Forces alone. They monitor progress in implementing the Treaty on Intermediate- and Shorter-Range Missiles (reciprocal inspection activity under the treaty will not end until the next century) and of conventional arms agreements.... "After the completion of special courses," Colonel Vladislav Alekseyev says, "the center's officers themselves work in inspection groups in the United States, Belgium, Britain, Germany, and Italy." Vladislav Arseniyevich, for example, has twice done inspection work at the Hercules plants in Salt Lake City. I did not catch the demolition engineers at home that day. Colonel Vasiliy Orzhekhovskiy and Colonel Mikhail Kiryushin together with their subordinates were busy organizing and providing backup for the unique job of destroying silo missile-launchers, which KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already written about and which people have been able to see for themselves in a recent Radar TV movie for Ostankino Television. But the duty shift was there that day, as it was supposed to be. Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Kirshkovskiy and Major Andrey Titov were busy with current operational work, maintaining communications with the National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center and receiving information from the CSCE.... The work at the center seemed to me to be routine and free of fuss. Even when the latest notification of an inspection from the United States arrived I did not see any change in the pace of work. They did not know which Strategic Missile Forces installation would be inspected or on what scale the inspection would be (there is a memorandum stipulating this), but the officers knew well what they had to do in these circumstances. Just as they do in all other situations connected with the destruction of nuclear missiles, furthermore.
