Shopkeepers refuse to accept or change them for other money. Smart dealers swap such banknotes for 20 per cent of the sum exchanged. Local financial experts suggest two reasons for the panic. Firstly, it might have been caused by Moscow press reports that the Russian market is flooded by forged 50,000-rouble banknotes. Secondly, it could have been caused artificially by local shady businessmen, who waxed rich last summer by cheaply buying up 1961-1992 Russian roubles, which were then being withdrawn from circulation.
