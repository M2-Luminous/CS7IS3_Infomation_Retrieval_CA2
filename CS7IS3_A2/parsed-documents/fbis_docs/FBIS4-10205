The people in the border cities of the southwest of the Dominican Republic have been deprived of fuel for several days due to the flourishing trafficking of oil products with Haiti, according to what the correspondent for the Haitian press agency in Santo Domingo has seen. This situation has paralyzed the enterprises in several Dominican cities, including Duverger, (Villard), Ragua, Neyba, Galvan, Tamayo, and Vicente Noble. Besides, numerous Dominicans, who went to these cities for Holy Week, have not been able to return to the cities from which they came due to lack of transportation. Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer, whose regime is accused of violating the sanctions imposed on Haiti, stated on 2 April, during an electoral tour of Romana city, that his government was employing all necessary efforts to definitively control smuggling at the Haitian-Dominican border. The ban on smuggling is part of a new strategy aimed at restoring democracy in Haiti, said the Dominican head of state. The announcement of these measures was made following the visit to Santo Domingo last week of U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd, who told President Balaguer about the the United States' concern over the increasing violation of human rights in Haiti.
