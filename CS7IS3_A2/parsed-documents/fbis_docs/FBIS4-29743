The survey covered 2,300 small and midsize manufacturing members of the chamber. Of the total, 22.1 percent, or 509 firms, responded. According to results of the survey and observations of industry analysts, Japan can expect further "hollowing out" of its industrial base in the coming years. The analysts noted that high domestic wages, coupled with an eroding international competitive power due to the yen's rise, are prompting smaller firms to set up shop in foreign countries. Of the respondents, 24.2 percent said they have already set up wholly owned subsidiaries abroad or acquired an equity stake in overseas businesses. The survey also found that 21.6 percent of the respondents plan to invest abroad. Of these, 91.8 percent said they intend to invest in Asian countries, with China ranking the highest in popularity, followed by Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.
