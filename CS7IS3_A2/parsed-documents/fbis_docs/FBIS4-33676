Several proposals were made during the closing ceremony of this important international event, which was attended by Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas, Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar, and Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchu. The three-day event, which ended on the evening of 1 June, proposed that the new order of relations with indigenous communities guarantee the recognition of the indigenous identity and the historical rights of their political, juridical, economic, social, and cultural institutions. It must also guarantee the total and free participation of the indigenous communities in all aspects of society, and especially in the issues that concern them. These and other recommendations will be proposed to the United Nations next December in an effort to prepare a declaration of the International Decade of World Indigenous Communities. Another proposal calls for strict compliance with the necessary measures to intensify the struggle against racism and against the cultural, linguistic, racial, and religious discrimination affecting the indigenous communities. Also in coordination with the organizations and institutions of the indigenous communities, a decision was made to adopt new necessary measures to guarantee the adequate participation of the indigenous communities in the distribution of the budget of each country, to eradicate poverty and isolation. Another proposal advocates the implementation of national policies for distribution of land, education, employment, technical assistance, protection of traditional economies, and sustainable ecological development, respecting the tradition of the indigenous communities, in order to improve their standard of living. The conclusions of the meeting also recommend the protection of the beliefs and rituals of the indigenous communities as an expression of their basic right to their cultural identity and to allow the indigenous communities access to the media to promote their culture and their opinion of society. The specific resolutions of the indigenous communities of Latin America and the Caribbean will seek free participation in the decisionmaking process for all aspects of society. The Fides news agency listed the following resolutions: -- Make express recognition, through the implementation of constitutional, legislative, and administrative measures, of the responsibility and historical rights of the indigenous communities established within states, as well as of the rights resulting from international treaties and agreements. -- Establish effective equal mechanisms for the negotiation and solution of conflicts that may develop between the indigenous communities and the non-indigenous sector (public or private) of society, including the possible violation of the individual or collective human rights of those communities. -- Establish one day of each year as an official day for public awareness of indigenous dignity, and study the possibility of establishing in penal legislation harsh penalties for those who commit acts harmful to the dignity of indigenous communities. -- Adopt measures to ensure the total eradication of discriminatory policies and practices on labor matters.
