Are the differences substantive and of the kind that may preclude a final agreement? [Quray'] Slowing up may be too strong a word and would suggest there is deliberate foot dragging, which is not the case. We are striving to hammer out an agreement. However, there are key issues that must be thrashed out. Take, for instance, the value added tax, which should not, under any circumstances, be as high as that levied in Israel. We proposed, and Israel rejected, a compromise of 15 percent. There is also the question of the tax deducted from Arab workers, which, incidentally, I don't think is an insurmountable hurdle, since there seems to be an inclination to reimburse the Palestinian authority. There is the more weighty issue of import policies. Israel wants to keep the same customs policies that are in force now under the occupation regime. We are interested in istituting cooperation with Israel, but without the continued Israeli domination of the Palestinian economy. The Palestinians must enjoy free and independent decisionmaking. In this area, we proposed a reasonable formula which they have rejected. We drew up a list of goods the Palestinian authority would import from the Arab markets, but we have not been able to work out an agreement. For us, this is an important issue, since we are a part of the Arab world. Our strategic heartland is Arab, and so we cannot have a one-way relationship with the Arabs, exporting to them without importing from them. That was a particularly delicate issue. [Mu'addi] How is it that economic issues are posing a hurdle to an agreement, after the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have come that far? [Quray'] Important as the other negotiations are, I think that, outside the security concerns, economic issues are the most important. Security and economics are the mainstay of the interim period. If we have kept the media at bay and failed to report on our economic talks on a daily basis, this has not been to belittle them. I regard the economic talks the more important of the two sets of negotiations. We are not talking here just about Gaza and Jericho; the talks are about the entire interim stage covering the areas of industry, agriculture, tourism, finance, and banking. Taken as a whole, these issues are highly important and must receive the attention they merit. [Mu'addi] Back to the Cairo talks, is 4 May a definite date for signing the Israeli-Palestinian agreement? [Quray'] I cannot be so specific. I think, though, early May should see the Declaration of Principles put in place. The two sides are determined that this happen. [Mu'addi] Thank you. [Quray'] Thank you.
