The two satellites have now been injected into synchronous orbits, according to reports from Xian Satellite Control Center and the space measurement vessel "Yuanwang" which was observing the satellites at the Pacific. The two satellites were launched by a "Long-March 3A" carrier rocket, which was developed recently by the Space Industry Corporation for launching China's new-type communications satellites. The "Long-March 3A" rocket, which was patterned after "Long-March 3," is capable of launching a 2.5-ton satellite. The "Long-March 3" rocket, which is capable of launching a 1.4-ton satellite, ranks fourth in the world in terms of launching capabilities. The scientific satellite "SJ-4", carrying six sound instruments, will probe charged particles and their effects in near-earth space. With the satellite, which was developed by the space center under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese space scientists can calculate the parameter of the particles' distribution and the necessary electric potential for charging satellite batteries.
