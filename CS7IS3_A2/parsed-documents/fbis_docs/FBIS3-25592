FBIS3-25592 "drafr036_c_94021" FBIS-AFR-94-036 Document Type:Daily Report 23 Feb 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AVF Denies Knowledge of Plans MB2002190694 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1831 GMT 20 Feb 94 MB2002190694 Johannesburg SAPA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Johannesburg Feb 20 SAPA--The Afrikaner Volksfront's [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] official spokesman on Sunday denied any knowledge of allegations that right wing plans for starting a civil war were well-advanced, and that hostilities could begin when Parliament reopened. AVF spokesman Stephan Maninger also rejected as ridiculous a secret document, partially reproduced in the Afrikaans Sunday newspaper RAPPORT, which detailed the treatment of "prisoners of war". RAPPORT said impeccable sources averred that about 50 young retired South African Defence Force soldiers, mainly brigadiers, colonels and commandants, had been hatching war plans for the past few weeks. "V-day," [volkstaat day] when the action would commence, could be when Parliament re-opened next month, the report said. The AVF's leadership and interim government were unaware of these plans, the report said. Said Mr Maninger on Sunday: "The AVF has made it clear in the past that it would seek every possible peaceful alternative before considering any military action whatsoever. "We are of the opinion that if there is such a document its origins are within those organisations who intend to discredit and demonise the AVF," Mr Maninger said. A government intelligence source said on Sunday the developments, if true, would be in line with information of a schism between the militant commando factions of the AVF and its leadership which was still pursuing a political solution by means of talks with government and the African National Congress. The source said the militant faction mistrusted some AVF leaders, suspecting them of being government agents. AVF leader Gen Constand Viljoen said on Saturday certain intelligence services were making attempts to cause division among right wing Afrikaners, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reported earlier. Gen Viljoen said Afrikaners were vulnerable to infiltration, and it was a technique of intelligence services to infiltrate such ranks and sow division. He later told SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news staff that it was possible the government's intelligence service was involved. Gen Viljoen would not give examples of the alleged infiltration, but said certain things were happening which caused him to draw this conclusion.
