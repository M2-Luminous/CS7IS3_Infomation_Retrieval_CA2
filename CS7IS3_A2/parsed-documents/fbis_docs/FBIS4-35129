This was asserted by Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu just after a long meeting with members of the International Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. He said the matter was discussed at length with congressmen. Answering a question on a possible "obstacle" as a result of government negotiations to find a common external tariff, the minister said there are no obstacles. He said the schedule that must be concluded by 30 June 1994 is on target. Regarding the disagreement expressed by the Chamber of Industries, Abreu said there will be a meeting today with the private sector, which will offer an "opportunity to listen to all opinions. The minister recalled that "a postponement regarding external tariffs has been sought...we want to know what arguments are being used. We want to know what level of political consensus can be achieved in such a delicate matter as this. He stated that Uruguay needs, beyond all sectorial interests, a clear signal of its prospects and national interests on this subject. Regarding the possibility of approving the position of industrialists, Abreu stated that the current opinion is neither favorable nor unfavorable and that "a schedule was established during the January negotiations which must be fulfilled. An effort is therefore being made to define a common external tariff. This effort seeks to fulfill the various phases of the treaty without making any changes." He said he is unwilling to close any channel, adding that "open dialogue is being conducted internally and externally," but without going outside the law. Julio Maria Sanguinetti, the Batllist Forum's presidential candidate, stressed on 22 June during several radio interviews that the report published by EL PAIS on 19 June under the headline: "Sanguinetti: The Mercosur [Common Market of the South] Must Be Postponed," does not reflect reality because he did not propose any such thing. His remarks, which were broadcast by Radio Sarandi during a rally at Empalme Olmos on 18 June, are as follows: "Through Mercosur we should be able to enter a new stage of transition. We have already had one stage of transition. The Mercosur treaty specifies that all tariffs will be eliminated on 1 January 1995. This is not possible, we must begin a new stage of transition so that another readjustment period of four or five years can be implemented, let us implement another readjustment, let us evaluate every situation...." The expected government reaction to Sanguinetti's remarks was not long in coming. Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas stressed that Uruguay's adhesion to Mercosur "is beyond the point of no return." He expressed concern that very important topics for the country--such as Mercosur and the exchange rate--are being used glibly for election purposes. During an ACDE [Association of Christian Executives] luncheon on 22 June, the minister said: "The intention now exists to undermine the government in an international negotiation like that of Mercosur."
