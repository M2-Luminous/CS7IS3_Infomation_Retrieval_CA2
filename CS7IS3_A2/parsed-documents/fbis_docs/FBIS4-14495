Serhiy Holovatyy believes that the scenario envisioning a vacuum has failed to materialize in spite of the flawed electoral law; and it was the people, who actively participated in the election, that headed off this scenario. In his opinion, after the second-round elections, the new parliament will be able to get down to work. However, it must be reform-minded in nature to operate successfully. You cannot overcome the crisis with an antiquated background, he stressed. Continuing on the topic of economic reform, Volodymyr Lanovyy emphasized: I stand for uniting all economic concepts that would help transform Ukraine into a wealthy state. We have nothing to fight for right now. We must unite. At the same time, Volodymyr Lanovyy said he was concerned about the political standoff that came to a head in the country, as well as the too-politicized election process. He thinks that the electorate cast its ballots either for far-right or far-left candidates. Only those who will work and not just talk should be elected to parliament, he stressed.
