"The idea of Former Prime Minister (Kiichi) Miyazawa to hold a forum for the comprehensive development of Indochina last year, the preparatory meeting last December, and the expected ministerial meeting in the near future, would facilitate these countries' reintegration into the mainstream of Southeast Asia's dynamic economic development," he said. Thailand and Japan believe that economic prosperity is the key to enduring peace and stability in Southeast Asia, Prasong said in his opening speech at the international conference on Japanese International Responsibility and Contribution to Peace and Prosperity in the Asia Pacific. Prasong said there was a concensus that prosperity required a certain amount of peace and stability and that the two conditions reinforced each other. The two-day conference was organized by Thammasat University's Institute of East Asian Studies and sponsored by the Japan Foundation. The seminar was attended by Thai academics, representatives of the embassies of Japan, China, and South Korea, and of international development agencies and Thailand's Department of Technical and Economic Cooperation. The director of the university's East Asian Study Center, Professor Surachai Sirikrai, said this kind of seminar, though academic-oriented, could help explore ways to shape and reinforce Japan's role in the region.
