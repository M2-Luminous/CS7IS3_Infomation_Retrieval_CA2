FR941202-0-00113 FR941202-0-00011 One commenter objected to EPA's proposal on this issue, arguing instead that ``EPA's current program for amnesty for small businesses should be expanded to other sources which conduct voluntary compliance audits'' and that such a revision would be consistent with Congressional intent. The commenter's reference to ``EPA's current program'' is apparently a reference to EPA's August 12, 1994, guidance memorandum entitled ``Enforcement Response Policy for Treatment of Information Obtained Through Clean Air Act Section 507 Small Business Assistance Programs'' signed by Steven A. Herman (herein referred to as the ``SBA Enforcement Guidance''). That document sets forth EPA's position that State Small Business Assistance Programs which provide small businesses voluntarily seeking compliance assistance a limited period to correct violations observed or revealed as a result of such assistance are approvable under Section 507 of the Act, provided the State program contains certain conditions. EPA disagrees that the Oregon statute is consistent with either title V or the SBA Enforcement Guidance. Section 70.11(a) requires that States be able to collect a penalty of up to $10,000 per day for each violation in order to obtain title V approval. ORS 468A.330(4)(a) would preclude Oregon from pursuing an enforcement action against a source if the enforcement action ``resulted from'' a technical assistance visit conducted under that provision. As discussed in EPA's proposal, Oregon's statute does not simply give a source a limited period of time in which to correct a violation observed during a technical assistance visit, but forever shields a source from further inspections or enforcement actions that ``result from'' a compliance assistance visit. For example, if a State inspector discovered a violation during a technical assistance visit and the source took no action to correct the violation, ORS 468A.330(4)(a) would shield the source indefinitely from further inspections or enforcement action unless the State had some independent reason for visiting the source not related to the information obtained during the technical assistance visit. The Oregon Attorney General has opined that no title V source that is a major source is eligible for assistance under ORS 468A.330(4)(a) because Oregon limits its Small Business Assistance Program to sources that meet the definition of ``small business stationary source'' under Section 507(b)(1)(C) of the Act. If, however, a source was determined to be a title V source as a result of a technical assistance visit, ORS 468A.330(4)(a) would preclude the Oregon permitting authorities from pursing an enforcement action against that source for failure to obtain a title V permit. The Oregon statute also poses title V approval problems for non-major sources that may later become subject to title V. In the SBA Enforcement Guidance, EPA interpreted Section 507 of the Act to allow States to grant non-major sources that meet the eligibility requirements of Section 507(b)(1)(C) a limited opportunity to correct violations observed during technical assistance visits. Even if EPA were to extend this policy to apply to all sources that conduct voluntary compliance audits, as the commenter urges, the amnesty granted under Oregon's statute far exceeds that policy. In short, the Oregon statute is inconsistent with the enforcement requirements of part 70 , even as EPA has interpreted those requirements under Section 507 of the Act and in the SBA Enforcement Guidance, for certain non-major sources. Accordingly, EPA maintains that ORS 468A.330(4)(a) bars full approval of Oregon's title V program, but does not preclude interim approval. B. Options for Approval/Disapproval EPA is promulgating interim approval of the operating permits programs submitted by ODEQ and LRAPA. 6 ODEQ will be implementing Oregon's title V program throughout the State, except within Lane County and the exterior boundaries of Indian Reservations in Oregon. LRAPA will be the title V permitting authority for title V sources in Lane County, except for sources located within the exterior boundaries of Indian Reservations. 6 The scope of this action does not include the issuance of permits or the enforcement of standards for sewage sludge incinerators under Section 405 of the Clean Water Act, 42 USC 1345. Delegation of sewage sludge incinerator permitting under the Clean Water Act, if requested by the State, would be considered in a separate administrative action (see 40 CFR Parts 122 and 501).
