He added that this act could help to dismantle the Tijuana and Guadalajara drug trafficking cartels that have damaged the country with violence and death. [passage omitted] Godinez explained: "We believe that this capture advances the investigation of Cardinal Posadas' murder mainly because the one captured is alleged to be linked to the escape of persons connected with the Arellano Felix group. This incident also leads us to regard as valid the hypothesis cited by the Mexican bishops in 1988, to the effect that drug trafficking would not occur if certain authorities were not implicated in it. This phenomenon is taking place in a clever, despicable manner on that market." He continued: "I think that we must make a distinction among the varying degrees of responsibility existing on the drug market, that is, in the drug traffic, ranging from large-scale traffickers to authorities concealing or protecting them, and including those growing and distributing drugs. "This capture gives us hope that we may learn the details of Cardinal Posadas' assassination. Furthermore, although this is an extremely difficult and complex task, we think that it could help to eliminate the drug trafficking cartels in Tijuana and Guadalajara. As pastors, what is most important to us is to prevent evils such as drug addiction, especially among the most vulnerable population: children and adolescents." [passage omitted] He explained that the bishops are aware that "although the drug trade has large-scale production and distribution operations in the national territory," it is primarily a problem of international dimensions. It is in other countries, such as the United States, that the major drug trafficking decision-making centers operate, and the largest drug consumption market exists. He emphasized that, in the text issued by the Bishops Conference, an analysis is made of the very close ties linking the drug traffic to violence and the arms trade. Those involved in it are risking their lives and those of their families. "Almost every day we hear of murders, to the point where this state of violence has become customary in some of the country's towns and regions." [passage omitted] He stressed that, in the case of the drug traffic, a distinction must nevertheless be made among the varying degrees of responsibility. The guilt of the large-scale drug market leaders, who have all the power and cleverness for carrying out their sinister business, and of the authorities implicated, is not the same as that of the day laborers, including peasants and Indians. The latter are associated with this activity because of their ignorance or extreme financial need. Finally, he indicated that the complete solution to the drug trafficking problem would lie in eliminating the demand, and rehabilitating the society demanding drugs. For this reason, he claimed, the consumer countries must also assume the share of the blame that they deserve.
