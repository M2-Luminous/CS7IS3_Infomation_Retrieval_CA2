Technologies of the 21st Century": "Photonics: Future of Broadband Technology. Light for Communication. Communication Networks Becoming the `Optical Ether' With Circuits for Lasers"; first paragraph is an introduction] [Text] Berlin, 14 Jan 94 (VDI-N)--Microelectronics in optical-fiber transmitting and receiving peripherals still decide the transmission capacity of optical systems. However, in the future photonics--optoelectronic signal processing--will decide the traffic capacity of broadband networks. Less than 0.005 percent of the more than 50 Tbps (equal to 50,000 Gbps) estimated transmission capacity ("bandwidth") of a single optical fiber is being used today. And even if one takes into account the fact that the required cascading of intermediate repeaters reduces this bandwidth to perhaps 5 Tbps, a nearly inexhaustible potential remains. This is reassuring to communications engineers, because it is becoming more and more obvious that retreading is in store for the largest and most complex machines--worldwide telecommunications systems. If multimedia terminals capable of video teleconferencing come of PCs, "it is unlikely that such machines will make do with 64 kbps," for instance, says John Buckley of British Telecom Laboratories (BTL) in referring to the foreseeable bottlenecks in the narrowband ISDN. And, in addition, the transmission capacity requirements will shoot up with mobile communications, if because of a shortage of terrestrial frequencies the base stations of the cells have to be connected via optical fiber dedicated-circuit networks. Specialists like Buckley estimate that within two decades with an average user bandwidth of 100 Mbps the traffic in national networks will increase to a total of 150 Tbps. It must be at around 75 Gbps today in Germany. So, the trend toward bit transfer rates rising into the multigigabit range will continue undiminished: 2.5 Gbps systems are already the state of the art, and 10 Gbps systems are about to be introduced. The electronic components for 40-Gbps links are already being developed in the laboratory. And with plans for bit transfer rates of 100 Gbps, engineers and scientists are already looking beyond even these targets, which should be attained in approximately four to five years. Photonics is still confined to optical-fiber external wiring. Optical signal representation is employed only in point-to-point connections, with a transmitting laser at the input and a receiving diode at the output of the optical-fiber link. Microelectronics predominate in terminals and network nodes: The gating and switching as well as the subsequent processing of digital signals take place electronically. No one doubts that fast electronic circuits based on gallium arsenide semiconductors, as those being developed by Siemens, Alcatel SEL and the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid-State Physics (IAF) in Freiburg, for example, can cope with bit transfer rates of 40 Gbps and more. However, as matters stand, the potential bottlenecks are becoming fewer in communication systems, "but are to be found in network nodes," Sonny Johanson of Swedish Ellemtel reckons. "It is important to avoid eyes of the needle that substantially restrict use of the network." The drawbacks of electronic switching stages at switching centers are obvious with ever increasing data rates. "Signals are processed bit by bit in such switches, so that power consumption could prove to be problematic," says communications engineer Hans Melchior of ETH [Swiss Technical College] in Zurich, cautioning against a strategy of "more of the same." And if electronic circuits can no longer keep pace because of the high data rates, "the switching medium at switching centers will inevitably have to be optical," Buckley of BTL believes. This means that photonic components will have to take over both space-division, time-division, and frequency-division multiplex functions in communication systems (see below). Photonics By means of photonics, in the future signals are no longer to be subject to any kind of conversion from an optical to electronic representation on the way from the transmitter to the destination station. This means that photonic components will have to take over both space-division, time-division, and frequency-division multiplex functions in communication systems: Space division multiplex stages are switching arrangements that direct the signal from an input optical fiber to the desired output optical fiber. In time division multiplex stages the timing sequence (timing relationship) of packets interleaved with one another is changed from various terminals according to the destination. They require ultrafast optical switching devices and optical buffers. In frequency division multiplex stages the switching process consists in converting the desired signal from one light carrier at frequency f[.sup]1[/] to another at frequency f[.sup]2[/] . Several of these functions have already been implemented in the laboratory by means of photonic switching devices. For instance, engineers at Alcatel SEL AG in Stuttgart have developed a "Y-laser" whose Y-type optical waveguide with one input and two outputs makes it possible to use it as a signal splitter or optical filter. As the basic module of a space-division multiplex stage the just 1.5 x 1 mm[.sup]2[/] device can guide optical signals transparently to one optical fiber output or another, and as the fast switch of a time division multiplex stage it can also extract individual packets--ATM cells, for example--from the optical bit stream. Scientists at the Heinrich Hertz Institute in Berlin demonstrated in the past year by means of a nonlinear semiconductor laser the same function in connection with synchronous frequency conversion. Into which network level these functions will be placed is thus far still an open question. For, with the almost unlimited transmission capacity of optical fibers, the network topology can in principle be simplified to a great extent: If the entire bandwidth is available at the subscriber station, no central office is needed any longer, and the terminals themselves can select the channel on which to communicate. "The core network is both simple and passive, then," says John Buckley of BTL, "but this simplicity is paid for by the availability of the full bandwidth at the terminals." Such a futuristic network is making the rounds among specialists as the "optical ether," because it bears a resemblance to terrestrial radio traffic through the "ether." According to this plan the optical fiber network would have a function similar to that of the data bus in the backplane of a computer. For instance, just as one inserts special cards into slots in a computer, new services would be offered then through the functionality of the terminals. As simple as this idea seems to be, the way to implement it is just as unclear. Rather, photonics is like a lottery for the semiconductor industry: One cannot predict today which ticket will win and which components will later on lead to value added.
