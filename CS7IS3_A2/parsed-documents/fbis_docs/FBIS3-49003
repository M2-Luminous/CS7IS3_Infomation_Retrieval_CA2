Ivanov commentary: "Opposite Poles Attract One Another"] [Text] At one time there was a popular joke to the effect that "every rumor is a reality!" It has turned out that this witticism still has topical significance. The persistent rumor of a meeting between the top leaders of the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] and BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] is on the way to being confirmed. Filip Dimitrov, SDS National Coordinating Council leader, has declared that he has met with [BSP leader] Zhan Videnov. The leaders of the two main political forces indeed have plenty to talk about. The subjects for discussion go far beyond seeking a way out from the vexatious situation in which the SDS and BSP have found themselves and possibly forming a coalition to fight local elections. Both the SDS and the BSP have their reservations regarding Dr. Zhelev, and they did not permit him to extend his powers. The same applies to any early National Assembly elections. A well-calculated amendment to the Electoral Law would enable the SDS's "disloyal ally," the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms], to be thrown overboard and ensure the tranquil existence of a two-party parliament in the future. Another question is that neither the SDS nor the BSP really want elections before the end of parliament's allotted term. This is also a subject for discussion. Regarding the naive voters (if there are any left) for whom the idea of such a meeting appears ridiculous, let them recall one of the laws of physics, which states that opposite poles attract one another.
