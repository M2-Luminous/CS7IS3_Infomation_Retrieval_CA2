At that time we people's deputies of the former USSR attended the first congress inspired and full of hope. It seemed only necessary to be elementarily honest and to learn how to expose society's diseases uncompromisingly, and our life would change cardinally for the better. We were surrounded by a halo of glory and honor on the part of the voters, and this accounted for the euphoria with which we were overflowing. Much has changed now. The times have changed, and our perception of the world has changed. Mere slogans about democracy are plainly insufficient to refashion life for the better. We have realized how responsible the post of deputy of the top organ of representative power nonetheless is. I will name just one of the lessons which we must not forget: Holding rallies and parliamentarianism are not one and the same thing. We are going to the Duma not to ascertain political predilections and sympathies but to get down to business. It is important that all deputies -- both each individual deputy and those united in groups, factions, and blocs -- advance to the fore not personal ambitions or a desire for power but the interests of Russia and its many millions of people. We have no alternative but to seek accord. Our society was paralyzed by political confrontation. Russia's former parliament took virtually no steps to overcome political confrontation. Now, I believe, everyone has realized that destiny itself and life itself doom us to accord. I hope that our work in the Duma will help to stabilize both society and our economy. There is no alternative to reforms. But a correction clearly must be made to the paths which they will take. The social thrust of the reforms must be strengthened. I absolutely agree with the president when he says that we have tried the people's patience long enough, that there is a limit to this patience. The reforms must be carried out in the future not by means of lowering the people's living standards. The opportunities for this now are broader than at the time when we were only starting the reforms. I believe that together with the president and together with the government the deputies of the top legislative organ of power will be able to find the solution to key problems in our life. The "Russia's Choice" bloc is ready for this. Konstantin Zatulin: The consolidation of various parliamentary factions depends on the reinstatement of the center, which is kicked around by everyone. The center is the blue helmets who are capable of keeping extreme forces away from confrontation. In the sphere of creating a coalition the PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] intends to orient itself toward groups of independent deputies representing industrialists, entrepreneurs, and autonomous entities. In particular, I am authorized by the party to hold talks with a number of political movements. Insisting on the reform option which will not cause productive forces to be smothered, our faction will submit to the lower chamber a number of new draft laws concerning regulation in the budget-finance and tax spheres. In the foreign policy sphere the party advocates Russia's reorientation away from distant toward nearby foreign parts and the creation of a confederation within the CIS framework. The draft of such a treaty is one of the ideas which we will attempt to get through the State Duma. As the party of the provinces, we will devote many draft laws to regional policy. The powers and rights of the regions must be clearly outlined. The PRUA has always supported the Constitution and the president and has been in favor of political stability and against all sorts of early elections and impeachments. The deputies of our faction are inclined to work for the whole term allocated to them by law and to instill order in the country by peaceful and legitimate means together with the president.
