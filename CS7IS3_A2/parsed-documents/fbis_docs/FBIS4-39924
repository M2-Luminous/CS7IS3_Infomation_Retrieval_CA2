At Sofia airport the guests were welcomed by Aleksandur Yordanov, chairman of the National Assembly (parliament). Talking to an ITAR- TASS correspondent he described the visit as "a culmination point in the contacts between the two countries' parliaments that have become especially active of late." I believe, he noted, that in the upcoming conversations we will find many points in common on issues of developing relations between Bulgaria and Russia in different spheres, and will also exchange views on the situation in the Balkans and Europe. According to V. Shumeyko, relations between these two states are now being built on a basis of equality determined by ideas of freedom and sovereignty. At the same time, they do not hamper the development of traditional ties between Russia and Bulgaria. Both parliaments can do a great deal, first of all, "by orientating legislations toward each other," something without which progress in other spheres can hardly be expected. This is one of the issues to which we attach considerable importance, the chairman of the Federation Council stressed.
