"A particularly large number of inhabitants of Moldova and Ukraine are now in pursuit of ill-gotten gains from this," Customhouse Chief A. Lyulin said. "Narcotic substances have simply been flooding in from there. Judge for yourselves: Whereas in the whole of last year we discovered 574 kg, this year we discovered 560 kg in January alone! And we are among the leading Russian customhouses in terms of drugs seizures..." The figures, of course, are not gratifying. They transport narcotics even in railcar hatches and coal bunkers. The customs officials' haul was the biggest yet: 360 kgs of poppy haulms was seized from gypsies on the Chisinau-Moscow train. They naturally disowned the goods and pretended to be illiterate to avoid reading or signing the seizure warrant. But the customs officials were particularly taken aback by the fact that this dreadful product was being transported to the capital by a woman with 14 children. Brandishing her heroine-mother papers, she expressed loud indignation at the confiscation. "How can you sell a substance which will kill babies and future mothers?"--a young customs official asked her. "What business of mine are other people's kids?" she spat out.
