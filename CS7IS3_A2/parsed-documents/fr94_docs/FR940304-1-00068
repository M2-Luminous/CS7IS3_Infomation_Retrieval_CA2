FR940304-1-00068 FR940304-1-00014 a. Energy Descriptors As discussed above, the Act established initial energy conservation standards for all of the covered products except television sets. Some of these standards were of a prescriptive form, such as the requirement of a no heat dry option for dishwashers, and others were performance standards, stated in terms of an energy descriptor, such as seasonal energy efficiency ratio for central air conditioners, annual fuel utilization factor for furnaces, etc. The intent of these standards, and the subsequent required DOE analyses and rulemaking regarding amending the standards, is to save energy. In conducting rulemakings and analyses required by the Act to determine if standards should be amended, the Department previously determined that the form of a standard may need to change in order to evaluate the efficiency standards. For example, the final rule issued for dishwashers changed the standard from the initial prescriptive standard to a performance standard based on an energy descriptor. 56 FR 22250, May 14, 1991. Additionally, the Department has determined in this rulemaking that energy descriptors may need to be changed when it is found they do not account for all of the energy or all types of energy consumed by an appliance. Not to change these energy descriptors would result in an incomplete analysis and could lead to standards being met by utilizing unaccounted energy resulting in products that might satisfy the energy descriptor but result in little or no total energy savings. Examples of unaccounted energy are the pilot light energy of a pool heater which is not accounted for by the current energy descriptor of Thermal Efficiency or the electrical fan energy of a gas furnace which is not accounted for by the current energy descriptor of the annual fuel utilization factor. Accordingly, the Department is proposing in today's notice to change the energy descriptors of the initial standards for direct heating equipment, mobile home furnaces, and pool heaters. b. Test Procedures For each product discussed in today's proposed rulemaking there is an applicable DOE test procedure to evaluate its energy efficiency. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would amend the test procedures for mobile home furnaces, direct heating equipment, and pool heaters was published in the Federal Register on August 23, 1993 (58 FR 44538); in addition, another Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which includes amendments to the test procedures for clothes washers, water heaters, ranges and ovens is being published. c. Technological Feasibility 1. General For those products and classes of products discussed in today's notice, DOE believes that the efficiency levels analyzed, while not necessarily being realized in production, are technologically possible. The technological feasibility of the design options are addressed in the product-specific discussion. The Department's criteria for evaluating design options for technological feasibility are that the design options are already in use by the respective industry, or that research has progressed to the development of a prototype. 2. Maximum Technologically Feasible Levels The Act requires the Department, in considering any new or amended standards, to consider those that ``shall be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' (Section 325 (l)(2)(A)). Accordingly, for each class of product under consideration in this rulemaking, a maximum technologically feasible (max tech) design option was identified. The max tech level is one that can be carried out by the addition of design options, both commercially feasible and prototypes, to the baseline units. 3 The Department believes that in identifying the max tech level a unit must be capable of being assembled, but not necessarily mass produced, by the effective date of the amended standards. Manufacturing ability is determined under economic justification. For example, in the November 1989 Final Rule, DOE concluded that evacuated panels for refrigerators was a technically feasible design option since refrigerators had been produced on a limited scale with this technology included. However, DOE concluded that this technology was not economically justified because the chemical industry would not be able to make sufficient quantities of the raw materials commercially available by the effective date of the standard. 3 The baseline unit is the most commonly used combination of engineering design options which are found in appliances that meet the existing National Appliance Energy Conservation Act standards except for television sets where no National Appliance Energy Conservation Act standard exists. In the case of television sets, the baseline is represented by the typical 19/20 ’ ’ television with electronic tuning and remote control. The max tech levels were derived by adding energy-conserving engineering design options to the respective classes in order of decreasing consumer payback. For example, the max tech level for room air conditioners includes higher efficiency fan motors, which were added early, and variable speed compressors, which were added later because of their slower payback. A complete discussion of each max tech level, and the design options included in each, is found in the Engineering Analysis. See Technical Support Document, Chapter 3. Tables 2&hyph;1 through 2&hyph;8 present the Department's max tech performance levels for all classes of the subject products:
