It is the occupying authority's responsibility to protect the citizens under occupation as provided by the Geneva Conventions, particularly the Fourth Convention, and international law. Consequently its responsibility is clear in this case and cannot be shirked. [Correspondent] We have already denounced the incident. Yet, considering its gravity, are practical steps being taken? [Musa] Discussions are underway, no, not discussions. Contacts and consultations are underway in New York in connection with the adoption of a resolution. We believe that the UN Security Council should adopt a resolution, not a mere statement. Some parties want only a statement. We want the Security Council to meet and issue a resolution. The instructions that we sent to New York spell this out. This is our position and I clarified this to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher when I telephoned him a short time ago to discuss the affair. What is important is that the Security Council should adopt a clear resolution on the matter. Second, the Palestinian citizens' security must be protected versus this criminality, this insanity, that the settlers and extremists show in the occupied territories, for example the criminal Kakh movement. Protecting the Palestinians is very important; this is the number one priority to prevent a recurrence of such incidents. The ongoing negotiations are supposed to enable us to achieve Palestinian self- determination, establish Palestinian autonomy, move from square one to more advanced positions, and reach a solution to the Palestinian problem. We cannot think that it is a solution to suspend the negotiations. We act as if we harm Israel when we do this. No, we must adopt such measures that will benefit us, including first protecting the Palestinians in the occupied territories and second adopting measures that will take us closer to a solution. [Correspondent] Does this incident, or rather catastrophe, in the Ibrahimi Mosque negatively influence the peace process? [Musa] This incident is undoubtedly bound to influence the peace process negatively. Its recurrence might kill the process entirely. [Correspondent] Whom has Egypt's contacted so far? [Musa] It has contacted everyone. Yesterday I issued a statement and the president telephoned Yasir 'Arafat and received a message from Clinton and a telephone call from Rabin. Christopher called me on the telephone yesterday and I called him today about this issue. In addition, we have contacted our delegation to the United Nations in connection with the Security Council meeting. [Correspondent] Minister, will this incident make the Palestinians demand a review of the status of the settlements in Gaza and Jericho? [Musa] The presence of the settlements and settlers in this way clearly causes grievous harm. [Correspondent] They are time bombs. [Musa] It is evident that grievous harm is being caused by the settlements and settlers to the peace operation and the Palestinian citizens' security. Our position remains clear on this: The settlement policy is an erroneous one that contradicts international law. These settlers, particularly the extremists such as the Kakh members, must be first disarmed and then prevented from harassing the Palestinians.
