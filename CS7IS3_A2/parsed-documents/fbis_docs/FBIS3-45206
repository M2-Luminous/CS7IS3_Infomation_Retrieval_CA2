While inspecting the two cities in Sichuan Province during January 6-11, State Councillor Li Tieying said that Sichuan should blaze a new trail of speeding up the reform and opening wider to the outside world for other inland areas in the country. The leader discussed how to promote the reform together with executives of major state-owned companies in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, and Chongqing, the leading manufacturing and commercial center in southwest China. He also visited a number of manufacturing companies in Chongqing. Li, who is also the minister in charge of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, asked local officials to step up construction of transportation, telecommunications and energy facilities in Sichuan Province. "Sichuan should also try to promptly institute a new economic system and an efficient operational mechanism," he said. The leader also asked local officials to attract more funds, technology and personnel from other parts of China and the world. Li said that current comprehensive reforms focus on the transformation of the operational mechanism of state-owned enterprises, the introduction of a modern enterprise system and implementation of macro-economic controls. "In the course of the reform the government serves both as a director and the most important actor," he told local officials. Therefore, government bodies must play a leading role in the establishment of a modern enterprise system, while transforming their own functions, he noted. Li Tieying stressed the importance of freeing businesses from the burden of "running society" -- taking charge of all employees' welfare -- by introducing a social security system. "Only by solving that problem will enterprises be able to become vigorous in market competition," he said. Speaking of cultivating a market structure, the leader stressed the need to promote the construction of production factor markets, financial markets and technology markets, as well as intermediate agencies such as accounting, auditing and law offices.
