The Lithuanian parliament took a binding decision on this question on Thursday. The parliament on Thursday did not agree to vote again on an amendment to a bill under which only political parties registered under the law on parties will take part in the elections. The amendment had been first forwarded to the parliament by Social- Democrats. The ZPL Sejm faction tabled a motion to take a vote on the amendment again. The ZPL members expressed their disapproval of the decision. The authors of the clause envisaging that only political parties should take part in the elections deny that it is allegedly aimed against Poles, but the Polish community received it like this. Bitterness is all the greater as the decision came soon after signing the Polish-Lithuanian treaty. ZPL Deputy Artur Plokszto said the decision was absolutely incompatible with present tendencies in Europe to de-politicize local governments. He said the ZPL now would have to decide whether to register as a political party or whether to give up participation in ruling in regions inhabited by Poles. The decision is to be made by the ZPL main board on Friday.
