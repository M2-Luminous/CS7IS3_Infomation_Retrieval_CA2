Forza Italia's chairman tried to play things down and confirmed his "full support" for the League. But he did acknowledge the suspicion that Bossi "wants to lead not the pole for freedoms but the say-what-you-like pole" and urged the League to avoid "self-damaging attacks of jealousy." "The alliance enjoys a good lead; we will not let one own-goal cast us into despair." But Bossi is not moderating his language. [Passalacqua] In Florence Berlusconi said that "our allies' candidates are the blood of our blood, the flesh of our flesh." What is your reply to that? [Bossi] What is Berlusconi? A vampire? [Passalacqua] A wisecrack is not enough to overcome opinion polls. [Bossi] The fact is that an attempt is being made to conceal things. The League is helping voters to see how matters stand within the parameters for freedoms created at the Assago congress. [Passalacqua] But Berlusconi is your ally, he is putting himself forward as a candidate for the premiership. [Bossi] If you are suggesting Berlusconi to me for prime minister, then I say "no." The prime minister is there (he pointed to [League lower house floor leader] Maroni), and in any case there will be no prime minister belonging to Propaganda Due. [Passalacqua] That is a fine way not to engage in polemics with an ally. [Bossi] I am not leveling charges, I am simply clarifying matters. I am just saying that I do not think that he is behaving acceptably. [Passalacqua] In what way is it unacceptable? [Bossi] If he says that he is close to the League, he does so only in order to confuse people. The League is the League, and Forza Italia is Forza Italia. It confuses not League members but the supporters, the artisans, and the small industrialists. It was we who carried out the revolution. He is hoping to confuse voters, and he can do so because through his television channels he enters people's homes and brainwashes them. [Passalacqua] Is he confusing the voters? [Bossi] He is trying to act the fox in our electoral chicken coop. I do not think that he will succeed, even if he wears make-up, powder, and a mask. Of course, he may gain some votes, but not in the part of the country important to me: the North. The League will win here. It is not Fininvest's flag that flies over Milan, but the League's flag. [Passalacqua] How do you manage to stay together? [Bossi] In all revolutions there are always two forces engaged in a dynamic relationship for hegemony -- that which carried out the revolution, the League, and the representatives of the old system that are worming their way into the new. [Passalacqua] The recycled ones? [Bossi] Let us call them the sudden converts. Forza Italia are the sudden converts, the old five-party alliance defeated in the field. Now, driven by necessity, they have insinuated themselves into the change. So it is inevitable that these conflicts will occur within the pole that will win the elections. [Passalacqua] Will you win? [Bossi] I am sure we will win. This, partly because we have put a strait jacket on the sudden converts. No less than 70 percent of the votes for the pole in the North are votes for League candidates. And in the proportional round people must know the truth. We expect them to vote for the League. If the sudden converts were to prevail, they would oppose change. [Passalacqua] One opinion poll suggests that the pole for freedoms will receive between 316 and 331 seats in the lower house. What do you think? [Bossi] I will reply by telling you what I know. I believe that the League will gain 180 deputies, and that Berlusconi will gain the same number in the South. Together, we will form an absolute majority and govern with the League setting the course. Because if those people smell jam.... [Passalacqua] What about [National Alliance leader] Fini? [Bossi] Never with the fascists. How can we join Europe if we accept the fascists in the government? That would be tantamount to admitting that the fascist pigsty can spread across Europe. We will not govern with stinking fascists. They are the Mafia, the brothel. We are the wind from the North.
