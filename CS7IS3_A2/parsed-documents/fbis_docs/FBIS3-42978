But who works strictly according to job description? Samorukov is also involved in LSI design and development and in the automation of LSI design. In other words, as Samorukov says, he takes what the logicians and experts in computer structure and architecture have developed, combines it, and pulls it through the physical implementation stage in such a way that the final prototype machine will operate reliably. [Samorukov] The point is that in specifying the limiting characteristics of our computers, all these specialists frequently forget to take into account the fact that Kvant is not independently capable of implementing their designs in hardware using existing components. We have therefore been forced to approach collaborating enterprises in the electronics industry and order new components from them; otherwise, we could only dream of reaching the required level. However, these collaborators have their own requirements: We must not only develop a concept for a new machine and determine its characteristics, not only develop plans for it, but also put all of the ideas in a document of specific form; this document is then provided to the designers of the various individual units---to designers specializing in electric power, automation, etc. One person needs to be able to keep track of all this in his head. I am that person. [KOMPYUTER MARKET] Is there any difference between what you worried about 10 or 15 years ago and what you worry about now? [Samorukov] The situation is quite different now. Before, under strict centralized government control, Kvant and its products had high priority. We had both money and confirming directives---in essence, guarantees. We took these directives and hired collaborating enterprises. And we knew that this product would come in from this enterprise and that product would come in from that enterprise in accordance with established deadlines, so that we could count on being able to construct a new machine within the required time frame according to plan, debug it, build a mockup, and present it to the customer. [KOMPYUTER MARKET] Weren't there failures under this system? [Samorukov] Of course there were. Supplies were occasionally interrupted and development sometimes slowed down, but the system generally functioned. It enabled both us and our suppliers to plan. The customers had well-defined benchmarks good to plus or minus six months or a year. It was possible to project 5-10 years ahead with reasonable confidence. The main customer for our high-production items has been the defense industry. And as soon as they began to have their budgets cut and started cutting back, the orders immediately stopped coming in, which left the Kvant Scientific Research Institute with much less financial maneuvering room. After all, the need for the equipment we produced was much smaller. Moreover, the flexibility of Kvant's supercomputer technology enables us to include 100 or even 1000 units in a single machine, while a commercial customer might be satisfied with a power of 10 or 20. It turns out that we are now working (to put it mildly) at far less than our full potential. Most ``free-market'' entities are simply not in a position to use our class of technology or components. This leads to wheel-spinning and downtime. [KOMPYUTER MARKET] Dead season? [Samorukov] Half-dead. It is now clear that without government support, ``high technology'' enterprises such as ours previously oriented towards defense work will soon experience difficulties. And this is despite the fact that many problems in pure science requiring high-performance computers (such as meteorological forecasting and seismic research) are still of current interest and remain unsolved. There is virtually no government support. The US itself, with its extremely well-developed commercial sector which has trillions of dollars available to it, has traditional government investment in supercomputer programs, and the sums involved are enormous: Last year, in 1992, the American government subsidized a supercomputer and communications technology development program with 600 million dollars. This is equivalent to 600 billion rubles. But our government has cast Kvant to the winds of fate and put us out to pasture to sink or swim. That's why we're going after any development projects at all, generally small projects completely inconsistent with the level of problems that the Kvant Scientific Research Institute is capable of working on. But what can we do? We are trying to keep our unique corps of specialists together and prevent them from running off to commercial or other enterprises capable of paying higher salaries than Kvant. [KOMPYUTER MARKET] And are you succeeding? [Samorukov] Yes, with difficulty. Many of the young people we had the most hope in have either already left or are thinking of leaving. We are only able to hold on to the older staff. After all, we stall have a budgetary limit on salaries. We even have to state this in [employment] agreements. Only very recently have we been able to talk about indexing salaries or graduated financing. To put it another way, it is completely impossible for us to provide our staff with the same standard of living that we could about ten years ago. The problem of how to keep the Kvant staff in some sort of suspended animation until our products are indeed needed by the country as a whole (and not just a limited segment) will therefore be difficult to solve. Moreover, we are now unable to invest in development as we have for many years. All of the money received by the Kvant Scientific Research Institute is now being eaten.
