Jean-Louis Borloo, an independent conservative who is also deputy mayor of the northern city of Valenciennes, said in a newspaper interview to appear Thursday that the current scale of joblessness was ruining the nation's young people. "Resign is not the right word. I disclaim it. By giving up my mandate as a lawmaker, I want on the contrary to remain faithful to my mission," he said, adding he could no longer look at voters "in the eye." Calling for a counter-offensive to put France back on its feet, he said: "The list of public impotence is too long. I want to continue to fight with my head held high." Some 3.3 million people are jobless in France -- 12.2 of the active population -- of whom 20 percent are under 26. French youngsters have taken to the streets in recent weeks to protest against a new draft law aimed at reducing unemployment by paying first-time employees 20 percent less than the minimum wage. The nationwide protests earlier this week prompted Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to effectively shelve the plan.
