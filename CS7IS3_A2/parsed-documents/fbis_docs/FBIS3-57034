New Georgiyevsk Treaty in Pipeline"] [Text] To stop Georgia's slide toward economic collapse is now possible only on condition of restored traditional economic links with Russia. The first step in this direction was Georgia's entry into the CIS last fall. In the meeting between Russian and Georgian Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Otar Patsatsiya, KOMMERSANT- DAILY reported yesterday, concrete mechanics for the republic to join the Commonwealth were discussed, and a number of bilateral agreements including one to establish a free-trade regime were approved. Georgia's desire for close economic relations with Russia stems from the crisis in the national economy, which is on the brink of collapse. In the estimate of the International "Reforma" fund, Georgia's state budget deficit in 1993 came close to 100 percent. Its debt to Russia tops 50 billion rubles [R], and the prospects for paying it are rather nebulous because Georgian exports to Russia were constantly falling, and in 1993 did not exceed R26 billion. This is in parallel with the devaluation of the Georgian coupon, whose rate against the ruble has fallen since last August by a factor of more than 100. The situation is being made even worse by an appreciable decline of supplies from Russia, primarily of energy. Deliveries of Russian natural gas were stopped as early as 1992, and after the Georgian side had been discovered illegally re-exporting Russian petroleum products (Russian raw material worth $23.1 million was shipped to France alone in the second part of 1992), the Russian side sharply cut back its oil and petroleum products supplies. Georgia hopes to stabilize the economic situation by signing bilateral agreements with Russia on trade and economic relations in 1994, and on a free-trade regime. Under these understandings, Georgia will be guaranteed supplies of Russian energy in agreed amounts while Georgian goods for Russia will be exempt from import duties. The latest meeting of the two countries' premiers in Moscow finalized 3 and 4 February as the dates of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. The above agreements will be signed during this trip. Besides, Eduard Shevardnadze is going to bring Georgia back into the ruble zone. The advantages for the Georgian side are apparent. As for the ruble, it will further weaken as a result of such an alliance. On the whole, Georgia is counting on Russia's financial and economic support in solving its own national problems. [Saneblidze]Of course. [Lominadze] It is difficult but absolutely necessary and it has to be done through systematic and purposeful propaganda and actions and not, as some leaders imagine, by thinking that, having entered these places, there is nothing else for us to do but sit idly by and wait for the results. This was precisely the mood when we entered Abkhazia. Yes, we did get from the Inguri River to Sukhumi! However, we did not advance further. It is well known what the consequences of this were for us. The same thing could possibly happen here as well. There was no hand-to-hand combat in Senaki or Khobi or Zugdidi or anywhere else. However, although those armed people have dispersed, they still exist, do they not? Of course they do. Who can guarantee to us that they will not unite again or will not use those socioeconomic problems that exist in reality for their own purposes? No one. Finally, there is a trend toward an improvement of the situation. However, we must not relax our efforts for a single moment. [passage omitted]
