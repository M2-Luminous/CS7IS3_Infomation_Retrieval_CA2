A riot erupted in the area, and IDF officers forcefully evacuated correspondents and journalists, including a Qol Yisra'el crew. Three officers dragged Qol Yisra'el's correspondent for about 20 meters, and shouted and threatened him with loaded guns, causing him slight bruises. The residents of Jericho started to riot, forcing IDF officers to disperse them with rubber bullets.
