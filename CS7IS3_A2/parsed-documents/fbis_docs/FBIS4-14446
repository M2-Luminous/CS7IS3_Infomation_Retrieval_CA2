Let me remind you that this refers to the recent publication of the scandalous version No. 1 of a coup d'etat allegedly being planned. In reply to these accusations, Yegor Yakovlev, the founder of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA today told our television agency: [Begin Yakovlev recording] [Video shows Yakovlev seated in office] If the Committee for the Press has not read OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, which stated that it was publishing a document known to be false and proving why it was false [pauses]... This is the first point. Second, there is Article 58 of the law on the press, or rather on the mass media, which says that any attempt to hamper the publishing of information will be subject to disciplinary, administrative, and criminal punishment. I do not know who signed this statement, whether it was Mr. (Mironov) or someone else, but when Mr. (Mironov) accused OBSHCHAYA GAZETA of warning society against this provocation -- and it was the first to publish this and was punished for doing it -- in this way we are being told: If you learn about another provocation, keep quiet. When a doctor tells his patient that he is ill, there is no point in hurling accusations at the doctor; similarly, this was a sick document produced by a sick society. We just demonstrated this. Another thing -- otherwise it would be too sad to talk about these attacks and persecutions. I recall the time when MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI was being persecuted in about the same way, with the same zeal, and more or less by the same organizations, though by different newspapers - yet now they say that MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI was always right.
