I'm sure it is something like ``Snow, rice, sake, and far from Tokyo.'' But it's necessary to revise this image a bit. As for rice, koshihikari is the famous brand, the charming but dry Niigata Seishu is the popular choice in sake and in terms of supplying it, Niigata boasts being third in Japan As for snow, it abounds in the ski resort areas on the borders of the prefecture, but in recent years it hardly has accumulated at all in Niigata City or other areas along the Sea of Japan. The distance in time from Tokyo is now only one hour and forty minutes on the rapid Asahi that runs on the Joetsu Shinkansen Line. If you leave Niigata at 8 AM, you can make a meeting in Tokyo that starts at ten o'clock. One might think that Niigata is primarily an area for farming and tourism, but actually it is the largest industrial region on the Sea of Japan. Since long ago, Niigata has been blessed with ``snow, and then the water from its melting,'' forming a productive region that is provided with local industries that supply the needs for food, clothing and shelter. The famous products and industries in Niigata include traditional Japanese clothing, which developed as a secondary winter industry for farmers in Tookamachi, Ojiya, and Shiozawa, synthetic fibers and knits in Gosen, Mitsuke, and Tochio. Tsubame and Sanjo, which originally produced Japanese-style nails, now after several transitions, form a base for processing metals in all fields. They are also famous for sake grown from rice and water, and Kamo is noted for its wardrobes made of pauwlonia wood. In addition to these, since the beginning of the Meiji period, Niigata has produced ``burning water,'' i.e. petroleum, which fostered the development of a drilling machine industry, ultimately becoming the foundation for the machine manufacturing and metals processing industries centered around Nagaoka. These enterprises, which have become firmly established as locally based industries, play a major role in industrial development in the prefecture. Challenges for Niigata Industry Judging from the most recent trends in Niigata industry, there has been steady growth, but it is also true that the tempo has become somewhat lax. Niigata's ranking among the prefectures in delivery of products has dropped from 19th place in this decade to 23rd. Regarding the structure of industry here, there has been progress in establishing new businesses concomitant with the development of high speed transportation systems. While the processing and assembly industries, beginning with electronic and electrical machinery have become leading industries, they comprise only 35 percent, which is nine points lower than the national average. 99.6 percent of the more than 20,000 manufacturing businesses in the prefecture are small businesses, many of which are subcontractors, so that the value added productivity is only two thirds of the national average. Consequently, an urgent challenge is to increase the added value of Niigata's industries, but in order to achieve this, it is first essential to aim at facilitating local development by improving the technological strength and planning ability of the local industries that are diverse in nature and form a solid base in the prefecture. It is also desirable for the prefecture to promote aggressively the attraction of new businesses, such as those in leading edge technology and information fields and those which possess R&D capability, in order to bring about a change in the structure of industry and to strengthen cooperation between incoming businesses and businesses already existing in the prefecture. It is desirable for the prefecture to take full advantage of the high speed transportation systems now in place, to aim for full activation of its potential by increasing the connectivity among businesses and industries. In order to achieve such objectives, it is currently developing and promoting the measures described below. Towards Improvement of Technology in Corporations in the Prefecture First of all, the Shinano Technopolis, centered in Nagaoka city, has been achieving substantial results. Last April, a plan was adopted for the second quarter, whose conceptual basis is the ``establishment of a consortium of cities for exchange of industrial technology which will become the leader in the Age of the Japan Sea Rim.'' The consortium has benefited from the arrival of new businesses and the development of corporations, and takes pride in having achieved the highest level among all technopolises in Japan in terms of the number of new sites established for business and the number of securities issued. Within the rim area, the Laser Application Engineering Center has been set up as one facet of a project to provide a national research base, and the prefecture has positioned laser processing as a major technology that will have great ripple effect on local industries. In promoting the center, it is working towards the dissemination of technology to local businesses. Nagaoka City has been designated as a regional focal point, but it is also promoting the Office Arcadia Concept and anticipates the establishment of research institutes, training institutions and information-related businesses there. Secondly, an industrial engineering center and under it six research institutes, set up by region and type of industry are conducting actual R&D and business leadership, playing a major role in improving the technology of local production industries. Concomitant with the changes in environment related to economic and technological developments, the need is increasing for strengthening collaboration between industry, academia, and government in R&D, development of human resources, and technology exchange, and for promoting R&D in the fields of technology that will form the base for progress in the prefecture in the 21st century. A ``technotank'' concept ,which is supposed to materialize this year, has been formulated in order to realize this effectively. For this reason, this year they are slated to formulate a basic plan by surveying the (current) status of the laboratory and research infrastructure, and conducting a needs analysis for technology development in the prefecture. Third, with the objective of incorporating a design viewpoint into commercial product production and business management, the Niigata Prefecture Life and Culture Creative Industry Foundation (commonly called the IDS Corporation) is active. Every February, Niigata sponsors an IDS design competition in order to determine the possibilities for the NEXT products from Niigata. It receives many entries from local industries. The outstanding participants receive guidance from specialists ( The Open Laboratory) on developing their entries into products. Fourth, implementation of measures for local small industries is a crucial task. The ``Law to Vitalize the Concentration of Local Small Businesses'' that was implemented last year is considered very effective for promoting the development of new fields of local industry in the prefecture. Those areas attempting the development of new fields are working on the gradual implementation of activation plans. Progress is also being made in establishing facilities for activation of local small businesses via local industry promotion centers in two locations, and the Sanjo branch of the College of Small Business. Fifth, in order to accelerate the location of businesses here, the prefecture is promoting prefecture-managed large scale industrial zones in three locations, and core industrial zones for public corporations for encouraging regional development. In order to increase opportunities for interchange between newly established and local businesses and strengthen cooperation between them, the prefecture has established the ``Niigata Link Project'' effective this fiscal year. Extending The Basis for the Japan Sea Rim Exchange Sphere We expect the Age of the Japan Sea Rim to arrive with the 21st century, which is just around the corner. Exchanges with countries bordering the shore of the Japan Sea will become increasingly active and the role played by areas along the Japan Sea are expected to grow in importance. By establishing the position of the prefecture as the gateway to the Japan Sea, and at the same time strengthening collaborative and cooperative relationships with neighboring prefectures, it is promoting the ``Japan Sea Kan'etsu Belt Zone Development Plan'' as the central strategic task of the prefecture. This will even further heighten the centrality of the prefecture as a node which ties it to the Kanto region via a high-speed transportation system. Niigata has been the only city to be connected to the Russian Far East directly by air route, but as of this April, regular air service with Vladivostok has been established. The runway at the Niigata Airport is currently being extended to 2500 m, and plans are under way to further expand it to 3000 m and to improve access to the airport including direct access to the JR Line. Since 1989, an annual Japan Sea Rim International Forum has been held. It will establish a Japan Sea Rim Economic Research Institute as a think tank to play a central role in generating information about Japan Sea Rim exchanges and in conducting survey research. Also, in order to promote economic exchanges, a basic plan aimed at introducing FAZ this fiscal year, and a survey designed to activate and make efficient the exchange of products within the prefecture, is being conducted. We want to construct a Niigata Prefecture that plays a vital role, by working collaboratively to create a base for exchange throughout the Japan Sea Rim area, and by producing high added value to the industries described above.
