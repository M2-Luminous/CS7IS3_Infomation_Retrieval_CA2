Maybe the urge to engage in exciting politics is so strong in our consciousness, after the years oppressed by stagnation, that we are inclined to deify the destroyers and the romantics rather than giving due credit to cautious and responsible politicians. In the ruling strata they are, so to speak, in the dugout, although they are on the team. It is not surprising that pragmatists are required to make considerably more sacrifices and produce more proofs of loyalty to democracy than are indulged in by their suspicious colleagues who are also their opponents. It is probably for this reason that State Duma Chairman Ivan Petrovich Rybkin has not yet established his image. Maybe this is partly his personal "fault" too -- as a man who does not go in for showy moves, although on occasion, maybe, this is a mistake: Populism, as a temporary measure, is sometimes necessary. The feigned refusal to recognize Ivan Rybkin as an independent political figure, the emphasis on the bare facts of his resume, and also the deliberate cultivation of the image of a "turncoat" and "traitor" and the underestimation of his strategic potential, are damaging not so much to his personal authority and the prestige of the legislators, as to the prestige of state power in general. It is time people realized this! If all this is true, what kind of Duma have we elected, if that is the kind of speaker it has? Are we capable of electing worthy rulers at all? A study of the logic of the establishment of the new power in Russia (and that is ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's main topic) requires us to look frankly at the political figures of today -- without party blinders, myths and gossip, or dogmas, and especially without devising cages of official powers for them. Asking questions does not mean eulogizing, and doubting does not mean rejecting. I feel that Rybkin's "novelty" as a politician is more or less unique. He differs from previous figures who have declared centrist positions but have soon drifted to right or left, in that one camp has not accepted him, and the other has rejected him. The way to the right and to the left is now closed for him, he is objectively obliged to remain in the center, and he has a unique opportunity to construct a centrist stance. Rybkin also differs from other politicians in that he does not repudiate his own past. He is moving toward the supporters of the new Constitution, becoming a kind of bridge between those in power and the opposition. You can reject that. You can assess it however you like. But you have to reckon with it. Ivan Petrovich Rybkin is on his way. What lies in store for him and how he will then behave, nobody can know. Although the experience of his 100 days as speaker reveals much about the personality of this politician. Read our interview with him on page 2: [Interview begins] [Kucher] The State Duma's two-year term could be a crucial period for the future of Russian parliamentarianism. I am not talking about the quantitative parameters of its work. Let us leave aside, for the moment, the number of laws adopted and to be adopted. I am talking about the fact that there is a historic opportunity, in these two years, to lay the foundations of a real parliamentarianism for our country, provided, of course, that we can shake off the spirit and traditions of the Supreme Soviet, which unfortunately are transferred from one Duma building to another along with the deputies.... Is it possible that ridding parliament of features that are alien to it could help it to move from the flanks toward the center? [Rybkin] I agree with you that Russia has long needed a proper lawmaking process. There are many gaps in this. At times, everything hangs by a mere thread. But I would not repudiate a single day of the history of Russian parliamentarianism. When people say that our parliament does not have much history, I do not accept that conclusion. What about the people's assembly in ancient Novgorod -- is that not part of our heritage? Or take the Zemskiy Sobor [assembly] which elected the czar in the terrible Time of Troubles. Then there was the State Council and the senate. There have been four State Dumas in Russia. I have carefully studied their history, and I am familiar with both the happy and the tragic chapters. And I have arrived at the firm conviction that the idea of centrism is the dominant idea. When this center was found, and there was support from the left and right wings, Russia lived peacefully and pursued the reforms it had undertaken. But when people leaned toward one wing, they suffered very serious upheavals. Therefore the people who championed the idea of the center are very dear to me as historical figures. [Kucher] You left the leadership component of the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation] on your own initiative, giving preference to the Agrarian Party of Russia. Does this step on your part confirm that you pin your hopes of creating a center party on the "agrarians"? [Rybkin] People tell me: The Agrarian Party is a conservative party. To some extent that is true, because it conserves the attitudes that form the genetic basis of the people. This is a weakness, but also a great strength. Every society must understand that it will have prosperity when the peasants enjoy success. Some 40 percent of the national product is created in the agro-industrial complex. That is the reality. And it is so not because some people support or do not support the Agrarian Party, although I myself am an agrarian -- I have had links with the peasants for the greater part of my life. If the peasants start to live prosperously, the Agrarian Party itself will be a party of the middle stratum, which is to say, the center. Those industrial workers who are able to live as well as the peasants will join the party. And I very much want the stratum of those who are prosperous to be a big one, and the center to be big. The country will thereby be strong. [Kucher] What do we want, in the last analysis? What are we building? Should we give all this some kind of name, define it?... [Rybkin] We should stop trying to delude people with all kinds of definitions. We have gone through the whole range of concepts. Let us turn our gaze to the north. There, life is more difficult, it is more difficult to build, to organize life. The ruling Social Democrats in Sweden, for instance, do not give any name to the society they live in. But the gulf between those who are very rich and those of average prosperity is three-, four-, or fivefold. In our country we never had this normal kind of inequality, it was abnormal, and now it is even more so. The gulf is enormous. So all the levers of influence must be used to prevent society from becoming so sharply stratified: through tax inspection, self-restraint, and properly perceived state interest, and by appealing to entrepreneurs' patriotic feelings. We have seen all this before in Russia's history, when businesspeople respected its laws and understood their role in the country's prosperity. I am not calling for a return to the past. But I know that many of the present representatives of national capital are well disposed toward cooperation with the state as partners. The $1.5-2 billion that goes abroad every year could and should be brought back home. Not directly, of course, not by way of administrative pressure, but with the help of economic measures, that is, voluntarily. The law must be applied to those who steal. But for those who cannot yet find scope in Russia for their minds and talents and who have to invest the capital they have earned at 5 percent in a foreign bank rather than receiving an income of 500 percent in their native state -- for those people it is simply essential that we find guarantees for their work. Maybe through the creation of transnational corporations or by other means. I have always believed that our people have fine qualities which you cannot buy for any money. Saint-Exupery called this the luxury of human contact. In Russia there has always been plenty of this. It must be valued. Handed down from generation to generation. [Kucher] You touched on the subject of the people's historical memory. I would like to ask you a question directly concerning recent political history. You once stressed in an interview that you attach particular value to the Lenin of the times of the NEP [new economic policy]. Does that mean that you advocate some kind of new approach to assessing the activity of the Bolsheviks in Russia? [Rybkin] I feel profoundly Russian by my origin and by my roots. At the same time I feel I am an inhabitant of Russia who grew up in a multinational environment. Therefore nothing in Russia's history is alien to me. Everything that happened belongs to me. I am a pragmatist. Therefore I am convinced that from all our hard-earned experience we should adopt what is most necessary and important. Our pride in our compatriots' greatness of spirit and mind should not be based on short-term considerations whereby one person is trampled underfoot in order to elevate another. All historical figures have been focal points for great good and great evil. The bigger the figure, the more significant the manifestation of both of these. Everything that was done by Peter I, by Alexander I or Alexander the Liberator -- all this passed through my family's history in one way or another. After the 1861 reform and the abolition of serfdom my forebears, who had fought, received parcels of land. They received this gift as a great benefit and clung to that land. The time of great upheavals came: the Japanese and First World Wars, the revolution. It was a peasant country. Something had to be done. But not the way they did it! And by 1920 this had become clear. My forefathers were freedom-lovers and refused to be brought to their knees, as many other citizens of Russia are refusing now. Because you can injure a person, and eventually he will understand and forgive. But you cannot humiliate him -- he will never forgive that. Every ruler who has real power must understand that. So then the NEP came along -- the wise new economic policy. The peasant finds himself in his accustomed market, he has room to maneuver. The peasants always lived in market conditions, albeit restricted or specific. Without the market of those days, I and my two brothers and two sisters would never have received higher education. The ruble, which was in the same state of upheaval as now, became gold. All these are elementary facts. I am repeating them in order to emphasize a simple thought: that if you are the leader, that is to say you are in the lead, in front of the others, it is incumbent on you to look ahead a pace or two, and not lead the others while walking backwards yourself. [Kucher] Could you name the strong and weak aspects of our government? [Rybkin] You mean, starting in 1991? [Kucher] For the sake of argument. [Rybkin] My sympathies are with the government headed by Yegor Timurovich Gaydar for their efforts, vigor, and desire to reform the economy. But I am frankly convinced that a thoroughly monopoly-based economy cannot be taken by a cavalry attack without injuries and errors. If we are thinking in terms of a system, we must understand that the reforms should involve dismantling, not destruction. An explosion is always a revolution. Bang -- then dust. But by dismantling a component and putting a new one in its place, we can change the system as a whole. The peasant who has rotting beams in his house knows how to do this without destroying the whole structure. Some of the people from that government still remain, and they are working with Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin. For the most part they are well-trained people with a good knowledge of theory. They have gained substantial experience over these years. Unfortunately, this has affected Russia painfully. It is distressing to see this. I do not want to engage in "if only's." Indeed, when they took on the job, there were not many volunteers. Now they are living through a difficult time. But the government operates as it deems necessary. It is inclined to heed parliament's opinion. Relations between us are equal, although we are rather critical about some of the government's steps. But we do not bear a grudge. In the committees there is the opportunity to discuss things with the vice premiers. In parliament's "Government Hour" (on Fridays) it is no problem for the ministers to justify or adjust their own viewpoint. There was admittedly a time when some of the young deputies raised the question of no confidence in the government. Not more than 16 percent of those present voted to put this question on the agenda. [Kucher] A situation very often arises in the government when it is necessary to act quickly, but an appropriate law does not yet exist. What is your attitude to the idea that the federal executive power could make broader use, in economic practice, of its own decrees and other normative acts? [Rybkin] The formula that forms the basis of the government's activity permits it to draw up practical, well-thought-out documents and adopt laws in a transparent form, with all interested parties playing an active part in this process. The federal budget was submitted to parliament 23 March, and was adopted on 25 March. We must not drift into an "emergency" attitude, although where it is necessary, in the interests of the cause, to regulate something by means of a government decree, this must be done, and likewise where a presidential edict is needed. But we must create a sound legislative basis, among other things as regards formulating the budget. There are those who assert that the Duma will not be able to adopt more than 30 laws in the remaining time, but that statement is unfounded. [Kucher] What does the concept of "an independent political figure" mean for you personally? [Rybkin] Everything relating to my duties. What you call independence is prescribed in the Russian Federation Constitution. It clearly states what I can and what I am not entitled to do. Some people believe that these aren't sufficient rights for the State Duma. I don't think so. The entire lawmaking process passes through the State Duma -- this imposes a tremendous obligation and a tremendous responsibility. Coordinating this work, organizing internal procedures -- all this complex process falls on my shoulders. But I believe that I am truly independent if I can heed the opinion of deputies and rely on it. The State Duma Standing Orders and other documents empower me to represent the Duma's interests in all organizations and power structures inside and outside the country. This represents a pretty broad range of questions and powers. But I repeat yet again that I constantly measure my actions against the sentiments of State Duma deputies and the State Duma Council and try never to take any step without them. Furthermore, there are always deputies around me and I have the chance to consult with them. When I was young and less experienced and was chairing faculty meetings I would listen to people and think: I was about to make such-and-such a decision but, having listened to them, I have fundamentally altered it. Thank God I listened, and thank God I altered that decision. It is important not only to listen but also to hear what people are saying -- this is also a sign of independence. [Kucher] You are sometimes accused of having betrayed your ideals, some people regard you as a defector... [Rybkin] On the subject of political retreats and defections. It seems to me that people who talk like that are maybe the ones who have lost contact with the world, whereas I move in the same direction as the world.... I live a real life, while they have their heads in the clouds. [Kucher] Historians and analysts are attempting to predict Russia's future, arguing among themselves. What do you think about its future? [Rybkin] There is a great deal that is artificial and divorced from real life in the arguments about whether Russia will become great power or not. I simply say that Russia has never ceased to be a great power. And never will. [Kucher] What is your view of how Russia will build its relations with the republics which have made the break and gone their own way, as they say? [Rybkin] I simply say that Russia is self-sufficient enough to weather any crisis. And we are weathering it. Those who have made a wrong move will probably soon realize. We learn by comparing. We all have to seek our own solution. But I am convinced that many will try to get closer to Russia. How this will be formalized -- by a Treaty of Georgiyevsk or of some other kind -- I don't know. But I do believe, for example, that the Russian-Belorussian [Belarusian] treaty and the things it offers is the correct path, particularly for fraternal peoples. I see a mixed economy for Russia. It is hard to say what the balance between private and state ownership will be. State ownership accounts for 22 percent in the United States, for example, 33 percent in Germany, 40 percent in Austria, and 10 percent in Japan. The current figure in our country is 70 percent. But even that figure is wrong. State enterprises are no longer what they used to be. We have not thought through the flotation process. And the people who work there have not gone into this in depth. Grabbing a controlling block of shares for itself, an enterprise follows the old tradition of begging the government for additional subsidies. We have instituted many different "levels," whereas the fact is that everything that's nonstate is private. A mixed economy is a strength. Admittedly many of our industrialists have forgotten that the word industry is related to the concept of being industrious and doing something, not just sitting back and waiting for some kind of economic pluralism to appear. As for the political aspect, a multiparty system is developing in the country. But this does not mean things will be as they are now, when it is very easy to register a party with neither a program nor social support. By tradition Russia will evidently have a center party, a left-wing party, and -- on the right -- a liberal democratic party. But I don't think that the right-wing party will be identical to the one that is currently active. [Kucher] It would be interesting to hear your assessment of the State Duma's first four months of work.... [Rybkin] I would like to talk not some much about lawmaking as about the fact that we have managed in a short space of time to find mutual understanding and cooperation between the president and the State Duma, the State Duma and the government, the State Duma and the Federation Council, the State Duma and the judiciary. This is a very, very important factor. It can be said that a hundred days is not a very long period to draw such a conclusion. We live in times when one day counts as two or even three. Because the State Duma has been granted only 24 months of activity. Four months have already gone. And we are very aware of this. A detailed plan of law-drafting activity has been adopted. It identifies priority legislative acts which are extremely necessary to back up economic reform in Russia. I would say, however, that we are not talking so much of even backup for immediate needs as of the longer term. And this is very important. In addition, the plan for law-drafting activity incorporates the wishes of all those with legislative initiative rights. What parts of this plan are already being implemented? First and foremost laws forming the legal framework of the new state: civil and land codes and water and air laws, which establish and consolidate the new ownership relationships in Russia. New criminal, criminal-procedure, and administrative-law codes are currently being elaborated. I regard it as a big plus for the State Duma that when we were shaping the administrative structures (the chairman of the State Duma and his four deputies, committees, and commissions) we followed not the path of enshrining the advantages which the party majority achieved during the elections but the path of proportional representation for all the factions and deputies' groups. Which was a considerable surprise to Russia and the rest of the world. This meant the main objective was achieved -- what emerged was not a list-driven majority based on the number of supporters of a given faction or group, but a real, sensible majority. Without which fruitful activity by the State Duma would be inconceivable. It is virtually impossible to get all deputies without exception to agree in the course of Duma plenary sessions. We had to consider the experience of the United States, France, Germany, Austria, and a number of other countries where work on a draft law starts in committee and is conducted on a multiparty basis there. Thus our chamber of the Federal Assembly -- to the surprise of many opponents -- very quickly structured itself, determined its forms and methods of work, and started operating -- getting down, that is, to its main job of lawmaking. In my view the existence of a strong "common sense" bloc in the Duma was evidenced by the amnesty decree. I am deeply convinced that without the decision adopted by the Duma it would be impossible, first, to get Russia out of crisis; second, to avoid suspicion, hoping for the worst, and the possibility of settling scores; third, to amnesty -- literally forgive -- not only the "Lefortovo inmates" but every last one of the political participants, on both sides, in the 21 September-4 October events, thereby halting the wave of hatred and vengefulness; and fourth, to give thousands of Russians with their new-found freedom the chance to join in constructive work for the benefit of the fatherland. The "common-sense bloc" made its weighty voice heard when working on the agreement on achieving social accord in Russia. In my view, that document is an important step strengthening Russian statehood. It is an original Russian version of the Moncloa Pact, which saved Spain from a rerun of the Civil War after Franco died. [interview ends] The old Supreme Soviet's departure from the political scene also brought in its wake the disappearance of one its invariable attributes -- the "video" record documenting deputies at work. We can no longer see how Ivan Rybkin chairs sessions or what he talks to deputies about and how. In fact he rarely appears on television. Instead we are starting to get more frequent assessments of his activity in the newspapers, and the dissatisfied voice of the opposition is growing stronger. But why? It has become demonstrably clear to me, for example, that you can only call Ivan Rybkin a communist or a liberal by stretching the truth an awful long way. He is neither. Because he is a legislator in the post of chairman of the State Duma. His predecessors, Lukyanov and Khasbulatov, were nothing but Supreme Soviet manipulators. Men with different styles and from different schools, but still typical party tyrants. Rybkin is a professional administrator, a statesman. No way has he sold out to Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, as some of his dogmatic colleagues believe; it is just that, on becoming Duma chairman, he acquired a new status obliging him to leave his political views outside the Federal Assembly door. It cannot be ruled out that he has learned lessons from the recent past. But he was most likely pushed in this direction by his own experience as an engineer, political scientist, and diplomat. Deputies are difficult customers. They have their own views of life, but they have a good sense of what a statesman is. What awaits Ivan Rybkin in the future? In answering this question I am not even attempting a prediction, merely citing facts. He is an outsider among his own people but not at home among those on the other side. His own people evidently cannot forgive him his "treachery": Baburin has already suggested that Rybkin be moved from the speaker's chair to a deputy's seat. They are hardly likely to back off, and a threat to Rybkin from that quarter is always a possibility. The other side, the democrats, who initially had a sharply negative attitude to Ivan Petrovich, are gradually coming to recognize his worth and will evidently forge closer contacts with him unless they frighten themselves and, by proxy, their colleagues, and start squabbling among themselves again. I wish to reiterate that Ivan Petrovich Rybkin is doomed to be in the center. He is able and, it seems to be, ready to reshape an assembly with Supreme Soviet morals into a real Russian parliament. Possibly he will persist for a long time yet in linking the idea of creating a center to the spirit of the Agrarian Party. Unless life thrusts a new kind of middle-class person into the arena. But let's not try to guess. Time will tell.
