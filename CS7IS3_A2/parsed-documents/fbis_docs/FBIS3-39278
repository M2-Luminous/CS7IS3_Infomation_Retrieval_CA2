After the northern pact between [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [League Secretary] Bossi, the moderate alignment is closing the pincer of alliances in the south, too. The National Alliance, Forza Italia, and the Christian Democratic Center [CCD] will field joint candidates and symbols with a view to winning 195 seats in the lower house (out of a total 630), 295 of them in single-candidate constituencies. An agreement has also been reached for the Senate, where, as the law requires, only one symbol will be used -- Forza Italia at the top, the National Alliance at the bottom, and the CCD in the middle. The agreement was reached after a week of negotiations in Rome and Milan. In the evening the three forces' mediators would go to the via Veneto. It was in fact at the Majestic Hotel that they laid the foundations for a compromise that seemed to be within reach but that at the last moment threatened to collapse because of the former Christian Democrats' tantrums. But now in Lazio, and elsewhere too, anti-progressive voters will find their candidates associated with no less than five groups -- National Alliance, Forza Italia, CCD, Center Union, and Teso's Pact group, that is, the dissidents who broke away from [Pact for Italy leader] Segni. It all started on 10 and 11 February, as IL GIORNALE is in a position to reveal. The first meeting on via Veneto was attended by [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini and Altero Matteoli for the Alliance and Domenico Lo Jucco and Marcello Dell'Utri for Forza Italia. When they met and spoke together the two sides realized that an agreement was possible. Together, they set out the guidelines for a possible agreement -- the prime need to defeat the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], the reaffirmation of national unity, and the defense and reaffirmation of Western values. It is not difficult to see that these issues focus the chances of an agreement between those who believe in economic liberalism and those aiming at a form of Gaullism, naturally within the context of Western democracy. The most difficult thing immediately proved to be the technical aspect of the agreement: Where and how are the joint candidates to be fielded? This, particularly since the accord has to be extended to the former Christian Democrats of Casini, Mastella, and D'Onofrio; Costa's Liberals; and Teso's reformers, disillusioned with Segni. The obstacle was surmounted by using as an example the Lazio region, where political and electoral interests converge. The subsequent meetings were attended, in rotation, by "Diakron" expert Gianni Pilo, Forza Italia Chairman Berlusconi himself, and the CCD's three representatives, Casini, Mastella, and D'Onofrio, always inseparable. But two men went the whole distance -- Matteoli and Lo Jucco. The agreement was placed in jeopardy as late as Thursday, when the CCE [expansion unknown] protested because it considered its strength to have been "underestimated." It was late and the meeting was adjourned until the next day. Another intervention by Berlusconi resolved the conflict and opened the final, very long day -- from 1000 hours to 0200 the following morning. The MSI [Italian Social Movement] representatives shuttled to and from their National Directorate meeting in a state of shock, being in a clear minority. Everyone --from Casini to De Luca, from Biondi to D'Onofrio, and dozens of provincial and regional councilors -- came and went, either out of curiosity or seeking a place in the sun. There was agreement even on disagreements: Each force will compete on its own account in the constituencies of Benevento, Caserta, and Avellino. Thus the National Alliance can avoid being accused of having included the former De Mita supporter, Mastella, on its list. The latter will compete probably only under his own symbol and that of Forza Italia. It is said that during the negotiations several representatives of Segni's Pact and of Martinazzoli's Popular Party either put in an appearance or spoke, frightened by the emergence of a center-right alliance. According to MSI members, "the Pact's Michelini was one of the most frightened." On the whole it was not possible to divide the pie strictly according to relative numbers. But, significantly, the National Alliance has 55 percent of the seats, Forza Italia 35 percent, and the CCD and the minor allies the rest. The percentages change from region to region. The Alliance is strong in Puglia, but weak in Sardinia, to cite just one example. Among other things, over half the Alliance's candidates will be not MSI members but individuals entering politics for the first time. As though to "consecrate" the agreement, Berlusconi and Fini will run in Rome. The former will be a candidate on the proportional list in Naples and Palermo too, and the latter in Trieste and Bologna. What about Bossi? According to MSI sources, "When we registered our joint candidacy with Forza Italia at the Interior Ministry, the League's Patelli blanched and asked us: Does Umberto [Bossi] know about this?" Now the real election campaign is starting. Fini's spokesman, Francesco Storace, is wasting no time and has accused Segni of fielding Andreotti's son-in-law, Marco Ravaglioli, in Rome "in the name of rejuvenation."
