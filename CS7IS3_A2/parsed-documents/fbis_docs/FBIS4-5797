This was part of a set of proposals adopted at a Thursday evening session of the coalition's decision-making forum at the level of secretaries general. The package of proposals also included agreement to launch talks on policy matters toward establishment of a new government and an appeal for new party Sakigake [Harbinger], one of the seven ruling parties, to come back to the forum, the officials said. The secretaries general of the parties in the forum, which was boycotted by Sakigake, shared the perception that the eight-month alliance might be dissolved if the parties involved reject the accord, the officials said. Leaders of three of the seven parties -- the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and Sakigake -- gathered to consider the set of proposals Thursday evening but agreed to reject it. Sakigake, led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, convened a general meeting of all its 15 members in the House of Representatives on Thursday, who agreed unanimously to reject the coalition agreement on the launching of policy talks, Sakigake officials said. Sakigake has insisted that party leaders, and not the deputy chiefs, should work out a combination of political parties that would comprise the new coalition government and pick a candidate to succeed Hosokawa. In a three-way morning meeting, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake leader Takemura agreed that a breakthrough should be sought through a meeting of party heads, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference. The three parties earlier called for a forum of the seven coalition party leaders to select a candidate for new premier, but Shinseito [Japan New Party], Komeito and Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) rejected the appeal. Takemura said in TV interviews Wednesday night that he considered it important to establish a democratic system of decision-making within the coalition. Takemura also urged the coalition partners to coordinate their basic policies, decide on the framework of a new coalition government and select a candidate for the premiership. Earlier this week, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is head of Shinseito, was reported to have emerged as the most probable successor to Hosokawa. Hata is in Marrakech, Morocco, for a ministerial meeting that will conclude with the signing of a treaty on the Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Hosokawa, 56, suddenly announced his resignation last Friday after a string of financial scandals paralyzed Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 budget over Hosokawa's rejections of opposition demands to summon his financial aides to the Diet to have them testify on the case. He will remain in office until a replacement is picked.
