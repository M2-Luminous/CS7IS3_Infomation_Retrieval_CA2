In a statement to ANATOLIA, Denktas pointed out that by going to Vienna and discussing its problem and its views once again, the Turkish Cypriot side showed its good will once again, and also "said its last word, drew the last line." Denktas pointed out that the masks of the Greek Cypriots are falling. He added: "It has become obvious that the Greek Cypriots do not intend to reach an agreement with us, but that they are ready to hide behind the false title of the legitimate Cyprus government and to wage their ugly struggle for another 40 years in order to get the entire island." Denktas stressed that the Greek Cypriot efforts to join the European Union [EU] are of a nature that can totally eliminate any developments. Criticizing the stand of the EU, Denktas said: "The ball is not in our hands any more. Had the EU made a realistic diagnosis of the Cyprus problem, it would not have treated the Turkish Cypriots so unjustly for so many years, nor would it have given the green light to the Greek Cypriots to join the EU on the 30th year of the Cyprus problem. We are faced with a strange and unacceptable situation. If we agree, our reward will be that the Greek Cypriots will join the EU which will mean Cyprus will integrate with Greece in line with Greek Cypriot requests. If we refuse, our punishment will be the same. "It is our fundamental decision not to join the EU so long as Turkey is not a member. This is our right, granted to us by the 1960 agreements. We must defend this right. We will certainly not give the Greek Cypriots the opportunity to integrate with Greece by seeming to agree to this situation. We prefer to be punished and to maintain our rights outside this integration. We are being left with no other alternative." Asked to comment on the results of the Vienna talks, Denktas said: "The difficulty in Vienna arose because there was insistence on the second map we were offered, on the changes made in favor of the Greek Cypriots. They insist on the use of the Lefkosa Airport by the Greek Cypriot Airline and they insist on controlling the road leading to Maras [Varosha] and its surroundings. The Turkish Cypriot side has categorically rejected this and it will continue to do so."
