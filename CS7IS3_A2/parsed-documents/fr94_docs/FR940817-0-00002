FR940817-0-00002 FR940817-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 7 CFR Parts 300 and 319 [Docket No. 94&hyph;035&hyph;2] Importation of Fuji Variety Apples From Japan and the Republic of Korea AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: We are amending the Fruits and Vegetables regulations to allow the importation of Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea. As a condition of entry, the Fuji variety apples have to be cold treated and fumigated for certain injurious insects in Japan or the Republic of Korea under the supervision of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The Fuji variety apples also have to be inspected by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the national plant protection agency in Japan or the Republic of Korea prior to export. This action relieves restrictions on the importation into the United States of Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea without presenting a significant risk of introducing injurious insects into the United States. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Peter M. Grosser or Mr. Frank E. Cooper, Senior Operations Officers, Port Operations, Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, room 632, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;6799. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations in 7 CFR 319.56 through 319.56&hyph;8 (referred to below as the regulations) prohibit or restrict the importation into the United States of fruits and vegetables from certain parts of the world to prevent the introduction and dissemination of injurious insects that are new to or not widely distributed within and throughout the United States. On June 8, 1994, we published in the Federal Register (59 FR 29557&hyph;29559, Docket No. 94&hyph;035&hyph;1) a document in which we proposed to amend the regulations to allow Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea to be imported into the United States under certain conditions. The importation of Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea has been prohibited because of the risk that they could introduce injurious insects into the United States. We proposed to allow importation at the request of those countries' ministries of agriculture and after determining that the apples could be imported under certain conditions without significant pest risk. We solicited comments on the proposed rule for a 30-day period ending on July 8, 1994. We received two comments by that date. In one, a foreign ministry of agriculture supported the proposal. In the other, a State department of agriculture expressed concerns regarding the possible spread into the United States of three fungal diseases ( Diplocarpon mali, Monilinia mali, and Alternaria mali ) known to affect apples in Japan and the Pacific rim. Two of the diseases are exotic to the United States and the other is known to occur only in the Southeastern United States. The commenter recommends that we conduct pest risk assessments for the three diseases in order to determine if mitigation measures are necessary. Prior to proposing to allow Fuji variety apples to be imported from Japan and the Republic of Korea, we assessed the risk of exotic pests being introduced into the United States on the apples. Based on this assessment, we believe that the risk of the three fungal diseases spreading into the United States will be mitigated by numerous factors. For instance, these three fungal diseases are primarily leaf pathogens and seldom infect fruit, unless inoculum pressures are high. Furthermore, the routine cultural practices for Fuji variety apple production in Japan and the Republic of Korea, such as orchard sanitation and the bagging of fruit, effectively suppress outbreaks of these diseases. Finally, we believe that the required inspections of the fruit following treatment in Japan or the Republic of Korea will allow us to easily identify fruit infected with any of the three fungal diseases and prevent its entry into the United States. Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule without change. Effective Date This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register . Immediate implementation of this rule is necessary to provide relief to those persons who are adversely affected by restrictions we no longer find warranted. Making this rule effective immediately will allow interested producers and others in the marketing chain to benefit from this additional source of fruit. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule should be effective upon publication in the Federal Register .
