It concerned the fact that the government has to secure delivery for the countryside of these materials in volumes that correspond to the contract for state purchases of agricultural production. All possible channels for getting energy supplies will be used for this--both in Ukraine, and from the countries of the near and far abroad. The transportation and other participating departments have been assigned to secure uninterrupted reception and unloading of petroleum products for agricultural consumers. Operative control over the work of the transportation production line has been established. At the conference, it was announced that the necessary means for reducing costs of fuel and lubricants will be used. The prices for these will be set no higher than world prices. This must prevent an increase in cost of the supply of other production of the rural economy, coming from the new harvest. Volodymyr Demyanov, Vice-Prime Minister of Ukraine, took part in the conference.
