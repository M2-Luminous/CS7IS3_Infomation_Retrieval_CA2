They voiced expressions of enthusiasm and expectation for the congress, which begins tomorrow. The newly arrived travelers made the trip despite threats and insults from the most conservative sectors entrenched in this U.S. city [city not specified], who failed in their attempts to prevent the emigrants from attending the meeting. "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference, convened by the Cuban Foreign Ministry, seeks to begin the process of addressing the concerns and requests of Cubans who live overseas and to consolidate the ties that unite them to their country of origin. To this end, approximately 200 emigrants were invited to participate in the event. Reality seems to indicate that this number will be surpassed, as dozens of them arrived from other countries, ahead of the large group that was welcomed today and those who are expected tomorrow. The hotel lobby became the setting for the first meetings, conversations, and greetings. All this occurred amid the urgency of the many reporters and the lights of several foreign television cameras, as they all tried to capture the first statements of the newly arrived home comers. Those who accepted the invitation represent a broad spectrum of opinions and ideologies that characterize the Cuban emigrant community. In general, their impressions about the conference, scheduled to conclude Sunday, were marked by expressions of certainty about the positive results the meeting will have. Another point of concurrence, with which even those who do not accept the island's political process agree, is the condemnation of the U.S. trade embargo against the Caribbean nation and the call for changes in U.S. policy toward the island. Journalists Luis Ortega and Marcos Castellon; Luis Torres, a participant in the failed invasion at Playa Giron [Bay of Pigs] in 1961; Maritere Vishop of the Cuban Change organization; Andres Gomez, the director of the AREITO magazine; and Xiomara Almaguer-Levy, of the Jewish Solidarity [previous two words in English] group, arrived with the first contingent. Castellon told PRENSA LATINA how radio stations controlled by the most radical enemies of the Cuban Government broadcast false information about the situation on the island, just hours before they took off. Torres gave a similar report, adding that the leaders of the groups that oppose the conference made numerous threats against those who accepted the invitation from Havana. They united in spreading false rumors, which were swiftly denied by the truth. Both individuals concurred in stating that events such as those only demonstrate desperation, before the support for the idea of defending the rights of the emigrants to normalize their relations with the Cuban State has rallied. The conference begins tomorrow with the special participation of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, who will discuss official migration policy.
