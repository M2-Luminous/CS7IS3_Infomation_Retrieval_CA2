FR941227-2-00097 FR941227-2-00068 Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA No. 125F] Controlled Substances: Established Revised 1994 Aggregate Production Quota AGENCY: Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Justice. ACTION: Notice of a final revised aggregate production quota for 1994. SUMMARY: The interim notice (59 FR 54629, November 1, 1994) which established a revised 1994 aggregate production quota for morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance, as required under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 826), is adopted without change. EFFECTIVE DATE: This order is effective upon December 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Howard McClain, Jr., Chief, Drug & Chemical Evaluation Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, D.C. 20537, Telephone: (202) 307&hyph;7183. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 826) requires the Attorney General to establish aggregate production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II each year. This responsibility has been delegated to the Administrator of the DEA pursuant to Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Administrator, in turn, has redelegated this function to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994). On November 1, 1994, an interim notice establishing a revised 1994 aggregate production quota for morphine was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 54629). All interested persons were invited to comment on or object to this proposed aggregate production quota on or before December 1, 1994. No comments or objections were received. The interim notice is adopted without change. The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The establishment of annual aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law and by international treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large manufacturers, their impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator has determined that this action does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator, pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994), the Deputy Administrator hereby orders that the 1994 revised aggregate production quota for morphine, expressed in grams of anhydrous base, be established as follows: ‚ê£ 1Basic class 1Established revised 1994 quota (in grams) Morphine 7,800,000 Dated: December 20, 1994.
