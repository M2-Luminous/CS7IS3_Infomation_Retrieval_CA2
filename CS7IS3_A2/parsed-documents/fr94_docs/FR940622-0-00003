FR940622-0-00003 FR940622-0-00002 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ASW&hyph;33] Modification of Class E Airspace: Refugio, TX AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action modifies the Class E airspace at Refugio, TX. Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level, has been designated at the Mellon Ranch Airport, Refugio, TX. This airspace overlies Rooke Field, located approximately 6 nautical miles (NM) west of the Mellon Ranch Airport. Operators at Rooke Field have requested that Rooke Field be excluded from the Class E airspace at Mellon Ranch Airport. Since the airspace within a 1/2 mile radius of Rooke Field is not needed to conduct safe operations, this action is intended to exclude that airspace from the Mellon Ranch Airport, Refugio, TX, Class E airspace. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Alvin DeVane, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Southwest Region, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Fort Worth, TX 76193&hyph;0530, telephone 817&hyph;222&hyph;5595. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On March 9, 1994, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class E airspace at Refugio, TX, was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 11010). Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. One commenter expressed concern about excluding the airspace within a 2 NM radius of Rooke Field from the Class E airspace at Mellon Ranch Airport. However, in a subsequent comment, the same commenter stated that he had no objection to excluding the airspace within a 1/2 mile radius of Rooke Field from the Mellon Ranch Airport Class E airspace. After further analysis, the FAA concurs with the final position of the commenter and is reducing the amount of excluded airspace to that airspace within a 1/2 mile radius of Rooke Field. This change will allow the continuation of more controlled airspace for the Mellon Ranch Airport while relinquishing unneeded control over the operations at Rooke Field. Additionally, the NPRM incorrectly listed the airspace in the narrative description as ``E2''. The designation of E2 is used to designate Class E airspace from the surface. The correct designation for this Class E airspace is ``E5''. Except for these modifications, this amendment is adopted as proposed. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1994). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations modifies the Class E airspace located at Refugio, TX. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows:
