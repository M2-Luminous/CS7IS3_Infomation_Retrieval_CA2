About one-fourth of the companies expressed concern about hollowing out of the domestic industry. The survey was conducted in October by sending out questionnaires to 571 manufacturing companies which have production bases overseas. A total of 219 companies have responded to the questionnaires. The companies which said "we will expand overseas production in the next five years" ran to 90.1 percent of the respondents. Five years ago, 6.7 percent of the companies answered "our overseas production exceeds our domestic production," but the recent survey shows 8.5 percent of the companies as having produced more overseas than at home, and the survey predicts the percentage of these companies to grow to 20.3 percent in five years from now. Moreover, while only 41.7 percent said "we will raise exports in five years from now," 67.8 percent said "we will raise `imports back' from their production bases overseas." According to the survey, the companies which will "import back" from overseas will grow to 75.1 percent in five years from now. Regarding the danger of "industrial hollowing out" that can bring reduction in the domestic production and employment as well as lowering of capabiliites for technological development, 65.3 percent answered, "there is such a danger, but we think we can avoid that situation by taking appropriate actions," while 25.3 percent replied "we see that danger well enough" and 8.9 percent said "we do not foresee that danger at all."
