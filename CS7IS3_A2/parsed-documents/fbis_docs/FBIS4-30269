However, the government's total foreign debt of U.S. $93 billion has now reached a psychological level. In view of that, Indonesia has to manage its foreign loans carefully. The World Bank loan will be used as an additional fund to upgrade 1,620 kilometers of road and maintain 6,000 kilometers of roads in 27 districts. Mr Saleh admits that to date, Indonesia's foreign debt has almost reached a psychological level with the figure approaching U.S. $100 billion. "The people will be shocked to hear that our foreign debt has reached U.S. $100 billion. Likewise, if the inflation rate is above 10 percent, the people will be psychologically affected and will be worried", he said. Even if it is so, the most important thing is to have the ability and willingness to repay the foreign debt. Indonesia is committed to debt repayment and will not ask for its installments to be rescheduled. After signing an agreement for an agricultural loan with the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said there is no need to make a fuss over the rise in foreign debt. This is because repayments are not only being made by the government. Projects that utilize the loans will also have to contribute to the repayments, which is being done in installments. He explained that foreign loans have been handed over to the government because the World Bank only gives loans to a single borrower. Continuing, Afiff said that there are three types of loans being extended to the government. They are: soft loans payable under a long-term period under the coordination of the CGI [Consultative Group on Indonesia], export credit, and foreign commercial loans (PKLN). "What we require is the soft loans, considering that the conditions attached are not very strict," he added. On the other hand, Indonesia has to be very careful about its foreign commercial loans, especially now that the total has reached 40 percent out of the U.S. $93 billion debt. "We have to act cautiously and not add to the huge amount of PKLN loans. However, we still need such loans to ease the government's burden of financing development projects," he said. He said that the debt service ratio [three preceding words in English] (DSR) is the yardstick for measuring the safe limits of a nation's foreign debt. Currently, the state's DSR, including that of the private sector's has reached 30 percent. Minister Afiff expressed the hope that the foreign commercial loans team will do a good job in preventing the private sector from using the government's name to take advantage of the foreign commercial loan facilities. Responding to the World Bank's prediction that Indonesia's economic growth during the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan [Repelita VI] will reach at least eight percent annually if bureaucratic constraints on the economy are limited, Afiff said that would be rather difficult. He said based on the present conditions, it would be hard to achieve such high economic growth. "We will be satisfied if we achieve a 6.5 percent growth under the Repelita VI. This exceeds the 6.2 percent target," he said. According to the coordinating minister, to achieve such high economic growth, there must be efficiency in both the bureaucracy as well as state-owned firms. As Indonesia's growth is fragile, the economic machinery will overheat if growth is rapid, he said. He added that the conditions that contribute to an overheated economy are the oversupply of money, an increase in the current account deficit, as well as other related factors. He said the fragile economic growth is due to the decline in the export on non-oil and non-gas commodities, the fluctuation of oil prices, and also strong pressure from the foreign debt problem. "If the government can control the macroeconomy, rapid growth will not result in the overheating of the economy," he said.
