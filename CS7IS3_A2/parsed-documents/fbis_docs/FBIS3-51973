No vehicles were available at the station. Finol said the situation was due in part to a lack of police support from state authorities, because if the Mayoralty's buses had begun operating in the early morning hours, "we could have broken the transportation strike in the city." However, Finol confirmed that seven routes were covered by Consolidated Transportation buses, which began offering their services after noon, and by 50 vans belonging to various municipal institutes. Jose Sarmiento, president of the Single Transportation Workers' Union and representative of the Central-Western Transportation Association, who drove through the city in a brand-new private vehicle with a cellular phone to assess the strike, concluded that it was a success in 17 municipalities of Zulia State. Upon the conclusion of the transportation strike, Manuel Finol denounced the destruction of 11 vehicles on Aticos Avenue, south of the city. The vehicles belonged to the Maracaibo mayor's office. A driver identified as Alvin Pirela was injured in the incident, which prompted IMTCUMA to suspend its contingency plan for providing transportation to the population through special means. Barquisimeto -- The Lara Drivers' Union decided to suspend mass transit to Lara and other cities in the remaining eight autonomous municipalities, thus forcing residents to cope with the situation in order to get to their homes, schools, and places of employment. Driver's Union President Deputy Erik Zuleta said the measure was implemented in accordance with instructions issued by the Transportation Federation as an action against the Transportation and Communications Ministry for not resolving the proposals made by that organization in October 1993. The Transportation Federation made proposals regarding increases in urban and rural fares in the countryside and the effects of the half-fare paid by students, which drivers hope the government will cancel. The measure, which proved wholly successful in paralyzing the transportation sector in 11 states on 25 January, was also to protest the implementation of the value-added tax, which the Transportation Federation believes should be definitively eliminated. Hundreds of people formed long lines to wait hopelessly for buses. Meanwhile, the Mayoralty and the Council made desperate attempts to contact private vehicle owners to authorize them to cover the various routes. In addition, cooperation from the National Guard and Army was being demanded to get the buses out on the streets. The lack of transportation prevented workers and students from getting anywhere all day yesterday. Merida -- The driver's union strike virtually paralyzed the principal cities in the Andean region yesterday despite efforts by the authorities to help people reach their various workplaces. There were no reports of violent incidents.
