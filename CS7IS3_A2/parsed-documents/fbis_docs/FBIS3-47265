It is because the Korean people have creditably built the self-supporting national economy, says NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today. The article says: The line of building a self-supporting national economy is fully displaying its great material strength, great validity and tremendous vitality in our country. The invincible vitality of the Workers' Party of Korea's line of building a self-supporting national economy lies, above all, in that it helps maintain the political independence of the country in any circumstances. Economic self-sustenance is just the way of maintaining political independence, the life and soul of an independent sovereign state. The Korean people are always firmly maintaining the political independence of the country by building the self-supporting national economy under the wise guidance of the party and the leader. Thanks to the powerful self-supporting economy the Korean people are now creditably defending the dignity and sovereignty of the nation in confrontation with the U.S.-led imperialists even under the situation where socialism has suffered setbacks in some countries of the world. Its invincible vitality of our party's line also lies in that it makes it possible to steadily strengthen the material and technical foundations of the country and accelerate the socialist construction at a high speed. The self-supporting economy of Korea is on a very high level in the modernization of its technical equipment and in the building of departmental structures and turns out everything necessary for economic construction and people's living. The powerful self-supporting economy helps the party and the people of Korea to develop the economy at a high tempo on the basis of their own economic foundations in any circumstances. An industrial output increased by 50 percent and its average annual growth rate was 5.6 percent in the period of the third seven- year plan, which clearly shows how the self- supporting economy of Korea maintains a steady and high- speed of growth. The invincible vitality of the line finds its manifestation in that it makes it possible to steadily improve the material and cultural living standard of people and highly display the advantages of socialism. Having a powerful self-supporting economy the party and the state can provide the entire people with a happy life. With the progress of economic construction the people's real income steadily increases and the party and the state are pursuing better policies for the improvement of people's living. All this shows the great superiority of Korean-style socialism to capitalist society and a proud fruition of the self-supporting national economy.
