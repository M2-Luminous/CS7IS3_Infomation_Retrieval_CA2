Despite the deficit, the state's foreign currency reserves exceeded the figure of $5 billion. In its monthly reports on a balance of routine exchange, the NBP takes into account trade with foreign countries involving merchandise, services, the repayment of interest rates on foreign debts, and the transfer of hard currency. The NBP calculates the balance on the basis of reports on changes in the balance of bank accounts from several dozen banks that are middlemen in foreign trade transactions. After the first quarter of this year, the routine exchange deficit was $438 million. Trade Involving Merchandise "The trade deficit involving merchandise after the first quarter was lower by $100 million compared with a year ago, but it nevertheless surpassed the $268-million mark," Jozef Sobota, a director at the NBP's Analysis Department, told journalists yesterday [12 May]. Over the same period, export revenues came to $3.489 billion (14.8 percent less than during three months of last year), while import expenditures amounted to $3.757 billion (an increase of 10.2 percent). "Preliminary data indicate that, in April, the trade balance involving merchandise could possibly be positive," director Sobota stated. Services and Property Income In the first three months of this year, revenue from the sale of services (this mainly refers to transportation) exceeded expenditures borne of having the services brought in by $74 million, despite the fact that, in March, the deficit was $6 million (last year it was $2 million). Property income (including, among other things, dividends paid to Polish companies for participation in foreign companies) amounted to $17 million after the first quarter (a year ago it was $24 million). Interest Rates and Transfers The negative balance of interest rates being paid on foreign debts was $1.119 billion, which is a decrease of $351 million compared with a year ago. This happened despite the fact that we had to repay $634 million to the Paris Club in March. Official transfers amounted to $765 million, out of which $734 million was the 80 percent of interest rates that the Paris Club decided to write off for us. After the first quarter, the balance of private transfers was $93 million (last year it was $106 million). Dollar Reserves Despite the trade deficit, the NBP's official reserves were $5.080 billion after the first quarter. The reserves rose by as much as $704 million just since March, and that figure includes the $504 million of credit obtained from the IMF. In the view of the NBP, the so-called border-area exports, among others, had a very big impact on the level of the reserves: Tourists leave hard currency, thus contributing to a surplus in the purchases of hard currency at hard-currency exchange units; that surplus was $758 million.
