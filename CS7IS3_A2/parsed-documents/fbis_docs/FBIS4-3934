Executive Vice Governor Lu Ruihua presided over the meeting and delivered a concluding speech on six problems that badly need to be resolved in the reform and development process of the province. These six problems are: 1) It is necessary to face reality squarely and work in a down- to-earth manner to resolve the problem of a shortage of funds and the strong demand for funds. 2) It is necessary to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, and to keep the drastic rise of the general price level down. 3) It is necessary to stabilize grain output, strive to increase grain production, and stop the slump in grain output. 4) It is necessary to conscientiously carry out fiscal and tax reform and ensure a steady increase in financial revenue. 5) It is necessary to strictly exercise self-discipline and carry out the anticorruption struggle in a deep-going way. 6) It is necessary to properly support reforms with a view to expediting reform actively and appropriately.
