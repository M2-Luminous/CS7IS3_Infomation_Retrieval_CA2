FR940930-0-00132 FR940930-0-00028 This action promulgates the statutory requirements that have not been implemented to date. These include the emission standards for light-duty and heavy-duty clean-fuel vehicles, regulations for the conversion of conventional vehicles to clean-fuel fleet vehicles, manufacturer California clean-fuel vehicles sales requirements under the California Pilot Test Program, and a state opt-in program for the California Pilot Test Program. The part of the conversion provisions addressing the sales volume limit beyond which special small-volume manufacturer provisions will not apply, will not become effective sooner than 60 days after publication and then only if no adverse comment is received within 30 days of publication. If adverse comment is received within 30 days of publication, EPA will withdraw this part of the rule pending a full notice and comment process on this topic. DATES: This regulation is effective October 31, 1994, except that 40 CFR 88.306&hyph;94(b)(3) will become effective on November 29, 1994, unless notice is received on or before October 31, 1994, that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. EPA will publish a timely document in the Federal Register if the effective date is delayed for this reason. The effective date may also be delayed if the information collection requirements contained in this section have not been approved by the Office of Management and Budget. In that case, EPA will publish a timely document in the Federal Register delaying the effective date. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 31, 1994, except as specified elsewhere in this DATES section. Sections 40 CFR 88.104&hyph;94 (b) and (d), 88.201&hyph;94 through 88.206&hyph;94, and 88.306&hyph;94(b) (1), (2), and (4) are not effective until the Office of Management and Budget approves the information collection requirements contained in them. EPA will publish a document in the Federal Register once the information collection requirements are approved. ADDRESSES: Comments on 40 CFR 88.306&hyph;94(b)(3) may be submitted to Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;30 at the following address. Materials relevant to this proposal have been placed in Docket Nos. A&hyph;92&hyph;30 (Clean Fuel Fleet Program) and A&hyph;92&hyph;69 (California Pilot Test Program) by EPA. The docket is located at: Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, Room M&hyph;1500, Waterside Mall, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. These dockets may be inspected between 8:30 a.m. and noon, and between 1:30 and 3:30 p.m. on weekdays. EPA may charge a reasonable fee for copying docket materials. In addition, copies of the Summary and Analysis of Comments document, which develops certain issues relevant to this final rulemaking, may be obtained by request from the contact person below. This document contains the Agency's response to the public comments received in regard to the two Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). Electronic copies of the preamble, regulations, Regulatory Impact Analysis, Regulatory Support Document for heavy-duty clean-fuel vehicles, and the Summary and Analysis of Comments for this rulemaking are available on the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) Technology Transfer Network Bulletin Board System (TTNBBS). Instructions for accessing TTNBBS and downloading the above rulemaking files are described under SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION in section I.A. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Bryan Manning, U.S. EPA (SRPB&hyph;12), Regulatory Development and Support Division, 2565 Plymouth Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105. Telephone (313) 741&hyph;7832. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction A. Accessing Electronic Copies of Rulemaking Documents through the Technology Transfer Network Bulletin Board System (TTNBBS) TTNBBS can be accessed using a dial-in telephone line (919&hyph;541&hyph;5742) and a 1200, 2400, 9600, or 14,400 bps modem. The parity of the modem should be set to N or none, the data bits to 8, and the stop bits to 1. When first signing on to the bulletin board, the user will be required to answer some basic informational questions to register into the system. After registering, proceed through the following options from a series of menus: OMS; Rulemaking and Reporting; Alternative Fuels/Fleets; Clean Fuel Fleets or California Pilot Program. A list of ``.ZIP'' files will be displayed, all of which relate to the Clean Fuel Fleet or California Pilot Program rulemakings. The above five documents for the Emission Standards for Clean-Fuel Vehicles and Engines, Requirements for Clean-Fuel Vehicle Conversions, and California Pilot Test Program rulemaking will be listed in the form of ``.ZIP'' files and are identified by the following titles: ``CFF&hyph;PRE.ZIP'' (Preamble) ``CFF&hyph;REG.ZIP'' (Regulations) ``CFF&hyph;COM.ZIP'' (Summary and Analysis of Comments) ``CFF&hyph;RIA.ZIP'' (Regulatory Impact Analysis) ``CFF&hyph;RSD.ZIP'' (Regulatory Support Document for heavy-duty CFVs) To download these files, type the instructions below and transfer according to the appropriate software on your computer: <D > ownload, <P > rotocol, <E > xamine, <N > ew, <L > ist, <H > elp or <ENTER > to exit: D filename.ZIP The user needs to choose a file transfer protocol appropriate for the user's computer from the options listed on the terminal. The user's computer is then ready to receive the file by invoking the user's resident file transfer software. Programs and instructions for de-archiving compressed files can be found under <S > ystems Utilities from the top menu, under <A > rchivers/de-archivers. TTNBBS is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week except Monday morning from 8&hyph;12 EST, when the system is down for maintenance and backup. For help in accessing the system, call the systems operator at 919&hyph;541&hyph;5384 in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, during normal business hours EST. B. Background The Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;549) added part C to Title II of the CAA entitled, ``Clean Fuel Vehicles''. Under part C, states are to establish clean fuel fleet programs (collectively called the Clean Fuel Fleet (or CFF) program) in certain nonattainment areas and EPA is to establish a clean-fuel vehicle (CFV) pilot program in the State of California (the California Pilot Test program or Pilot program). The purpose of the Clean Fuel Fleet Program is to introduce light- and heavy-duty CFVs in specified ``covered areas'' with air quality problems. CAA section 246(a)(2) defines a ``covered area'' for purposes of the fleet program as an area having a 1980 population of 250,000 or more that is also (1) a serious, severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment area (based on 1987&hyph;1989 data), or (2) a carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment area with a CO design value at or above 16.0 parts per million (based on 1988&hyph;1989 data). Currently, there are 22 such areas in 19 states (Table 1).
