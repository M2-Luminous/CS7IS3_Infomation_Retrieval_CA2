"In Tbilisi, they do not want to reconcile themselves to the idea that Abkhazia will no longer be a part of Georgia. Abkhazia has won the war. And conditions are set by the winners not by the losers. It is only possible to talk about a treaty being signed by Abkhazia and Georgia as equal entities. Such a treaty will not in any way limit Abkhazia's sovereignty, since we are also planning to sign similar treaties with Russia and other neighboring countries. "As for the return of the refugees, I believe that the Georgian side is using this issue for speculative aims. We prevent no one from returning home. However, many of those who are on the run do not have a clear conscience. They know well that nobody will forgive them their collaboration with the occupation army. Those who met Georgian troops with open arms will not be able to live in Abkhazia", Vladislav Ardzinba said.
