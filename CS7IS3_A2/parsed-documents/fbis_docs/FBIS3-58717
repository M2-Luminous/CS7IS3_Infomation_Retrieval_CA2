In statements that amount to a rejection of the joint British and Irish declaration as it stands, Mr Adams made clear that without clarification there could be no end to the IRA campaign. "Up to now I do not have any political package with which to approach the IRA," he said. "It is clearly the responsibility of the two governments to produce such a package. "They cannot, however, argue that they have a basis for peace unless they can produce and explain what it is. I will not mislead the IRA neither will I mislead others about the IRA. "The London government demands an IRA surrender as a precondition to dialogue with Sinn Fein. Yet for over three years the government was involved in contact and dialogue without such preconditions." But his demand, repeated yesterday, for immediate and unconditional dialogue with the British and Irish governments on the declaration was rebuffed by the Prime Minister. John Major told the Commons: "The joint declaration is not in any way an invitation for renegotiation. The only acceptable response from Mr Adams is for him to call for an end to IRA violence. The only question that needs to be asked is of Mr Adams: will he stop the violence and enter the democratic process or not?" Reports in Dublin yesterday that Irish government officials are to meet senior Sinn Fein members were dismissed by the foreign affairs minister, Dick Spring. "There has been no change in government policy in relation to negotiations or direct contact with organization which are engaged in or support violence," he said. In a lengthy statement, Mr Adams set out for the first time the differences between the Downing Street document and the Hume/Adams agreement--the result of months of talks between himself and John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, which preceded the London-Dublin talks that resulted in the declaration. His claims will be a direct challenge to Mr Hume, who has backed both agreements and implied that the gap between them is marginal. Mr Adams said that his and Mr Hume's proposals, agreed in September, were known to both governments. They contained a basic set of principles: 1. The Irish people as a whole have the right to selfdetermination. 2. An internal settlement is not a solution. 3. Unionists cannot have a veto over British policy. 4. The consent and allegiance of Unionists is crucial to any agreement. 5. The British government must join the persuaders (to such an end).
