What is your comment on the negotiations breakthrough in Brussels? [Bildt] The talks have been very tough but a few minutes ago they were solved in that the European Union [EU] side announced that they had accepted the final position taken by Sweden as a result of the give and take which has been going on for quite some time. This is, of course, of extraordinarily great significance. This is the most important international agreement Sweden has concluded this century. It opens the way for full Swedish participation in European cooperation, widens the political horizon, and provides new economic opportunities. [passage omitted] In matters of substance, it is a very satisfactory result. It is my hope now we will also achieve an agreement between the EU and the other countries, perhaps above all Finland and Norway. I understand that as regards Finland, above all, it seems to be very close now. I also want to say that in my opinion there has been extraordinarily skillful negotiation work by the Swedish delegation led by Ulf Dinkelspiel in Brussels. There has also been very close consultation with the Social Democrat opposition. All this has contributed to success becoming possible. [passage omitted]
