Narasimha Rao, today expressed fear that in the liberalised post-GATT scenario, crucial technologies may be withheld from India to stunt her progress in various fields. This was in spite of the fact that the new GATT deal ensuring further opening up of national economies and erosion of national borders as a consequence of internationalisation of business, innovation and technological development, he said. "Yet, I foresee emergence of such trends and building of protectionist walls, said the Prime Minister while inaugurating the 81st session of the Indian Science Congress at Rajasthan University here. "However, I have full faith in the genius of Indian economists, scientists and technologists and the people to get around such problems." In his 40-minute speech, devoted mainly to stress the importance of technology in the post-GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) world environment, Mr Rao said though the new global agreement on ensuring free trade would affect many fields, its impact would be high only in some key areas. Identifying these areas as textiles and clothing, agriculture, trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPs) and services, including research and development services, he said such sectors required a strong base in indigenous R and D and science and technological capabilities. "With our vast reservoir of S and T personnel and comparatively lower manpower costs, it was possible to meet such challenges through appropriate R and D inputs. To make this happen, industry has to play a dominant part," Mr Rao stressed, referring to the successful examples of industrialised nations. However, private industry contributed less than 15 per cent of national R and D investments. This should change, said the Prime Minister, and industry should come forward to define the goal areas and set targets for the scientific community. While creation of wealth was important, it ws even more crucial to ensure its equitable distribution, said Mr Rao. He attributed increasing social tensions to the perpetuation inequity in economic development. Quoting a Sanskrit verse, he said prosperity for all should the purpose of our developmental programmes. Referring to the theme of this session, "Science in India: excellence and accountability," he said he shall not judge the performance of scientists in terms of conventional yardsticks that are used to assess productivity. It will be left to scientists' own methods of judgment. At the same time, there can be no judgment according to which concrete results were ignored. He quoted noted scientist Prof S. Chandrasekhar to stress this point: "One's place in science, as posterity will duly assign, depends largely on one's continuous exertion, at the edge of one's ability. Deftly side-stepping issues of declining government investment in the R and D sector and allocations for the educational institutions voiced by the scientific community, the Prime Minister said industry should step up investments in universities too and also ensure involvement of high quality manpower in programmes of their interest. Prof P.N. Srivastva, in his presidential speech, regretted "complete neglect of the education of science" and doubted India's competence to compete with other countries. He asked the science administrators and policy-makers to ponder as to how the expectations and aspirations of the people were going to be achieved if science education continued to be neglected. Quoting recommendations of senior scientists made to the government in 1990, Prof Srivastva regretted programmes to provide excellence in science education by establishing consortia of universities to work in collaboration with higher institutions of learning and utilising their superior human and material resources were not initiated. He suggested at least ten per cent of the science and technology budget should be embarked for training of manpower in universities and colleges. The scientific activities of the UGC [University Grants Commission] should be supported by various concerned agencies and the departments of science and technology. Proper improvement will have to be made in primary and secondary schools as well. "If we do not do this, we will only be strengthening the tip of the pyramid, whose bottom is weak. In such a situation, we will never be able to compete with the world in the 21st century," Prof Srivastva cautioned. The chief minister, Mr Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, asked the scientists to suggest ways to solve the problem of drinking water in Rajasthan. The governor, Mr Baliram Bhagat, also said Rajasthan was [a] rain deficient state having two major rivers--Chambal and Mahi. Scientists should help the policy makers in overcoming water shortage in the state. The Union minister of state for science and technology, Mr Bhuwanesh Chaturvedi, the Rajasthan minister for science and technology, Mr Lalit Kishore Chauturvedi, also spoke on the occasion. Prof U.R. Rao, director of the Bangalore-based ISRO, [Indian Space Research Organization], was elected president of the next session of the science congress. The Prime Minister today awarded nine Indian scientists for outstanding work in science and technology at the opening ceremony, adds PTI [Press Trust of India]. Dr A.S. Paintal of Delhi was presented the Asutosh Mookherjee Memorial Award for his work in medical research. Dr M.S. Narasimham, who is associated with the international centre for theoretical physics, Italy, was presented the C.V. Raman birth centenary award for his research in mathematics. The Srinivasa Ramanujan birth centenary award was bagged by Prof R.P. Bambah of Punjab University in mathematics. Other recipients include Dr Hari Narain, who bagged the M.N. Shah birth centenary award in earth science and Prof P.V. Sukhatme who got the P.C. Mahalanobis birth centenary award. While Prof A.K. Sharma received the J.C. Bose award for 1993-94 in citogenetics and cell biology, the P.C. Ray award for 1993-94 was given to Prof C.N.R. Rao in the field of solid state chemistry. Dr K.C. Binsal and Dr S.L. Kothari, jointly shared the Prof Hiran Lal Chakravarty award in the field of botany. After the awards presentation, the Union minister of state for science and technology, Mr B. Chaturvedi, released a book on Science in India, Excellence and Accountability. Mr Bhagat also released a book titled Indian Science, A Selected Bibliography.
