In connection with the crash of an F-15 fighter that was taking off from Kadena Air Base, the lieutenant governor visited the headquarters of U.S. Forces Japan [USFJ] in Yokota on the morning of 6 April. During a meeting with officers of the command, the lieutenant governor stated: "The U.S. military aircraft crashed near fields in which farming has been tacitly approved and near the Southeast Botanical Garden, which at the time had many tourists visiting it. Had one thing gone wrong, the crash could have resulted a terrible disaster involving Okinawans. We regret the occurrence of such a crash." She also asked that the command conduct a thorough investigation into the cause of the crash, that it report its results to the Okinawa Prefectural Government, and that it operate U.S. military bases safely and take measures to prevent a recurrence of the crash. After deciding that "it is effective to make a request directly to the USFJ command," the Okinawa Prefectural Government asked the lieutenant governor to visit the command. The lieutenant governor is now coordinating a visit to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to make the same request. Okinawa Prefectural Governor Ota, who has considered visiting Tokyo, will fly to Tokyo on 7 April. During his stay in Tokyo, he intends to ask the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Agency, the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, and other related government ministries and agencies to request the USFJ to investigate the cause of the crash. Lieutenant Governor Tomon told officers of the U.S. command: "A total of 111 crashes involving U.S. military aircraft have occurred since Okinawa reverted to Japan, and of the crashes, 12 involved F-15 fighters. In the past year, four crashes occurred, and F-18 Hornet fighters assigned to Kadena Air Base collided in the air over Mike-Mike [as published] waters in December." In this way, the lieutenant government cited a series of crashes which had taken place on Okinawa.
