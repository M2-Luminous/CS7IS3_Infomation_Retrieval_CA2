Ginzburg, chief of the Information Studies Department at the Oblast Administration, under the "Apropos One Appeal" rubric: "There Is No Need To Spread Panic"] [Text] Recently, certain political forces have made attempts to discredit the idea of the imperative adoption of the law "On the Status of Kaliningrad Oblast." At the same time, it turns out that this move will be responsible for our political distancing from Russia, will promote Germanization of the oblast, and so on. The emergence of such statements on the eve of debates on this draft law in the Federal Assembly is worrisome. Therefore, I consider it necessary to focus on the following: 1. The draft law "On the Status of Kaliningrad Oblast" was prepared by the Oblast Administration in cooperation with the Oblast Soviet of People's Deputies and promulgated for public consideration in the 6 August 1993 issue of KALININGRADSKAYA PRAVDA. Later, the draft law was brought in line with the Constitution of the Russian Federation adopted on 12 December 1993, the current law of the Russian Federation, No. 2117 decree of the Russian president of 7 December 1993 "On Kaliningrad Oblast," and proposals of ministries and departments concerning its first reading. 2. If it is adopted, the law will establish the status of our oblast as a territory of the Russian Federation separated by other territories from its proper area. The term status in this case implies the legal situation of Kaliningrad Oblast within Russia, defined by specific conditions for economic activities. Moreover, the status will conform with the oblast's geopolitical, social, and economic position, and will provide for additional guarantees in protecting the rights of Russian citizens on its territory. 3. All talk about the oblast's distancing from Russia are unfounded. Those who claim this, have either not read the draft law or are deliberately misleading Kaliningrad inhabitants. For example, the first article entitled "Kaliningrad Oblast Within the Russian Federation" clearly states that our oblast is an inseparable part of Russia, that its frontiers coincide with the state border of the Russian Federation, and that its territory has a particular place in ensuring Russia's security system. Furthermore, the last version of the draft law notes that it bans the activities of any political parties, organizations, and individuals in Kaliningrad Oblast, which run counter to international legal norms that establish Russia's authority over this territory as final. 4. Speculation about the law facilitating the purchase of land by foreigners, which would allegedly promote Germanization of the oblast, are groundless. In fact, Article 36 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation reads that land in Russia (that is, also in Kaliningrad Oblast) can be owned only by citizens of the Russian Federation and not by any foreign residents. In other words, this is a citizen's rather than a human right. The draft law on the status of Kaliningrad Oblast reflects all the key peculiarities of our unique region. The sooner this law is adopted, the sooner the oblast will gain political and economic guarantees. I think that in such a situation some esteemed deputies should direct their efforts to the consistent protection of the interests of our oblast rather than to spreading panic.
