Thus [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi tried to minimize the story of the letter he had received from the head of state inviting him to guarantee that all the ministers in his cabinet would comply with institutional rules. In an interview with GR [Radio News] Director Livio Zanetti, the prime minister also denied that Scalfaro had named any of the ministers in particular. Scalfaro's concern, according to Berlusconi, stemmed from "the possible inclusion in the ministers' list of personalities who may have given rise to reservations being expressed by a certain section of the press and, particularly, by a certain section of the international press." Berlusconi further explained: "I believe that the ministers' list has provided the president with the assurances that he requested from me." The prime minister then denied the existence of a "[Judge] Di Pietro case," following the news of contacts having taken place -- while the government was in the process of being formed -- between himself and the most famous Clean Hands public prosecutor. "I kept on reading in the press," Berlusconi said, "about offers that were actually never made, about negotiations and talks that had never taken place. I therefore decided to check the situation personally with Di Pietro." "We had a friendly, straightforward, honest, pleasant meeting, and that was it. In my view," he added, "Di Pietro did well to decide to continue the work that he had started and that he is currently carrying out." As for the government's next moves in the economic field, Berlusconi said that he did not have a "magic wand," but that he would be aiming, in particular, to revive the public works sector and to reform the tax system. Concerning foreign policy, he stressed that his government would not change European policy in any respect: "We are staunch Europeanists," he asserted. Finally, having been asked what he intended to do with RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], he replied: "I will watch it and listen to it."
