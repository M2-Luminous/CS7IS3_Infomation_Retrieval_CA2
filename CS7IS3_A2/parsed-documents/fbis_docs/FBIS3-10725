[Nule] Good morning, Dario. The situation is as follows: We are continuing the same process that we explained a few weeks ago following our visit to the island. The negotiations continue; we expect that there is a possibility of selling to the island between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil daily beginning in July, [as heard] but this is subject to negotiations, analyses, and evaluations of the terms of these negotiations; that is, a review of purely trade terms, which is a guarantee that Ecopetrol [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] usually requests. The process continues. No contract has been signed yet. We have clarified this already, but the negotiations continue, and we may or may not reach an agreement. [Arizmendi] Mr. Minister, won't the boycott that Miami Cubans announced make the Colombian Government reverse itself on the possibility of exporting oil and other oil products? [Nule] No, we have not thought about it. Personally, I think this would be very serious, because it would mean subjecting any commercial activity [peticion], in this case a commercial activity of the country, to pressure by a very respectable group. [sentence as heard] I believe, however, that this is not the way to proceed. Among other reasons, this type of negotiation with the island has also been held with many other countries that maintain embassies in and business with the United States, and there have been no reprisals. I do not see why there would be reprisals against Colombia, nor do I see why Colombia would have to change its trade policies due to, I repeat, pressure from a group, regardless of how respectable it might be. [Arizmendi] The front page of EL TIEMPO newspaper today, Mr. Minister, carries a report stating that the Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board was in Havana at an intercontinental summit that was also reportedly attended by a diplomat, a bishop, other prominent personalities of the continent, and of course, from Colombia, persons who have been part of subversion. Would this fact, if proven, stop the negotiation process with Cuba? [Nule] I do not know, Dario. We at the Mines and Energy Ministry deal with nonpolitical issues, much less with foreign policy. We know that we have diplomatic ties with Cuba, and this allows our trade relationship and do not understand why it cannot be. If there is any inconvenience, we will be appropriately notified in due time, but I do not think it is.... [pauses] besides, I am neither aware of this nor is this among my responsibilities. [Arizmendi] According to the estimates of the ministry you head, Energy and Mines Minister Guido Nule Amin, how much fuel would Colombia sell to Cuba during the second half of the year should the negotiations materialize? [Nule] Should negotiations materialize, we would be talking about some 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of oil per day. We need to multiply this by a price that could be between $14 and $15 per day [figures as heard]; that is, we could be talking about some $5 million per month.
