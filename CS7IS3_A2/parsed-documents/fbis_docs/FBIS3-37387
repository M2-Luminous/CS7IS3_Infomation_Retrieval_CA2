Grachev but you to be Russian defense minister 4 October 1993. Would you have carried out the order to storm the House of the Soviets? [Samsonov] As an official I would not like to answer your question. As a Russian officer I would say no. My service has not taken place in offices and on parquet floors. (You know how some officers and generals advance through the central apparatus.) I spent 10 years serving in the Transcaucasus. I remember how it all started in Sumgait in 1988 before my very eyes. I was involved in the events in Ganja. I saw our boys at the controls of the tanks confronted with a dilemma: Should they carry out orders and continue the convoy's advance? But that meant crushing women and children. (The People's Front "got busy" dragging kids out of baby buggies and putting them on the road). The order came that they must reach their objective right on schedule. Could our Russian lads, raised in school on Soviet traditions, have crushed women and children? Of course not. No one calling himself a man could have tried to force them or have ordered them to do that. [Lenskiy] Could you please tell us the reason for the CIS Joint Armed Forces High Command being transformed into the Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation? Does this move not indicate that the CIS heads of state and defense ministers are losing interest in common security problems? [Samsonov] The reason for the change is that we regrettably failed to reach a common view regarding the need to preserve the unified defense area along with the unified early-warning, air defense, and space defense systems within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States, nor did we succeed in creating Joint Armed Forces and a unified command and control system for the strategic nuclear forces. Although there was, and still is, an obvious need to do so. Interest in problems of military security within the CIS has certainly not faded lately, indeed it has considerably increased. Late last year the number of CIS states party to the Treaty on Collective Security rose from six to nine. Now only three of the 12 CIS states -- Moldova, Ukraine, and Turkmenistan -- remain outside the treaty. They too have lately been showing great interest in military cooperation issues. [Lenskiy] Did you try to stop the disintegration? [Samsonov] Of course. When it was decided to switch to national armed forces we wanted to preserve at least the most important systems in our common interests. Let me cite a simple example. There was a common air defense system in the Central Asia region... At one time we suggested setting up the "Yug" [South] air defense system under joint command, covering the interests of Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. The point is that the 12th Army was deployed on the territory of several republics! You had a command post was in one republic, a corps in another, a division in a third, and a regiment in a fourth. Some system that was! We suggested that it should not be broken up, because borders cannot be drawn in the air. But to no avail: It was destroyed. Now we are about to recreate it. But that is a very costly business. And it will take a very long time. [Lenskiy] What impact have these actions had on the combat readiness of the new independent states' armies? Can they rebuff outside aggression where necessary? [Samsonov] That is something for these states' military-political leaderships to worry about, since it was they who set up the national armed forces. They are answerable to the people. But the fact that the systems that I mentioned have been destroyed means that we cannot talks seriously about the Commonwealth as a whole or its individual members' being totally secure. The point is that readiness to rebuff such aggression, particularly by military means, is forged in peacetime. Common operational planning of the use of coalition armed forces is carried out along with advance training and coordination of national armies for conducting joint combat operations. Command and control systems are set up as well as the main types of support and a definite infrastructure. [Lenskiy] But, to all intents and purposes, that kind of training is not being carried out today? [Samsonov] No, it is not. The experience of setting up Collective Peacekeeping Forces [CPF] in Tajikistan is very indicative. It took over three months to get together just one battalion apiece from Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. And Kazakhstan's battalion has still not turned up! I do not know when we will set up groupings in case of major aggression. That should be pondered in peacetime. [Lenskiy] What is hampering you: ambition, general confusion, objective difficulties? [Samsonov] All of those. The current situation in the defense sphere is closely connected with economic and social decline. There can be no integration on defense questions against a backdrop of political and economic disintegration. [Lenskiy] How are the republics fulfilling their commitments regarding funding your activity? [Samsonov] To be frank, not a single document is being properly implemented. As for Russia's contribution, that is mainly what we are living off. We are even in its debt, since Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Belarus are not fully meeting their commitments. They are not, of course, refusing to pay. But they are citing difficulties with the mechanism for mutual settlements. [Lenskiy] What conclusions can be drawn from the experience of the CPF in Tajikistan? [Samsonov] I take a positive view of these forces' activity. Thanks to the CPF, conditions have been created for peace talks and dialogue with the opposition, and their presence acted as a stabilizing factor at the last parliament session in Tajikistan, where passions hotted up at one moment. The Tajik leadership should take advantage of the favorable conditions to conduct dialogue with the opposition. There is not that much time. According to our data, the Tajik armed opposition is preparing for decisive action in the spring. [Lenskiy] Last July we were all shocked at the number of casualties sustained by the 12th Russian Border Outpost in stopping infiltration of the Tajik-Afghan border. Government and parliamentary commissions traveled to the scene of the incident, nonetheless the public never learned who was responsible -- the Defense Ministry, the Ministry of Security, or the border troops. Or perhaps it was just a tragic coincidence? [Samsonov] I believe that the border troops leadership bears the bulk of the responsibility. Nonetheless it cannot be held entirely responsible. The border troops are greatly in need of hardware and arms, but most particularly of personnel. Many outposts, including the 12th Border Outpost, are by no means fully manned. I flew out there with a group of officers, we conducted an investigation and redeployed Defense Ministry battalions, but that is patently inadequate.... The attack on the 12th Outpost did not come as a surprise. Audacious, impudent attacks have been going on a long time. The proper response has not been forthcoming, the situation was not analyzed carefully, and steps were not taken. And any aggression has only expanded as it has not been rebuffed. That is the unfortunate lesson. [Lenskiy] Are we insured against another tragedy? [Samsonov] I am not certain right now. Attempts have been made, and outposts are bombarded with rocket shells and heavy machineguns several times a week. Enemy weapon positions are immediately suppressed by helicopter attack, artillery and mortar fire. However, our combat readiness and reactions continue to be tested and probed. [Lenskiy] Following the breakup of the USSR the length of Russia's borders to be guarded (compared with the Union) dropped by a factor of 1.5. Why have the liberated hardware and arms not been operationally redeployed to the most dangerous part of the border, Tajikistan? [Samsonov] Nothing has been liberated! It has all been "privatized" by the new independent states. In a not entirely civilized manner, to put it mildly. The principle employed was that everything on my republic's territory is "mine"! There was no discussion as to whether it was needed or not, whether there was an adequate supply or a surplus over requirements, and it was impossible to reach agreement. In the Transcaucasus, for instance, special technical equipment from the security strips was barbarically destroyed. The argument was as follows: Why have the border guards got so much land, when our sheep have nowhere to graze? [Lenskiy] The commander of the border troops claims that 13,000 km of border are open today. [Samsonov] We have not even determined where to have a border, with whom, and what kind of border it should be. For instance, Azerbaijan effectively has no border with Iran and no one knows who is to guard it. Russia too has no border with Azerbaijan. In the proper meaning of the word. [Lenskiy] What new opportunities do you see for settling local conflicts within the CIS (Karabakh, Abkhazia) in connection with Azerbaijan and Georgia's joining the Commonwealth? [Samsonov] I think that the admission of Azerbaijan and Georgia to the collective security system will create favorable opportunities for these conflicts to be resolved by political means. Real conditions have emerged for groups of military observers and CPF troops to be used to localize and put a stop to conflict. Everything, or virtually everything, now depends on the good will of the political leadership in these states. We would remind you that peacekeeping forces have played their part in the Dniester Region and South Ossetia. [Lenskiy] But the conflicting sides must mutually agree in order for this to occur. At the moment the only signs of that are in Abkhazia. Karabakh is another matter. Azerbaijan has, on the contrary, been observed to step up hostilities since the Ashgabat meeting. [Samsonov] You were absolutely right to say that there must first be mutual agreement for a cease-fire. If that is secured, military observers can "maintain" the situation, prevent it from breaking away.... A political solution has to be found. At one time I thought that leaders had already had enough of war -- both peoples have suffered a great deal. But it turns out that I was mistaken. Someone thinks that the fighting must go on. [Lenskiy] There are reports that foreign mercenaries are involved on both sides in the Karabakh war. There are increasingly frequent references to Afghan mojahedin. [Samsonov] There is a lot of talk like that. I was told about this during an emergency meeting with the states' representatives -- the deputy chiefs of staff. I said: Show me just one prisoner of war on television who is a citizen of Afghanistan, Iran, or Pakistan. They are unable to do so! There is talk, but no facts. [Lenskiy] On the other hand we have clearly seen Russian boys who have been fighting on either the Armenian or the Azerbaijani side and have then been captured. How do you regard that? [Samsonov] There are only a handful of these mercenaries. However, that is the cost of the processes that occur during the breakup of a great empire. Who thought about the guys who were left on the territory of a particular republic regardless of what they wanted? They had one homeland -- the Soviet Union -- and it sent them to serve in Armenia or Azerbaijan. Overnight (there was no period of transition) these boys found themselves without a place to serve, without an apartment, without any certainty. No one was asked who wanted to swear another oath and who did not. No, they just had people shouting at them: All you Ukrainians and Belarusians, go back home to your own country. They did so. But there are no jobs. For instance, 100 engineers are needed, but 200 turn up. "But we don't need 200." Where are they to go? They will no longer be welcomed at their former post in Russia -- they have been crossed off the unit's rolls. They are told: Take discharge. These people have ended up wanted by no one. We now have servicemen in Central Asia, for instance, who do not know to whom they belong. They have no status. They are not being given dual citizenship. Some would like to continue their service, but they are told: Take local citizenship. "I don't want to." "No? Get lost." Many problems would be settled if the parties to the Treaty on Collective Security signed an agreement on dual citizenship. [Lenskiy] Won't the Baltic states' involvement in the NATO "Partnership for Peace" military program threaten the security of the Commonwealth? [Samsonov] That is not an easy question. There must be an in-depth investigation into the real idea behind this program. At first glance the NATO plan, as it is being presented to the Western public, does not aim to pose additional dangers to anyone. However, the fact that this document emerged shortly after the North Atlantic alliance's official decision not to expand the bloc by admitting new members does cause some concern. This decision was adopted under pressure from the world and European public, as well as owing to Russia's tough stance. There is doubt as to whether the new program constitutes a veiled means of expanding NATO, establishing its strategic influence in East Europe, and bringing the bloc's front lines right up to Russia's western borders. If that is the case, this move could upset the balance of forces in Europe as enshrined in the CFE Treaty -- which is unacceptable to us. [Lenskiy] However, NATO does not cease to assure us of its peaceableness.... [Samsonov] As if we had been friends for ever and ever. But then the commander in chief of the NATO southern theater travels to Greece and Turkey. To what end, do you think? [Lenskiy] Probably to reduce their military presence. [Samsonov] If only! He went to strengthen NATO's southern flank. That is the point. But you were saying about the Baltic.... [Lenskiy] Do you believe in the future of a single security system in Europe with NATO and Russia under the same "umbrella"? [Samsonov] Not right now. Only in the very long term. Judging by the statements and the arguments it all looks OK in theory. But not in practice. Our national interests are confined to Russia's borders or, in the last resort, to the territories of the CIS republics. But U.S. national interests are increasingly focusing on Europe, East Europe even, and Asia. Recent statements indicate that U.S. interests must be present worldwide! Once again something does not somehow gel here.... [Lenskiy] Will you be making additional efforts to securer UN or CSCE status for the CIS states' peacekeeping forces? Is that necessary? [Samsonov] Tackling these issues is not part of the Staff's functions. The Collective Security Council or the Council of Commonwealth Heads of State will probably tackle them. As for whether it is necessary, I think it is. After all, a UN mandate does not only relieve a state of possible accusations of expansionist policy but also considerably reduces the burden of its material expenditure on a peacekeeping operation, lends it an international character, and gives its mission UN or CSCE prestige. [Lenskiy] How do you regard the prospect of Russian military bases being set up on the territory of certain other CIS countries (Baykonur, for instance)? [Samsonov] If the Commonwealth countries reach a mutual agreement with Russia on the siting of such military bases, I take a positive view of this. By and large they are elements in the Commonwealth's common defense area. This step does nothing but strengthen CIS stability and security. [Lenskiy] From time to time reports appear regarding your Staff's difficult -- to put it mildly -- relations with the Russian Federation Defense Ministry. What can you say about that? [Samsonov] You know, there can never be easy relationships during a period of reorganization, when major reforms are being implemented and new approaches and views of those issues are being formulated. Time will tell who is right and who is less so. It is a fact that it has become easier lately to work, cooperate, and find mutually acceptable compromise solutions.
