He went to Guangzhou from Hunan and joined the expanding ranks of "vagabond [liu lang 3177 3186] reporters." He is working as a reporter for a newspaper that can be distributed only in the province. During the day, he is busy going to streets and lanes, and in and out of government institutions, to earn a floating salary several times higher than that in the hinterland. At night, he sleeps in an office on two desks joined together. In comparison with regular reporters in Guangzhou, he has no residency or house, does not enjoy free medical service or other benefits, and is apt to lose his job at any time. For all these reasons, "vagabond reporters" have no fear in competing with regular reporters. They grab "real news" whenever and wherever they can, showing their talents in press circles. Guangdong newspapers now ranked third in the country. Guangdong has more than 120 kinds of newspapers distributed throughout the country and some 280 kinds of "restricted publications" distributed only in the province. New newspapers keeping appearing at sidewalk newsstands. As there are many "restricted publications," there are many restrictions on distribution and advertisements, and as funds also are limited, these publishing houses are willing to recruit "vagabond reporters" who do not have many burdens. As a matter of fact, openly distributed newspapers also like to employ "vagabond reporters" to make up the shortage of local reporters. After the influential XIANDAIREN BAO [Modern People Journal] switched to a daily newspaper, it said that it would select reporters mostly from among the "vagabond reporters." Generally speaking, the salaries of "vagabond reporters" are much higher than those of regular reporters. The "vagabond reporters" employed by XIANDAIREN BAO generally earn more than 2,000 yuan a month, and some may earn 3,000 to 4,000 yuan a month. Regular reporters envy them very much. Many "vagabond reporters" live an army-like life. DONGFANG YEBAO [Oriental Evening News] provides its "vagabond reporters" with a dormitory, bicycles, pagers, and food. However, "vagabond reporters" are sometimes worried about their future and feel they are living under others' roofs. Initial statistics show that there are now about 100 "vagabond reporters" in Guangzhou. Yang Yikai, director of the Publication Management Section of the Guangdong Provincial News and Publication Bureau, told this reporter that "their capacity should not be underestimated." The presence of a large number of "vagabond reporters" supports the emergence of new newspapers. Director Yang pointed out: At a time when there is a large variety of readers, advertisements, and contingents, the appearance of "vagabond reporters" and the emergence new newspapers will bring about prosperity in the press industry and the competition will force old newspapers to improve their quality.
