Rudik, chief of the Civilian Defense Workers Directorate, interviewed by Colonel Anatoliy Yurkin (res): "Urgent Topic: Civilian Personnel of Russian Federation Armed Forces--Wages and Social Protection"] [Text] The Russian Federation Defense Minister's Order No. 130, "On Introducing New Wage Terms for Civilian Personnel of Troop Units, Institutions, Military Educational Institutions, and Budget-Financed Enterprises and Organizations of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense on the Basis of a Uniform Wage Scale [UWS]," significantly improves social protection for civilian personnel of the Russian Armed Forces and is becoming a tangible incentive. Major-General V. Rudik, chief of the Civilian Personnel Labor and Wages Directorate of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, tells about the procedure for introducing the new wage terms based on the Uniform Wage Scale (UWS) and the tasks involved in accomplishing this important work. [Yurkin] The introduction of new wage terms affects the vital interests of employees of the entire national-economic budget sphere and the civilian personnel of the Russian Armed Forces. However, before talking about the innovations, Viktor Antonovich, it seems that we should first discuss, if only briefly, the background of this issue. Many ask why the introduction of the UWS was necessary and whether it is in keeping with the Russian Federation Labor Law Code. [Rudik] Let's start from the beginning: The socioeconomic situation that obtained at the end of last year caused a sharp change in traditional wage policy. A significant wage gap arose between the production and nonproduction spheres. After prices were liberalized, members of certain branches (miners, air-traffic controllers) used various methods to obtain appreciable advantages, causing even greater tension in society. The question of social justice and compliance with the requirements of Article Two of the Russian Federation Labor Law Code arose with special urgency. Let me remind you what that article says: "Every worker has the right to equal compensation for equal work, without any discrimination and not below the legally prescribed minimum amount." This in turn led to Russian Federation government Decree No. 785, whose purpose is to regulate wage rates for various branches and to establish substantiated wage ratios for workers depending on complexity and skill levels and based on the use of the UWS. Just what is the UWS? It is a uniform scale of wage rates and grade-based wages for workers and office employees. It encompasses all budget sphere workers and provides for wage differentiation among 18 grades. The wage scale for workers has eight grades. In contrast to analogous workers in the national economy, the Russian Federation government decree sets increases in wage rates of up to 50 percent for categories of civilian personnel and for various types of work, as well as a schedule of additional payments, compensation payments, and wage and salary raises linked to the particular features of military units' activities. [Yurkin] Who has been given advantages in terms of the amounts of wage and salary increases? Won't workers' rights be infringed upon? [Rudik] No, they will not. The wage rates (including the increases of up to 50 percent) have been increased first and foremost for workers, who had no grounds to complain about their pay earlier. This applies to toolmakers, a wide range of machine tool operators, and tool-setters who work with unique equipment. This category also includes loggers, divers, topographers and geodesists, district power grid specialists, and several others. The maximum wage increase of 50 percent is being introduced for all UWS grade one workers, as well as for certain categories of physicians and middle- and junior-level medical personnel. Wage rates are being increased by 40 percent for all workers on whom UWS grade two is conferred, such as drivers, road and railroad repairmen, utility repairmen, and workers who specialize in construction repairs. I could continue this list, but the point of the changes lies in that the differentiated wage increases were also prompted by an adverse personnel situation. For example, certain garrisons in the Fear East and the Transbaykal region in effect have no workers to operate their utility systems. For this reason, the introduction of the UWS provides wage increases for workers that are more substantial, and in a number of cases higher, than those for degree-holding specialists, such as engineers, economists, and even directors of structural divisions. [Yurkin] Many readers might immediately ask about the procedure that will be used to confer grades on workers. Who will do this? [Rudik] That is a rather complex question, but I will give an intelligible answer to it. First of all, enterprise and organization workers whose pay was based on hourly wage rates will be subject to the previous procedure for conferring grades one through eight, which conform to the UWS wage categories. The Russian defense minister's order directs that skill categories are to be conferred on workers who did not have them previously. For example, guards, office cleaning women, film projectionists, and park landscapers. This also applies to boiler operators and dry cleaning and laundry workers. Military units also have other worker occupations for which a specific wage category is not conferred but rather set by the commanding officer. He takes into account the difficulty, service norms, and other parameters of the job in question. Grades nine and 10 can be set for highly skilled workers employed in important and responsible jobs. I should point out that this norm should not be viewed as a chance to establish wage rates for worker occupations in grades nine and 10, but only as a chance to pay them wages based on the rates set for these grades. These wages need not necessarily be of a permanent character. The introduction of the UWS does not require that workers be assigned new wage categories, as a rule. They are simply given the new wage in keeping with the grade already conferred on them or set for them by the commanding officer, and an entry is made to this effect in their labor record booklets. Military unit commanders are also permitted to introduce labor organization and wage methods and systems (temporary, piece-rate, brigade, etc.) when concluding collective contracts within the scope of the confirmed wage fund. [Yurkin] Let's hope, Viktor Antonovich, that the gist of your explanations will be clear to workers reading this. The important thing is that they are going to start earning more money by exhibiting diligence and discipline. Will the social rights of directors and specialists and of our intelligentsia be safeguarded just as thoroughly? [Rudik] I see no reason for concern, since wage procedures and terms for that category of civilian personnel of the Russian Armed Forces have been set for all budget branches, regardless of place of work. For example, economists will have wage scales in the range of grades six through 11, chief specialists, 13 through 17, and office managers, four and five. In view of the heightened social responsibility and the creative character of the work of employees in public education, higher education, public health, and science, their wage rates have been set at one to four grades higher than those for general specialists. For example, while engineers in various specialties have wage rates at grades six through 11, teachers and doctors will have wage rates at grades seven through 14 and grades eight through 15, respectively. For many specialist positions, skill requirements entail dual grades within the framework of the corresponding category. For example, a category-two production engineer comes under grades nine and 10. This is due to rather significant differences in the level of difficulty, diversity and importance of their official duties. Taking this approach to setting grades for military unit commanders (based on the decisions of certification commissions) makes it possible to effectively resolve wage rate issues in specific circumstances. The wage rates for top officials and directors of institutions, organizations, and enterprises fall within grades nine through 18, as a rule. They are differentiated on the basis of complexity of administrative functions and their social responsibility. Salary rates for deputy directors and chief accountants are set 10 to 20 percent, and for assistant directors 30 to 40 percent, below the salary of the corresponding director. The amount by which the salary is reduced is set at any percentage from the minimum to the maximum amount established for the deputy, assistant director, or chief accountant. As in the case of specialists, wages for this category will be based on the findings of special certification procedures. [Yurkin] What determines wage amounts for enterprise, institution, and organization directors? [Rudik] The group of the enterprise, institution, or organization. Military units and formations, for example, are divided into four groups. This division is a forced one. You will agree that managing a corps and managing a division are by no means one and the same thing. It is hardly fair if a 1,500-bed hospital pays the same wage as a hospital with just 200 beds. The criteria for assigning plants, arsenals, bases, warehouses, repair shops, print shops, and a number of other enterprises and organizations to the various groups are performance indices in physical terms and the established number of workers. When work-force tables are registered and audits and checks are performed, a check is made to see that the director has been assigned to the correct wage group. [Yurkin] Will wage terms and, in particular, above-wage amounts change with the introduction of the UWS? [Rudik] In contrast to the national economy, the introduction of the UWS for civilian employees of the Russian Armed Forces entails significant changes in this form of wages. In shifting to the new wage terms based on the UWS, military unit commanders are authorized, when concluding collective contracts and within the scope of their approved wage funds, to agree to salary raises, to set additional payments over and above the wage rates, and to pay additional pay of a compensation character. For the first time, additional pay has been introduced for combat alert duty and for working in rural areas. The main types of additional pay of a compensation character are provided to directors, specialists, and technical performance personnel who know foreign languages and use them in their daily work and to motor vehicle drivers with skill ratings. The defense minister's order takes into account all special features of the work of branch employees and categories of civilian personnel and establishes various types of salary raises and additional pay. In my opinion, the new system for paying percentage-based increases for uninterrupted service merits special attention. [Yurkin] Needless to say, we are dealing with an urgent problem that concerns a lot of people. Could you spell out what the innovations being introduced will basically mean, so that readers of our journal who work in military units and at Ministry of Defense organizations and enterprises can quickly calculate their wages? [Rudik] Let me begin with the most important point: The amount of the percentage-based additional pay for uninterrupted service has been substantially increased and is now equal to that of an officer for years of service. This innovation was introduced in order to stabilize cadres and to give civilian personnel a greater material incentive to amass uninterrupted work time in military units and to increase their wages. The following additional pay for uninterrupted service, as a percentage of the wage rate for basic occupation, has been established: more than one year, five percent; more than two years, 10 percent; more than three years, 15 percent; more than five years, 20 percent; more than 10 years, 25 percent; more than 15 years, 30 percent; and more than 20 years, 40 percent. It should now be easy to make the calculations with a pencil. The procedure for calculating length of uninterrupted service for servicemen who have been discharged into the reserves or have retired on account of age, sickness, personnel cutbacks, or health limitations has been changed, and rightly so. Their total length of uninterrupted service conferring the right to receive percentage-based additional pay for such service now includes their entire period of military service. True, on one condition: That they began working in the military unit within one year of the date of discharge from military service, and, with respect to employees discharged on account of disability, excluding the time of a group one or group two disability. This period used to be six months. The question of including military service in the Armed Forces of the states that used to be former Soviet union republics has also been solved in a positive fashion, provided that the person began working in the military unit within one year of the date on which he was discharged into the reserves or retired on those same grounds. Given current migration processes, this measure will undoubtedly help many people make important decisions about their future, relying on the help of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense. [Yurkin] The social orientation of many Russian Federation laws relating to our Armed Forces is clear. Does the introduction of the UWS give broader rights to unit commanders in providing incentives for conscientious service? [Rudik] The rights of commanders are undoubtedly broadened. With the consent of elective trade union agencies, each year military unit commanders approve a material incentive and material assistance fund in an amount of up to six monthly wage funds (based on a one-year period). How will this money be used? First and foremost, to pay bonuses for basic performance on a monthly and quarterly basis and to make additional incentive payments. For example, for completing especially important, urgent tasks and to reward employees for annual performance results--the so-called 13th paycheck. The following provision is also new: Monies in this fund may be used to reimburse workers for meals and the cost of commuting on urban public transport and to make other payments of a social character stipulated in a collective contract. The latter is the legal foundation regulating all material incentive matters. Bonuses, additional pay, rewards, and material assistance paid to an individual employee are not limited by any maximum ceilings; however, total payments to all workers in the course of one year must not exceed six monthly wage funds (based on a one-year period). Money saved from monthly wage funds may not be used for these purposes. [Yurkin] Viktor Antonovich, let me make a proposal: Let's look at incentive factors on a somewhat different plane. You will agree that it's one thing to live and work in Russia's central regions, and quite another in Siberia and the Far North. Are any compensation measures provided for Northerners, Siberians, Far Easterners, and people in the Transbaykal region? [Rudik] I can assure you that the approach to setting regional coefficients, the subject of your question, has been fundamentally changed. Everyone was fed up with the discrepancies that existed earlier. For example, a 1.30 coefficient was set for military units in Nizhneilimskiy and Bratsk Rayons, Irkutsk Province, but a 1.40 coefficient for loggers. This sort of social discrimination against civilian personnel of the Russian Armed Forces was also to be observed in Okhotsk District, Khabarovsk Kray. These discrepancies have now been eliminated. The Ministry of Defense has been authorized to apply regional coefficients to the wages of civilian personnel within the scope of the coefficients set for a corresponding region, including those set by local agencies. For this reason, Order No. 130 of the Russian Federation defense minister establishes uniform regional coefficients for civilian personnel of military units, institutions, enterprises, and organizations in the corresponding regions. The introduction of the UWS entails a shift to the interbranch wage organization principle. This means that in fields of Defense Ministry activity, equal pay for equal work is being introduced for employees in equivalent occupations. At the same time, special features of the work of employees in various branches are taken into account in setting wage terms. This is reflected in defense minister Order No. 130 that I mentioned. [Yurkin] If we are going to discuss special wage arrangements, I suggest that we start with military educational institutions. [Rudik] This section of the order deals with wage terms not only for higher educational establishment employees, but also for employees of general-education institutions, such as schools, kindergartens, and extracurricular and military educational establishments. For professor and instructor positions, skill requirements call for experience in research, research-and-teaching, or practical work, which must be reflected in the employee's labor record booklet. The procedure for paying for teaching work over and above established workload norms (including when an employee is substituting for an instructor who is temporarily absent) has been changed. An employee may hold a second job at up to 50 percent time, in either his own or another department, it makes no difference. On the whole, the innovations will result in a increase 3-4 times for the salaries for educators in comparison with November 1992, and increase of 3.5-5 times for educational institution directors. We also have another category of civilian employees whose wages have prompted many questions. It is medical and pharmacy employees. There will be no special certifications in introducing the new wage terms. Under the wage scale system, their pay grades will be based on the position they hold, the skill category conferred on them, whether they hold any academic ranks or honorary titles, and their place of work. Physician specialists at rest and relaxation facilities, preventive-care facilities, boarding houses, tourist centers, sports schools and facilities, general-education schools, and preschool and extracurricular institutions will be assigned to UWS wage grade nine, regardless of their skill categories. Medical and pharmacy employees who manage their departments and are candidates of sciences; physicians who serve as chairmen of military physician commissions and medical flight commissions; directors of military medical institutions who have a skill category; and physicians who have the honorary title "Meritorious Physician" are to be assigned a pay grade that is one grade higher than that of persons who do not have these distinctions. I repeat: only one grade higher, not two grades, one for being a manager and one for the honorary title. [Yurkin] Are there no exceptions? [Rudik] The rule is this: People who are entitled to increase their pay grades by one or two grades on the basis of several factors may take one pay grade increase based on the most compelling grounds. And now as regards exceptions: The UWS pay grades may be raised by two grades for physicians and for certified pharmacists who manage their military medical institutions and who have the highest skill rating, and for doctors of science and physicians who hold the honorary title "People's Physician." I should also call attention to the following features: Military hospitals and sanatoriums, as well as out-patient polyclinics that include diagnostic centers, have been raised to the next highest grade with respect to wages for their directors. In addition, in contrast to the previous procedure, salaries for civilian personnel who work in hazardous and especially difficult conditions are being raised not only for employees of military medical institutions, but also for employees who are enlisted to provide consultation, medical care, and other services. The salary increases for these employees are based on the actual amount of time they work under the aforementioned conditions. [Yurkin] How will wages for cultural workers change? In the library, Margarita Petrovna complained to me that she had worked her entire life for 120 rubles. [Rudik] Now the situation has changed. The salary paid to a library director before the introduction of the UWS has been increased by 293 percent. For a librarian without a skill rating, the salary has been increased by 182 percent. But that's not all: Directors of cultural organizations, institutions, and enterprises are given the right, in concluding collective contracts, to include commitments--over and above those stipulated in the overall wage terms--to raise salaries for arts workers who hold the honorary titles "People's Artist" and "Meritorious Artist." Rank and file workers have not been overlooked either. For example, salaries may be increased for cinema mechanics, library workers, and other specialists at cultural-education institutions in rural areas. [Yurkin] Significant changes have been made in the wage system for sailors, hydrographers, divers, and command personnel on Russian Navy support ships. Will this be an incentive in their work? [Rudik] I think it will. The international classification of command personnel positions was used in devising the skill requirements. For example, captain is followed by the position of senior (chief) mechanic, and the position of second mechanic is equivalent in pay to the position of senior captain's assistant. This was done not by lowering the pay grades for captains' assistants, but by raising the pay grades for the mechanics. The positions of other support ship crew members have been standardized. Substantial changes have been made in wages for divers. Instead of three specialization groups, divers have been assigned pay grades four through eight, with grade eight reserved solely for Defense Ministry divers. Additional pay for skill ratings have been maintained for them. For the first time, the question of wages for nonstaff divers on sea (roadstead) ships for time spent working underwater has been resolved. [Yurkin] There is one other category of Russian Armed Forces civilian personnel that we have not touched on--employees of district, fleet, and army staffs. Please explain how they will be paid. [Rudik] The UWS wage principles do not extend to state administrative agencies. Wage terms for these employees will be set forth in the Russian Federation Law "On State Service." In the meantime, the decree of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet and Government "On Regulating Wages for Employees of Representative and Executive Government Agencies" is in effect, together with the Russian defense minister's Order No. 129 of March 8 of this year. The provisions of defense minister Order No. 130 apply fully to the civilian employees of military administrative agencies as concerns the procedure for calculating and confirming wage funds, providing percentage-based additional pay for uninterrupted service and regional coefficients, and providing material incentives to such employees; up to six monthly wage funds (based on a one-year period) may be used for these purposes. Now that I have described the special features of wages for various categories of civilian personnel of the Russian Armed Forces, I consider it necessary to call attention to the certification of directors, specialists, and technical execution personnel for the purpose of making sure that the employee is qualified for the position he holds and determining his wage grade in accordance with the UWS. This certification is quite different from previous ones and is designed to ensure effective measures to improve these employees' material situations and to reinforce their wages' incentive role, based on social justice principles. I want to emphasize that certification will be required for all directors, specialists, and technical execution personnel (including those working on a part-time basis) of military units, institutions, military educational establishments, enterprises, and organizations, with the exception of medical and pharmacy employees. For them, the wage grades will be set on the basis of the previous (1991) certification's results. The job of introducing UWS wages will be overseen by the unit commander. At the commander's discretion, the mostly highly qualified employees of financial agencies, labor agencies, and personnel departments, economists, and other specialists may be enlisted in it. In view of the special characteristics of this time and constantly rising inflation, which is aggravating social tension in certain labor collectives, we are pinning special hopes on smooth and efficient work by commanders and specialists of financial agencies and labor and wage agencies who are best qualified to introduce the new UWS wage terms. It is our common duty to do everything in our power to ensure that the civilian personnel of the Russian Armed Forces receive their newly recalculated wages in the shortest possible time.
