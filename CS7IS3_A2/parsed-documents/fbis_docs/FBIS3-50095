What it offers to European states is cooperation in the military and political spheres. This is what Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said on television. Asked about the schedule for the Czech Republic joining NATO, the minister replied: [Begin Zieleniec recording] It much depends on the general development of the security situation in the world. I think that a tacit part of the agreement is that the plan will acquire greater dynamism in the event that the situation on the continent and also in East Europe deteriorates. On the other hand, if developments proceed along the lines of peace and calm and if they are heading toward democracy in all East and Central European states, there could be some delay. But, in that case, there would be no risk to our security. [end recording]. Josef Zieleniec went on to emphasize that the meaning of NATO is the provision of joint guarantees for a larger entity sharing similar interests, values, and way of life. The immediate opening of NATO toward the deep east and embracing states where democracy--and I quote--is not fully convincing, would be very risky, Minister Zieleniec said.
