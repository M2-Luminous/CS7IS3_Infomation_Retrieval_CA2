[Begin Doan Khue recording] Dear the meeting presidium: In compliance with the party statute and a party Central Committee Secretariat directive, the all-army midterm conference of party organizations is due to open today. The conference will be in session for four days, from 1-4 March 1994. Although it is not a congress, the all-army midterm conference of party organizations is very important as it is designed to thoroughly study the resolution of the midterm national party congress, review efforts to provide guidance for the implementation of the national defense tasks over the past two and a half years, and determine the course of action, tasks, and an action program for the next two years -- 1994 and 1995 -- to, together with the entire people, implement the party congress resolutions successfully and move the country's renovation process toward new, greater successes. [end recording] Afterward, on behalf of the party Central Committee's Military Commission, Comrade Doan Khue delivered a political report with some suggestions. He asked the conference to concentrate on thoroughly studying the party Central Committee's political report at the midterm national party congress. His report contains two parts with the first part evaluating the implementation of the Seventh Party Congress resolution and the second part discussing the orientations, tasks, and targets for the remaining period of the term of office of the Seventh Party Central Committee. In the first part, after outlining the international and domestic situations, Comrade Doan Khue pointed out three major achievements that consist of: 1. Having overcome by an important step the socioeconomic crisis. 2. Having been able to continue to maintain and consolidate political stability. 3. Having broadened foreign relations, improved the prestige and position of our country in the world, and created favorable international environment for the cause of national construction and defense. Our achievements scored in the renovation process have further generated the people's elation and confidence in the party leadership and created more strength and stature for our national revolution to continue to make headway. As for weaknesses and resulting problems, after pointing out the weaknesses in the economic, cultural, and social domains, his report also mentions a number of weaknesses directly related to national defense tasks. For instance: Although political stability has been firmly maintained, there still exist numerous complex factors we cannot ignore. Many party and state organizations have failed to build themselves into clean and steadfast organizations. Political security has not been firmly maintained, and public order and safety have not been guaranteed. Judging from advantages and difficulties, Comrade Doan Khue's political report arrives at an important conclusion that although there still exist numerous weaknesses to be overcome, those important achievements scored have been, and are creating premises with which to shift the country to a new stage of development -- the stage in which we move toward national industrialization and modernization. These premises involve a series of factors, both strength and stature, both material and spiritual needs, and those economic, political, social, and cultural factors at home and abroad. These are a particularly important issue and also a new, striking point of the situation, and a development of the policy set forth by the Seventh Party Congress. Regarding the orientations, tasks, and targets for the remaining period of the term of office of the Seventh Party Central Committee, after discussing great challenges and opportunities for the entire party, people, and armed forces, Comrade Doan Khue pointed out the overall targets that call for motivating the entire party, people, and armed forces to be of the same heart and mind, to exert their extraordinary effort to uphold their sense of independence, sovereignty, and self reliance, to broaden international cooperation, to practice the motto of industry, thrift, integrity, righteousness, public dedication, and detachment, to exploit advantages, dispel dangers, overcome ordeals, successfully achieve the overall targets already set, and accelerate the pace of achieving those targets set forth in the strategy for economic stabilization and development until the year 2000 in a bid to build a propserous people and an equal and civilized society. To achieve these targets, his politial report points out eight essential tasks for the period ahead as follows: -- effecting a change in the economic structure toward industrialization and modernization. -- consistently carrying out the policy on multisectoral economic development. -- uniformly building a market mechanism under the state management along the socialist path. -- taking good care of cultural and social issues. -- strengthening national defense and security. -- continuing to broaden foreign economic relations. -- building a law-govering Vietnamese state of the people, by the people, and for the people. -- carrying out party renovation and rectification. Dealing with the task of strengthening national defense and security, Comrade Doan Khue said: [Begin Doan Khue recording] Against a situation where the enemy force is conspiring to intensify their sabotage activities on a large scale, we must attach importance to national defense and security and must satisfactorily perform our duty of defending our fatherland and our national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and firmly maintaining political and social stability and the course of socialist development. We must undertake a universal, all-out, and long-term struggle in all fields of activity to foil the schemes and actions of hostile forces in their peaceful evolution strategy and their rebellious and subversive attempts. [end recording] The all-army midterm conference of party organizations will continue its discussions designed to thoroughly understand those essential issues in the political report of the midterm national party conference. The conference will continue in session until 4 March.
