As a result, the second coalition administration under Prime Minister Hata came to an end in just less than two months since its inauguration on 28 April. The direct cause of the abrupt ending was the fact that the Hata administration was forced to run a minority government due to an uproar over the formation of the parliamentary group "Kaishin." However, the high-handed political style of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and his followers and the lack of political leadership shown by the prime minister and cabinet ministers who repeatedly made controversial remarks, only to find themselves having to make apologies and retract their remarks, can also be counted among factors that led to the folding of the administration. From early next week, ruling and opposition parties are likely to be engaged in a power struggle, perhaps with parties breaking up and further political realignment taking place. The ruling coalition parties plan to resume governmental and policy consultations with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], in hopes that the latter would return to the coalition. Should such consultations end in failure, however, the ruling coalition parties are also said to be considering reaching out to elements of both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ. Meanwhile, the LDP is considering plans to form a coalition alliance with the SDPJ and other parties in a bid to regain power by taking advantage of the situation. The SDPJ has insisted that a voluntary mass resignation by the Hata administration would be a precondition to its returning to the coalition. Considering that this condition has been satisfied, the SDPJ, which holds a decisive vote over the outcome of the current political turmoil, has indicated that it is prepared to return to the coalition, with the possibility of Hata's reelection in mind. There is nothing significant about the current situation. It simply means that a power struggle will continue to rage with the ruling coalition parties, the LDP, and the SDPJ engaged in a "tripartite" deadlock. The mass resignation of the Hata administration has left many unanswered questions. In a news conference, the prime minister said: "Should the Diet be dissolved, it would create a month-long political vacuum. Under current circumstances, this must be avoided." He thus justified his decision on a "voluntary mass resignation" to avert a Diet dissolution and a subsequent general election. However, it is suspected that his true intentions were to prevent being forced to either resign en masse or dissolve the Diet due to the probable passage of a no-confidence motion, while leaving the possibility that he may be nominated as prime minister again. There was a similar situation in the past. In this case, the administration of then Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama once resigned en masse in November 1955, saying that the nation's political foundation had changed as a result of the formation of the LDP through an alliance of liberal forces. After being reelected as prime minister, Hatoyama went on to serve his third term as prime minister. In the case of the Hata administration, the line of argument that Hata and his colleagues apparently take is that their intentions pose no problems at all from the standpoint of the Constitution, the Cabinet Law, and other relevant matters. At the time of the formation of the third Hatoyama administration, the SDPJ, which was an opposition party at the time, complained that "this is a plot to establish a permanent hold on power by conservative forces by prearranging the handing over of the reigns of government among themselves." Although historical circumstances have changed, the mass resignation of the Hata administration gives a strong impression that this is merely a coalition tactic to muster a majority for maintaining a hold on power and to prearrange the handing over of the reigns of the government among themselves. We have asserted that the current power struggle in which politicians simply try to gain a majority is intolerable and that in order to create a government with capable leaders, the lower house of the Diet should be dissolved in the not too distant a future to seek the judgment of the people. With the mass resignation of the Hata administration, a Diet dissolution and a subsequent general election has been postponed. However, upon notification by the "House of Representatives Election Redistricting Council" regarding demarcation of new single seat constituencies for holding general elections under a new electoral system, the next administration must immediately convene an extraordinary Diet session to promptly enact the redistricting bill. It must then seek the will of the people after a designated period has passed for public acknowledgement of the enactment of the bill. There is not much time to spend on forming a new administration. There are impending tasks -- including tax system reform, which primarily involves a consumption tax hike -- as well as the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, Japan-U.S. summit talks, and the Naples summit. We cannot allow politicians to continue with their political struggles, which are based merely on grudges among themselves or on their likes and dislikes, and which totally ignore the will of the people; nor can we allow "job-executing cabinets" to continue on and on.
