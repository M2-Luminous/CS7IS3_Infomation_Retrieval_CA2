The newspaper "AL-BA'ATH," mouthpiece of the ruling party, called today on the U.S., a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process, to play its supposed role for achieving the objectives of this process. The paper argued that the U.S. is capable of putting pressure on Israel to commit itself to adhering to the peace process in both words and deeds. The Arab parties involved in the peace talks include Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians. According to diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital, Christopher's coming tour of the region is intended to hold preliminary talks with the parties involved in the Middle East peace process to remove the obstacles to the resumption of the peace negotiations and set a date for such resumption. Arab political sources in Damascus maintain that Christopher is likely to make some progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track of the peace negotiations, which will enable him to focus on pushing the peace process forward. Yet the sources hold that Christopher's task of persuading the Arab parties, particularly Syria, to resume the Washington talks would not be an easy job because Syria adheres to its consistent stand. Syria insists that peace can be achieved only on the basis of a complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and the full restoration of the Palestinian people's rights, especially their rights to repatriation, self-determination and the establishment of an independent state. The sources add that Syria adheres to the peace-for-land principle and condemns Israel's intransigent stand which consists in its insistence on considering the security arrangements to be made in the Golan Heights without showing willingness to withdraw completely from there.
