Japanese Ambassador to Kazakhstan Akira Matsui signed the agreement with Kazakhstan Foreign Minister Tuleutai Skakovich Suleymenov, in Almaty, the ministry said. The agreement was the last to be signed between Japan and the four former Soviet republics. Tokyo signed similar pacts with Russia last October, Belarus last November and Ukraine earlier this month. The accord follows Japan's announcement in April last year at a ministerial meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) nations that it would extend a grant-in-aid of 100 million dollars for the promotion of nuclear weapons destruction in the former Soviet Union. The committee will include representatives of the Governments of Japan and Kazakhstan, it said.
