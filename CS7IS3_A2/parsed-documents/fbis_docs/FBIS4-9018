At the beginning of this month, the Serbs had stored their heavy weapons in six depots, following the cease-fire agreed between Croats and Serbs from the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina. Van de Weghe said that they have already withdrawn "a considerable number" of those weapons. This hardening of the Serbian attitude is, according to the military spokesman, a result of recent NATO air strikes on Serbian positions around Gorazde. Van de Weghe stressed that the situation in Baranja was "calm" and that there was "absolutely no reason" to fear for the safety of the Belgian UN troops on the ground. The military spokesman added that "reassuring reports" had been received concerning the 30 Belgian UN troops being held by the Serbs in the Raslovac barracks near Sarajevo. Van de Weghe said that these soldiers "do not feel they are hostages or are being threatened." Most of these soldiers are from the 11th Battalion of engineers from Burcht that has been based in Sarajevo since the beginning of March.
