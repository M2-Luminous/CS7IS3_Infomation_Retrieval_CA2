Meeting with ROK President Kim Yong-sam at the Diaoyutai State Guest House this evening Li said that President Kim had come to visit China just a year after taking office, which demonstrated that the president highly valued the development of ROK-China ties. He said that though the two countries established diplomatic ties not long ago, their relationship has developed rapidly due to the common efforts. Personnel exchanges have increased rapidly while bilateral economic cooperation has expanded continually, he added. Developing the good-neighborly ties between the two countries will conform to the aspirations and fundamental interests of the two peoples, he said. Kim said he was satisfied with his fruitful talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and pleased to have the chance to meet with Premier Li. Noting that the ROK and China have enjoyed long traditional relations, he said there is great potential for furthering bilateral economic ties and trade. Kim said that the ROK encourages its enterprises to invest more in China. As long as the two sides strengthen cooperation, the future for such relationship will be brighter, he said. Talking about the situation on the Korean peninsula, Li said that China pays great attention to having a good surrounding environment. Therefore, he said, China hopes that the Korean peninsula will maintain a peaceful and stable situation. This, he continued, conforms to the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and the people of the north and the south of the Korean peninsula as well. The Chinese premier said there had been some progress recently on solving the nuclear issue concerning the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. But now there appeared difficulties and twists. Of course, he said, it needs time to accomplish anything. As long as the parties concerned conduct dialogue patiently, finally a way to solve this issue properly can be found. It was just like erecting a bridge to cross a river. One needs to create a good atmosphere and an environment of relaxation in order to resume the dialogue among the four parties, he said. Kim said he agreed with Li Peng's view on the settlement of the nuclear issue through negotiations. He said it is the most effective way to conduct sincere and direct dialogue between the parties involved in the issue. It is the ROK's hope that such dialogue will be resumed, so as to find a proper solution to the issue. During the meeting, Kim invited Li to visit the ROK at a time convenient to the premier. Li expressed thanks and accepted the invitation with pleasure. Li Peng's wife and Kim's wife attended the meeting. Also participating in the meeting were Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen; Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission Wu Jichuan, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee and minister of posts and communications; as well as Yun Tong-yun, ROK minister of telecommunications and posts; Kim Chol-su, minister of trade, industry, and energy; Kim Si-chung, minister of science and techology; and others. After the meeting, Li Peng and his wife gave a dinner in honor of Kim and his wife and their party.
