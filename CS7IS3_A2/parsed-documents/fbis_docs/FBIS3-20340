According to Mr. Poniatowski, who spoke on RTL [Luxembourg Radio and Television], "the figures mentioned in the report were not discovered or revealed by the judge, but were officially transmitted by the PR treasurer," Jean-Pierre Thomas. "The report," the Eure deputy continued, "does not reveal anything new on the issue of political party financing. It is known that before 1990, all political parties were obliged to find operating funds in a way which was not always conventional. Since 1990, the advantage of the law is that all accounts are now clear." Mr. Poniatowski summarizes the behavior of the judge, which he qualifies as "very serious," as follows: "Let us smear, smear, and some of it will always stick, even if the smear is absolutely unfounded." On 29 March Alain Madelin, companies and economic development minister and PR vice president, also stated to RTL: "Was the Republican Party's financing in line with the laws on party financing? The PR's response is yes. Let justice do its job. As far as I am concerned, I have absolutely nothing to do with PR financing. Because of this, I have confidence in the judicial system of my country. I bear the responsibility for the Republican Party, and I assume it totally."
