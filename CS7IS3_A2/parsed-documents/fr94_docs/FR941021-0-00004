FR941021-0-00004 FR941021-0-00001 A significant requirement of 7 CFR 1755.910 involves the changing of the bonding and grounding system of outside plant housings from a 14 gauge system to a 6 gauge system. The change to the 6 gauge bonding and grounding system in the housings will help to assure that REA housings will be manufactured in compliance with recognized industry safety standards that are considered critical to the protection of outside plant telephone equipment, craft personnel, and the public. Comments On September 1, 1993, REA published a proposed rule at 58 FR 46110 on 7 CFR 1755.910, REA Specification for Outside Plant Housings and Serving Area Interface Systems. Comments on this proposed rule were due October 1, 1993. Comments and recommendations were received from several companies by this date. The comments, recommendations and responses are summarized as follows: One respondent recommended that paragraph (d)(3)(xxx) of this section be changed to allow the use of locknuts as well as nuts with captive lock washers. Response: REA has reviewed the recommendation. The requirement for the captive studs and nuts with captive lock washers was initiated in a letter to all Telephone Borrowers by Mr. Michael M.F. Liu, Acting Administrator, dated April 24, 1992. Captive studs and nuts with captive lock washers replaced the spade clip and terminal as the means for grounding and have proven to be very efficient. Because of concern that the locknut will become loose after repeated lifting of ground connections on cables that require frequent locating, REA will not change the requirement in this paragraph. One respondent recommended that paragraph (d)(6)(v) be modified to add color 4.4GY 6.74/1.5 under the gray-green color. Response: REA has reviewed the recommendation and as a result of the review will add color 4.4GY 6.74/1.5 under the gray-green color as proposed by the commenter. Several clarifying and editorial changes in paragraphs (d)(3)(v), (d)(3)(vii), and (d)(3)(xiii) were made in response to comments from two respondents. These changes did not alter the intent or technical requirements of the affected paragraphs.
