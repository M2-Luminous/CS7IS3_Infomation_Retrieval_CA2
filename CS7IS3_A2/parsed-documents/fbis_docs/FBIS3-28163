They claimed that peoples in these countries lacked complete freedom of expression and regarded the setting up of the radio station as an instrument for conveying varied views to those peoples. It is well known that during the Cold War period, the United States utilized Radio Free Europe as one of its tools to oppose the socialist countries in eastern Europe. That radio station played an important role in interfering in the internal affairs of those countries. In the last decade of the 20th century, while the United States and other countries throughout the world are expeditiously seeking ways to increase mutual cooperation and understanding, the United States itself is considering setting up a Radio Free Asia to oppose the countries in Asia. It is surprising indeed. The LPDR Foreign Affairs Ministry is of the view that the establishment of Radio Free Asia by the Unites States runs counter to the trend of promoting cooperation and creating peace in this region and throughout the world. The only thing the peoples and governments in this region want is that they hope the United States will use other means of communications in an effort to contribute to building mutual trust to facilitate the promotion of economic, scientific, cultural, social cooperation, and peace in Southeast Asia and the world.
