This was emphasized by a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in connection with the discussion on the use of German arms in Turkey. This means that Turkey must use German arms only within the framework of NATO orders, the spokeswoman said. This was also laid down in an exchange of letters between the foreign ministers of the two countries in 1992. According to Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Bundestag Deputy Klaus Francke, the Bundestag's Foreign Committee will deal with the issue on the use of German arms in the Kurdish conflict on 13 April. The Federal Government will subsequently comment on the issue, Francke said on North German radio NDR on Saturday [2 April]. If Turkey were to use German arms in its actions against Kurds, this would be a violation of the arrangements made with Turkey. Arms supplied within the NATO framework must not be used in internal conflicts. [passage omitted]
