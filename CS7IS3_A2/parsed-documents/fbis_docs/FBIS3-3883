Japanese sources said the talks between a nonpartisan group of eight Japanese parliamentarians, who arrived in Taipei on Tuesday, and 18 Taiwanese counterparts would continue. Japan occupied Taiwan from 1885 to 1945. Before and during the war it forced people in Taiwan to deposit part of their monthly salaries in postal savings accounts. According to a Japanese Government estimate, the postal savings deposits, postal annuities and unpaid salaries totaled 452.4 million yen, owing to some 2,547,000 people. Japan has voiced its intention to refund the unpaid money from the fiscal 1995 state budget beginning in April 1995. But many Taiwanese hope to link the unpaid money to indexing, saying the value has risen by about 4,500 times from 1943 on the basis of Japanese public servant salaries. Sources said the issue is to be handled the same way the government repaid the savings of Okinawa residents deposited before the war. The government reimbursed 94 million yen in savings to the residents, adding 339 million yen to the principal as indexing.
