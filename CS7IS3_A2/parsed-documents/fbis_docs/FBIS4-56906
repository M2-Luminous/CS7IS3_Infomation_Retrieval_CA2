Neither does it authorize him to sit without recess except for emergency cases, he stated. [passage omitted] Furthermore, Eddy Volel says he is opposed to the installation of Emile Jonassaint as president of the Republic because, he says, it is as unconstitutional as it is a blatant violation of the 16 December 1990 vote.
