As Aerospatiale boss Louis Gallois reportedly announced in Cannes (southern France), a holding society is to be founded in Munich before the end of the year in which the two enterprises are to participate on a 50:50 percent basis. Negotiations on this cooperation have not yet been concluded, a spokesman of the German Aerospace AG company stressed. According to Gallois, the two firms hope to achieve results by July. The partners believe that, in a self-confident manner, they will jointly become the largest European producer of satellites and a serious competitor for the English-French Matra-Marconi group.
