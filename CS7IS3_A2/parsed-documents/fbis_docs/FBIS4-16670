The essence of the amendments is as follows. Import duties on goods which have not been increased when compared with previous rates are to operate from 15 March. But those which have risen will not go into force until 1 July. This means that importers who concluded contracts before 15 March have been given a breathing space. This is the response to the complaint of businessmen buying goods abroad for the Russian consumer who have rightly criticized the authors of the decree for the fact that importers were not forewarned of the planned changes and could not prepare for them. Meanwhile, an amendment to the law on customs tariffs is now being examined which will envisage that after a decision on the imposition of new duties, importers are to be given at least 90 days to adapt to the changed conditions. Before the end of the year it is planned initially to reduce a number of customs duties which exceed 30 percent of the customs value of certain commodities. This government intention is in keeping with the GATT requirement for an average world level of rates no higher than 7-8 percent, whereas the rate in our country currently exceeds 14 percent.
