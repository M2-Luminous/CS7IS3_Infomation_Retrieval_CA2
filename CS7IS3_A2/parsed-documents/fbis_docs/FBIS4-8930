Borka Rudic reports: [Rudic] Of these, 33 arrived last night in the Jablanica municipality, where the War Presidency and other civilian organs of authority of the Prozor municipality have their provisional seats. The other prisoners left for the municipalities of Bugojno and Zenica, where their families are. All inmates of the Heliodrom camp should be released today. According to what those who have already arrived in Jablanica said, there are another 70 Muslims from Prozor in this camp in Herzegovina. A further 25 of them are also expected to arrive in Jablanica. The others expressed the wish to go abroad. The release of the prisoners from the Heliodrom camp is a result of the latest agreements between the Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian sides that were recently reached in Medjugorje, and the endeavors to realize the Washington agreement in practice. Dr. Slobodan Lang also made a major contribution to the successful release of the Muslims from this Herzegovina camp of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO]. Even after the release of these residents of Prozor, who were imprisoned nine months ago and placed first in a prison in Prozor and then in Heliodrom, according the local Center for Investigating War Crimes, the fate of 200 Muslims from Prozor is completely uncertain. Therefore, members of the civilian authority of that municipality are appealing to the International Red Cross and all other organizations to do whatever can be done to finally find out what has actually happened to these 200 civilians.
