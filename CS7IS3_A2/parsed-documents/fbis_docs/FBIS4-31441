Enormously discreet and of a negotiatory turn of mind, this 46-year-old lawyer and father of two has exchanged weapons, which gravely wounded him, for words to end this war which has been devastating the former Yugoslav republic for over two years. On Bosnia's future, Zubak says that Serbs, Croats, and Muslims must coexist. "We have lived and will have to live together." Although it is not the first time that he has come to Geneva -- he has been a member of the Croat delegation on many occasions -- the new round of UN-backed negotiations is proving a baptism of fire for this "political amateur," as he describes himself, since on this occasion he shares the billing in the same delegation with Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, who, at least publicly, calls the shots. [Fernandez] Does the setting up of the Croat-Muslim Federation mean that the differences between these two peoples, who were enemies until a few weeks ago, have disappeared? [Zubak] The setting up of the Bosnian Federation is an extremely important step for creating trust between Muslims and Croats. With it, a political agreement which satisfies both peoples' interests has been reached, and we believe that it is also a good framework which can accommodate and satisfy a third people's interests. [Fernandez] But after two years of war and ethnic cleansing, is it still possible to believe that the Serbs will wish to join this federation? [Zubak] The war will have to end some day, and it will have to end with a political agreement. There have been several wars in our nation's history, and all of them were ended. This war will be ended, too. [Fernandez] Do the Croat and Muslim military chiefs also accept this agreement without reservations? [Zubak] The agreement which has been reached is a package of measures. When we concluded the political agreement, we signed a military agreement which has now begun to be implemented, and in fact it is the one which is producing better results on the ground. Immediately after the signing of the military agreement, the hostilities between Croats and Muslims ceased, and this means that the two peoples have achieved a political solution, which is the way to end this war. We have lived and will have to live together. Let us hope that the Serbs will also reach the same conclusion. [Fernandez] How do you explain the many turnabouts by the Croats, who at the beginning of the war were on the side of the Muslims, then of the Serbs, and now of the Muslims again? [Zubak] I believe that this is a mistaken conclusion. The Croats have always had a very clear political option, and this option was to set up a federal state or a confederation. We have always been in favor of Bosnia-Herzegovina's being a pluralist country. Now we have agreed with the Bosnians the framework for this country, which means that our political aim is being achieved. [Fernandez] What are your territorial claims for the new federation? [Zubak] We claim 58 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, based on the 1991 census, in which the Bosnians and Croats were the majority, and this is in line with the principles expressed by the international community, which rejects ethic cleansing and aggression. The offer which we currently have gives us 51 percent, and the remaining 49 percent for the Serbs. [Fernandez] But the international community supports the 51-49 percent plan, including the United States, which initially supported your 58-percent claim. [Zubak] This means that they do not respect their own principles. We are prepared to reach a compromise if Bosnia-Herzegovina is a viable state and if the international community gives us assurances that this agreement will be implemented. [Fernandez] Are you in favor of lifting the arms embargo imposed on the Bosnians? [Zubak] I repeat that nothing is resolved through war. I am in favor of resolving problems through political agreements. If this were not possible, it would be just to grant the Croats and Bosnians the right to defend ourselves.
