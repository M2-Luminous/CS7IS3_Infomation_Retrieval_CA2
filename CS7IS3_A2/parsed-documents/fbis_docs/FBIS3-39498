In a petition dealing with policy on Europe issued by the party, which was founded recently by former FDP [Free Democratic Party] politician Brunner, the Presidium warns of the consequences of the Maastricht Treaty. "Maastricht, a product of secret cabinet politics, will fail, because the Germans will not allow themselves to be deprived of the German mark, because Europe's cultural diversity will not tolerate a super state, and because liberal democracy inevitably will be destroyed along with the nation." Europe cannot be forced into being a community, but should be organized as "an association of sovereign states." The petition further states that the Maastricht Treaty will result in central planning overcoming a market economy in Europe, and a bureaucratic "redistribution apparatus," largely financed by Germany, which will come into being and ruin the German economy. To check this "regulation madness" and "the power of bureaucracy," all guidelines and directives that extend beyond the single market should be approved by the national parliaments. The document does not deal with the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The presidium calls for the abolition of EU [European Union] agricultural subsidies, which are a described as a "corrupt farce." One quarter of agricultural subsidies end up in "dishonest hands." The destruction of food on a massive scale must end. The party opposes the "imposition of uniformity" by European laws and is in favor of minimum standards that will enable each country to "introduce tougher or the toughest possible criteria if it so wishes." The petition expresses support for EU common foreign and security policies. "While the EU is smothered by bureaucracy and is in the process of dismantling liberal democracy, it is still unable to pursue a common foreign policy on really major issues." The EU was helpless and in disagreement in the face of the outbreak of war in the Balkans. A common foreign policy must be based on the right of peoples to self-determination. "If unanimity cannot be achieved on foreign policy issues, there should be an obligation to exchange information and maintain peace," the document states. However, a security policy that is independent of the United States and NATO runs counter to German interests. Finally, the party leadership proposes that the the states of Central Europe become EU members "as quickly as possible." Political stability and the economic development of the new democracies in East Europe are the central element in the Association of Free Citizens policy on Europe.
