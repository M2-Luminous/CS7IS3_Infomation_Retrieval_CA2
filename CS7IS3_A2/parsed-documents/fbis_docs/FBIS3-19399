The Tuebing professor of political economy thought then that the CDU had made serious economic mistakes at the time of German unification and many of its visionary thinkers had "steered expectations in the wrong direction." The chancellor's party, according to Starbatty, had "gone into neutral in the area of regulatory policy." Many of his colleagues saw it the same way as well. But Starbatty, who has been upholding liberal principles as chairman of the Action League for a Social Free Market Economy since 1991, is now acting accordingly. Since January, the professor, to whom friends ascribe a "crusading temperament," has been deputy chairman of the Federation of Free Citizens, on whose executive committee two other economists of the neoliberal school also serve: Franz-Ulrich Willeke, a retired economics professor from Heidelberg, and Bernd Thomas Ramb, an active businessman with a second job as an nontenured professor in Siegen. Roland Vaubel, professor of political economy in Mannheim, collaborated on the new party's platform and wants "to continue to advise" Brunner's forces "on social and economic policy issues." He is not even disturbed by the party founder's closeness to right-wing extremist politicians such as Joerg Haider, head of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPOe). Vaubel: "That is only an image that some people want to foist on him." While other protest parties come to the fore as programmatic no-names, Brunner's economists are attempting to revive a brandname item: "Social free-market economics along the lines of Ludwig Erhard" is the recipe of Starbatty, who himself was trained in the academic school of Alfred Mueller-Armack, a fellow traveler of Erhard. The economist is calling for an all-round renewal through market forces and competition. The welfare state is allegedly "facing an imminent collapse" and a "rigid wage system" is supposedly "robbing the unemployed of opportunity." Individual responsibility must once again "be granted and be expected." The highly touted social peace, Starbatty believes, has long been far too costly in this country and overvalued as an advantage for the location of industry: "It exists in Great Britain today as well." The regulatory policy fundamentalists see themselves agreeing with prominent colleagues in the matter of their hit election campaign issue: `no' to a European Monetary Union. In a sensational manifesto back in 1992, 60 economics professors declared their opposition to bidding farewell to the German mark. Integration by agreements from above "will paralyze competition and centralize risks," warns monetary expert Franz-Ulrich Willeke, who is particularly rankled by the fact that "justified reservations" are constantly being dismissed as "heavy-handed fear-mongering." It is finally time now to shuffle up the old parties' cartel. Professor Willeke is delighted: "We are, after all, a social experiment."
