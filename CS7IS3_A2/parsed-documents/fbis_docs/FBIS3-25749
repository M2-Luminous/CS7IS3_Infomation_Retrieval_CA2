The document states that although prostitution was obvious in the society even before the arrival of Unomoz personnel, with the arrival of thousands of soldiers in the country within the framework of the peace process, this phenomenon increased from that period. The report states that this increase is also due to the fact that the Unomoz personnel are earning more than Mozambican citizens, hence they are attractive to minors, who involve themselves in prostitution. [Begin Deputy UN Special Representative recording in English] It has been suggested that some Mozambican cities, where the incidence of Unomoz members involved with prostitutes was found to be greatest, have been regional centers of prostitution in successive periods during which foreign troops were present there. In those places, prostitution, including minors selling sex, has long been a feature of urban life. In addition, many observers agreed that patrons of the sex trade in Mozambique are not limited to Unomoz personnel. Nevertheless, it is evident that some Unomoz personnel stationed in some locations in Mozambique have indeed patronized prostitutes and that prostitution in those places has increased perceptibly since the arrival of Unomoz in large numbers. This increase in prostitution has negatively affected the quality of urban public life, and apparently in some instances generated some ill-feeling toward Unomoz personnel in some areas. It is also evident that some Unomoz personnel patronizing prostitutes sought the services of prostitutes thought by them to be minors. Now, the investigating team found that patronage of prostitutes, among them minors, by some Unomoz personnel occurred despite existing codes of discipline and the explicit instructions given to many members of the Unomoz to avoid all illegal sexual liaison with Mozambican women.
