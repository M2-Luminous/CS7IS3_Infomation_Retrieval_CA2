This apprehension was heightened by the failure of talks involving the UN representatives to establish a cease-fire between the Serbs and Muslims. The UN representatives' attempts failed because of Serb opposition to the removal of their heavy weapons and artillery from the area around the Bosnian capital. Despite the scale of the catastrophe of Saturday's [5 February] massacre, its unprecedented nature, and the innumerable sacrifices it claimed, stunning and horrifying people enormously, the UN representatives remain skeptical. They announced that it is difficult to examine the incident. Along with this stance, European countries are seen to be quite ambivalent, reluctant to condemn the Serbs for this savage and antihuman act and brutal threats. They continue to give conflicting assessments of possible strikes on Serb positions--even though the Serbs have violated the UN Security Council resolutions. That, ultimately, indicates a lack of consensus on the need to take serious steps. The United States has said it cannot assume sole responsibility for any action against the Serbs. This, while the European and American communities--with their own doubts and impotence--fail to consent to other countries, including those of the Islamic world, intervening to prevent massacres in Bosnia-Herzegovina from continuing. Many political experts say that even if the Western countries acted against the Serbs, this action would not be considered within the framework of a fundamental solution to the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. It would merely be a way of mitigating the pressure of public opinion. This, because the Europeans continue to step up their pressure on the Muslims to accept a compromise and the partitioning of Bosnia-Herzegovina anytime a possible plan for any measures against the Serbs is mentioned. The West's unjustified conduct, the contradiction in its words and deeds, and the vacillation in the stances of the EC and the United States indicate the unlimited decadence of ethical values prevailing over the West's policies. With such low ethical and moral values, Europe and the United States are nothing more than terminally ill patients with little time left until their demise.
