Dusan Kovacevic, the Bosnian Serbs' "defense minister," told AFP the problem was resolved peacefully late Tuesday at Osijek, near Ilidza, a western suburb of the Bosnian capital, after the units received orders from their military headquarters. "These arms were withdrawn deep into our territory, not to any particular destination, and will not be used at any point along the front unless the Moslems (Moslem-led Bosnian government forces) launch a general offensive against the Serbs," the general said. He denied reports in Sarajevo that the Serbs had moved the arms toward the Olovo front, 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of Sarajevo, where fierce clashes broke out between Serbs and Moslems in November and December. Journalists who witnessed the settlement said the soldiers had refused to turn in their weapons unless UN peacekeepers deployed along the front line. The confrontation began Sunday, in the run-up to the expiration of a NATO-imposed deadline to Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their weapons from around Sarajevo or put them under UN control by midnight GMT, or face air strikes. The recalcitrant units were based at Ilidza, Grbavica, the only part of central Sarajevo under Serb control, and in the northern part of the front lines.
