She was sure she could find a teaching job at a college, particularly at a time when education is the last choice for many university graduates. But Zhang, who holds a master's degree from Beijing Normal University, was greeted by so many recruiters saying "we only want men" that she went to a corner at the bustling fair, angry and frustrated and on the verge of tears. Zhang is not the only female who feels frozen out of job markets held for college seniors. More than half of the posts at the exchanges read "men only." Even occupations which are traditionally reserved for women, such as secretaries and teachers, are being taken by men. While China's hot economy is demanding well-educated talent, bosses are ready to reject qualified female applicants. And the problem is growing worse this year. One reason is the streamlining of staff in government and enterprises to improve efficiency. Also, some employers are reluctant to hire women because they think the women cannot go on business trips alone, cannot serve as business representatives abroad and are less career-minded once they get married and have children. Liao Aidong, who majored in textile engineering, an industry which is not hiring many people this year, said no one responded to her applications, while male classmates readily secured jobs in Beijing textile mills. Even women who graduate with "hot" degrees, such as computer programming and foreign languages, have to swallow their pride when men who didn't perform well in school are chosen over them by employers. The Beijing Foreign Studies University has 300 graduates this year, 60 per cent of whom are women. Nearly all the male graduates who wanted to stay in Beijing have signed contracts with employers, while less than half the women with the same desire have met with success. This is despite the fact that many of the women at the university do better on tests than the men. Some schools are now taking steps to give women an equal chance. The Beijing Foreign Studies University, for example, insists that a woman must be interviewed by a company before a man is recommended for an interview. Many schools have similar policies to persuade obstinate employers to hire women. But according to an official with the University of International Business and Economics (UIBE), this tactic is backfiring this year. Many employers are now saying that if females are forced on them, they'll stop recruiting altogether. Women at UIBE are told not to compete with men for the best jobs with the highest salaries or a chance to go abroad, according to school authorities. "Girls must lower their expectations," said an official with UIBE. But the situation is not always this downbeat. Some specialty areas are so short of qualified graduates that employers have no choice but to ignore the gender of applicants.
