The conversation took place around the marble table in the Belveder. The Polish president replied to questions from journalists Aleksandra Akinczo (ZNAD WILII), Rytis Sabas (LIETUVOS RYTAS), Mecislovas Sadovskis (EKHO LITVY), Algirdas Strumskis (TIESA), Josef Szostakowski (KURIER WILENSKI), Kazimieras Sliuzas (ELTA), Rimantas Varnauskas (LIETUVOS AIDAS), and Algimantas Zukas (RESPUBLIKA). [passage omitted] [Reporter] There are enemies of the Polish-Lithuanian treaty on both sides. One representative of the Lithuanian Union of Poles compared this treaty to the Molotov-Ribbetrop pact. Mr. President, what can you say about this? What gains will this treaty bring to the Polish minority in Lithuania? [Walesa] There has been much discussion, which means that the treaty is good. If the number of its supporter equals that of its enemies, the treaty is ideal. Let us take advantage of the possibilities that this treaty will present. When we speak about ethnic minorities in Europe, we cannot invent new standards. The past is weighing heavily on the treaty's enemies, as well as on those who represent the ethnic minority. They are still avoiding a different assessment. This is a peculiar quadrangle of a circle. Until the treaty is signed, we will not be able to settle other matters. Thus, let us get moving at last. Let us follow the standards established in Europe: Primarily, the openness of our countries that will help to open borders and remove obstacles feared by the minorities. If there is no openness, our relations concerning ethnic minorities may deteriorate. I do not know who wants the two nations -- the Lithuanians and the Poles -- to not reach a mutual agreement. We are even becoming ridiculous because of that. We are such close nations, and we are settling these most important matters with such delay. I do not think that any side would resort to discrimination. The latter leads to Yugoslavia. Neither party wants a Yugoslavia. Thus, let us be open and get down to work. Certainly, Lithuania can choose the Asian direction, or that through Poland. [Reporter] Mr. President, we would like to hear from you what definite effect this treaty will have on economic, cultural, and political relations between Lithuania and Poland, which you and President A. Brazauskas will sign in Vilnius? [Walesa] In former times, everything was imposed from above. You know that epoch. The one that is beginning now will be different: Political agreements only open possibilities and remove barriers to security. Life and people must make these political agreements effective, so that one could remove obstacles and overcome difficulties. We are trying to open our doors. Maybe, we are doing this incorrectly. Maybe, this should be done differently. However, we must accomplish the same what we did with other countries. The implementation of treaties by workers of culture, economists, and historians is a totally different issue. In short, a treaty means the opening of doors. Maybe, there will be some doors, but no one will walk through them. However, we, politicians, must open them. If it becomes obvious that we did too little, and that the minorities gain little from this treaty, we will change it. Demand will decide everything. [Reporter] Mr. President, excuse us for asking this question, which may be unpleasant to you. You say that you care about ethnic minorities. The Lithuanians in Poland stress their loyalty to this state. However, they are displeased to hear that, for example, this state lacks money to publish several thousand Lithuanian textbooks. Another example is that the Polish state imposes additional duties on building materials imported from Lithuania which are necessary for the construction of the Lithuanian cultural center. [Walesa] One could assess the aforementioned duties and other things as malevolent issues. Some people claim this. However, this is untrue. Certainly, some things are not planned, in this case, this Lithuanian cultural house which is being built by Lithuanians. This was not included in our plans. However, this is done with no evil purpose. I did not learn to be a president as well. The freedom team that came to work may have not noticed those problems, while some newspapers assessed these as malevolent activities. Both you and us have some matters that are simply arranged improperly. Should we adopt a new constitution and customs clauses with regard to Lithuania? Maybe, our dear neighbor would not feel any damage in that case, and you would not question me about it. Maybe, these things should be changed, but there are principles. However, I am pleading for one thing -- do not pass over to the enemy's ranks. Let us assess this as a misunderstanding. I believe, however, that the problem is quite different. [Reporter] Mr. President, you said at the first "Solidarity" congress, I suppose, 13 years ago that you must drive the horses you were given. We know that your current position is not very easy. Could you tell us how your relations with the Sejm and the government are developing? [Walesa] The problem does exist, but it lies elsewhere. Speaking about the complexity of the situation, I predicted that in advance. If we assess the situation in terms of my extreme desire for power, then my position is really difficult. However, I have never wanted to be president, and I have no desire to be one. I only wanted to fulfill a certain task. I wanted to overcome the former system that was bad to everyone. I wanted democracy, openness, and pluralism for everyone. When I was heard, the nation would go with me, and I would claim victory. My goal was to bring the country to the system we had planned. Certainly, now we have different concepts and various troubles. At one moment, there was such an opinion that the Polish president must not have any political backing, and that he must be equal with other people. I also thought so and did everything to renounce any political impediments. Therefore, I am having trouble today. Different interests are being manipulated. These are not only the people from the old system. They are not necessarily bad communists. Every one of them -- leftists, rightists, and centrists -- would like me to be with them. I console everyone and urge him or her to preserve the balance. That is why I do not please everyone. However, I am implementing this concept with consistency. People do not voice claims that I have no good initiatives. However, they are displeased with the fact that I do not implement those initiatives. They say that I have promised a few things but failed to fulfill them. Of course, I accomplished a lot. However, execution exceeds the limits of my possibilities. It is the government and the parliament which primarily engage in implementation. I am an executor in this political system. However, people care little about this. They say: We have elected you -- now you must deliver. My troubles have emerged due to the pressure from the system in which I happened to live. The vital question is as follows: There must be one powerful leader, a political party, and a presidential or a parliamentary system. As long as this question remains unanswered, I am the sole person loyal to my principles, and this does not cause any trouble. Certainly, I do not explain this, because primarily I am faithful to the principles which I promised to implement: To create a system and bring it into the country. Of course, one can make everyone listen to and follow the leader. One can also blind people through other measures: To incite and provoke them, or set them against each other. However, one must begin to create.... [Reporter] Mr. President, recently, the presidents of the three Baltic states put forward the initiative called 5 + 3 + 4 (Central European, the Baltic, and Visegrad group states). However, the Visegrad countries rejected this initiative. Why? [Walesa] We still seem to misunderstand each other. One used to say in former times -- let us unite into pacts of three, five, and ten. One could really expect success then. The new epoch is quite different -- if we open our borders, we must have regional cooperation, and not because Vilnius is closer than Washington. Life's demands rather than decrees are responsible for such regional cooperation. A similar problem arose during my conversation with Russian President B. Yeltsin. The Russians wanted to leave their factories at the former bases. I said: Mr. President, let us change this in the agreement so as to make our current economic cooperation tenfold larger. However, this depends on economic demand and cannot be imposed. I cannot impose cooperation on anyone if it is unprofitable. Do you, the Russians, want to mine gravel near Szczecin and ship it across Poland? Does not Russia have gravel? Therefore, I say, let us not do such things. I believe that we must agree on the principles and values that we would defend. We must say that the entire world will defend Lithuania's freedom, as well as that of Poland. The most important thing is that no one will attack, if we sign such an agreement, if we remove all dangers, and if we say that the nuclear power station is the matter of the entire world, or at least of Europe, and not only the internal problem of Lithuania or Poland. However, all of Europe has the right to check whether the nuclear reactor is good or bad. If it is bad, Europe has the right to demand its closure. Let us defend great principles and values. If such rights were observed in advance, there would be no problem of Yugoslavia, because it is said that everyone has the right to freedom. However, one's freedom must not pose any danger to the freedom of another person. This means that there are no possibilities for resolving problems by force. If someone does not observe these principles, he or she can be forced to do so. In this respect, there is no need to create what you are talking about. There is no need to conclude agreements, if there is no demand. If the economy requires them, let us allay these matters, so as to be able to resolve them in a natural manner. [Reporter] Mr. President, you have said that you want to continue your duties. We understand that you will take part in the upcoming elections. [Walesa] I still have two years. I see that the system for which I fought has not yet been created. If I really want to participate in the upcoming elections, I will really win them, because I always achieve what I want. [Reporter] The veto of the popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law and the refusal to confirm the finance minister are assessed as your new election program. What would be the key principles of your election campaign? Who would be your most powerful rival? [Walesa] I have enough time for the program. I have said that I want to create a system. By designing it, I show its faults and accomplishments. However, I set a challenge at the same time. We have the provisional Small Constitution. What can be the decision, if I say "no," and the government is unable to do anything. However, the government coalition says something different: We present you a name, and you (president) must approve it. Why? Under what law? That is why it is bad for both sides (president and the coalition). I do not want these principles to be transferred to the new constitution, which we are now drafting. Can I ignore the problem of constitutional amendments resolved in such an improper manner? I ask who has the right to change the Constitution and the system? There can emerge a casual majority coalition in a couple of hours, even of drunk people, that can change the system. Seeing all this, I am setting a challenge.... [passage omitted]
