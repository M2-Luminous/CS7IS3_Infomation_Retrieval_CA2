FR940425-2-00056 FR940425-2-00043 CoreStates Financial Corp.; Acquisition of Company Engaged in Nonbanking Activities CoreStates Financial Corp., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Applicant), has applied pursuant to Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and 225.23 of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 22.23) to acquire all of the voting securities of Rittenhouse Financial Services, Inc., Radnor, Pennsylvania (Company), and thereby engage in providing investment advisory services to trusts, estates, corporations, pension and profit sharing plans, registered investment companies, banks, thrifts, and individuals, including the exercise of investment discretion on behalf of individuals who do not qualify as institutional investors. Such activities will be conducted throughout the United States. Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity that the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. A particular activity may be found to meet the closely related to banking test if it is demonstrated that banks have generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity; or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form. National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors , 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y (49 FR 806 (1984). Applicant asserts that the proposed investment advisory services are permissible under 225.25(b)(4)(ii) and 225.25(b)(4)(iii). In particular, Applicant asserts that 225.25(b)(4)(iii) of the Board's Regulation Y permits the provision of discretionary portfolio investment advisory services to customers other than institutional customers, when such services are not provided in combination with brokerage services as described in 225.25(b)(15) of the Board's Regulation Y. See 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4)(iii). In addition, Applicant contends that previous Board orders have approved portfolio management services to individuals on a discretionary basis. See Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation , 68 Federal Reserve Bulletin 782 (1982); Credit Suisse , 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 160 (1987); Creditanstalt-Bankverein , 72 Federal Reserve Bulletin 63 (1982). In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that the performance of the activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit the public by enabling Applicant to provide a broader range of services to its customers and thereby enhance Applicant's ability to compete and expand its participation in the investment advisory business. Applicant also believes that the proposed activities will not result in any unsound banking practices or other adverse effects. In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the BHC Act. Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than May 16, 1994. Any request for a hearing on this application must, as required by 262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April 19, 1994. Jennifer J. Johnson, Associate Secretary of the Board. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9882 Filed 4&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6210&hyph;01&hyph;F
