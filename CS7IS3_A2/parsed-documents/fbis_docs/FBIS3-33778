[passage omitted] According to the agreement between the United States and Israel, any change in the free trade agreement requires prior consultations and agreement. U.S. sources promised Israeli representatives that Israel had no reason to be concerned. Officials in Jerusalem nevertheless fear that certain Israeli industries may be seriously affected by these changes. Israel has still not studied the changes in the rule of origin provisions; however, it seems that the Israeli textile industry, for example, could be badly hurt by the anticipated tightening of the rules. Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and Industry and Trade Minister Mikha Harish have sent letters to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and U.S. Trade Commissioner Kantor expressing concern about the recently proposed changes in the rules of origin, designed to maintain harmonious trade relations between the United States and the NAFTA countries and ease the load on U.S. customs. As a result of these changes, Israeli companies may be asked to pay customs on products previously exempt under the free trade agreement. The U.S. officials have not yet replied. The matter was also raised in the talks between Shohat and U.S. Trade Secretary Ron Brown in mid-January. [passage omitted] Officials in Jerusalem are worried because the proposal calls for comprehensive regulations stipulating, among other things, that whenever there is a discrepancy between various rules of origin and the NAFTA regulations, the latter will prevail. NAFTA regulations on rules of origin are tougher than those in the trade agreement with Israel. Officials in Jerusalem fear that one day they will find themselves facing faits accomplis.
