After three hours of ferocious fighting, members of the (Marko Praljic) battalion managed to disperse the enemy army. Three Muslim soldiers, including one Iranian mojahid, were killed on this occasion and their bodies have remained on the territory controlled by the HVO. A considerable quantity of arms was captured as well. At noon the Muslims began an attack in the region of Brezova Kosa and Krsic from the direction of Zeljezno Polje in the western sector of the Zepce front. The fighting is still under way and the defenders are repelling all the aggressor's attacks. The most difficult situation today is on the Maglaj front. After repulsing an attempted infantry spearhead into Croat villages in the Bosna river valley near Maglaj, members of the Zepce brigade launched a counterattack and succeeded in taking a very important strategic point from which their firepower can control access to the Natronka factory where the Muslims have been manufacturing arms for quite some time now.
