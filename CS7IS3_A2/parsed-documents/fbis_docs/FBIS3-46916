FBIS3-46916 "dreas003__a94019" FBIS-EAS-94-003-A Document Type:Daily Report 5 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Finance Ministry Considers Selling NTT Shares OW3012141993 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 Dec 93 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW3012141993 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] plans to include revenues from sales of government-held shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) in a draft budget for fiscal 1994. It is considering selling 500,000 shares. There is criticism that "the MOF places priority on selling NTT shares held by the government." However, the MOF appears to think this criticism will weaken because a ban on selling NTT shares is to be lifted at the end of fiscal 1993 and because it included the resumption of public capital increase in measures to deregulate the stock market, which the ministry recently announced. It will decide whether or not to sell the shares while carefully watching the trend of the stock market. If the MOF sells the shares, it will be the first time it has done so in six years. The ministry will put the revenues from the sales in the debt consolidation fund. Although the fund is for repaying national debts, part of it will be used for public works projects. The ministry plans to estimate the revenue amount by examining NTT share prices in the market. If the share price keeps to the level of the closing price at the Tokyo Stock Exchange on 22 December (which was 751,000 yen), the profit will be about 300 billion yen after a selling charge is deducted. The MOF hopes to spend part of the revenue on public works projects to shore up the economy. Nonetheless, it thinks that the stock market is in a severe situation. That is why it dropped plans last weekend to list Japan Tobacco Inc. shares on the stock market in the current fiscal year. Thus, it is still uncertain if the MOF will actually sell NTT shares. After giving up selling NTT shares in fiscal 1989, the government planned to sell 500,000 shares each year over a five-year period starting in fiscal 1991. However, because the stock market continued to be sluggish, it hesitated to sell the shares. In August 1992, the government announced the freeze on the sales of NTT shares in fiscal 1992 and 1993.
