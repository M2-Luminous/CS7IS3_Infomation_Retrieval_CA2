[Al-Zuray'i] We discussed matters pertaining purely to the movement and we also discussed the security situation, the people's suffering in the strip, and the economic blockade against our people. I believe that the hot security situation in Gaza is a result of the bad economic situation but Israel also is not unconnected with the disturbances and sedition. It helps foment internal conflict in the occupied territory by flooding the Strip with arms via "collaborators," but Palestine cannot be turned into another Afghanistan or Somalia because there is profound national awareness and the state of the political movement is good despite the fact that the people are in dire need of essential goods and normal living conditions. [Khashanah] How do you explain the growing phenomenon of liquidation of "collaborators" with the occupation? [Al-Zuray'i] This is a new phenomenon and it is exaggerated. I believe that under no circumstances should a gunman become magistrate, judge, and executioner. The collaborators can be classified into categories. There are those who are beyond reform and have crossed the point of no return, and there are those who got involved inadvertently or were wronged. Some of the latter could be returned to the national ranks or neutralized. At any rate, the situation in the Gaza Strip is difficult, like the other occupied areas. The cause of the difficulty is the Palestinian masses' frustration resulting from the Israeli procrastination on the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. [Khashanah] What is your estimate of the number of the Gaza Strip detainees? [Al-Zuray'i] The general estimate is over 10,000 detainees including 6,000 detainees from Gaza. That affects the people of the Strip. In our meeting with the Palestinian leadership in Tunis we concentrated on the need for a clear timetable and deadline for the release of the Palestinian revolution's detainees regardless of their organizations and affiliations because the PLO embraces all sectors of the Palestinian people. Without fulfillment of that objective there can be no meaningful agreement. [Khashanah] What was the leadership's answer? [Al-Zuray'i] There was official response and agreement with that view because the agreement would be worthless without the release of the detainees and prisoners. In fact that would be the only step that would ameliorate the agreement or make it less ugly. [Khashanah] What kind of relations exist between Fatah and the other factions which reject the agreement, in the Gaza Strip? [Al-Zuray'i] We and many cadres and leaderships of these factions in the Strip have the long struggle in common and we have had dialogues with them in prison and outside. We always maintained that the homeland is above all organizations. There is cooperation now in all fields, apart from the differences of opinion. There is field coordination at a level higher than the level of coordination outside the occupied territory. It is enhanced by the sense of responsibility demonstrated by all factions. [Khashanah] How would friction and conflict be avoided when Fatah becomes a ruling party and assumes power? [Al-Zuray'i] We have discussed these matters as Palestinian citizens with the parties concerned, especially the Islamic parties, at an early stage. There can be no doubt that many brother leaders and members of the factions at home have a clear vision. Now the common vision leans toward finding a clear national program that would answer all questions in the next phase. But so far there is no national program for the prospective Palestinian authority. We hope that, through joint meetings and seminars, we will be able to formulate an initial concept of a national program that would confirm the principles of democracy, independence of the judiciary, freedom of the press, human rights, and the rule of law. These are the principles on which there is Palestinian consensus. The situation at home will not stabilize without the fulfillment of these objectives as the main foundations of national authority. [Khashanah] Did you discuss the Palestinian draft constitution in the strip? [Al-Zuray'i] There is no crystallized final draft yet. The dialogue on it is continuing. All the Palestinian people should be consulted on it. [Khashanah] Did you and the leadership make any practical decisions regarding the state of the movement in the Strip? [Al-Zuray'i] Decisions were made on most of the issues we came to discuss with the leadership. We are waiting for the implementation of the recent Cairo agreement and we hope that will be done before the end of the month, as President 'Arafat told us. [Khashanah] What matters relating to the Strip were discussed? [Al-Zuray'i] Organizational matters, the security situation, and the people's suffering. [Khashanah] Do you believe that the phenomenon of liquidating the collaborators is likely to continue? [Al-Zuray'i] Negative aspects have appeared between members of the Palestinian people since 1936, between families and between tribes, resulting in many casualties. That is why we have fought that phenomenon and still do, strongly, and we hope that we will turn over that leaf quickly to protect the lives of these people. I believe that Palestinian justice will be fair to everyone and will bring to account everyone who collaborated with the occupation. That is why we say let us leave this matter to the Palestinian authority and national justice, for it to task those who did wrong and be fair to those who were wronged. We found the other factions responsive to that view. Those who carry out the liquidation operations do not take orders. They are youngsters under the age of 18. Their actions are usually based on personal views.
