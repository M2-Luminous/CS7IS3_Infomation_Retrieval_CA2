[Dinkelspiel] There is no doubt that a majority of Euro-MP's [members of the European Parliament] are in favor of enlargement. What is somewhat worrying me is that MP's might not reach the quorum to produce the required absolute majority. However, according to information in our possession, the outlook seems good. [Bernard] What would happen should the vote turn out negative? [Dinkelspiel] The whole enlargement process would be frozen. To be sure, the new Parliament would have the option of picking up the issue in the fall. But should enlargement be rejected this week, it would be because of institutional quarrels, and I cannot imagine how the issue could be settled within six months. [Bernard] Which changes would Sweden like to see implemented in European Union [EU] institutions within the scope of the 1996 revision of the Maastricht treaty? [Dinkelspiel] I do not think that it is very polite to discuss a club's statutes even before becoming a member. Anyway, it was made clear from the start that enlargement would take place according to the regulations currently in force. However, an EU enlargement to 20 to 25 members will require reforms, which smaller countries are especially interested in. The EU cannot have 30 commissioners, and its Parliament cannot consist of 1,000 members. [Bernard] Is it possible to simplify decisionmaking processes without decreasing the influence of smaller countries? [Dinkelspiel] I for one am not a federalist. But in a number of areas, such as the environment, I would prefer that decisions be made by simple majority rather than unanimity. [Bernard] Will the Scandinavian "bloc," i.e., Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Denmark, attempt to steer the EU in a particular direction? [Dinkelspiel] I do not think we will act as a bloc. The Spanish foreign minister recently noted that Spain's voting record at the United Nations has been closer to that of Sweden than that of other European countries. On the other hand, Scandinavian countries do have common values that they will uphold, such as environmental protection, social security, equality between sexes, and free trade. In the short term, I believe that the EU has a major role to play in two areas: the fight against unemployment and peacekeeping. [Bernard] Swedish public opinion, however, seems as yet not convinced of this. A majority remains opposed to EU membership. How do you plan to change their mind before the referendum, which is scheduled for November? [Dinkelspiel] First of all, we need to challenge a number of myths, such as the one that says we would be compelled to enter into a military union. But we also must go beyond the purely economic debate that has been dominant so far. Here, a crucial factor is the attitude of the left (social democrats), which must be more openly pro-European so that EU membership does not look like the right's pet project. [Bernard] Do you think the referendum's outcome will be positive? [Dinkelspiel] It is not going to be easy. Each and every supporter of EU membership will have to rise to the fight. But I do believe Sweden will say yes in the end.
