FR940512-2-00109 FR940512-2-00055 In addition to the Indemnity Agreement, in the event the Employer defaults on the Lease, the principals of the Employer (the Principals) have guaranteed (the Guarantee) the rental payments to the Plan for the duration of the Lease, including the Renewals. It is represented that as of September 2, 1993, the Principals had minimum net worth of approximately $2,600,000. 10. The independent fiduciary for the Swap, the Lease, the Indemnity Agreement and the Guarantee will be Earl W. Johnson (Mr. Johnson), a certified public accountant and an executive vice president over tax and financial planning with Lawhorn Johnson and Company, P.C. Mr. Johnson represents that he is independent of all parties to these transactions, and that he had no prior professional or personal association with any of the parties. Mr. Johnson also maintains that the fees received by him for serving in the independent fiduciary capacity in these transactions, combined with any other fees derived from the Employer or related parties will not exceed 1% of his annual income for each fiscal year that he continues to serve in the independent fiduciary capacity with respect to the transactions described herein. 11. Mr. Johnson states that he is qualified to serve in the independent fiduciary capacity for the Plan because of his professional experience which includes providing administrative services to qualified retirement plans, and handling real estate transactions. Specifically, with respect to his clients, Mr. Johnson has prepared retirement plan calculations, made investment projections and reviewed investment alternatives. Mr. Johnson has also reviewed audits of retirement plans. 12. Mr. Johnson represents that he has consulted with legal counsel regarding his ERISA fiduciary responsibilities and accepts and acknowledges these responsibilities as they relate to the proposed Plan transactions. Mr. Johnson also maintains that he has knowledge of ERISA and understands the fiduciary responsibilities under the law associated with qualified retirement plans. In his capacity as the independent fiduciary, he reviewed the Plan's assets with respect to the Swap and the Lease, and concluded that the Swap offers a significant premium to the Plan, and is in the best interest of the Plan participants. Mr. Johnson also states that the Lease offers a fair rental value to the Plan. According to Mr. Johnson, under the Lease terms, the Plan has the option to renew the Lease pursuant to the two Renewal options. As required by the Lease, the Condominium will be appraised every time that the Lease is renewed. Mr. Johnson represents that the Condominium will be appraised at the time it is finished and the Swap is completed. He further represents that as an additional safeguard the Condominium will also be appraised annually by an independent qualified appraiser. With respect to the Indemnity Agreement, Mr. Johnson represents that the Principals of the Employer have sufficient financial net worth to indemnify the Plan. Also, Mr. Johnson states that the Guarantee by the Principals of the Lease payments to the Plan during the initial Lease and the Renewal periods, is additional security for the Plan. As such, Mr. Johnson represents that the Swap and the Lease are also protective of the Plan and administratively feasible. The Condominium will be considered part of the fixed income portion of the Plan's portfolio, and when the value of the Condominium increases, there will be an offsetting reduction in existing fixed assets to maintain the proper asset allocation. The remaining Plan assets are represented by stocks and bonds. There are participant loans in the Plan, but these loans represent a very small percentage of the Plan's assets. 13. Mr. Johnson represents that the proposed transactions are administratively feasible, in the interest and protective of the Plan. Mr. Johnson states that the Swap is in the best interest and protective of the Plan because the Condominium has been appraised by an independent qualified appraiser at $750,000, and the acquisition of the Condominium will result in a significant premium to the Plan. Subsequently, the Plan will lease the Condominium to the Employer. The fair market value of the Condominium represents approximately 20% of the Plan's total assets. Mr. Johnson will monitor the Lease throughout its initial term of three years and during the two year Renewal terms. The Condominium will be appraised annually and at every Renewal, and the fair market rental will be determined by an independent qualified appraiser at each Renewal. The annual rental amounts will never be below $75,000, which is the annual rental amount for the initial year of the Lease. Furthermore, the rental payments have been personally guaranteed by the Principals for the initial term of the Lease plus the two Renewal terms. The Principals have also indemnified the Plan in the event that the Condominium is sold for an amount less than $425,000 during the initial term of the Lease and during the two Renewal terms. The Plan will incur no expenses as a result of the proposed transactions described herein. 14. In summary, the applicant represents that the transaction satisfies the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code because: (1) All terms and conditions of the Swap, the Lease, the Indemnity Agreement and the Guarantee are at least as favorable to the Plan as those the Plan could obtain in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (2) The fair market value of the Condominium will be determined by an independent qualified appraiser at the time the Swap transaction is consummated; (3) With respect to the Lease, the Rental Amount has been determined by an independent qualified appraiser, and will never be below $75,000, which is the fair market rental amount for the initial year of the Lease; (4) The Condominium will be appraised by an independent qualified appraiser each time that the Renewal option on the Lease is exercised; (5) The fair market value of the Condominium will at no time exceed 25% of the Plan's total assets; (6) The Lease is a triple net lease under which the Employer is obligated for all costs of maintenance and repair, and all taxes, insurance, utilities and condominium fees related to the Condominium;
