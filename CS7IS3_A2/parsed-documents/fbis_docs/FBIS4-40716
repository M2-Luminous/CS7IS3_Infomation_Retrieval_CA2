In his opinion, the idea suggested by Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev to set up a Eurasian alliance "should focus on current CIS integration difficulties rather than distract attention from them." He said it was good that the process of separation in the former USSR proceeded peacefully. "Fortunately, Russia had enough strength to avoid confrontation and bloodshed. Now, it is necessary to advance towards setting up a real commonwealth rather than a neutral community, a commonwealth where all its members be respected as sovereign and independent republics," he said. Speaking about Russia's peace-keeping efforts in CIS states, Kozyrev regretted the absence of appropriate legislation for that. "Regrettably, our new parliament has no time for such legislation. It finds it more exciting to discuss North Korea's nuclear program. The impression is that our members of parliament work on the principle that our chief concern is that there should not be another Pol Pot," Kozyrev said. He voiced puzzlement at the fact that the Federation Council is not ready to sanction a Russian peace-keeping operation in Abkhazia. "Whenever there is a vacuum, it is always filled. If not Russia, some other country will come to that region, and that will hardly be in Russia's interests," Kozyrev said.
