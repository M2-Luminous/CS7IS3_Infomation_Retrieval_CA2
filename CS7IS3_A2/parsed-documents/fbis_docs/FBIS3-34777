Following the Serbs shelling of a trade center in Sarajevo in late January which claimed the lives of 68 people and over 200 others were wounded, in a 10-day deadline last Wednesday the NATO urged the Serbs to withdraw their heavy arms from the vicinity of Sarajevo. It warned that in case the Serbs refrained from doing so NATO forces would strike them by air. Iran's permanent representative at the United Nations Kamal Kharrazi in his remarks at the open session of the Security Council said that the recent moves to lift the seige of Sarajevo fell short of expectations. He stressed that overall efforts should be made to ensure that all provisions of the ultimatum are met by the Serbs. "In the event the ultimatum is violated, either through further shelling or failure to fully withdraw the Serbian heavy weaponry by the deadline, the air strikes must be automatically initiated," he said. Kharrazi called on Security Council to allow Bosnia and those prepared to help the beseiged republic to take action under Article 51 of the UN Charter in individual and collective self-defence. "Under the present circumstances, the least the international community can do is to lift the siege of Sarajevo and other cities and to lift the unjust arms embargo against the republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina." He voiced concern over the efforts made by some powers to press the Bosnian Government to accept a so-called peace saying that it "will be the beginning of a more tragedy and ethnic cleansing." He stressed that imposition of any settlement on the Bosnian Government would be "militarily unenforceable and morally unacceptable to the international community."
