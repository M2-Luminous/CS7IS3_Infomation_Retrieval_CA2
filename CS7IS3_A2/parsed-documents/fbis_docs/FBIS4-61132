Is that right? Your ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent's conversation with Ruben Mirzakhanyan, leader of one of Armenia's most influential opposition parties, Ramkavar-Azatakan (the Democratic Liberal Party), began with this question. [Mirzakhanyan] I think that it is nonetheless only apparent calm. But one thing is indisputable: There has been a drastic decline in protest activity of late. [Topchyan] The president promised that a new constitution would be adopted this year. [Mirzakhanyan] I believe that the country's new fundamental law will be adopted within the year, and this means new parliamentary and presidential elections. [Topchyan] Armenia is virtually the only republic in the former Union where the parliament has been operating successfully for four years now and Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who has been the state's leader for as many years, is clearly not thinking of retiring. [Mirzakhanyan] I think that this is due to three factors: First, the militarily favorable development of events in Karabakh. Since early 1992 the Armenians have held the initiative in the Karabakh-Azerbaijani war. Imagine if the picture had been different. The second factor is that Armenia's leader, unlike the representatives of the new political wave in certain other independent states that were once USSR republics, is more restrained in both domestic and foreign policy. Third, for various reasons Armenia's parliament has not in its four-year activity been a major adversary of the executive, the president included. [Topchyan] How are events in Russia affecting life in Armenia? [Mirzakhanyan] Very directly. That is quite natural, since we are all heirs to the same political traditions. [Topchyan] Do you not think it rather phenomenal that effectively all the political forces in Armenia unequivocally favor alliance-partnership relations with Russia? [Mirzakhanyan] It would be incredibly hard for Armenia to build its future without close partnership relations with Russia. [Topchyan] What is your forecast regarding the probable development of political events in Armenia? [Mirzakhanyan] It depends directly on the changes under way in Moscow. If there are many unknown quantities in Russia's future, the same can be said about the future of Armenia.
