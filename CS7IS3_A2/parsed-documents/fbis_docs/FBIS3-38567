"Quite frankly, we still don't know who he is." Franco Rocchetta, chairman and foreign affairs spokesman of the Northern League, answers the telephone almost inaudibly from his home in Montello, where he is in bed with influenza. [Fuccaro] But do you want an alliance with Berlusconi or don't you? [Rocchetta] All I can say is that Berlusconi strikes me as a virtual politician. [Fuccaro] And what do you mean by that? [Rocchetta] I mean that from one day to the next, like a mushroom popping up after a shower, we have seen the emergence of a label called "Forza Italia" on a platform very similar to ours. But we are a force rooted in our territory, we have deputies who have made their presence felt, and how, in parliament. We have been the driving force for change. Can Berlusconi say the same of himself? [Fuccaro] Are you perhaps saying that he is a test-tube product? [Rocchetta] I prefer to put it like this. It is only fair that we should talk to him, and some sort of agreement is possible. [Fuccaro] However, Berlusconi claims that "Forza Italia" is the top party.... [Rocchetta] Hold on there, opinion polls are not the election result. [Fuccaro] True, but there are those in the League who think that Berlusconi's sole aim is to take possession of your electorate. In that case, how can you reach agreement with him? [Rocchetta] I don't know. For the time being these are only hypotheses. We neither bow down to him nor demonize him. [Fuccaro] But they also say that his entry into the fray has called the leadership of the freedom pole into question. [Rocchetta] To be frank, I don't think so. Not at all. It strikes me as too early to tell. [Fuccaro] Why should it be too early? [Rocchetta] We represent a real force, while he strikes me as not a bluff exactly, but a long shot. It's as if Miss Italy, in other words the League, were worried because one day a little girl, "Forza Italia," might carry off her beauty queen's crown. [Fuccaro] So, there's no comparison? [Rocchetta] Berlusconi, whom I hold in high esteem and respect, doesn't have the votes. And even if he had, he would have to prove himself a shrewd politician, just as he has been an "enterprising" entrepreneur. [Fuccaro] But do you need Berlusconi as an ally? [Rocchetta] For the time being he would appear to be more of a potential ally. I'll give you an example from history. Let's take the Americans: During the second world war, they had allies similar to themselves, such as the Australians and Canadians, against the national socialists, but they also had the Spanish, who were Franco-ist, the Brazilians, who were fascist, and the Soviets as well. [Fuccaro] Are you in the League prepared to line up with all those who are against the progressive alliance? And do you see the national Alliance as forming part of this force as well? [Rocchetta] I would not talk about agreements with Fini's movement. What I have in mind is something that will avoid a war between north and south, considering that a lot of people in the south have decided to vote for the right for want of anything better. We must keep an eye on movements in that camp.
