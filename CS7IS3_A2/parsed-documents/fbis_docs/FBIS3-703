These plans were contained in a communique signed by General (Molanda Jean), who says that the Zairian opposition has armed men who are ready to militarily defend the institutional order of the Sovereign National Conference. It will be recalled that recently Jacques Matanda, an Executive Committee member of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition, announced his party's intention to lead an armed struggle in Zaire to overthrow President Mobutu. He said at the time that he had fighters based in Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, and Angola.
