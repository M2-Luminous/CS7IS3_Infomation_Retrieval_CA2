Jorge Constantino, leader of the Belisario Dominguez Regional Union of Rural Small Landowners, flatly said that "appointing one commissioner is a mistake. There should be several commissioners, not just one." He added that his comrades hope Madrazo, "unlike Manuel Camacho Solis, who left his job incomplete, will work seriously to solve the problem once and for all. We are in no condition to keep waiting." Speaking of Jorge Madrazo, Constantino said "he treated us badly as president of the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) during some incidents in Altamirano Municipality. This, however, is not the time to chide him. We hope he will change his attitude." Constantino's opposition to the appointment notwithstanding, he expressed his desire that "Madrazo will act impartially with justice on his side to expedite a solution to the conflict," emphasizing that "some of my associaites are disappointed by Madrazo's actions in Altamirano" earlier this year. The cattle ranchers' leader said the attitude taken by Madrazo in those days could spark "negative reactions by cattle ranchers and landowners in the conflict area." He emphasized the following: We hope the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] accepts the new commissioner appointed by President Carlos Salinas, because "if he is the cure for what ails us, go ahead. We do not care who solves it." The leader criticized former Commissioner Manuel Camacho's work by saying: "I do not know what positive role he played because the EZLN refused to accept the government's proposals. Constantino insisted that Camacho's job was left incomplete. Francisco Lopez Ardinez, leader of the Ocosingo Cattle Ranchers Association, said his comrades were "not too pleased with the appointment." The leader of cattle ranchers in Ocosingo, one of the municipalities most affected by the armed conflict, angrily and disapprovingly added: "I would rather say nothing because the best opinion is the one that remains unspoken, the one that is interpreted only."
