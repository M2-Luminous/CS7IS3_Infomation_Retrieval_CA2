Governor He Zhiqiang addressed the meeting, stressing that all local authorities in the province must further intensify family planning, tighten control over population growth, improve the quality of the population, and strive hard for the sustained and wholesome economic development of the province. In his speech, He Zhiqiang first iterated the necessity of correctly evaluating the situation in family planning work in the province. He said that over the past few years, party committees and governments at all levels in this province have conscientiously implemented instructions prescribed in the relevant documents issued by the central authorities and the State Council, as well as Yunnan Province's regulations on family planning, and have introduced a stable policy toward child bearing, thus basically checking the trend of excessively high population growth. However, we must also be clearly aware that our province is facing a grim situation regarding population growth. At present, we are in the third baby boom, with the population of married women of child-bearing age continuing to increase. In addition, our province has scarce human resources to attend to family planning at the grass-roots level, and birth control is particularly difficult in minority nationality areas and impoverished areas. Therefore, we are undertaking very arduous tasks. He Zhiqiang pointed out that the population issue is both a social and economic issue. Since reform and opening up, our province has enjoyed relatively rapid economic growth. From 1989 to 1992, our province's gross industrial and agricultural output value increased by a wider margin than the average standard in the country. However, because of excessive population growth, our province's aggregate per-capita economic growth is 14 percentage points lower than the national average. Therefore, local governments at all levels must ensure that the principle of paying attention to both production and population growth is embodied in strategic planning and actual work. We must carry out family planning with real earnest as if we are dealing with the issues of economic construction, reform and opening, and social progress so as to ensure a harmonious balance between population growth and economic and social development. [passage omitted] During the meeting, Vice Governor Huang Bingsheng delivered a speech entitled: Sum up Experiences, Make Persistent Efforts, and Lifting our Province's Family Planning Work to a New Level. Liang Jinquan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, presided over yesterday's meeting. Also present at the meeting were Yang Ming, vice chairman of the provincial people's congress standing committee; Chen Liying, vice chairwoman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference provincial committee; and former leading persons of the provincial authorities, (Gao Zhiguo) and Li Guiying.
