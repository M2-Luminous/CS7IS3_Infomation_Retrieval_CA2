As for the counterforce potential of Russia's strategic nuclear forces, at 3,000-3,500 warheads, as previously at 10,000-13,000 warheads (initial level) or 5,000-6,000 warheads (START I Treaty), it is indeed far less than that of the U.S. strategic nuclear forces. The change in the structure of Russia's strategic nuclear "triad" is a most important aspect of the START II Treaty and has far-reaching consequences. At a time of strategic offensive arms cuts, the question of shaping the optimum structure for the nuclear "triad" that Russia will have at its disposal in the early 21st century acquires particular significance. Approximately 60 percent of Russia's nuclear might (number of warheads) is currently concentrated in silo-based ground-launched or road- and rail-mobile ICBM's, 30 percent is on missile-carrying submarines, and 10 percent is carried by strategic aviation. The U.S. nuclear "triad" currently looks as follows: 25 percent ground-launched ICBM's (silos only), 55 percent submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and 20 percent free-fall bombs and all types of cruise missiles. In accordance with the average figures laid down by the START II Treaty, by the year 2003 both sides will have approximately the following structure in their strategic nuclear forces -- 15-30 percent ground-launched ICBM's, 50-55 percent on submarines, and 15-35 percent on aircraft. As, for instance, Academician R.A. Golosov of the Russian Federation Academy of Natural Sciences and certain other specialists claim, the United States will in practice retain the existing correlation of strategic nuclear forces within the "triad" framework, whereas Russia will be forced to sharply alter the structure of its nuclear "triad," weakening its main component -- ground-launched strategic weapons. In R.A. Golosov's opinion, implementation of the treaty will damage the country's interests from both the military-strategic and economic viewpoints. From these standpoints the START II Treaty can be seen as inequitable and as failing to ensure equality in counterforce potential, thereby not promoting the maintenance of strategic stability in relations between Russia and the United States. It is no secret that implementation of the START II Treaty will indeed leave the U.S. side with a number of advantages -- specifically in counterforce potential. But this situation also existed in the past, and has not been eliminated by any of the previous treaties, including START I. A positive aspect of the new treaty is that it creates conditions under which the U.S. interest in building up its counterforce potential is significantly diminished both by reducing the number of U.S. warheads capable of hitting defended precision targets, and by Russia's reducing the number of targets on its territory which would have been most attractive to a counterforce strike -- primarily, heavy ICBM's. The Russian side is also reducing its counterforce potential, since it too will pledge to eliminate a certain number of missiles with the ability to strike defended targets and with the possible ability, in the U.S. side's opinion, to be used in a first strike. From the standpoint of the prospects for the nuclear disarmament process there is a clear possibility in the very near future for a further change to the structure of the nuclear "triad" which could be initiated -- for various reasons -- by both the U.S. and Russian sides. Leading Russian specialists in the strategic stability sphere and experienced military diplomats are, in particular, not ruling out the emergence of a U.S. proposal for a further stage of disarmament, comprising further cuts in or the total elimination of ground-launched missiles. This proposal has some attractive reasoning behind it. We understand, for instance, that first counterstrike missiles would be targeted exclusively on naval and air bases and other important military installations and would pose less of a threat (by excluding the Strategic Rocket Forces) of destroying civilians and land ecosystems. But this step is unacceptable to Russia because of the qualitative superiority of the U.S. naval component over the Russian naval component (as already mentioned above). Consequently, Russia needs to retain its land-based component -- that is, the Strategic Rocket Forces. With a view to equalizing the combat survivability [ustoychivost] of Russian and U.S. strategic submarines -- which would enhance overall strategic stability -- it would be expedient for Russia to propose to conclude an agreement with the United States to restrict ASW systems along the lines of the ABM Treaty. In connection with a number of articles in recent months it would be a good idea to talk separately about the need to preserve such a component of the Strategic Rocket Forces' ground-based grouping as mobile missile systems. Since Russia is allowed to increase the number of these installations under the START II Treaty, these are the systems that have been particularly "under fire" from the media. The concern felt by the people writing these critical articles for the fate of Russia's strategic nuclear arms is entirely understandable. Nonetheless, I would like to object to many of the points raised in these articles. The usual argument cited in disputes by supporters of the complete retention of silo-based ICBM's is the claim that a missile in a silo that can be prepared for firing in the space of one minute and has protection up to 100 kg per square centimeter is a more reliable weapon than a mobile missile that takes on average around an hour to prepare for firing and is protected up to 1 kg per square centimeter. We should dwell on these figures. The accuracy of modern missile systems is such that a silo-based missile with a protection level of 100 kg per square centimeter (the silo's coordinates will be known) is guaranteed (with a probability of close to 100 percent) to be hit by a single megaton-class nuclear munition. According to the research done by relevant Russian Federation Defense Ministry organizations (arguments in the newspapers never usually worry about checking if their results were correct or their methodology appropriate), in order to hit a single road-mobile missile system an enemy would have to use more than 10 such nuclear munitions to cover the entire potential deployment region (position area). A mobile system's survivability is ensured not only by the size of the position area, but also by choosing terrain with the requisite camouflage and protective qualities, and by camouflaging the system itself -- something that people often forget to take into account. Modern mobile systems can travel over roadless terrain and not merely, as is often claimed, on metaled roads -- in other words, they are not just "road"-mobile. Road-mobile systems are only "vulnerable" to a surprise "nuclear strike" by U.S. submarines when the mobile systems are at their garrisons, as U.S. President George Bush insisted during the negotiations. But even in this instance, if there were a rise in tension in the world -- and much more so if there were a threat of nuclear attack -- road-mobile systems could be moved out of their garrisons into their combat position areas. Consequently, the survivability of mobile systems is not lower but actually considerably higher than that of silo-based systems. In this connection it would seem logical to give up silo-based missiles. But if the launch command (for a counterstrike on our part) were given in good time, the silo-based missiles would escape an enemy strike thanks to their high level of combat readiness -- in other words, the missiles would leave the silos before the impact of the nuclear explosion of enemy warheads came into play. This, needless to say, is if it proved possible to carry out a counterstrike. If not, then this is yet another argument in favor of mobile systems. Moreover, mobile systems allow for different basing modes [formiruyut mnogovariantnost], which strengthens deterrence. Admittedly, silo-based missiles require less expenditure than mobile missiles -- they are more resistant to sabotage and to the use of precision nonnuclear weapons. But why do we need to view one basing mode as an alternative to another? The optimum structure for the Strategic Rocket Forces, ensuring reliable deterrence under different strategic situations with different amounts of economic and material expenditure, is to combine silo-based and road-mobile missile systems, which it is planned to preserve within the Strategic Rocket Forces after 2003 -- provided, of course, that financial considerations do not alter the situation. The view that "it is not difficult to knock out a mobile system" and that it would take overpressure of only 4-5 kilopascals to topple one over is known to be incorrect. Overpressure of 4-5 kilopascals (0.04-0.05 kg per square centimeter) in a nuclear shock wave propagated through the air merely corresponds to a mass airflow velocity of around 40 km/hour. Such a small level of overpressure poses a threat only to glass windows. Overpressure an order of magnitude (more than 10 times) greater would be needed in the nuclear shock wave propagated through the air in order to topple a road-mobile transporter-erector-launcher and its missile, and then only if the nuclear munition exploded precisely at right-angles to the launcher, rather than at an acute target angle [tochno na traverze ustanovki, a ne na ostrykh kursovykh uglakh]. This pressure in the shock wave corresponds to a gas flow velocity of more than 300 km/hour. It is interesting to note that in the late eighties the official U.S. position at the START talks boiled down to a bilateral ban on the deployment of mobile land-based strategic missile systems. This was due to the U.S. side's doubts about the ability of national means of verification to detect the deployment of these missiles and by the special approach taken by Congress -- for a whole host of reasons -- toward approval of the program for the development [sozdaniye] of mobile missile systems in the United States. But, first and foremost, the U.S. position was due to the U.S. reluctance to see an overall improvement in the combat survivability of the USSR's strategic nuclear forces (this was not a major problem for the United States itself because of the existence of a powerful and, to all intents and purposes, equally "mobile" sea-based component in its strategic nuclear forces). Ultimately, the U.S. position shifted in favor of an agreement to the deployment of single-warhead road-mobile missile systems, on condition that measures were implemented to verify the number of deployed missiles in this class and, by agreement, the number of such missiles by type -- which was to all intents and purposes carried out under the START II Treaty. Here we can note that criticism and a continual desire to argue have become part and parcel of our political life. This is natural for our life today, but we need -- at least in some measure -- to retain our consistency and objectivity. Otherwise we will find ourselves in a situation where a U.S. agreement to mobile systems will cause justifiable suspicion about their motives from some of our experts, while a failure to agree on their part will produce no less justifiable doubts from other experts as regards the competence of the Russian delegation to the talks. We can also note the contradictory nature of the approaches taken by the Americans. When the official U.S. position was to ban road-mobile missile systems, a group of U.S. experts drew up some very noteworthy recommendations for their delegation members: -- since mobility is the most effective means of enhancing the survivability of strategic missiles during a nuclear first strike, the negotiations with the Russians should not raise the question of a total ban on them, leaving open the possibility of the United States' developing this component for the land-based grouping of its strategic nuclear forces; -- under no circumstances should a situation be created in which the combat survivability of road-mobile missile systems is even slightly diminished as a result of demands to allow the sides access to accurate information on their deployment and on the observance of the treaty restrictions on the number of land-based mobile missiles. It was thought sufficient to stipulate merely the term, acceptable to both sides, of "cautious" on-site inspections and the utilization of national means of verification, provided that the side undergoing inspection retains all the advantages relating to the difficulty of determining the precise location of the missiles at any specific time. In conclusion, I would like to note that we can already make a confident forecast about the existence of different approaches to the way in which the treaty will be seen by deputies, different factions, Defense Ministry representatives, and so forth. Obviously, there is a desire on the part of many military experts as a whole to assess the treaty as a relatively isolated phenomenon in international life and to look only at its military-strategic and military-political aspects. At the same time, the attitude taken by the corps of deputies to the START II Treaty will reveal a closer linkage with Russia's domestic life and with the voters' direct interests -- and this attitude, despite the extensive discussion of the treaty's provisions in the press, has not yet been finally formulated. It is likely that in the course of preparations for the START II ratification hearings, the corps of deputies will demand that the problems relating to the multifaceted and, perhaps, contradictory impact of the START II Treaty's implementation on the development of the political, economic, and social processes under way in Russia be clarified. Attention will most probably be fixed on issues such as the reasons for the positive assessment of the treaty (and even, in a number of cases, the lobbying for it) by representatives of the military-industrial complex and the professional military; the correlation between the treaty's provisions and the emergent system of new state policy and our sphere of national interests; the treaty's impact on the pace and direction of scientific and technical progress in Russia, on the elaboration of new advanced technology, on the implementation of our national space program, and on the closure or adaptation [rasformirovaniye ili pereprofilirovaniye] of existing military educational establishments; the economic and environmental consequences for specific regions, the cost of implementation, and so forth. The corps of deputies will only take an objective view of the ratification of the START II Treaty if issues of interest to a wide range of the Russian population -- rather than just those to which military specialists and diplomats are trying to restrict themselves -- are discussed. Thus, the range of problems which it will be necessary and sufficient to resolve in order to reach a decision on the treaty remains very vague and is tending to expand. The emergent situation and the increased distrust of "departmental" views which the new Duma may follow the Supreme Soviet in expressing are in line with the realities of political life in Russia, will be transient (as the experience of other countries shows), and will focus attention yet again on the need to improve expert assessment of the decisionmaking process within the framework of the formation of our new democratic institutions. At the same time, in purely military terms it is clear that, in order to reliably deter any aggressor, it will be necessary to preserve the triad in the structure of Russia's strategic nuclear forces (the Strategic Rocket Forces plus sea-launched and air-launched strategic nuclear systems) and a rational structure for the Strategic Rocket Forces -- silo-based and road-mobile missile systems. Only this kind of structure will be able to have the requisite combat readiness, survivability, and military flexibility with the optimum financial expenditure in the foreseeable future. The expenditure point is of no little importance to Russia. The switch to a dyad (Strategic Rocket Forces plus sea-launched strategic nuclear forces or some other combination) is for Russia -- and this cannot be said of the United States -- unjustifiable for economic and efficiency reasons. Moreover, statements about a dyad are, as a rule, restricted to the most general arguments and are not backed up by any kind of serious calculations. Russia's main task in the context of strategic offensive arms reduction is to further improve its strategic nuclear forces, not least as regards enhancing the operational safety of aviation missile systems. If the START II Treaty is ratified and the structure and components of our strategic nuclear forces are improved, Russia will have a sufficient deterrent potential and will not be left "defenseless in the face of the threat of nuclear blackmail." A necessary condition for this is the implementation of an armaments and military hardware development program that meets the demands of Russia's military doctrine, the present-day political and strategic situation in the world, and the real level of military danger to our country. Only in this event will the Russian eagle be able to hang on to its nuclear sword, which plays a key role in protecting Russia's national interests and actual integrity -- at least until such time as the economy and domestic stability become effective components in our national might.
