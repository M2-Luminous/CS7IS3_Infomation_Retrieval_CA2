Ham Myong-chol, the Foreign Ministry's director-general for international organizations, said the government's regret was contained in a message it delivered to the Amnesty International through the Korean Embassy in London. The government pointed out in the letter it was not desirable that AI published such a report at a time when follow-up measures were being taken in the country to better institute the democratic system. "It seems that AI was not fully aware of the new government's democratization policies and that it observed Korea's human rights conditions from the past's biased point of view," Ham said. He said it was especially regrettable that AI prepared the report based only on the statements by those involved and their families. The official said the instances cited in the report were cases of actual law violations such as espionage activities. "There can be no political prisoners nor any acts of torture in Korea since the birth of the civilian-led government," Ham said.
