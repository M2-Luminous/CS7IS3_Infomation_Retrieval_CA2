Other villagers considered the keeping of the animal "inauspicious". Three years have passed and Puqung's sow has given birth to 15 piglets. He sold the sucklings and earned 2,000 yuan. Instantly, Puqung's success became the talk of the hamlet and spawned keen followers. By raising and selling pigs, farmers in Targyai Village are able to buy chemical fertilizers and new furniture to decorate their homes. In recent years, more and more farmers like Puqung have emerged in Xigaze County. Their interest is no longer confined to cattle and sheep. Farmers living in the middle reaches of the Nyang Qu River of Bainang County used to regard miles of marshland there as wasteland. Now they have transformed the swamps into duck-raising farms. Many have earned more than 10,000 yuan. Xigaze is one of the grain baskets in Tibet. More than half of the autonomous region's grain is harvested there. The potential, however, has not been fully tapped. One saying describes the local people as "sitting on top of a mountain of grain, starving." As China's burgeoning market economy has reached this remote area, Tibetan farmers are eyeing a world that is more than highland barley, cattle and sheep. Out in the wide, open fields of Xigaze stretch patch after patch of lovely vegetables. The plastic-film covered greenhouses in farmers' courtyards are also green with vegetables even in the dead of winter. On highways are carts of fresh vegetables on the way to market. Barley for brewing beer and some exotic stock from South America have found their way into the fields on the roof of the world. The growth of animal breeding and planting has broadened the farming structure and food varieties of Tibetan farmers, who are earning more with a diversified economy. Last year, farmers in Gyangze and Bainang Counties earned more than half their income through breeding and planting.
