The report enumerates shocking examples and statistics. We have reprinted the report here. Its original title was: Some Foreign-Invested Enterprises Seriously Encroach on the Legitimate Rights and Interests of Workers.) The meeting of the presidium of the Second Session of the 12th All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which concluded not long ago, analyzed labor relations in foreign-invested enterprise and felt deep concern about how some foreign-invested enterprises had violated relevant Chinese laws and regulations, and had seriously encroached on the legitimate rights and interests of workers. It hoped that the departments concerned would attach importance to and concern themselves with this issue. At present, 153,000 foreign-invested enterprises have been approved on the Chinese mainland, of which 47,000 enterprises, employing more than five million workers, have been completed and put into operation. On the whole, the labor relations in foreign- invested enterprises are stable, and most foreign-invested enterprises operate and organize production according to the law, but there are some quite serious labor-relations problems in some foreign-invested enterprises. According to surveys recently conducted by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, there are five conspicuous problems: Safety Neglected, Labor Conditions Poor 1. The labor and living conditions of workers are very poor. Even the most basic labor-protection measures in safety and sanitation are lacking. Accidents occur frequently and the safety of workers' lives is not guaranteed. Surveys conducted by provincial and city trade unions in Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, and Zhejiang show that in many foreign-invested enterprises -- especially some labor-intensive enterprises for manufacturing plastics, toys, shoes, and textiles -- the workshops are crowded with people and equipment, and are hot and sultry. The air there is polluted, and the noise far exceeds permitted levels. Zhuhai carried out a survey in seven foreign-invested enterprises and found that the levels of such toxic gases as benzene, toluene, and dimethyl benzene in the air exceeded national standards by eight to 10 times. The quarantine departments in Xiamen carried out tests on the air-borne dust content at 21 points in 11 foreign-invested enterprises, and found that permitted standards were exceeded at 14; air-borne toxic gases were tested at 23 points, at which permitted standards were exceeded at 18; and noise volume was tested at 69 points, with permitted standards exceeded at 33. A nonmetallugical limited company in Fuzhou carried out open operations, long- prohibited in China, at its pyrophyllite pencil stone crushing section. The dust concentration exceeded national standards by more than 100 times. Shenzhen checked the health check-up forms of 260 staff and workers in foreign-invested enterprises and found that 46 of them suffered from anaemia or had abnormalities in white blood cells or blood platelets, or had warning indications of other diseases in their blood. What is even more serious is that some foreign-invested enterprises have ignored production safety, as well as China's labor protection laws and regulations. Serious man-made industrial accidents occur often and the safety of the workers' lives is not ensured. In a tableware company that employs 400 workers in Xiamen, 38 industrial accidents have occurred since it started operation four years ago and 39 workers had their fingers crushed. Recently, two large fires occurred in Shenzhen and Fuzhou in less than a month, resulting in the deaths of 144 people. Insult, Punishment, and Beating 2. Workers are insulted, punished, or beaten, and their personal rights are encroached upon at will. Some foreign-invested enterprises do not respect minimum human rights, ignore China's laws, and use extremely brutal and backward management methods. Some enterprises have established rules forbidding workers to go to the toilet, to drink water, or to see doctors during work hours, and offenders are asked to stand before the others wearing a placard. A shoe plant in Putian, Fujian, punishes workers by asking them to stand in the rain, stand in the sun, or leap like frogs. A foreign management supervisor at the Shenmei Household Necessities Company in Shenyang found that a glass item had not been cleaned properly. He went as far as forcing the worker concerned to lick it with his tongue. A Taiwan businessman in Guangdong even punished several dozen members of a work team for a mistake made by only one of them, asking them to kneel on the floor. In 1993, case after case of male "security" personnel illegally searching women workers were found in Tianjin and Qingdao. A restaurant run by a Japanese businessman in Shanghai once even illegally asked women workers to take off all their clothes during a search. Some foreign-invested enterprises even employed "supervisors" and "foremen" to serve as roughnecks. Working Extra Hours 3. Workers are compelled to work extra hours and labor quotas are set beyond the bodily strength of the workers. The eight-hour work day is the most basic right and interest the working class all over the world has struggled to achieve. The relevant laws and regulations in China also include explicit provisions on festivals, holidays, and days off. In quite a few foreign-invested enterprises, however, these legitimate rights and interests of workers have been willfully violated. In August last year, the Guangdong Provincial Labor Bureau carried out a survey in 17 foreign-invested enterprises in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Dongguan. It discovered that work hours at most of these enterprises were 10 to 12 hours daily, and there were no Sundays or days off. The Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions carried out a survey in 105 foreign-invested enterprises and discovered that with the exception of seven, in which the workers work three shifts, all the rest asked their workers to work extra hours. An enterprise even asked workers to work 36 hours at a stretch. Some foreign-invested enterprises increase workers' labor quotas at will. In a Sino-Japanese joint-venture watch company in Zhuhai, the labor quota per worker per shift in the the workshop turning out second hands is fixed at 4,000 pieces, while the quota set in Japan is only 2,500. Wages Are Deducted, in Arrears, and Embezzled 4. Wages are on the low side, and the wages and overtime pay of workers are deducted, in arrears, and embezzled at will. Regulations in China state that the wages of workers in foreign-invested enterprises are not to be less than 120 percent of the average of those of state-owned enterprises with similar conditions of the same trade in the same locality. However, the wages of workers in many foreign-invested enterprises are on the low side, and some of them are even lower than the lowest local wage standard. In Shenzhen's Shekou Industrial Zone, for example, the Kaida Enterprise Company Ltd, which employs more than 1,300 people, pays workers only five to seven yuan per day, nearly half the lowest wage standard of 11.2 yuan per day in 1993 as announced by the Shenzhen City Government. According to a survey carried out in 75 foreign-invested enterprises in the Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou Special Economic Zones [SEZ], the lowest wage standard of workers in 41 enterprises is lower than that published by local governments of the SEZ's. These enterprises account for 55 percent of the surveyed total. The lowest wages of workers are only 140 yuan a month. Not Signing Contracts and Not Fulfilling Contracts 5. Workers are not recruited openly, but at will. Labor contracts are not signed with workers and signed labor contracts are not implemented strictly. Some foreign-invested enterprises do not sign labor contracts with workers. As a result, workers' jobs are not safeguarded, the workers are not insured against unemployment, and workers' legitimate rights and interests are not protected by law. The Qingdao City Federation of Trade Unions carried out a survey in 48 foreign-invested enterprises and found that 11 had signed labor contracts with only some workers, and four had not signed any labor contracts at all. In 1992, Shenzhen carried out a general inspection on enforcing labor laws, made selective examinations among 280,000 workers and 205 enterprises, and discovered that 17 percent of workers had not gone through any labor formalities. The number of foreign-invested enterprises in the Shantou SEZ and Zhuhai which have not signed labor contracts accounts for 70 and 90 percent, respectively, of the total of such enterprises. Although some foreign-invested enterprises sign labor contracts with workers, the rights and obligations of the two sides are not on an equal basis. The contents of some contracts clearly violate the law, while those of others are self-contradictory. In the contracts of a joint-venture enterprise in Shanghai, there are articles restricting the time for workers to go to the toilet, stating the number of years during which workers may not fall in love with others, and giving enterprise management the power to dismiss any worker who does not follow the arrangements for working extra work hours. The labor contracts of a large restaurant in Shanghai had two versions, in Chinese and English, but the contents of these two versions were completely different. The boss let the workers read the Chinese version, but asked them to sign the English one. Before the probation period was over, some workers could no longer stand the illegal practices of using detectors to search them or to search their bags, and wanted to terminate their contracts although they had to forfeit 340 yuan of cash pledge as stated in their Chinese contracts. However, the administration of the restaurant took out the English versions of the contracts, which stated that the workers had to pay 5,000 yuan in compensation, in addition to the cast pledge. A Shenyang enterprise, which was entirely owned by a businessman from the Republic of Korea, took advantage of the six- month probation period for new workers. It recruited workers secretly, dismissed them in less than six months, and recruited other workers in a bid to avoid signing labor contracts or paying workers' insurance fees. At present, most foreign-invested enterprises recruit young workers, then dismiss them within a few years. In reality, this is to shift the responsibility for paying workers' pensions onto society, and will constitute a problem for China in the future. Work Stoppages, Strikes, and Go-Slows Owing to frequent conflicts between labor and capital in some foreign-invested enterprises and because of tense labor relations, some unexpected events have occurred, such as suspension of work, strikes, and large numbers of people applying for an audience with the higher authorities to appeal for help. They have affected social stability and security. In 1991, the Shanghai municipal arbitration organs handled 70 cases of major labor disputes at foreign-invested enterprises; in 1992, the number increased to 111. In Fujian Province, the number of major labor disputes occurring at foreign-invested enterprises in 1993 was 582 cases more than in 1991, an increase of 82.7 percent. In Shenzhen from January to May 1993, there were 185 cases of large numbers of workers applying for an audience with the higher authorities to appeal for help, as well as six strikes, with more than 100 workers taking part in each. Twelve cases of work stoppages or go-slows occurred in the Dalian Economic and Technology Development Zone in the first half of 1993.
