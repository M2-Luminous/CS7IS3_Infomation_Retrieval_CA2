Galazov thinks that the Federation Council will accomplish its historic role if it resolves the artificially created problems associated with the confrontation of the regions. "It is the republics that form the basis for Russian federalism and reducing them to the level of the other components of Russia may lead to an intensification of separatist sentiment and the disintegration of the Russian Federation," the head of North Ossetia declared.
