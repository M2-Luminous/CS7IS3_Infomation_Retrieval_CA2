Imset: "Military Determined To Crush Rebellion by Force"] [Text] Ankara--Turkey's military commanders, or rather those who are commanding all state policy out of the Southeast, have finally clarified their position in public: a military solution to the Kurdish problem. Sabah's prominent columnist Hasan Cemal on Wednesday reported the highly interesting results of a meeting he had with the most senior security officials in Diyarbakir. Cemal identifies his hosts as members of "the entire state." These are State of Emergency Regional Governor Unal Erkan, Diyarbakir Governor Ibrahim Sahun, Turkish police chief Mehmet Agar, Seventh Army Corps commander Gen. Metin Saglam, Gendarmerie regional commander Gen. Hasan Kundakci, Second Tactical Air Force Commander Gen. Ergin Celasun, prosecutors, deputy provincial governors, high level security and intelligence officers. Perhaps not truly aware of Western suspicions on what is brewing up in their regions, the officers tell Cemal what is going to happen and how far military policy will go in dealing with the Kurdish problem. Obviously, no one refers to it in these words. Despite what Ankara tells foreign capitals regarding its recognition of "the Kurdish identity," views back at home are totally the opposite. As Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin recently told a Western journalist, "There is no Kurdish problem. There is only a terrorism problem in Turkey." When the situation is such, even in the words of a "social-democrat" member of the coalition, how can anyone expect Turkey to seek any "political" or "democratic" outlet to the "non-existing" Kurdish problem. The full text of Cemal's observations are published today on Page B2 of the special section of the TURKISH DAILY NEWS. The highlight remarks, however, deserve to be debated extensively for they represent not only the dominant view among "commanders" in the region but also reflect what is being "reported" to Ankara. It is not clear which general made the remark, "I understood he was a Turk... I told myself I could not read treason in his eyes," but the implication is clear. If the mentality behind Turkey's imminent crack down on terrorism is to "differentiate between the innocent and the criminal" by looking into people's eyes, and only "Turks" are not suspected of treason, much can be guessed about the real "targets" of the operations... Cemal reports that the most widely heard evaluation among the security emperors of the region is that "the organization has been put into a situation where it can no longer organize mass incidents." This is what President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller are being informed. A view which has been strengthened by the fact that instead of appearing in the streets in their thousands and rioting with Kurdish flags, the people of the Southeast remained at home during the March 21 Kurdish new year of Newroz. Somehow, the officials appear to have missed the hitch: the Turkish service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) carried an exclusive interview with outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan two days before in which he called on the people to stay at home. Ocalan warned the people that Turkey was preparing for a "massacre" and, in order to avoid this, they stayed at home. Indeed, although Erkan explained to us that everything was "peaceful and quiet," and that even the people--"the true people"-- in the PKK stronghold of Cizre were on the street celebrating Newroz along with the security forces, the actual truth was quite different. First of all, he has failed to mention that thousands of people from Cizre had been displaced over the past two months and that there was a state-controlled "re-population" of this town, strengthening the presence of village guards there. He forgot to explain why and how whole districts had been forced to move to other cities, and that several thousand people, just because they lived in districts known to be supportive of the PKK, had been forced to move to the province of Gaziantep. In place of those remaining people who "listened to the PKK," and waited inside their homes, village guards were bussed in with their families and celebrated Newroz along with special crack teams. Not even the loudspeakers, calling on the people to come out, were enough to move them. Erkan, instead of going into such "technicalities," only explained the following: "Do not forget that until a few years ago, those village guards were unable to go out on the street in Cizre. If they did, they were liable to be hanged upside down from the trees. Yes, its true. Because the PKK was "strong" in Cizre and because it had expanded its "grassroots." A strength which was won only after 1989 when a gendarmerie officer forced Kurdish villagers to eat human excrement. A strength which, even according to separatist leader Osman Ocalan, "was due mainly to Turkish policies." But looking at the cost of "moving village guards" into Cizre, one can only be aware of the pain inflicted on all of the civilians: forceful displacement of a whole population, raids on major districts and repression. It is difficult to legitimize what has been done to Cizre in the past by no more than a celebration by a handful of village guards and police officers, mainly "imported" from the outside. And can this justify all of the "mystery murders" as well? Certainly not. But the fact that the PKK has called on the people to stay at home and that the people have done so, has served to "prove" claims that the organization were unable to move the masses. But it didn't. For even the PKK leader referred to this "action" as a "passive resistance." In other words, it was the very lack of activity that made the point. Had the people gone on the streets and celebrated Newroz, this really would have been the evidence for a lack of support in the organization. And what one commander said with regard to Sirnak is even more scary, as scary as the remark on "treason read in the eyes." "Remember the March 21, 1991 Newroz day in Sirnak. From morning to evening it was impossible to remove the PKK colors from the flagpole in the city square. And the things that were done to the Ataturk statue there! Then came the 1992 Newroz. Demirel's prime ministry. The PKK was taught a lesson in Sirnak. The state displayed its might. Everybody saw that there was a price to pay for messing around with the state. Today, not the slightest sound was heard in Sirnak. Think of the change brought about in three years." Yes, everyone has to think of this. And everyone also has to remember how this "success" was achieved. For instance, how 17,000 people living in this city were forced to migrate when it was pulled to the ground in a massive security operation. How the state supported, funded and armed the feudal Tatar tribe in order to control the local people. How policemen burned cars owned by journalists, how newsmen were beaten on the streets, and how much confidence in the state has been lost through this policy--boosting local support for the PKK. But, it appears from what the decision-makers are saying that no one really cares about a thing about "methods" as long as the expected "results" are achieved. And, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who has "successfully" failed Turkey in every direction, has "surrendered" all authority and policy as far as security is concerned to the military. Cemal has been told this clearly and made this point: "A curious line is being drawn from Ozal to Demirel and now to Ciller. It is being stressed that in the fight against the PKK, Ciller is in complete harmony with the security forces and the military. One of the officials says, 'Ciller has grasped the situation. She saw how the security forces could be given the boost to morale that they needed. And this has been accomplished." And an interesting remark: "You may recall that once it used to be said that the Republican People's Party (CHP) plus the army equals power. Now Ciller sees this and seizes the opportunity." Ozal had closed the doors to the military, believing a political solution could be achieved in the Kurdish dispute. He had also accepted that "a Kurdish problem" existed in Turkey. Moreover, this policy had served to restore "civilian" democracy in Turkey. With his death last April, Turkish democracy itself was set back by about ten years, and finding any kind of solution to the Kurdish issue is becoming more and more impossible. Demirel opened the door for the military in fear of losing his own authority if he limited the authority of commanders. Still he had control and influence on what was going on. Ciller allowed the military to walk through the door opened by Demirel and has given "full authority" to the military. In other words, she is saying, "Stop this problem and stop it fast. Do whatever is needed." What is needed, then? It is evident that the military actually believes there is an army-Ciller coalition in power. The increasing domination of national issues by military commanders, their growing role in daily policies and other significant developments imply they may be right. And they have their own solution to the Southeast dilemma now. 1. They deny that a "Kurdish problem" exists. 2. They believe the problem is only one of "terrorism." 3. They are determined to "solve" this problem by summer at the latest and 4. They will "solve" it by force alone. The result of the recent blows delivered to the PKK are categorized by officials as: "Fewer recruits to the organization, more information about the organization, a sharp decline in the logistic support for the organization, greater demand to become village guards." 1. Recruitment to the PKK is continuing steadily and has actually been boosted by the reaction to the "methods" used in the latest security operations. 2. The decline in logistical support to the organization is due mainly to the forcible displacement of villagers and the burning down of 900 villages, in addition to massive crackdowns on four major towns. This has cut direct logistical support to the PKK but has also increased local sympathy, as well as the number of "undecided" villagers moving "up to the mountains." 3. The "greater demand" to become village guards is a reflection of the increase in the number of village guards that has already taken place and that resulted from the security forces telling civilians that if they do not agree to take state-issued weapons and fight the PKK, they will be "seen and treated as the PKK." Sort of a "die or join us" policy which is also one of the major reasons behind the forceful evacuation of villages and their being burned to the ground. Officials have told Cemal that this will be a "hot" summer. That, as of April, "the rural areas" and "the mountain cadres" of the PKK will be the targets. That these will completely be wiped out. But how will the state differentiate between the terrorists and the innocent? And how many people will die in this campaign? Last year, both Chief of Staff commander Gen. Dogan Cures and President Demirel said in separate speeches that "anyone who supports the terrorists or sympathizes with them is a traitor." Even sympathizers, be it out of fear or because for 70 troubled years they have not felt the state at their side, are thus targets. But how many targets? Could it be only a coincidence that several weeks after Demirel and Gures' remarks, another senior military official boldly told the press that "the PKK has 350,000 sympathizers." Or is this a message? The military viewpoint, which is controls [as published] almost all state affairs but the economy (for which no one wants to take responsibility), is clearly outlined to Cemal: "Nothing can be done as long as the fight against the terrorist organization continues. First you must make that organization collapse. Then you can think of other things. If you tried to do anything else at this stage, there would be no end to it. Things would go on, as a chain. First the fight against terrorism." And what will be the second step? Does Ankara recognize the Kurdish "identity?" Yes. Does anyone know what this recognition means other than upgrading Turkey's image abroad? No. Does Ankara recognize the Kurdish "problem?" No. So what can be the second step? In the words of former gendarmerie intelligence chief Maj. Ahmet Cem Ersever, with the policy currently underway, even if the PKK is destroyed, "There will be other PKKs under different names." No solution. But Ersever will fortunately not be around to witness that crisis because, after making such remarks following his retirement, he was shot dead with hands tied behind his back. Later, three of his "operatives" were also killed. People related to the Kurdish issue in one way or the other have died by the dozen from "natural" or "unnatural" causes over the past year. Gendarmerie forces commander Esref Bitlis died in a queer "plane crash." Turgut Ozal had a heart attack and died only days before submitting a major proposal for "Kurdish reforms" to the National Security Council. Ersever has died. Ugur Mumcu was killed while investigating possible links between the PKK and Turkish intelligence. Musa Anter, Vedat Aydin, Mehmet Sincar are only several of those killed over the past week. As the war, which Turks are advised to refer to as "conflict", continues in the troubled region for ten years, a different and more hidden form of war is going on in larger cities. "There is a certain, unexpressed, feeling that it would be better if the media did not write or broadcast anything about the region," Cemal says. How good it would be not to be monitored in any way. How great it would be if everyone, like Ciller, understood where the "authority" currently lies and what ends this will serve. A total of 350,000 troops (an amendment to earlier figures) are now based in the Southeast along with police teams and village guards. Meanwhile local officials prepare for the most massive crackdown that has ever been launched in the region. Even more massive, perhaps, than the "security operations" in the past 70 years aiming to crush 28 "Kurdish rebellions." According to Demirel, "the 29th rebellion" is now taking place and it is obvious how such uprisings should be treated. This is what is scary, coming with remarks from officials who are to run the operation implying that it is only Turks who will not have treason shining in their eyes, the "targets" of any operation to be launched in that region should interest everyone.
