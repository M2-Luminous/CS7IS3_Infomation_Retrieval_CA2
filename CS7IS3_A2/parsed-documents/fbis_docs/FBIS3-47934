Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, also told reporters there should be no misunderstanding on any agreement at the summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. Kume recalled that the Japanese industry set a voluntary target for its auto parts imports during then President George Bush's Tokyo visit in 1992 but that the United States later characterized it as a "public pledge," which became a source of dispute. He said such a situation must be avoided. The U.S. is demanding in the talks that Japan set numerical targets for its auto parts imports.
