FR940922-1-00048 FR940922-1-00008 3. Need for OTC LEV (or LEV-Equivalent) Program for Purposes of Maintenance. (a) Legal Relevance of Maintenance. EPA discussed the timing of reductions from the OTC LEV program and the relevance of maintenance to its inquiry at length in the April 26 proposal. See 59 FR 21728&hyph;21730. The program would not achieve substantial reductions until after its first implementation in model year 1999. There is much evidence that the nonattainment problem in the severe areas is a regional problem in origin, and that the OTC LEV program is therefore needed throughout much of the region to prevent contribution to nonattainment in the severe areas. In addition, however, EPA believes that the states in the OTR need the program to avoid interference with downwind maintenance of the NAAQS even after it is achieved. While EPA believes it should consider this maintenance need here, it must have legal authority to do so. In the April 26 notice, EPA raised this issue because the language in section 184(c) describing the basis for an OTC recommendation, EPA's obligation in reviewing it, and EPA's obligation to explain why any control measure is not necessary all reference necessity ``to bring an area in such region into attainment by the dates provided by this subpart'' and omit any reference to maintenance. Nevertheless, EPA currently believes that it has legal authority to consider maintenance under section 184, and in any case has independent authority for the action proposed here on maintenance grounds directly under sections 110(k)(5) and 110(a)(2)(D). EPA believes that these sections of the Act, together with the overall structure of title I, support this conclusion. To be sure, other provisions of the Act explicitly distinguish between ``attainment'' and ``maintenance.'' Beginning with the overall goal of healthful ambient air quality, section 109(b) requires EPA to issue ambient air quality standards ``the attainment and maintenance of which'' are necessary to protect the public health or welfare. The current statutory structure as revised in the 1990 Amendments, however, reflects a difference between the manner in which Congress addressed states' attainment and maintenance obligations with respect to their own independent air quality and the manner in which Congress addressed states' obligations to prevent contribution to downwind nonattainment and interference with downwind maintenance. In sum, EPA believes that this new structure establishes particular time-frames for states to address attainment separately from maintenance to protect their own air quality, but left much greater discretion for EPA to insist that states address these concerns at all times when states' emissions cause harm in other states. Prior to 1990, initial SIPs due nine months after EPA promulgation of a NAAQS were to include programs designed both to attain and thereafter maintain the standards. See prior section 110(a)(2) (B) and (D) and section 172(a). In 1990, for areas designated as nonattainment areas, Congress specified requirements for attainment and maintenance in discrete provisions that provide for discrete SIP submissions to address these two separable concerns. Section 172 continues to require submission of a SIP providing for the attainment of the NAAQS in nonattainment areas. The subpart 2 ozone program specifies deadlines for submission of a variety of SIP revisions, including attainment demonstrations for moderate and above areas. Maintenance considerations for nonattainment areas were specifically relocated to a new section 175A, which provides that states are to submit plans, including additional control measures, as necessary to ensure maintenance for at least 10 years following redesignation to attainment. See section 175A(a). Significantly, section 175A includes no requirement that a state adopt measures to address transport of pollutants that may interfere with maintenance downwind. 64 64 One might assume that an area that is in attainment and maintains that status could not interfere with attainment or maintenance downwind. Intuitively, one might not expect a ``clean air'' area to cause other areas to have ``dirty air.'' But this is not the case. Areas that meet the standard may nonetheless have emissions that interfere with attainment or maintenance downwind. Indeed, Congress's decision to require control measures such as RACT and nonattainment new source review even in attainment areas throughout the OTR under section 184(b) indicates Congress understood that ``clean air'' areas could contribute to ``dirty air'' downwind. Consistent with this new structure, Congress changed the requirement formerly codified at section 110(a)(2)(D) that required SIPs to include a permit program for stationary sources as necessary to assure that NAAQS ``are achieved and maintained.'' The new section 110(a)(2)(C) simply requires regulation of stationary sources as necessary to assure that NAAQS ``are achieved.'' Thus, it appears that Congress specifically deleted references to maintenance in section 110(a)(2) where it believed that to be appropriate in light of the new structure and new section 175A. 65 65 Congress did leave a reference in section 110(a)(2)(C) to ``a permit program as required in parts C and D.'' The part C permit program codified at section 165 of the Act is designed to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in attainment areas, and hence would only be relevant to maintenance, not achieving attainment. One might argue from this that Congress intended the reference to attainment in section 110(a)(2)(C) to include maintenance, as well. But, the better view may be that Congress simply overlooked the need to delete the reference to part C in light of its specific deletion of the reference to maintenance. However, Congress made no such change to the pollution transport provisions of section 110(a)(2). The transport provision was significantly broadened from the former section 110(a)(2)(E) to new section 110(a)(2)(D), as discussed above. Nonetheless, in changing the language of the transport provision, Congress saw fit to retain the reference to maintenance. Indeed, Congress had to specifically focus on this issue when it changed the standard from ``prevent[s] attainment or maintenance'' in the former provision to ``contributes significantly'' to nonattainment and ``interfere[s] with maintenance'' in the new provision. This indicates Congress specifically sought to retain maintenance as a criterion for pollution transport under section 110(a)(2) at the same time it was deleting maintenance as a criterion for the permit provisions in light of section 175A.
