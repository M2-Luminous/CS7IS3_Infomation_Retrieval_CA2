FR940628-2-00007 FR940628-2-00003 April 19, 1994. Richard E. Sanderson, Director, Office of Federal Activities, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW. (A&hyph;104), Washington, DC 20460. Re: JFKIA Gull Hazard Reduction Program EIS Process Dear Mr. Sanderson: This is to advise that anticipated public safety considerations require that we seek a reduction in the 30-day period (between notification of availability of the final environmental impact statement and issuance of records of decision) required by 40 CFR 1506.10(b) in the above-referenced matter. The 45-day comment period on the draft environmental impact statement closed on March 28, 1994. We now anticipate that the notice of availability of the final environmental impact statement will be published in the May 6th issue of the Federal Register . It appears, however, that decisions may have to be made before June 5, 1994, the earliest a decision could be issued consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 1506.10(b)(2). The environmental impact statement_the process for which has to date fully involved the public and included an on-site ``public information meeting''_explores alternatives to reduce the gull hazard to aircraft at John F. Kennedy International Airport. During each of the past three years beginning in mid-May the potential for gull-aircraft interactions has tended to increase dramatically. We reasonably expect that the potential for gull-aircraft interactions will reach an unacceptable level before June 5, 1994. Thus, a reduction of the required 30-day period between notification of availability of the final environmental impact statement and issuance of the records of decision by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, lead agency in the EIS process, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, a cooperating agency in the EIS process, is hereby requested. If additional information is needed or you have questions concerning this matter, please call me at (301) 436&hyph;8565. Thank you for your consideration of this request. ␣␣␣Sincerely, Carl Bausch, Deputy Director, Environmental Analysis and Documentation.
