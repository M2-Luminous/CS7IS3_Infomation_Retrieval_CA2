FR940805-1-00004 FR940805-1-00001 REA is proposing amendments to clarify policy on supplemental financing requirements. Existing 7 CFR 1710.110 states that, except in cases of financial hardship, applicants for a municipal rate insured loan are required to obtain a portion of their loan funds from a supplemental source without an REA guarantee. The method for determining the supplemental financing percentage for each individual loan is set forth in existing §§1710.110(c)(1) and (2). For most borrowers, this percentage is based on the borrower's plant revenue ratio (PRR), as defined in §1710.2. To clarify the requirement for those borrowers whose PRR changes between the time of the loan application and the time of loan approval, REA is proposing to codify the policy of using the PRR based on the most recent year-end data available on the date of loan approval. Consistent with longstanding REA policy, if termination or rescission of an insured loan, or its associated supplemental loan substantially affects the overall proportion of REA and supplemental financing to a borrower, the amount of supplemental financing required on that borrower's next municipal rate loan is adjusted to maintain the overall proportion. Since REA loans generally carry a lower interest rate than supplemental loans from private lenders, this policy is intended to avoid (1) Penalizing borrowers following a loan rescission and (2) Allowing a borrower to receive a disproportionate amount of low interest REA financing. The proposed amendment will clarify that the adjustment will only be made following rescission or termination of more than 5 percent of an insured loan subject to supplemental financing. No adjustment will be made based on rescission of a hardship rate loan where no supplemental financing was required. The amendment will also set forth the formula used to compute the adjustment. Amortization of Principal Under current procedures, amortization of principal begins 2 years after the date of the note for advances made during the first and second years of the loan, and 4 years after the date of the note for advances made during the third and fourth years. REA proposes to continue existing policy with respect to advances made during the first 2 years of the loan. In conjunction with lengthening the allowable loan period, REA is proposing, in §1714.58, that principal amortization of advances made more than 2 years after the date of the note begin with the loan payment billed in the next full month after the month of the advances. For example, principal amortization on funds advanced any time during the month of June of the third year after the date of the note would begin with the bill sent to the borrower in July of that year. In cases of financial hardship, the Administrator may approve a principal deferment period of up to 2 years for any advances made after the second year of the loan. The initial 2 year deferment period allows the borrower to make significant improvements to existing facilities and, in addition, to place most of the new plant in service, earning revenues with which to repay the loan. REA believes that any increase in scheduled payments after the second year of the loan will represent only a fraction of a borrower's total scheduled debt service payments and an even smaller fraction of its total costs. Any increase in principal payments during these later years will be offset by reduced principal payments in subsequent years. Final Maturity REA proposes a technical change in the method used to evaluate final maturity of loans. Pursuant to §1710.115, REA loans must be repaid with interest within a period, up to 35 years, that approximates the expected useful life of the facilities financed. The existing rule bases expected useful life on the weighted average of the depreciation rates proposed by the borrower. The proposed amendment will base final maturity on useful life, rather than on depreciation rates. Although depreciation rates and useful life are closely related, REA believes that basing loan maturity directly on useful life is a more straightforward approach. Equity Development Plans On January 9, 1992, at 57 FR 1053, REA published regulations requiring at 7 CFR 1710.116, that a borrower whose total equity as a percentage of total assets is, or is projected to be, less than certain target levels, prepare and agree to follow an equity development plan as a condition of obtaining an REA loan. For distribution borrowers the target equity level is 40 percent; for power supply borrowers the target level is 20 percent. The equity development plan must be designed to make reasonable progress toward meeting the applicable target level during a 10-year period without, as stated in the existing rule at 7 CFR 1710.116(d), raising power costs or retail rates for electricity unreasonably, placing an unreasonable burden on rate payers, or substantially reducing the borrower's ability to compete with neighboring utilities or other energy sources. The requirement that borrowers develop and maintain equity was intended to strengthen the Agency's credit policies and protect the value of its loan portfolio. In accordance with the RE Act, REA may make a loan only if the Administrator determines that the security therefor is reasonably adequate and such loan will be repaid in full within the time agreed. Since a borrower's total capitalization is equal to the sum of its equity and its debt, a low ratio of equity to total assets indicates a correspondingly high level of debt. The equity targets were designed to minimize cases where over leverage could jeopardize a borrower's ability to meet its financial obligations. While REA still believes that low levels of equity present risks to lenders, two years of experience with the equity development plan requirement has demonstrated that such plans are an unnecessary and burdensome means of achieving the desired result. As stated in the preamble to the 1992 regulation, the target level of 40 percent for distribution borrowers was based on the experience of REA borrowers, typical industry standards, and the long established threshold in the REA mortgage for determining whether REA approval is required for borrowers to retire capital credits.
