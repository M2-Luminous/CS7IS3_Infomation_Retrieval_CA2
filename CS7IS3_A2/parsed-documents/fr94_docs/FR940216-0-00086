FR940216-0-00086 FR940216-0-00010 The Agency received many comments about the proposed NO X standards. Some commenters claimed it was counter to the regulatory negotiation agreement. This concern has been addressed in section A above. Others felt that NO X control should be considered on a local basis to meet local needs and thus should not be part of a national fuel program. Another stated that states should have to demonstrate the need for mobile source NO X control before EPA required it. Some commenters supported NO X control based on the cost-effectiveness analysis presented in the proposal because of the similarity with the costs of other current NO X control programs. One comment suggested that EPA control NO X by eliminating the oxygen requirement using the authority granted in section 211(k)(2)(A). It was also questioned whether EPA had satisfied the requirements to use the authority granted in section 211(c) regarding the supporting information presented in the proposal. The remainder of this section presents EPA's response to these concerns; additional detail may be found in the RIA. a. Scientific justification for NO X control. As discussed in the RIA, a recent study by the National Research Council (NRC) indicated that VOC control alone is of minimal benefit to ozone nonattainment areas such as Houston which have high VOC to NO X ratios in the ambient air. 29 The NRC study and work by EPA 30 and others 31 have also indicated that NO X control is an effective ozone control strategy for the northeast (including New York-Connecticut and Boston-Maine) as well as the Lake Michigan region (Milwaukee, Chicago, and Muskegon). In general, many studies have shown that NO X control alone may be helpful in achieving ozone reductions in some areas, though not necessarily in all areas, again depending on the VOC to NO X ratios. Reductions in emissions of both VOC and NO X should benefit all areas, however. Those areas that do not benefit from the reduction in NO X emissions should benefit from the large reduction in VOC emissions that will be achieved by Phase II RFG. 29 National Research Council, Rethinking the Ozone Problem in Urban and Regional Air Pollution, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., 1991. 30 U.S. EPA, Regional Ozone Modelling for Northeast Transport (ROMNET), EPA Report 450/4&hyph;91&hyph;002a, June 1991. 31 See the RIA for additional references. There are also non-ozone benefits of NO X control, such as reductions in emissions leading to acid rain formation, reductions in toxic nitrated polycyclic aromatic compounds, lower secondary airborne particulate (i.e. ammonium nitrate) formation, reduced nitrate deposition from rain, improved visibility, and lower levels of nitrogen dioxide. A complete discussion of these benefits can be found in the RIA. A NO X standard also should effectively protect against an increase in the olefin content of the fuel, reducing concern over a possible increase in the reactivity of vehicle emissions. b. Consideration of section 202 motor vehicle controls. Before controlling or prohibiting a fuel or fuel additive under section 211(c)(1)(A), the Administrator must consider ``other technologically or economically feasible means of achieving emission standards under section [202].'' This has been interpreted as requiring consideration of regulation through motor vehicle standards under section 202 prior to regulation of fuels or fuel additives under section 211(c)(1)(A) [ Ethyl Corp. v. Environmental Prot. Agcy ., 541 F.2d 1, 32 (D.C. Cir. 1976)]. This does not establish a mandatory preference for vehicle controls over fuel controls, but instead calls for the good faith consideration of motor vehicle standards before imposition of fuel controls [541 F.2d at 32 n.66]. This reflects Congress' recognition that fuel controls under section 211(c)(1)(A) might logically involve controls on fuel composition itself, while vehicle standards under section 202 are generally performance standards, regulating vehicle emissions and not the design or structure of the vehicle. Fuel controls might therefore lead to greater government involvement in the regulation of the manufacturing process than would be expected from vehicle controls [541 F.2d at 11 n.13]. Congress addressed this concern by requiring agency ``consideration'' of vehicle standards under section 202 before imposition of fuel controls under section 211(c)(1)(A). It is important to note that the Administrator must in good faith consider such vehicle controls, but retains full discretion in deciding whether to adopt either fuel or vehicle controls, or both [541 F.2d at 32 n.66]. In evaluating motor vehicle controls under section 202 in this context, the first major point to consider is that EPA has already imposed more stringent NO X control standards on motor vehicles. The Tier 1 standards for light-duty motor vehicles and trucks require reductions in light-duty motor vehicle NO X emissions starting with model year 1994, with a percentage phase-in of the more stringent Tier 1 standards until they apply to all new model year 1996 and later light-duty vehicles and trucks. These vehicles are also required to meet in-use standards. 32 For heavy-duty vehicles, EPA recently reduced the NO X standard to 4 g/bhp-hr, starting with model year 1998 [58 FR 15781, March 24, 1993] 32 56 FR 25724, June 5, 1991. Also, note that the Tier 1 standards apply to light-duty trucks with a loaded vehicle weight rating of 3,750 lbs. or less. While these motor vehicle and motor vehicle engine controls are expected to reduce mobile source emissions of NO X , this result is limited by certain basic facts. First, the standards only apply to new motor vehicles and engines. It will therefore take several years after the first model year of the standards before vehicles and engines certified to these standards will make up a significant portion of the motor vehicle fleet. 33 In addition, it is expected that emissions reductions based on the reduction in the NO X standard will be offset to a significant extent by an increase, over time, in total vehicle miles travelled. 33 As supported by the MOBILE5a model, 58 FR 29409, May 20, 1993.
