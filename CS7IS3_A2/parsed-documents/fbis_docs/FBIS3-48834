It is worth recalling that the people and the NADK had routed the Vietnamese communist puppets' military offensives in the Bavel region of Battambang Province in early January. However, the Vietnamese puppets continued to massacre their fellow countrymen, plunder their cattle, and burn their rice crops and homes. This made the people extremely furious. So, between 24 and 26 January, they joined forces with the NADK to attack and destroy the Vietnamese communist puppets' troops around Bavel District. The following are the results of the onslaught against the Vietnamese puppet forces: 1. On 26 January, a group of our forces attacked and completely destroyed the position of the 24th regiment from Division 6 stationed at Ampel Pram Daeum, the position of the 8th battalion at Boeng Sangke, and the position of a company at (Siem) village. We killed 30 invaders, including a regiment commander and a deputy commander of the 6th division, and wounded many others. The remaining enemy soldiers were forced to beat a hasty retreat to Bavel. The people also captured two enemy soldiers, seized 20 assorted firearms -- including DK-75, 80-mm, DK-82, 12.7-mm, and 60-mm guns; B-40 rocket launchers, and AK rifles -- and destroyed some armaments. They also liberated many thousands of villagers in Ampel commune. 2. On 26 January, over 200 people closely cooperated with the NADK to attack the Vietnamese communist puppets' invading troops in the areas of S'tha Po, Prey Khpuos, (Dei S'at), and Kbal Krabei. We killed 15 enemy soldiers and wounded many others. We also liberated many hundreds of families in S'tha Po village. 3. On 25 January, a battalion of the Vietnamese communist puppets planned to attack us from behind. But we ambushed it, killed seven enemy soldiers and wounded five others. The remaining troops were forced to retreat to Lvea. 4. On 24 January, the people and NADK attacked and routed invading enemy troops along Route 5 in the area between Chroy M'teh and (Ta Pi). We killed five enemy soldiers and wounded 10 others, and we dismantled the Vietnamese communist puppets' state authorities in the following five villages: Chroy M'teh, Am, Ta Ping Toch, Ta Ping Thom, and Tuol Neakru. We also seized more than 10 assorted guns. These were the counterattacks mounted by the people to prevent the Vietnamese communist puppets from mobilizing their troops for offensives. These are attacks made in self-defense to protect the people's lives and their property, cattle, carts, plows, and rice crops. The people say the only way to defend their lives is to cooperate closely with the NADK. They also say that the entire Cambodian nation and people, both in the urban and rural areas, are now rising up. They add that they can no longer allow the Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese puppets, and their alliance to continue inflaming the war to kill Cambodians at will.
