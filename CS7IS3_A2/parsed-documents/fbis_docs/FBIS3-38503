The second recipient is Italy, which took up 19 percent of the investments. EIB investments outside the EU represent 9.6 percent of the mobilized total. The increase in EIB investments in Spain was 45 percent for the year, thus overtaking the traditional chief recipient country, which used to be Italy. If it is estimated that EIB loans provide on average 30 percent of the amount invested in each project; the money mobilized represents 14 percent of the investment in Spain in 1993. The EIB's investment decisions depend on the applications and management ability of the states, which have to submit coherent plans, well supported by profitability and environmental impact studies. The 1993 fiscal year was very good for the EIB, according to its executives, who presented a balance sheet recording a 15 percent increase over the previous year and a ECU19.6 billion (over 3.1 trillion pesetas) grand total of loans. According to its president, Brian Unwin, the EIB "has played a key role in the Community's economic recovery program, especially with respect to financing the trans-European networks." Unwarranted Accusations The non-Community countries, primarily in North Africa and Central and East Europe, took up ECU1.9 billion (300 billion pesetas). Despite this, Brian Unwin stated that the Mediterranean countries received over twice what was lent in the previous year, and so it is unwarranted to accuse the bank of paying greater attention to the East than to the south. Half of the EIB's loans to Spain consisted of investments in transport, prominent among which are the Madrid to Seville high-speed train, the Bilbao to Santander line, the subway systems of Bilbao, Madrid, and Valencia, two sections of expressway in Barcelona, local roads in several provinces, new terminals, the enlargement of airports in Palma, Madrid, and Barcelona, and the modernization of the ports of Barcelona, Bilbao, and Valencia. Some 15 percent of the loans were for water supply and treatment. [passage omitted]
