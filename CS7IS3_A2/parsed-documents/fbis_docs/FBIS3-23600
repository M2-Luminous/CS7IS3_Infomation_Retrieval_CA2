"Dear Editor, "Could you provide any information on the history of the establishment of the sector main commands, their missions and their fate? In the 1980's, the whole country knew about such sector main commands, but unfortunately the crazy secrecy in which our society was living deprived us of the most elementary official information. "[signed] A. Palitsyn (Saratov)" Major transformations consisting of a complex of measures were undertaken in the Soviet Armed Forces in the second half of the 1970's and in the early 1980's. The plan was to transform the main command of the ground forces into the directorate of the commander-in-chief's reserves, and to subordinate civil defense and the military commissariats to him; to establish sector main commands; to form separate army corps of brigade composition (as a resource for actions in the enemy's operational depth); to create air forces in the military districts while simultaneously eliminating air armies; to organize air defense on the territorial principle, where each military district would be responsible for air defense within its administrative boundaries. An attempt was made to draw a clearer dividing line between the functions of the General Staff, the main commands of the armed services, and sector troops and military districts. This process was a long time in coming. The increasing scale and rate of military preparations by the opposing blocs--NATO and the Warsaw Pact, their creation of the latest resources of armed conflict, and chiefly for a first nuclear strike, as well as the desire of Western countries to break the military-strategic parity that had evolved by this time, motivated the Soviet leadership to take effective steps both to improve organizational structures and to fundamentally change the forms and methods of command and control. In the postwar years the activity of commanders and staffs in troop command and control continued to grow more complex. Command and control became the most important component of the combat readiness of troops and naval forces, and one of its decisive factors. This necessitated a constant search for effective ways to improve the entire system of command and control, especially of large troop (force) groupings in theaters of military operations (TMOs). With regard for this, in September 1984 a new link of operational-strategic command and control of troops and naval forces--sector main commands--was brought into the command and control system. The Soviet leadership undertook this action in retaliation to similar actions by the leadership of the NATO bloc. Back in the early 1950's the member nations of this bloc created coalitional elements of operational-strategic leadership of troops in Europe. In this case the Supreme Main Command in Europe assumed a central place in the overall system of the Joint Armed Forces of the NATO bloc. Its zone of responsibility included the territories of all of the bloc's European member nations (except Great Britain and Portugal) and Turkey, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. Three main commands of the Joint Armed Forces were established simultaneously: In the Northern European (a staff of up to 700 persons), Central European (up to 2,000 persons) and Southern European (over 1,500 persons) TMOs.[.sup]2[/] The block's leadership made a particular effort to train and set up command and control posts and to organize communications. The main commands were in a high state of readiness, and they could assume control over forces allocated to them in short time. Modern communication resources and automated command and control systems were present at control posts for this purpose. Thus, the leadership of the NATO bloc managed to acquire certain advantages in troop command and control by this time, and it possessed a workable system of command and control for both peacetime and wartime. The Soviet Armed Forces were significantly behind NATO in this area (by more than 30 years in time, and hopelessly behind in organization and equipment). The idea of transforming the system for controlling Soviet forces was based on the experience of the Great Patriotic War[.sup]3[/] and operational-strategic exercises. The process of creating the main sector commands in a sense went through two phases. The first phase embraced the period from November 1978 to September 1984. During this period the main commands were foreseen as coalitional elements of operational-strategic leadership of troops and naval forces of the Joint Armed Forces of Warsaw Pact states in the Western and Southwestern TMOs, and only in wartime.[.sup]4[/] The main commands owed their creation both to the essence itself and the complexity of the problem of providing for the collective security of Warsaw Pact states, and to the volume and rate of military preparations of the NATO bloc, as well as the nature of possible warfare. It was felt that without unified, centralized leadership of troops and naval forces of the Joint Armed Forces at the scale of TMOs, it would be impossible to hope for success in war, were it to be initiated by the aggressor. One of the forms of conducting military operations in a possible war--the TMO strategic operation, in which large troop (force) groupings of all armed services could participate--was theoretically recognized, and perfected in operational exercises. The organization and conduct of such an operation was an exceptionally complex and difficult task, requiring strict centralization of command and control of troops and naval forces. It was assumed that success in such an operation would be possible only on the condition that command and control of the troops (forces) was highly competent, efficient and unified, for which reason the elements of leadership had to be established ahead of time, while still at peace. Considering this, the Staff of the Joint Armed Forces of Warsaw Pact states was adopted as the basis for establishment of main sector commands in the Western and Southwestern TMOs. It was transformed from a wartime military-political element into two operational-strategic elements of leadership of troops and naval forces in theaters of military operations. Establishment of a unified Supreme Main Command was foreseen for centralized leadership of these forces,[.sup]5[/] and the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces became the command and control element. The administration of the commander-in-chief of sector troops in a TMO consisted of deputy commanders representing each allied army, a staff, a political directorate and the following directorates: Missile forces and artillery, air forces, air defense troops, engineering and chemical troops, and armament and rear services. The main element of command and control was the staff of the main command, headed by a chief of staff, who was also the first deputy commander-in-chief. Deputies representing each of the allied armies were foreseen under the chief of staff, as well as under the chief of the political directorate. The troop staff and all directorates were manned by generals, admirals and officers from all of the allied armies on a proportional basis, including generals and officers who served in the Staff of the Joint Armed Forces of Warsaw Pact states in peacetime. Command and control of troops and air defense forces in the TMO was to be provided by a joint air force and air defense command post under the leadership of the air defense commander, who was also the deputy troop commander for the TMO. The system for command and control of joint naval forces was organized on an entirely different basis. The commander of such naval forces became the deputy troop commander-in-chief for the TMO, and he essentially had to manage all of the naval forces. After all of the necessary documents were drawn up (regulations, basic missions and functional responsibilities, organizational structure), and the corresponding decisions were made, the main command of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states and the national commands and staffs embarked upon the practical work of forming the Western and Southwestern sector main commands. Much work was done in this aspect by the main command of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states, and primarily by Commander-in-Chief Marshal of the Soviet Union B. G. Kulikov and Joint Armed Forces Chief of Staff Army General A. I. Gribkov, by defense ministers, and by general and main staffs of the allied armies. It should be noted that operational-strategic exercises such as Soyuz, Granit and Shchit played a special role in this. They were conducted according to plans of the joint and national commands of the allied armies. Exercise Soyuz-83 under the leadership of Marshal of the Soviet Union V. G. Kulikov was the most typical exercise of this scale. In it, the administration of the main command for the Western TMO was fully manned by generals and officers from four allied armies (the East German Army, the Polish Forces, the Czechoslovak Army and the Soviet Army) as well as from the Staff of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states, and the staffs of the fronts, armies, troops and naval forces were included. These actions were approved by the leadership of all Warsaw Pact states, and they were made necessary, as was noted earlier, by the complexity of the military-political situation in Europe at this moment in time, and by the importance of the European theater of military operations in the plans of the North Atlantic bloc. It was difficult not to agree with such a step then. However, for the sake of justice it should be emphasized that not all of this was taken to its logical conclusion. First of all, problems associated with the composition of the unified Supreme Main Command of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states were not resolved, which had a negative effect on the solution of other problems. Nor can we ignore the special position taken by the Romanian leadership, which proposed an entirely different system of command and control of troops and naval forces in the theaters of military operations. Back when the documents on the main commands were being drafted (chiefly the draft of the Regulations), the Romanian Ministry of National Defense, while not entirely rejecting the need for creating sector main commands for the Joint Armed Forces (in the TMOs), stated a special opinion, the essence of which reduced to the following: - The Political Consultative Committee should be the supreme main command of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states, because only it is an authoritative body capable of carrying out major military-political tasks; - the main command of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states and not one of the general staffs of the allied armies should become the working element of the Supreme Main Command in wartime; - generals from each allied army serving in the rank of TMO first deputy commanders-in-chief had to be present under the commander-in-chief of sector troops (in the TMO). Being a collective and coalitional element of leadership, the military council had to make the decisions on all of the basic questions of organizing and carrying out operations and controlling the troops; - the commander-in-chief of sector troops (in the TMO) needed to control the troops through his first deputies from the allied armies, and through the military council, and not through the staff of the sectors troops. Only the first deputy commanders-in-chief had the right to issue directives, orders and instructions, and thus provide for troop command and control; - generals, admirals and officers from all allied armies needed to be appointed to positions of leadership in all of the directorates and departments, proportionately and on a rotating basis; - there was no need for creating a political directorate. Each country's party could carry out political work in the troops through its own political apparatus, in close cooperation with their armies. Obviously, little more needs to be said about these conclusions, except that they clearly manifested the desire of the Romanians to dilute the main sector (TMO) command of the Joint Armed Forces, make it amorphous and incompetent, and in short, to remove national troops from its control. This was unacceptable. This is why the fundamental documents on the sector (TMO) main commands of the Joint Armed Forces were adopted by the Committee of Ministers of Defense and the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Pact states without regard for the conclusions of the Romanian side. However, as a rule, during exercises and other operational measures these and other wishes of the Romanians were accounted for to the extent possible. Such are the main landmarks in the first phase of establishment of the TMO main commands of the Joint Armed Forces. In my opinion this system of troop leadership satisfied the requirements of development of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states in that situation. The second phase embraces the period since 1984, when the Soviet leadership unilaterally, and contrary to decisions of the heads of Warsaw Pact states, raised to a practical plane the issue of creating sector main commands in peacetime, and only for Soviet troops. This decision was dictated -- besides by the arguments presented above -- by the Soviet Union's geopolitical position, the great dimensions of its territory, and the fact that the situation necessitated immediate improvement of troop leadership in the most important strategic sectors. It was felt in this case that creation of sector main commands would be a new important step forward on the road of development of the entire system of command and control of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, and would bring the leadership directly in touch with the troops, which would facilitate the command activities of the highest military bodies -- the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces. Thus, in September 1984 the main command of troops of the Western Sector was created and the composition of troops and naval forces subordinated to it was determined.[.sup]6[/] On 24 September Marshal of the Soviet Union N. V. Ogarkov assumed the position of the commander-in-chief of sector troops. A military council consisting of Chairman N. V. Ogarkov and the following council members was formed simultaneously: B. P. Utkin, the political directorate chief, the chief of staff -- the author of this article, and the first deputy commander-in-chief -- Army General M. I. Sorokin. The following deputy commanders-in-chief were designated as members of the military council later on: for air forces--Colonel General of Aviation S. V. Golubev, for armament--Lieutenant General A. A. Ivanov (as of 1985, deputy commander for combat training), and deputy commander for rear services--Lieutenant General G. P. Pastukhovskiy. The following were subordinated directly to the troop commander-in-chief of the Western Sector: Two military districts (Belorussian and Carpathian), three groups of forces (the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany and the Central and Northern groups of forces); the following were operationally subordinated: The Baltic Fleet, one air army of the Supreme High Command and one air defense army (the 2d Separate Air Defense Army). The composition of the troop groupings and naval forces was approximately adequate to the NATO troop (force) groupings stationed in this sector. By the nature of his position (but more in formal terms) the commander-in-chief of sector troops was endowed with full power of leadership over subordinated troops. He was given the responsibility of solving practically all problems associated with the life and activity of the troops: Ensuring the constant combat readiness of troops, naval forces and staffs; operational planning; organization of operational, combat and political training of troops and staffs; conduct of operational exercises, including with the participation of troops, fleets and staffs of the allied armies; implementation of measures to tighten military discipline, to provide material and technical support to the troops, and to establish operational materiel reserves; solution of problems concerning operational preparation of the TMO; creation of a system of communication, command and control. The commander-in-chief of sector troops resolved the issues of operational planning and joint exercises that concerned the allied troops through the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces, and coordinated directly with the military leadership of the allied countries (in the West--with the general staffs of the Polish Forces, the Czechoslovak Army and the main staff of the East German Army). Such a broad declaration of the rights of the commander-in-chief of sector troops did not enjoy any practical support. The difficulty was that the center (represented by the main commands of the armed services) did not want to concede its unshared leadership of troops and forces subordinated to it (this was manifested especially strongly by the main commands of the air forces and air defense forces). The intermediate link--the military districts (groups of forces)--felt that the sector main command would usurp their authority in many issues, and therefore they did not wish to have this intermediate element of command and control above them. As far as the leadership of the armies and divisions is concerned, it expressed gratitude for the work of officers of the main command. Note that for practical purposes nothing changed at that time in the work of the main commands of the armed services and the staffs of the military districts and groups of forces; the entire system that had been honed over the years remained in place. The leadership of the military districts (groups of forces) not only retained the right of direct communication with the minister of defense, the General Staff and the main commands of the armed services, but it was even encouraged. Still, the range of issues that had to be resolved through the sector main commands was clearly defined. This was also reinforced by the fact that all problems of material support and personnel issues were resolved centrally, chiefly in the administrations of the main commands of the armed services. All of this led to parallelism in work, and to reduction of the role of sector main commands and the main commands of the armed services. This practice automatically created conditions for various conflicts. Strange as it may seem, with the appearance of the sector main commands the main command of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact states, which was one of the initiators in creation of sector main commands, began doing everything it could to block their contact with the leadership of allied armies. This position had a negative effect on the work in general. And the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces had not developed clear directives regarding this matter by this time, occupying a kind of dualistic position in relation to the new elements of command and control. Nor did creation of these sector main commands have the needed impact as a retaliatory measure to the military preparations of the NATO bloc, as the leadership of the USSR Ministry of Defense simply hushed up their existence. None of this provided for normal work. At that time the administration of the sector main command included: A staff consisting of operational, naval, intelligence and organizational-mobilizational directorates, a communications directorate, and the following departments -- ECM, topographic, political, troop services, special services, supply, financial and others; directorates: missile forces and artillery, air forces, air defense forces, combat training, political, engineering and chemical troops, armament and rear services; a construction inspectorate, a messing inspectorate; a financial service; communications, security and support units. In this variant the staff of the main command of sector troops was the main element of command and control. It carried the responsibility for the entire volume of tasks determined for a main command, and in addition: Evaluating the military-political situation, organizing reconnaissance, developing proposals on the mobilizational readiness of troops and on improving their organizational and staffing structure, organizing troop services, creating and improving the communications and command and control systems in the TMO, supporting the conduct of operational training and exercises, performing monitoring functions, and studying, generalizing and bringing progressive experience and new training methods and techniques to the awareness of the troops. The chief of staff provided leadership to the work of the staff of the main command of sector troops. (He was also the first deputy commander-in-chief and a member of the military council). He had the right to issue orders on behalf of the commander-in-chief to subordinated troops, and he coordinated the activity of all elements of command and control. The chief of staff personally participated in solving the most important problems pertaining to troop combat readiness, operational planning, exercises and training. Establishing and maintaining close business contacts with the leadership of the general staffs of allied armies was a special concern of the chief of staff. And there were many difficulties in this area. A political directorate headed by Lieutenant General V. P. Utkin, deputy chief of the Main Political Directorate of the Soviet Army and Navy, was formed to organize and coordinate political work in the troops and Navy. The political directorate was granted the rights of an element of leadership, which was not received well by the political directorates of the armed services and military districts (groups of forces). This structure of the administration of the main command (numbering 500 persons) was believed to be fully acceptable for carrying out its tasks. But it must be recognized that the administration of the main command of the Western Sector was created in haste, for all intents and purposes between September and October 1984, while its overall establishment proceeded in two phases: September-December 1984, during which time it was 40 percent manned, and from 1 March 1985, when it was manned to its full complement. The staff directorates were headed by experienced generals such as Lieutenant General V. G. Maganov (operational), Vice Admiral P. F. Sharov (naval), Lieutenant General V. A. Kartashov (intelligence), Lieutenant General P. F. Ponomarev (organizational-mobilizational), Lieutenant General G. F. Mishin (communications directorate). Lieutenant General D. G. Shkrudnev, a participant of combat operations in Afghanistan, became the first deputy chief of staff. The missile forces and artillery directorate was headed by Lieutenant General N. A. Mikhaylov, the air defense forces directorate was headed by Lieutenant General V. V. Litvinov, and the air force staff was headed by Lieutenant General of Aviation M. M. Kuznetsov. On the whole, the directorates and departments of the main commands were staffed by experienced, well-trained generals, admirals and officers. These were specialists in their areas, who possessed considerable practical work experience in their corresponding positions. Nonetheless, mistakes were made in personnel. Many officers came up from positions at division and army scale, did not have work experience in higher staffs, and knew little about the peculiarities of the Western TMO. These and other mistakes necessarily impacted upon the style and results of the work, especially during initial establishment of the main command's administration. The desire of the leadership to immediately begin practical work in the forces, without any kind of preparatory period, also had a negative effect. After all, every officer needed time to assimilate his functional responsibilities and the peculiarities of the life of the troops, and to study the peculiarities of the theater of military operations. Direct work in the troops, in the Navy and in the staffs was the principal method of leadership of the main command and of the administration as a whole. The work was organized on a principled but benevolent basis, and it was oriented on fulfilling the requirements of directives (orders) of the minister of defense and the General Staff of the armed forces. The principle of teaching the troops what they needed in war was introduced into troop and staff training practice for real. I feel it my duty to give credit in this regard to the ability and tactfulness of the troop commander-in-chief of the Western Sector, Marshal of the Soviet Union N. V. Ogarkov. Being one of the initiators of creating the sector main commands, he invested a great deal of work into forming and initially developing the administration of the main command of troops of the Western Sector. Possessing a broad outlook, a knack for creative operational thinking, considerable experience in the troops and work experience in higher positions, he was able to teach commanders and staffs patiently and objectively. And not only teach them but also to demand the same kind of relationship to subordinates on the part of generals and officers of the administration of the main command, requiring them to provide specific assistance to subordinates locally. This practice and style of work made it possible to reach one of the objectives--bringing the leadership directly in touch with the troops. In this aspect the sector's main command became for practical purposes the executive element of the central leadership in the forces. The leadership of the Ministry of Defense only needed to rely a little more actively on it, which is something it did not do in practice. Advances were also made in reaching the objective of improving the system of command, control and communications in the TMO, which was practically nonexistent at that time. It had to be created anew. Under these conditions it was extremely important to maintain firm control, guaranteed to be reliable, over the men and equipment of air defense and air forces in the TMO. In this connection it was believed that air defense should be organized within the TMO (within the sector) on the territorial principle, assigning responsibility for its organization within the boundaries of the TMO to the commander-in-chief of sector troops (by this act, a new level of authority was introduced to assume responsibility over air defense); and within the boundaries of the military district, to the corresponding district troop commander. This was recognized to be a more flexible, dependable and easily controllable system, capable of successfully carrying out its missions. However, it was impossible to carry out all of the plans in their full volume, because soon after, the entire air defense system was once again rigidly centralized under the sole leadership of the commander-in-chief of air defense forces. And so, radical reforms of a major scale were not carried out in the Army and Navy in those years--the conservatism of the center prevailed. Almost all organizational measures carried out in the armed forces, mentioned at the beginning of this article, were rescinded, and everything was pushed back to square one. This was a huge mistake. Before dismantling the organisms that had evolved and been perfected by the second half of the 1970's, a fully adequate replacement for them should have first been prepared. Paradoxical though this may be, this is precisely what was absent. The dismantling of many structures that took decades to evolve, often hastily, with major mistakes and without adequate foresight, did harm to the Army and Navy. Their development was set back many years. The almost simultaneous replacement of the leadership of the sector main commands and numerous reductions of their numerical strength, as well as recision of direct subordination of military districts (groups of forces) to them transformed the administrations of the main commands into formal elements of leadership in subsequent years. And with the disintegration of the strategic grouping of Soviet and allied forces in Eastern Europe, the administration of the main command of forces of the Western Sector was abolished. I feel that it would be pertinent to cite here one of the statements made in this regard by Marshal of the Soviet Union S. F. Akhromeyev. In 1991, assessing the suitability of creating sector main commands, he said: "Main commands of sector troops were not created before the start of the Great Patriotic War, but all attempts to create them during the war ended in failure. It is too difficult, and practically impossible, to create such a large element of operational-strategic command and control and the corresponding contingent of administrative forces for it when already at war. Our opponents demanded immediate dismantling of both the structure and the system of command and control of the armed forces, including the main commands of sector troops (emphasis mine.--M. T.). ...The system for the country's postwar security, upon which so much energy and resources had been expended by our people, collapsed."[.sup]7[/] Such is the bitter conclusion. In may be said in conclusion that being a new form of leadership of troops and naval forces in peacetime, the sector main commands were felt to be fully capable of carrying out their missions, and they doubtlessly played a certain positive role. What was negative in this was, obviously, the fact that the sector main commands were created in the absence of a deep assessment of the military-political situation, in haste, and of course, without adequate foresight. Their operation over the course of approximately eight years turned out to be an expensive measure, even for those times. The imposition of a wide range of tasks upon the sector main command, with emphasis on the functions of controlling the military district, and the unjustified demands for fulfilling these tasks dispersed the efforts of the leadership and distracted it from more-objective execution of the main tasks. The low manning of the organizational structure, which was more than anything a copy of the administrative staff of the military district, and not even of the Group of Forces in Germany of that period, was no help either. Presence of such intermediate elements of troop leadership in peacetime (in the 1970's-1980's) may have been more effective had the rights and responsibilities in relation to subordinated troops been truly complete and harmoniously interrelated. In order to carry out all of the assigned tasks of leadership of troops and naval forces, the administration of the main command had to be larger in structure and operational composition, especially in the Western Sector (an example would be the main command of NATO Joint Armed Forces). The growing rate and scale of the present military reform and development of a new Russian Army as the heir to the best traditions of the Russian Army and Navy require new qualities on the part of command and control elements, ones which would encourage them to continually improve the style, forms and methods of command activities.
