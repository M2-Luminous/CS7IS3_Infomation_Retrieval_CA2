A senior company researcher said if a programmer inputs general data on the character of a model -- for instance, a model with weak characteristics -- into a workstation, the computer automatically outputs facial expressions and motions suited to the character on the basis of that data. He said the new technology will probably be put to practical use in the field of game software in a few years, and eventually in the field of motion pictures and broadcasting.
