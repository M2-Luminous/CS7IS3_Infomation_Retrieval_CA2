The report is a self-confession of how the British side ruined Sino-British cooperation. It is also excellent teaching material for Hong Kong compatriots to know the nature of British colonialists. The report affirms and supports Chris Patten's confrontational policy and provocative methods of pursuing political reform in Hong Kong and states that the British side will act unilaterally in the remaining years of the transition period. This clearly announces that in the next three years, Britain will not converge with the Basic Law or devote itself to a smooth transition, but will continue to proceed on the path of the "three violations," set up illegitimate organizations (such as a human rights commission) and various other obstacles to the composition of the special administrative region and the smooth implementation of the Basic Law, impose on the special administrative region groups of people chosen by Britain and new laws and a new political system unilaterally formulated, and challenge China in the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty. Reinforcing this line of confronting China to the end is now intended to win support from parliament. It is also intended to reduce domestic pressure on the Major administration, whose performance has been unceasingly criticized and which is heading toward a dead end, and shift the attention of the British people. The British administration thinks that by holding a confrontational attitude and adopting a stance of protecting British interests, it will immediately show an image of "being able to accomplish something" and will arouse the nationalist feelings of the British people. On the contrary, this only has exposed its weaknesses. First, this has exposed the fact that the British administration does not have powers of political analysis and will only continue to forfeit Britain's long-term interests in the Far East and forfeit the opportunity to develop Sino-British cooperation and develop British economic and trade interests. Second, it has exposed the administration's empty show of strength. The less strength it has, the more it wants to take risks. The outcome will be that its strength and timing will be at a disadvantage in the competition and it will surely fail. The report encourages unilaterally setting up the three-tier councils and pursuing Patten's proposals, while admitting that the British can do nothing to prevent China overturning his proposals and reorganizing the three-tier councils in accordance with the Basic Law. Third, it has exposed the fact that Britain's international card has failed everywhere and can no longer create the scenario. Britain is attempting to organize "allied forces" and launch a crusade on the Hong Kong issue. It has proposed that the European Union formulate a common policy to deal with China; used "human rights" and "democracy" as weapons in relation to loans, aid, and trade agreements with China; issued threats; and supported its stand on Hong Kong. But the international situation is that, on the question of joining the EU, Britain has been isolated from the European continent. At first, it appeared tough on relations with other European countries. Later, when none of its allies conformed, it drifted to their side like a deflated balloon. Its allies do not care about its complaints, and it simply does not have much influence in the EU. The fact that Britain played the "international card" in Europe by asking its allies to follow its policies toward China and Hong Kong is just ridiculous now that it has not correctly assessed its own strength and does not know its limitations at all. France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Finland, and Luxembourg are all busy developing relations with China, doing a lot of business, and seizing markets. Moreover, Portugal, taking a different path from Britain, is successfully implementing the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and negotiating cooperation. Now, Britain is asking for help from its allies, but who is going to listen? The British perhaps still cherish hopes about the "international card," so the report on Sino-British relations once again put forward plans and proposals in hope of success. This is a signal and Hong Kong people had better heighten their vigilance on the British Hong Kong authorities' internationalization scheme. The report does not take the facts into account when it links Sino-British relations, which are now at a low ebb, with "human rights obstacles." Of the Western countries, Britain was the first to recognize China, but did it ever consider "human rights obstacles then?" Why were there no "human rights obstacles" in the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's, when Britain maintained good relations with China? It was not until Patten began to pursue a confrontational line when he arrived in Hong Kong that Sino-British relations worsened. The report, however, did not mention these facts but shirked responsibility, so how can it serve its purpose? The fact that the report attacks Article 18 and Article 158 of the Basic Law precisely shows that the current low ebb of Sino-British relations is caused by Britain's incorrect policy on Hong Kong. Britain signed the Joint Declaration and promised that Hong Kong would be returned to China and that China would resume exercising sovereignty in 1997. But it is unwilling to do so and is using tricky plans to prevent China from exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong. Everyone on the street knows that Britain is opposed to and is preventing China from stationing troops in Hong Kong after 1997. Now, it is attacking China for having the right to proclaim a state of war preparedness in Hong Kong if it is invaded by a foreign enemy and if national unity is endangered and has attacked China's NPC Standing Committee for having the right to interpret the Basic Law. This has fully exposed Britain's ambition of opposing China's possession of sovereignty over Hong Kong in ways conducive to the extension of its concession-style rule. This "country within a country" only appeared in the former Shanghai concessions where the central government could not station troops, could not interpret or use Chinese laws, and did not have the right to defend its territory and deal with riots, and such rights are possessed by all countries. Only those in Britain who wish to throw Hong Kong into confusion and who shield troublemakers would put forward such absurd demands. The report is very frank about telling us the intentions which Britain has never told before. Now, Hong Kong people who love the country and who love Hong Kong can see more clearly and know more clearly what dangerous factors have to be removed in order to guarantee a smooth transition and guarantee Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.
