FR940727-1-00047 FR940727-1-00014 The exclusion, option 1, may also have an impact upon mercury-containing lamp processors. The Agency estimates that there are currently 15 facilities which process spent mercury-containing lamps. Two of these facilities recover spent mercury through retorting; the remaining 13 facilities separate the glass and aluminum ends, and send the mercury-containing phosphor powder to the two facilities that retort. Ten of the 15 lamp processing facilities are located in the three States where spent lamp management regulations exist. Although most recovery facilities are located in States with stringent State lamp disposal requirements, and would most likely will not be affected by today's proposed exclusion, a certain percentage of the spent lamps currently recovered at these facilities are generated in States with no specific lamp disposal requirements. EPA believes that a portion of mercury-containing lamps would no longer be sent for recovery under the proposed exclusion (option 1) since disposal in municipal landfills would be significantly less expensive. 5 Assuming that lamps generated outside of these States will not be sent for recovery, it is possible that 17 percent, or 16 million lamps, may be diverted. Using a lamp/revenue ratio for recovery facilities of $.44, total impact to the industry could be approximately $7 million dollars 6 in lost revenues ($469,000 per facility). Future recycling efforts may also be impacted since many of these facilities may retract plans for expansion in States which currently have no specific lamp disposal requirements. 5 EPA estimates that Subtitle D landfilling costs range between $10 and $150 per ton depending upon the region of the country. Compared with an average recycling cost of $1375 per ton, Subtitle D landfilling is significantly less expensive. 6 Similar estimates were not derived for Subtitle C waste haulers or disposal sites. Under option 2, the proposed special collection system, small and large quantity generators would not be allowed to choose to dispose of hazardous waste lamps in a municipal solid waste landfill. Thus the above impacts on Subtitle C waste haulers, disposal and spent lamp processing facilities would not be observed under the second option. VIII. References Baccini, P., G. Hensler, R.
