Dorenko introduces Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma, as an intelligent and diplomatic politician who was largely responsible for pacifying passions after the release. Rybkin had a meeting with President Yeltsin today, described by Dorenko as "scandalous because it did not produce any scandal." Dorenko continues: "Rybkin was surprised at the haste with which the Lefortovo inmates were released, said he did not know anything about the presidential staff pressurizing Kazannik, and declared that any fresh disturbances with old protagonists taking part will be suppressed by the president, whose actions will be supported by the Duma." Rybkin is then briefly shown comparing the coup plotters with some spoiled children who "screamed and cried, stamped their feet, or maybe dropped on the floor in the kitchen and kicked and got all covered with jam -- well, such things happen, you know." Yeltsin's aide Georgiy Satarov then says in a short interview: "During the conversation when presidential staff tried to stop the procurator signing the amnesty order, Kazannik several times suggested disbanding the Duma -- he returned to this option about three times. It was Kazannik, the knight of righteousness who is guarding the law, who proposed this." On the other hand, Dorenko says, "Rybkin could have made a good snake-charmer. He speaks in the quiet voice of a self-assured person. I entered his study today fully convinced that the authorities were going through another relationship crisis, and reemerged fully convinced that I had been hallucinating." "After the Duma won the main point, Ivan Rybkin is ready to make concessions about secondary points," he adds. Rybkin then says in an interview clip: "God forbid that those who are being released today thanks to the magnanimity of their country, the president, and the State Duma should spurn it or forget about it and start again, in the Moscow streets or elsewhere, the political thuggery which led to the tragic events of 4 October. The president, together with the State Duma and the Federation Council, will take most severe measures to stop such behavior. My personal opinion is that they [putschists] will have enough goodwill, intelligence, and human decency to behave differently." Dorenko then comments on the chances of a state of emergency being introduced. He says this is unlikely because neither the Duma nor Yeltsin's closest entourage are interested in it. He continues: "I understood from my conversation with Rybkin today that he would not play the card of miners' discontent, so that the idea of introducing the state of emergency would not as much as enter the president's mind." "The main compromise of the day is that the Duma has exchanged the release of Lefortovo prisoners for their arrest in case of even the slightest future misbehavior. Rybkin has managed to persuade Yeltsin that this is exactly what he, Yeltsin, has always wanted. As for the Kazannik episode, which looks so vexatiously embarrassing against this idyllic background, the authorities say it was just a misunderstanding," Dorenko concludes.
