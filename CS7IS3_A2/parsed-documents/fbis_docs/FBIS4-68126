FBIS4-68126 "jptot020__l94048" JPRS-TOT-94-020-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 9 May 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA JORDAN Report Reviews Details of `Afghans' Case Report Reviews Details of `Afghans' Case JN0905170594 Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic 9 May 94 p 28 JN0905170594 Amman AL-RA'Y Arabic BFN [Report by Ahmad Kurayshan] [Excerpts] The public prosecutor of the State Security Court has issued a decision dismissing the case of seven Jordanian Afghan defendants. The public prosecutor announced that the case does not fall within the court's jurisdiction and that he would refer the case to the attorney of the State Security Court, who should refer it to the competent judicial quarters. The decision stated that the State Security Court charged the defendants with participation in a conspiracy to carry out terrorist acts and planning to commit crimes against people and public funds. The decision said that, after investigating this case and studying it in detail, the public prosecutor of the State Security Court became convinced that the first defendant, Bura', and the second, Yahya, are members of the Jordanian Afghan movement who had left Jordan for Afghanistan in 1989 where they received military training. They stayed there for over a year, during which time they took part in the war there. In 1991, they returned to Jordan. In 1993, the two defendants got together again and discussed the idea of establishing a religious jihad organization that seeks to remove vice by force and to achieve the highest objective of this organization, the establishment of an Islamic state. The two set out the objectives of the organizations as follows: 1. Declaring as infidel the ruling regime in Jordan and all its civil and military institutions. 2. Attacking the state's civilian and military personnel, since they are followers of the ruling regime. 3. Assassinating certain Jordanian personalities, including intellectuals, economists, and men of letters. 4. Blowing up the Parliament building, since it is the legislative authority that passes legislation conflicting with the Holy Koran. 5. Smashing movie theaters and liquor stores inside the Kingdom. 6. Declaring as infidel women who do not wear an Islamic veil and considering them prisoners of war. The two defendants, Bura' and Yahya, then began looking for sources to finance this organization, especially to acquire weapons and pay for the expenses and financial obligations of the members of the organization. Consequently, the second defendant, Yahya, issued a ruling sanctioning the theft of funds from non-Muslims and considering the money they get from those people war spoils, as long as those people do not pay Islamic tax for their stay in a Muslim country. The second defendant also sanctioned the theft of bank funds which, they argue, are usurious. He also said it was permissible to take the money of a Muslim who does not pay alms tax either by force or by fraud. In accordance with this edict, the two defendants agreed to rob several stores and banks, such as the Arab Bank, Umm al-Summaq branch, and a goldsmith in al-Fuhays. They also planned to attack foot patrols to kill them, since they follow an infidel ruling regime, and to seize their weapons. The two defendants also agreed to recruit other elements to this organization. Thus, the first defendant, Bura', recruited another defendant, Wa'il, after explaining to him the aims of the organization and the methods it would adopt to achieve these aims. On 17 November 1993, defendant Yahya left Jordan for Saudi Arabia where he was arrested, while the first defendant, Bura', and the third defendant, Wa'il, began to prepare for the thefts that were agreed upon among the three defendants. Wa'il bought a 7-mm pistol [as published] for 400 dinars and two tear gas grenades to be used in the theft operations. [passage omitted] After verification, it has become clear that the established facts here are not in conformity with the provisions and elements of the first charge against the defendants; namely, participating in a conspiracy to carry out acts of terrorism, and that the actions carried out by all the defendants, even if proved to be true, do not constitute more than an offense, or an agreement to perpetrate crimes against people and their funds in violation of the provisions of Articles 157/1 and 158/3 of the Penal Code No. 16 of 1960. Since this offense, even if proven true, does not fall within the jurisdiction of the State Security Court in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the State Security Court Law No. 17 of 1959, amended by Law No. 6 of 1993, I have decided to dismiss the case as not falling within my jurisdiction, and to refer the file of the case to the attorney of the State Security Court to refer it to the competent judicial quarters. The defendants are: 1. Bura' Ghanim 'Abduh, alias Abu-Malik, 33 years old. 2. Yahya Ibrahim al-Zughli, alias Abu-Humam, 35 years old. 3. Wa'il Rashid al-Waza'ifi, 24 years old. 4. Ahmad Nasuh al-Waza'ifi, 26 years old. 5. Ahmad Musa Naji 'Amirah, 25 years old. 6. Isma'il 'Abd-al-Wadud al-'Isawi, 22 years old. 7. 'Ali Muhammad Mahmud al-Faqih, 24 years old.
