FBIS3-40891 "jpsea002___94024" JPRS-SEA-94-002 Document Type:JPRS Document Title:East Asia/South East Asia 18 February 1994 PHILIPPINES Proposal To Legalize Clandestine Gun-Making 94P30029A 94P30029A Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] The 16 January Manila BALITA in Tagalog on page 2 reports that Interior Secretary Rafael Alunan has proposed legalizing the clandestine gun-making industry to curb the spread of unlicensed guns, and at the same time earn dollars from weapons exports to Asian countries. Alunan said that as a first step toward legalization, unlicensed gunsmiths in central Danao city, the country's gun-manufacturing center, could form a cooperative. BALITA reports that efforts to quash the industry have failed, partly because the gunsmiths are protected by some politicians. The paper also reports that Danao gunsmiths, formerly farmers, produce thousands of guns every year, and these guns find their way into the hands of criminal gangs in Japan and Taiwan. The guns include revolvers, shotguns, and pistols that sell for $25 to $290.
