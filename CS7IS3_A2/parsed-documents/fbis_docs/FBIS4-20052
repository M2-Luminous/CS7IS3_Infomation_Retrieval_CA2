In his "good city" of Rouen, on the same platform, the most eminent leaders of the majority -- neo-Gaullists, Liberals, and Social Democrats -- vied with each other in enthusiastically professing their faith in Europe. With 50 days to go before the European election, the RPR [Rally for the Republic] and UDF [French Democratic Union] clearly defined their course of action. It boils down to one word: unity. The bitterness aroused in the RPR and PR [Republican Party] by the defeat of Jean-Francois Deniau as head of the majority's single list has been forgotten. All energies are mobilized in the leaderships to enable Dominique Baudis to achieve the best possible vote on 12 June. "Dominique," PR President [and Industry Minister] Gerard Longuet said, "we did not campaign for you, but we will mobilize in support of your list without bitterness or ulterior motives." The same enthusiasm was expressed by Alain Juppe [foreign minister and RPR secretary general]: The RPR is committed "with sincerity, good faith, and dynamism." Inspired by a desire for effectiveness, the two majority partners chose to say nothing during the campaign about their real disagreements on Europe: a Europe of nations defended by the RPR, a federal Europe with a president desired by the CDS. Between now and 12 June, the RPR and UDF leaders will therefore strive, especially during their planned big rallies (Toulouse, Strasbourg, and Paris), to "reconcile the French people with Europe." Europe? "A great opportunity for France," in Gerard Longuet's view. And Alain Juppe replied: "France needs a strong Europe." In this context, [Justice Minister] Pierre Mehaignerie also wanted the majority "not to be unaware of those who voted against Maastricht" and called for "intelligent safeguards" at the gates of the European Union. This is a way of holding out a hand to the RPR and UDF voters tempted by Philippe de Villiers' list. In the same sphere, Dominique Baudis said that Europe should be able to protect its jobs, for instance in the aeronautics industry, by resisting the Americans in the coming 10 months of "very tough" negotiations. But a defensive attitude is not enough. European construction, Centrist Jacques Barrot exclaimed, must serve as a lever to build "an upright, influential, and masterful France." And its main objective must be employment, Valery Giscard d'Estaing strongly emphasized, hinting that the European institutions "would have done better to devote more energy to employment and less to expansion." Now that the message of unity and hope has been launched, the majority party leaderships will resume their detailed diplomatic work to draw up the list of 87 candidates to be submitted to the voters on 12 June.
