The latest Gallup poll shows there are still 37 percent of Austrians who are undecided whether they should vote "yes" or "no" on 12 June. This is the highest proportion of undecided people that has ever existed for a political vote in Austria such a short time before the decision is made. Nevertheless, the majority in favor of EU membership, which has been obvious for months, remains in effect: Two weeks before the European referendum, 50 percent of Austrians say they will vote "yes." In the interviews for the poll 36 percent said that they will vote "no." When asked about the referendum, 14 percent say that they do not have any preference. In its studies on the EU Gallup is asking additional questions concerning Austrians' certainty regarding their decisions. Most recently, the following findings were made: - In addition to the 14 percent whose voting behavior is "completely open," there are 10 percent who want to make a final decision only in the voting both and another 13 percent, who might still be persuaded one way or the other by arguments or events -- this means: During the last week one has to struggle for 37 percent (more than one out of three Austrians). - Another detailed Gallup analysis shows how exciting the race is: Of the 50 percent who will vote "yes," four-fifths say that they are "firmly decided." This means: At the moment, the government can rely only on 40 percent of definite "yes" votes for the time being. Among the opponents only about two-thirds are firmly determined to vote "no." Thus, Haider and company have only 23 percent of definite "no" votes. Says Professor Fritz Karmasin [of the Gallup Institute]: "At the moment any result is possible!" In this poll, currently the most extensive one on EU membership in Austria (each week 1,000 personal interviews, representative for all of Austria -- plus 500 telephone interviews to show topical trends), Gallup also investigated the mood of Austrians two weeks before the EU decision. It is surprising that the mood of the population still seems to be clearly in favor of the EU, despite signs to the contrary. The details: -- A total of 54 percent of all Austrians believe that the referendum on 12 June will end in a "yes" -- only 16 percent believe in a majority "no." - A total of 47 percent of Austrians believe that "positive effects" will dominate in case of EU membership. Only 37 percent primarily see negative effects. - However, only 30 percent of Austrians polled think shortly before the referendum that they are "well informed" -- particularly bad is the level of information among retirees (26 percent), workers (25 percent), and Austrians with net incomes of less than 12,000 schillings. In fact, despite the general approval for the EU of 50 to 36 percent, EU rejection is becoming increasingly clear among the problematic target groups: - As many as 49 percent of people with wages below 12,000 schillings -- who are a particularly important group because of the high degree of determination to vote in the referendum -- are against the EU, only 35 percent are for it. - Among the farmers approval for the EU has slightly risen most recently -- 35 percent intend to vote "yes" -- but "no" still has a clear majority of 53 percent. - There is also a slight trend toward "yes" among retirees: According to the latest poll, 44 percent are in favor, 40 percent against joining the EU. Last week, the opponents were still slightly ahead with 43 to 42. - However, the situation in some provinces is a threatening omen for the advocates of EU membership. The change in the mood in eastern Austria, above all in Lower Austria, which was noted already in last week's NEWS, is consolidating with great speed. In Lower Austria and in Burgenland already 52 percent intend to vote against EU membership and only 42 percent for it. This is a difference of 10 percent, which is beyond any statistical fluctuations. - The frontlines are stabilizing among the party followers. Among the voters of the Social Democratic Party of Austria the proportion of "yes" votes (61 percent) has stayed the same, among voters of the Austrian People's Party it has even increased by 5 percent (now 60 percent). In contrast, the voices in favor of EU membership became softer among the opposition parties. Only 34 percent of the followers of the Freedom Party of Austria (last week 40 percent) are in favor of EU membership and 15 (18) percent of the Greens.
