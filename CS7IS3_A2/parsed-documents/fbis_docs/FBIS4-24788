The "circular" says: Over the past year, public security organizations have done a lot of work and achieved some good results in investigating and banning the illegal production and sale of police uniforms and police insignia and emblems and cracking down on the activities of impersonating policemen. Nevertheless, the situation of producing and selling police uniforms, police insignia and emblems, and police equipment by some plants and units is still quite serious. The situation of impersonating policemen by a small number of people is still quite conspicuous. Some criminals bought police uniforms to impersonate policemen and commit crimes. This has seriously endangered public security in the society and undermined the reputation of the people's police. The "circular" points out: It is imperative to seriously handle those cases involving the illegal production and sale of police uniforms and signs, the illegal wearing of police uniforms and insignia, and swindling by impersonating policemen in accordance with related regulations. It is necessary to investigate criminal responsibility of those whose cases are serious and constitute crimes.
