He complained about the increase directly to Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso in a telephone call early in the morning. The increase was not released by the Finance Ministry the previous afternoon, and this has been a practice in the Itamar Franco government. Newspapers and television stations learned about the increase through the distribution companies, while the resolution was not published by the official gazette until 11 January. In addition to complaining about the increase granted on the sly, President Franco ordered that, as of now, all new increases will be implemented only after advance notice to the public. It was the president himself who, in the beginning of his government, adopted this initiative that fuel price readjustments would be implemented only after notifying consumers at least 12 hours in advance. "There will be no more increases in the dead of the night," President Franco said then. According to Planalto Palace spokesman Francisco Baker, President Franco was aware of the fuel price increase, but he complained about the "failure in communication" that prevented the announcement of new prices to the public. As of 0000 last night the gasoline price increased to 219 real cruzeiros per liter, alcohol prices to 172 real cruzeiros, while diesel oil went up to 136 real cruzeiros per liter.
