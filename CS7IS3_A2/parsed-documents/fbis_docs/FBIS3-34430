The statement asked for severe, deterrent punitive measures against the aggressive Serbs and immediately lifting the siege of the city of Sarajevo and all other Islamic cities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It also urged supplying the Bosnians with arms, equipment, food, and medicine, and allowing them to defend themselves by lifting the arms embargo, if the international forces do not immediately oppose the aggression against land, man, and human values. The statement asserted that the painful, brutal massacre against Sarajevo by the shells of the Serbs, which killed or injured hundreds of people and targeted defenseless civilians -- elderly, women, and children -- is a link in the brutal aggression against innocent Muslims. The massacre took place amid international silence and mere verbal decisions.
