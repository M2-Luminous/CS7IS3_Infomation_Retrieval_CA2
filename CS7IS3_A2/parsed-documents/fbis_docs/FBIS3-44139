The inhabitants of Abeche woke up yesterday to sustained weapons fire. Some elements of the Chadian National Front [FNT] attacked the military garrison and the Gendarmerie. This attack left 29 dead among the attackers and two among the government forces. Defense Minister Mamadou Regui immediately went to the site. For the moment, the situation is under control, and the people have resumed their normal activities, as the minister of defense explained in a statement this afternoon in Abeche. Here, Minister Mamadou Regui speaks to our special correspondent Solomon Ngartha. [Begin Regui recording] Soon after our arrival, (?we noticed that) the situation was quite alarming. We saw some fighting. We saw dead bodies almost everywhere in the town, and we still heard shooting here and there. After the agreement, the elements of the FNT gathered here in Abeche. They numbered about 400. They were waiting to be absorbed into the army, but unfortunately there were some constraints here and there [words indistinct] that they were deceived by some individuals--by people who have left the other fronts to come to Abeche and some accomplices in the town of Abeche. These elements mutinied and broke into the storerooms here and looted more than 400 weapons, took ammunition, and began the attack. After some hours of intensive fighting, the Chadian National Army got control of the situation. When we arrived here, the town was already under the full control of our elements. The survivors managed to flee in many directions. Searches are currently going on. Our troops are all over the place. We have organized searches in the town of Abeche, but--as you know--the town is very big. It is the Gendarmerie that is carrying out this search. These elements, it is said, infiltrate [words indistinct] by midnight, we saw some elements who were stealing and who broke into people's homes here and there to steal. Since this morning, the situation has been calm. The town has begun to come back to life. Shops have opened. It is true that it not all the shops, but there are traders who have already opened the doors of their shops and have begun working. The town is quite lively. I have met with some traders. I have met with traditional chiefs and village chiefs and unit heads. We discussed many issues and I told them that their security is guaranteed. I personally engaged myself to search for these [words indistinct] in the Army and in the Gendarmerie. We have seen some elements who are currently under (?detention) and who will be brought before court. Concerning the FNT elements who are in flight, I mean those in flight who are hiding somewhere in the town or are very far away in the bush, I still extend to them a hand of reconciliation. They must surrender. Their security will be guaranteed because the agreement is still valid provided they return. I think that they have heard the appeal by their leader, the chief of staff, (Dawuud), who was with us today. He launched an appeal. He has asked them to return. Well, if they return, their lives are guaranteed and we will take all the measures necessary to have them brought into the Army, have them organized, and [words indistinct]. [end recording]
