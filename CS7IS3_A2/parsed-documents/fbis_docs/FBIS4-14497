Some 90 per cent of the voters in the Crimean Tatar ethnic constituency cast their ballots for candidates from the kurultay- mejlis, while the national movement of Crimean Tatars, which is in opposition to the kurultay, managed to poll slightly above 5 per cent of the votes. The telegram said this outcome was prompted by the intensive treatment of the people by means of the mass media, numerous violations of the voting procedure, overt campaigning for kurultay candidates on the election day, which is banned under law. The leaders of the Crimean Tatars' movement assess the election results as a plot against Ukraine, Russia and Crimea, as well as the Crimean Tatars, the CIS, the world community, the truth and justice.
