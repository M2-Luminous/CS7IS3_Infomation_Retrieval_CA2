The exit polls, the legality of which had earlier been questioned by the interior minister, indicate a great advance by the opposition parties, and among them especially by the Socialists. The Median polling agency conducted its survey together with NEPSZABADSAG. Their preliminary plans were to conduct a survey in 704 districts, but as a result of last week's antipolling campaign, pollsters were turned away from several localities by the authorities. According to Median, it is conceivable that because of the campaign there were more people than usual among right-wing voters who refused to answer, and therefore they might have somewhat underestimated the percentage of national-conservative voters. Incidentally, the pollsters of Szonda Ipsos who prepared their survey for MAGYAR HIRLAP had similar experiences. Median's survey, prepared on the basis of a national sample, was completed a few minutes after the polls officially closed. According to the survey, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] received 33 percent of the votes for party tickets. The Association of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] followed with 19 percent, while third place, with 11 percent, went to the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. The Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] got 10 percent, and the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] got 7 percent each. According to the preliminary survey, three representatives were elected in the first round: Gabor Kuncze [SZDSZ] in Pest county, Tamas Suchman [MSZP] in Somogy county, and Agnes Gyarfas Rado, also a Socialist, in Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen county. The Szonda Ipsos agency also conducted a national survey. Their ranking: 27 percent for the MSZP, 20 percent for the SZDSZ, 12 percent each for the MDF and Fidesz, 10 percent for the FKGP, and 8 percent for the KDNP. According to Szonda's data, of the 32 Budapest election districts, Socialist candidates were in the lead in 25 and Free Democrats in seven. Nationally, 104 MSZP candidates and 40 Free Democrats are in first place in the election districts for individual representatives. The Hungarian Gallup Institute, whose pollsters questioned 134,733 voters, arrived basically at similar results. According to the afternoon survey of the Gallup Institute, the MSZP led with 31 percent. The Socialists were followed by the SZDSZ with 20 percent, the MDF with 10 percent, the Fidesz and the FKGP with 9 percent each, and the KDNP with 7 percent. All three exit polls indicate that no new party will have seats in the Hungarian National Assembly.
