Katyal: "U.S. Policy Review Sees No Change"; quotation marks as published] [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 29. Contrary to the belief here, the U.S. Administration maintains that its policy on South Asia remained consistent in 1993 despite the change in presidency. According to an official year-end review of the U.S. relations with the Indian sub-continent (details of which are available here), most of the themes sounded by the Clinton Administration on "South Asia--nuclear non-proliferation, democracy-building, human rights, free trade and economic reform--echo the policies set in place by his predecessor, George Bush." That is because, it says, these broad goals best define American interests in the post-cold war world and are particularly relevant to South Asia. Indo-Pak. tensions: The historic tensions between the region's two strongest countries, India and Pakistan, the review notes, have become far more troubling in recent years, now that both are widely considered to possess a nuclear weapons capability. Added to the volatile mix is the ongoing instability in Afghanistan, where security risks have prevented the United States from reopening its embassy. The breakup of the former Soviet Union evoked a wholesale re-evaluation in Washington of U.S. relations with the former eastern bloc, but its effect on U.S. South Asia policy has been subtle. In the Presidency of Mr. Bill Clinton, the changes, it is pointed out, have come in the degree of emphasis placed on particular issues. It cites the views expressed by the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, Ms. Robin Raphel, and other officials from time to time that the State of Jammu and Kashmir is a "disputed" territory. Questioning the suggestions in sections of South Asian media, "for largely parochial reasons" that the Clinton Administration had modified the South Asia policy, it quotes the following remarks of the State Department spokesman in November: "As we have noted consistently since 1947, the U.S. believes the entire geographic area of the former princely State of Jammu and Kashmir is disputed territory. The U.S. believes the best way to resolve the dispute over Kashmir is through direct discussions between the Governments of India and Pakistan as envisioned in the (1972) Shimla agreement, taking into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people." Delhi sees new elements: As seen in New Delhi, the Clinton Administration introduced new elements in its South Asia policy, with recurring references to the "wishes of the Kashmiri people" and its willingness to help resolve (in other words, "mediate") the problem if desired by the two sides. The debate over the possible scrapping of the Pressler Amendment is summed up thus: "Another U.S. policy that is likely to provoke regional opposition but remain unchanged is the suspension of U.S. aid to Pakistan. The 1985 Pressler Amendment to U.S. law requires that aid to Pakistan be withheld unless the U.S. President can certify that Islamabad does not possess nuclear weapons capability. The Bush administration revoked Pakistan's certification in 1990, and the aid cutoff has remained in effect ever since. Although the Clinton White House indicated in 1993 an interest in removing `country-specific' language from the foreign aid law to allow presidential discretion in such decisions, the principle that underlines the Pressler Amendment continues to be upheld. As a result, the aid cutoff can be expected to continue until Pakistan's nuclear programme ceases to be of international concern." Priority for non-proliferation: Citing Mr. Clinton's address to the U.N. General Assembly that he had "made non-proliferation, one of our nation's highest priorities," the review describes how that official message was brought home during an October State Department briefing, with the statement that the U.S. was "particularly concerned" about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in regions such as South Asia. "We have ongoing, senior-level discussions on this issue with the Governments of Pakistan and India and we will continue to urge both Governments to undertake direct, high-level discussions on this and other issues dividing them, including Kashmir." Among the "good news" were the decision by India and Pakistan to resume official talks and the elections in the two countries, according to the official document. The Pakistani elections, according to the review, were widely hailed as having been the freest and fairest in its history with some observers suggesting that the process may have given birth to a genuine two-party system. The significance of the Assembly elections in India was spelt out thus: "Hindu-Muslim tensions heated up with the December 1992 destruction by Hindu nationalists of the historic mosque of Ayodhya, and riots which left hundreds dead. Tensions were further heightened by a bomb attack in downtown Bombay and the siege by Indian security forces of the sacred Hazratbal mosque in Kashmir, where Muslim militants had barricaded themselves. Those and other events led many to predict that Indian politics would become increasingly fractious and polarised by religious extremism. Instead, voters in India's recent elections largely rejected the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) Hindu nationalist party. The election results were widely interpreted as a reaffirmation of India's status as a modern, secular State." "In a positive move that was lauded by the U.S. and international organisations, the Indian Government agreed this year to allow human rights observers to enter Kashmir and investigate reports of abuses committed by New Delhi's security forces," the review said.
