Our special envoy, Monique Mas, has met him and asked him to explain the position of his movement toward the UN decision to deploy 5,500 blue helmets for a humanitarian mission in Rwanda: [Begin recording] [Kanyarengwe] We in fact agree that a humanitarian force should come and help and facilitate the activities of the humanitarian organizations operating in our country, and also to help people in dangerous situations, especially those confronted by a crazy militia and its massacres. But what we don't understand is why their number is quite high in proportion to the task assigned to them. We find the figure of 5,000 is [word indistinct]. We thought a force of about 2,000 men would be enough. [Mas] You seem to be worried in case this humanitarian force becomes a buffer force? [Kanyarengwe] It has often been noticed that for one reason or another, there is always an authority which tries to deflect such a force from its task [words indistinct]. We are not afraid of this and we are not excessively worried about it. If this ever happens, we will take appropriate measures. Once again, we insist that this force should not exceed 2,000. [Mas] Tell us what will specifically happen -- are you ready to hand over the airport which is under your control to the United Nations? [Kanyarengwe] Yes, we discussed with the United Nations this issue of turning the airport into a neutral zone. We replied that since we fought many battles to conquer this airport, we intend to keep it under our control and in security and put it at the disposal of the United Nations for any activity it wishes to undertake. [Mas] The international community is urging you to end the war and agree to a cease-fire. What would make you end the war and what are your conditions? [Kanyarengwe] We would have hoped that the international community would help us to end the war from day one when the massacres started, when people were being mutilated, maltreated, and tortured, to put an end to the work of the assassins in the authorities. There was an urgent need to put an end to massacres, but instead, the international community came quickly to the help of their nationals and turned its back on us. Finally, it was only after thousands of people had been killed that the international community expressed its indignation. We are shocked and we were shocked by this attitude. The international community has abandoned us. [end recording]
