The one-day meeting provides Mr Major with an opportunity to enhance his image as a European statesman in advance of June's Euro elections after an embarrassing climbdown over EU [European Union] voting rights. Officials have stressed the close personal relationship between the two leaders but divisions between Germany and Britain have been reported over who should be the next president of the European Commission. Britain wants Sir Leon Brittan, the senior British Commissioner, to succeed Jacques Delors in the 150,000 pound sterling a year job. But it is understood Mr Kohl favours Belgian Premier Jean-Luc Dehaene. Tory Euro sceptics claim Mr Dehaene is an avowed federalist. Stepping out of a German Air Force jet at RAF Northolt, west London, Mr Kohl refused to be drawn on the issue. He joked that he could then be required to back every member state's chosen candidate each time he visited their country. Mr Major said: "It is our view that Sir Leon is the best candidate. We will need to discuss that with all our colleagues, it will be a collective decision." Mr Kohl stressed the warmth of Britain's relationship with Germany and Mr Major said he was delighted to see "such a good friend of the UK" back on British soil. Turning briefly to the situation in Gorazde, Mr Major said: "It does seem we had a pretty quiet night in Gorazde. At the moment aid is getting in and patients are getting out. I am delighted that is proving to be the case and I hope further examination today will show that the Serb armaments have been moved 20 kilometres away, as requested." The two leaders then boarded a helicopter for Chequers, Mr Major's official country residence, for around three hours of talks before they return to London to join their respective economic and foreign ministers, who are holding separate talks, for a news conference at the Foreign Office.
