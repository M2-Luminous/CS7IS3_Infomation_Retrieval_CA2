FBIS4-36531 "drnes112_m_94002" FBIS-NES-94-112 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 Jordan Results of Washington Talks `Step on A Long Road' Results of Washington Talks `Step on A Long Road' JN0906112994 Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic 9 Jun 94 pp 1, 27 JN0906112994 Amman AL-DUSTUR Arabic BFN [Editorial: "A Step on a Long Road"] [Text] The results of the tripartite Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli committee in Washington -- with regard to the Jordanian-Israeli talks -- are considered a step on a long road. This step could lead to achieving tangible progress in the peace process if the Israeli intentions are honest and if the Israeli leaders give momentum to the requirements of this process. If these results can be seen as a turning point in a negotiating track that has lagged behind for several months, this will be a beginning surrounded by all kinds of dangers. At the front of these dangers is Israel's possible return to its traditional course known for its evasion of requirements, maneuvering over texts and words, and attempting to gain time. We still remember well those Israeli methods. In light of all this, we must not be overoptimistic or propagate peace scenarios and bilateral or regional cooperation plans before everything becomes clear. That is, we must not be so before Israel rids itself of the mentality that it is the dominating force, and before it agrees on restoring all legitimate and recognized rights. Therefore, we view the results of the tripartite meetings and the results they produced -- in terms of the agreement on a detailed agenda for the Jordanian-Israeli talks -- as a first step on a long way and the beginning for all possibilities, including positive possibilities. This will be achieved if Israel's intentions are honest and if the spirit of reconciliation and peace triumphs over the spirit of hegemony and military and ethical superiority.
