FR940114-1-00066 FR940114-1-00014 GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION 48 CFR Parts 519 and 552 [GSAR Notice 5&hyph;384] General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation; Small Business Subcontracting Program AGENCY: Office of Acquisition Policy, GSA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This notice invites written comments on a proposed revision which expresses GSA's expectation that offerors under GSA procurements, in submitting required subcontracting plans, will do more than merely restate minimum plan requirements described at FAR 52.219&hyph;9. GSA also expects subcontracting plans to demonstrate aggressiveness, creativity, and innovation in involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns in subcontracting opportunities and an understanding of the requirement that these concerns be afforded the maximum practicable opportunity to perform as subcontractors in the offeror's procurements. In negotiated solicitations, the subcontracting plan will be negotiated with price and any technical and management proposal required by the solicitation. In sealed bid solicitations, target goals may be stated by GSA in the solicitation. GSA understands, however, that offerors' subcontracting circumstances may vary greatly. The proposed revision also deletes various sections because they concern nonregulatory material. DATES: Comments are due in writing on or before March 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to the GSA Desk Officer, room 3235, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503 and Marjorie Ashby, Office of GSA Acquisition Policy, 18th and F Streets, NW., room 4006, Washington, DC 20405. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul Linfield, Office of GSA Acquisition Policy, (202) 501&hyph;1224. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Executive Order 12866 This rule was not submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review because the rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and, therefore, was not required to be submitted. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the GSA certifies that the proposed rule will not have significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, since the revised subcontracting plan requirements in the proposed regulation will not apply to small business concerns. Accordingly, an initial regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The retitled provision at 552.219&hyph;73 contains an information collection requirement that is subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), and it has been submitted to OMB for approval under the Act. Comments on the information collection may be submitted to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for GSA, Washington, DC 20503. The title of the information collection is ``GSAR 552.219&hyph;73 Preparation, Submission, and Negotiation of Subcontracting Plans.'' The provision requires all offerors, other than small business concerns, responding to a negotiated solicitation to submit a subcontracting plan with their respective offers so that a plan can be negotiated concurrently with other parts of the proposal. The respondents are potential GSA contractors. The contracting officer will use the information to evaluate whether GSA's expectation that subcontracting opportunities exist for small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business is reasonable under the circumstances; negotiate goals consistent with statutory requirements and acquisition objectives; and expedite the award process. The estimated annual burden for this additional collection is 14,690 hours. This is based on an estimated burden per response of 11.3 hours, a proposed frequency of one response per respondent, and an estimated number of likely respondents of 1,300.
