This policy applies to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Cuba, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Moldova, Mongolia, North Korea, Russia, South Africa, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. This policy also applies to countries with respect to which the United States maintains an arms embargo (e.g., Burma, China, Haiti, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan, the former Yugoslavia, and Zaire) or whenever an export would not otherwise be in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States. Comprehensive arms embargoes are normally the subject of a State Department notice published in the Federal Register . The exemptions provided in the regulations in this subchapter, except §§123.17 and 125.4(b)(13) of this subchapter, do not apply with respect to articles originating in or for export to any proscribed countries or areas. * * * * * (d) Terrorism.

The countries in this category are: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. The same countries are identified pursuant to section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)). * * * * * (f) Angola. Consistent with U.N. Security Council Resolution 864 of September 15, 1993, an arms embargo exists with respect to UNITA. Accordingly, exports subject to this subchapter are prohibited in accordance with Security Council Resolution 864, Executive Order 12865 of September 29, 1993, and the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions Regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury, on December 10, 1993 (58 FR 64904).
