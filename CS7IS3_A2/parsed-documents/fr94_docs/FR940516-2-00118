FR940516-2-00118 FR940516-2-00081 DEPARTMENT OF STATE [Public Notice 2004] Public Information Collection Requirement Submitted to OMB for Review AGENCY: Department of State. ACTION: The Department of State has resubmitted the following public information collection requirement to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35. SUMMARY: Public Law 103&hyph;94, effective February 3, 1994, authorized the garnishment of salary of Federal employees for unpaid debts. Under Executive Order 12897, the Office of Personnel Management was delegated authority to promulgate regulations to implement the commercial garnishment provisions in section 9 of that law. OPM has issued interim regulations which, among other things, specify the ``minimally required'' information to accompany legal process (5 CFR 582.203). The law also requires that priority be given and special treatment be provided for garnishments for child support and alimony under 42 U.S.C. 659, 661, and 662. The information proposed to be collected on the Department of State form DS&hyph;1932 includes the minimally required information and facilitates differentiation between commercial garnishments and those for child support or alimony. The following summarizes the information collection proposal submitted to OMB: Type of request_New collection Originating office_Bureau of Legal Affairs Title of information collection_U.S. Department of State Garnishment Application Form No._DS&hyph;1932 Frequency_On occasion Respondents_Parties seeking garnishment of employees' salary Estimated number of respondents_500 Average hours per response_15 minutes Total estimated burden hours_125 44 U.S.C. 3504(h) does not apply, as no rulemaking is being conducted in connection with this information collection.
