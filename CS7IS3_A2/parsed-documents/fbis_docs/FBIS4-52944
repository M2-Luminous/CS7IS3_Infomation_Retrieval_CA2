Led by the party, our country is entering a new stage of its national history in which we will have to carry out national industrialization and modernization under the conditions and circumstances Vietnam is now facing. Given Vietnam's choice of approach -- and with the wisdom, creativity, and self-reliance of the Vietnamese people -- we are determined to prevail in our renovation process and national development and keep pace with our friends across the five continents while retaining our own identity. Lying ahead are not only new opportunities but also countless difficulties and challenges requiring every person, every collective and locality, and the entire country to show the determination to surge forward by continuing to develop their tradition of persistently struggling toward the goal of building a prosperous people, a powerful country, and an equitable and civilized society. In this way we will be worthy of the sacrifices of preceding generations.
