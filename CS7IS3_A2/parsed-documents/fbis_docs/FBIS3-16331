The statement issued yesterday notes that discussions concerning the Lithuanian-Polish treaty on friendly relations and good-neighborly cooperation, which is due to be signed, often acquire the nature of unilateral accusations. The concern by the Ministry of Foreign affairs was caused by a statement issued by a group of Kaunas City Council deputies which categorically demands that the text of the draft treaty be made public and even points out which concepts should be included into the text of the draft treaty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the negotiations with Poland were proceeding according to the principles of international law and practice and according to the decision of 1992 adopted by the government of Lithuania, which says that information about negotiations with foreign countries up until the signing of the agreement is a state secret of the Republic of Lithuania. The Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejects any such pressure as an attempt to influence the course of negotiations and to complicate mutual relations of the two states. As is known, in a democratic country confidence in the quality of work of the diplomatic service is tested and verified during the ratification of the signed treaty in parliament.
