FR940523-2-00073 FR940523-2-00041 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Public Housing Primary Care Program Approximately $8.7 million is available for awards. It is anticipated that the above funds will be awarded to support up to 7 noncompeting continuation grants ranging from $217,667 to $375,000, and up to 14 competing grants, ranging from $125,000 to $775,000 each for a project period of up to three years. Eligible Entities To be eligible, an applicant must be a public or nonprofit private entity and have the capacity to effectively administer this grant program. In an area where there are a certified Resident Management Corporation (RMC) and public or private nonprofit entities providing primary health services, including those receiving funds under sections 330 or 340 of the PHS Act, the organizations are encouraged to submit only one application demonstrating collaboration between the respective organizations. Applicable Requirements Grantees providing primary health services directly and organizations with whom grantees contract to provide primary health services must be participating and qualified providers under the Medicaid plan approved under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, and must maximize payment for services available from private insurance, Medicare, other Federal programs, and other third-party sources. Grantees entering into contracts for services may be granted a waiver of this requirement if the organization they contract with does not impose a charge or accept payment available from any third-party payor, including payment under any insurance policy or under any Federal or State health benefits program, including Medicaid. The Secretary may not make a grant to an applicant unless the applicant signs an agreement indicating that, whether the services are provided directly or through contract, services under the grant will be provided without regard to ability to pay for the services. Further, if a charge is imposed, it will: (1) be made according to a schedule of charges that is made available to the public; (2) not be imposed on any resident of public housing with an income less than the official poverty level; and (3) be adjusted to reflect the income and resources of the resident. For applicants which are public entities (e.g., State or local health departments or institutions of higher education) the Secretary may not award a grant unless the public entity agrees that, with respect to the costs to be incurred by such entity in carrying out the purposes of the grant, the entity will make available non-Federal contributions in cash toward such costs in an amount equal to $1.00 for each $1.00 of Federal funds. In-kind contributions will not constitute acceptable contributions. Also, funds provided by the Federal Government, or services assisted or subsidized by the Federal Government, may not be included in determining the amount of the non-Federal contributions. Project Requirements The following services are required by Section 340A and must be provided either directly or through contract: (1) Primary health care services, as defined in section 330(b)(1) of the PHS Act, including health screening, and health counseling and education services for residents of public housing, on the premises of public housing projects or at other locations immediately accessible to residents of public housing; (2) Referral of residents, as appropriate, to qualified facilities and practitioners for necessary field services; (3) Outreach services to inform residents of the availability of such services (especially high risk women of child-bearing age); and (4) Aid to residents in establishing eligibility for assistance under entitlement programs (e.g., Medicaid; Women, Infants and Children program; Aid to Families with Dependent Children) and in obtaining services, under Federal, State and local programs providing health services, mental health services, or social services. In addition, applicants may also provide the following optional services: (1) Training of public housing residents to provide health screening and educational services; and (2) Health services to individuals who are not residents of public housing, if those services will be provided to such individuals under the same terms and conditions as such services are provided to the residents. Restrictions on the Use of Grant Funds The following restrictions apply to the use of grants funds: (1) The applicant may not expend more than 10 percent of the Federal grant funds for the purpose of administering the grant; (2) Grant funds may not be used for inpatient services;
