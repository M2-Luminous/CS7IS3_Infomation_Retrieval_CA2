Referring to the 1991 agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia according to which some 115,000 Iranians could go for hajj pilgrimage each year, and holding of 'Bara'at' (deliverance from pagans) rally was accepted, the `TEHRAN TIMES' said that Riyadh has unilaterally canceled the agreement and reduced the number to 61,600 for this year. "The Saudi ruling family is governing a country that has a special status in the Islamic world," noted the paper adding that they should "understand the sentiments and philosophies of one billion Muslims who are not Saudi citizens but believed that the house of God belongs to all of them." "It is in the Saudi's interest to facilitate Muslim's needs and provide them with security and accommodations," the article said. Muslims cannot sit idle and watch a government create obstacles to prevent them from performing their religious obligations, it added. Pointing to the large number of the elderly Iranians who were in the waiting list to take a trip to Mecca and perform their religious duties, the paper said Iran has been "forced" to accept a reduced quota for this year's hajj. It concluded by saying that to show good faith, the Saudi Government should help Muslims perform their hajj duties, including the Bara'at rally.
