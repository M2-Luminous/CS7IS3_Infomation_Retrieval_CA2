FR940428-0-00060 FR940428-0-00022 Regulatory Evaluation This section summarizes the full regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA that provides detailed estimates of the economic consequences of this regulatory action. This summary and the full evaluation quantify, to the extent practicable, estimated costs and anticipated benefits to the private sector, consumers, and Federal, state, and local governments. Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to analyze the economic impact of regulatory changes on small entities. Finally, the Office of Management and Budget directs agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA has determined that this rule: (1) will generate benefits that justify its costs and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is not significant as defined in Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures; (3) will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) will not have a negative impact on international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below. Costs The costs of the rule will essentially equal the costs that would have been incurred by manufacturers in complying with requirements imposed as special conditions in the absence of this rule. The new standards will be no more stringent than those imposed through recent special conditions, which are consistent with FAA Advisory Circular 20&hyph;136, ``Protection of Aircraft Electrical/Electronic Systems Against the Indirect Effects of Lightning,'' dated March 1990, and SAE Committee Report AE4L&hyph;87&hyph;3, Revision B, dated January 1989. Given the novel design features of advanced electronic systems and their susceptibility to lightning strikes, the FAA would have continued to require adequate lightning protection for all new certifications through imposition of special conditions; consequently, this rule imposes no new incremental costs. Notwithstanding this cost perspective, the FAA has evaluated the costs of the rule apart from the existence of special conditions, i.e., under the assumption that the reference level of costs prior to this rule is zero. The relative costs of the final rule are summarized below for two type-certifications_a representative part 25 large transport category airplane (i.e., air carrier), and a representative part 25 small transport category airplane (i.e., a business or commuter jet). Based on manufacturers' experiences with special condition requirements and other relevant data, nonrecurring testing costs for a representative large transport category airplane are estimated to total $6,300,000, consisting of $2,000,000 for avionics equipment, $200,000 for engine controls, and $4,100,000 for airframes. Recurring modification costs for each airplane produced are estimated to average $50,000 for avionics, $35,000 for engine controls, and $12,600 for the airframes, totalling $97,600 per airplane. Assuming 50 airplanes are produced each year over a 10 year period (1995&hyph;2004), recurring modification costs total $48,800,000. Thus, the costs to meet the lightning protection requirements for certification of a representative large transport category airplane total $55.1 million in nondiscounted 1990 dollars, or $27.7 million when discounted to 1991 present value. For a representative small transport category airplane, nonrecurring testing costs are estimated to total $980,000, consisting of $630,000 for avionics, $150,000 for engine controls, and $200,000 for airframes. Recurring modification costs for each airplane produced are estimated to average $25,000 for avionics, $8,000 for engine controls, and $9,000 for airframes. Assuming production of 50 airplanes per year for 10 years (1995&hyph;2004), recurring modification costs total $21.0 million. Thus, the costs to meet the lightning protection requirements for certification of a part 25 small transport category airplane total approximately $22.0 million in nondiscounted 1990 dollars, or $10.5 million when discounted to 1991 present value. Benefits The benefits attributable to the rule are the prevented fatalities, injuries, and airplane damage that might otherwise be caused by the adverse indirect effects of lightning strikes on airplane electronic systems. Information from the FAA Accident/Incident Data System indicates that, from 1985 through 1990, there were two incidents involving part 25 airplanes (both were large transport category airplanes) in which the indirect effects of lightning strikes adversely affected electronic systems. In each case, the airplane landed safely with minimum damage. In one incident, the first officer's flight instruments were lost, and in the second a partial electrical failure occurred. Neither of the two airplanes affected were certificated within the last five years, and therefore few sophisticated electronic systems were involved. Lightning protection requirements imposed through special conditions (since 1986) have substantially reduced the probability that indirect effects of lightning would disrupt electronic systems. Consequently, incidents involving more recent certifications that include advanced electronic systems have not occurred. Given the complexities of the more advanced electronic systems and their increased vulnerability to lightning impacts, inadequate protection of the systems would result in increased risks of operational failure. As the number of flights increases through normal growth in air traffic, the overall number of potential lightning strikes increases accordingly. Each transport category airplane experiences, on average, 1.25 lightning strikes during each year of operation. Thus, between 15,000 and 16,000 lightning strikes could be expected during the operating lives of the airplanes produced under one typical part 25 certification (i.e., 500 airplanes × 1.25 × 25 years). Since two incidents affecting less advanced systems occurred over a recent five year period, it is not unreasonable to postulate that at least this number could occur during a future five year period. Given the advanced systems' lower tolerance thresholds for disruptions and the criticalness of their effect on safe flight and operation, events that were incidents in the past could be accidents in the future. The FAA has estimated the minimum levels of averted losses (in terms of avoided fatalities and airplane damage) that would be necessary to offset the expected costs of complying with the rule. For a representative part 25 large transport category airplane certification, the requirements will be cost-beneficial if one averted accident prevents 91 fatalities and the destruction of the airplane. For a representative part 25 small transport category airplane certification, the rule will be cost-beneficial if 2 averted accidents prevent 36 fatalities and 2 destroyed airplanes. For the reasons outlined above, the FAA expects that the new requirements will prevent at least the minimum number of accidents specified and therefore considers the rule to be cost beneficial. Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The rule will affect transport category airplane manufacturers. None of these manufacturers is considered to be a small entity in accordance with FAA criteria which states that a small manufacturer is one with 75 employees or less. Therefore, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
