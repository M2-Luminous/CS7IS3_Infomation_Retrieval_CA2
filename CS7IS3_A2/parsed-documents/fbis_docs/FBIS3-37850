Here is the opinion of Boris Yeltsin's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, on the latest events around Yugoslavia. [Begin Kostikov recording] I would like to recall in this respect that recently the opposition accused the president of all the deadly sins: in betraying Russia's interests and in selling himself to the West, and in playing to the foreign policy tune of the United States... How much speculation there were around trips to Yugoslavia. All and sundry went there, in an attempt to earn some political brownie points on the Yugoslav crisis. President Yeltsin, however, managed to succeed where our political chatterboxes failed -- he demonstrated in deed the clause, enshrined in the new constitution, that it is the President of Russia who is the guarantor of Russia's national security. A few more words on the president's role in these events. Let us word this issue in simple terms: Who, except for President Yeltsin, could say today such a weighty and decisive word -- so that it would have been heard in Sarajevo, Bonn, and Washington -- in the whole world, as a fact. There is no other person like this now. [end recording]
