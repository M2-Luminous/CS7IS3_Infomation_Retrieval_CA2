Only ninety percent (90%) of each such estimate shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder prior to Completion of the Project: Provided, however, that at any time after work, which, in the sole determination of the Engineer, amounts to fifty percent (50%) of the maximum contract price has been completed, the Owner may elect, in lieu of paying ninety percent (90%) of each such subsequent estimate, to pay each such subsequent estimate in full. Upon completion by the Bidder of the Project, the Engineer will prepare a Final Inventory of the Project showing the total number and character of rights-of-way clearing units and, after checking such inventory with the Bidder, will certify it to the Owner, together with a certificate of the total cost of the construction performed. Upon the approval of such certificates by the Owner and the Administrator, the Owner shall make payment to the Bidder of all amounts to which the Bidder shall be entitled thereunder which shall not have been paid: Provided, however, that such final payments shall be made not later than ninety (90) days after the date of Completion of Construction of the Project, as specified in the Certificate of Completion, unless withheld because of the fault of the Bidder. (b) The Bidder shall be paid on the basis of the number of rights-of-way clearing units actually completed at the direction of the Owner shown by the inventory based on the staking sheets or structure lists; Provided, however, that the total cost shall not exceed the maximum contract price for the construction of the Project as set forth in the Acceptance, unless such excess shall have been approved in writing by the Administrator. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1(a) above, the Bidder may, by giving written notice thereof to the Owner elect to receive payment in full for any Section of the Project upon: (1) Completion of such Section as certified by the Engineer and approved by the Owner and the Administrator; (2) Submission to the Owner and the Administrator of the releases of lien and the certificate referred to in Section 2 hereof; (3) Approval by the Owner and the Administrator of the inventory in respect of such Section; and (4) Submission to the Owner and the Administrator of the consent in writing by the Surety or Sureties, if any, on the Contractor's Bond to payment in full for such Section prior to Completion of Project. If no Sections are designated in Article II, Section 1(c), the term ``Section'' shall mean for purposes of this subsection (a) and Article IV, Section 3(b) only, a part of the Project as designated by the Owner which represents at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the maximum Contract price as stated in Article III, Section 1. (d) Interest at the rate of XXXX percent 3 ( XXXX %) per annum shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder on all unpaid balances due on monthly estimates, commencing fifteen (15) days after the due date; provided the delay in payment beyond the due date is not caused by any condition within the control of the Bidder. The due date for purposes of such monthly payment shall be the fifteenth day of each calendar month provided: (1) The Bidder on or before the fifth day of such month shall have submitted its certification of rights-of-way clearing units completed during the preceding month and (2) the Owner on or before the fifteenth day of such month shall have approved such certification. If, for reasons not due to the Bidder's fault, such approval shall not have been given on or before the fifteenth day of such month, the due date for purposes of this subsection (d) shall be the fifteenth day of such month notwithstanding the absence of the approval of the certification. 3 The Owner shall insert a rate equal to the lowest ``Prime Rate'' listed in the ``Money Rates'' section of the Wall Street Journal on the date such invitation to bid is issued. (e) Interest at the rate of XXXX percent 4 ( XXXX %) per annum shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder on the final payment for the Project or any completed Section thereof, commencing fifteen (15) days after the due date. The due date for purposes of such final payment shall be the date of approval by the Administrator of all of the documents requiring such approval, as a condition precedent to the making of final payment, or ninety (90) days after the date of Completion of Construction of the Project, as specified in the Certificate of Completion, whichever date is earlier. 4 See Footnote 3. (f) No payment shall be due while the Bidder is in default in respect of any of the provisions of this Contract and the Owner may withhold from the Bidder the amount of any claim by a third party against either the Bidder or the Owner based upon an alleged failure of the Bidder to perform the work hereunder in accordance with the provisions of this Contract. Section 2._Release of Liens and Certificate of Contractor (See sample REA Form 224, Waiver and Release of Lien and sample REA Form 231, Certificate of Contractor.) Upon the Completion of Clearing by the Bidder (or any Section thereof if the Bidder shall elect to receive payment in full for any section when completed as provided above) but prior to final payment to the Bidder the Bidder shall deliver to the Owner, in duplicate, releases of all liens and of rights to claim any lien, in the form attached hereto from all manufacturers, materialmen, and subcontractors furnishing services or materials for the Project or such Section and a certificate in the form attached hereto to the effect that all labor used on or for the Project or such Section has been paid and that all such releases have been submitted to the Owner for approval.
