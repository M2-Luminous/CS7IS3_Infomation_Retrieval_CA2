FR940525-2-00088 FR940525-2-00061 (a) The Independent Account Representative directs that all of the assets in the Account be liquidated. In such cases, both the decision to sell equity securities from the Selling Account and the decision regarding the particular equity securities to be sold will be made by the Independent Account Representative. (b) The Independent Account Representative directs that a portion of the Account be liquidated. In such instances, the decision to sell equity securities from the Selling Account will be made by the Independent Account Representative. However, the determination of the particular equity securities to be sold by the Selling Account will be made either by the Independent Account Representative or by the Optimization Program (as described below). (c) The investment restrictions and objectives established by the Independent Account Representative for the Selling Account require that a particular security or a particular type of security be sold. Whenever a choice must be made as to particular equity securities to be sold, the Optimization Program will select the equity securities from the Account's holdings in a manner calculated to best bring the Account into compliance with the applicable investment restrictions. BFM states that for all ``trigger events'' described above the selection of the specific equity securities to be sold by the Selling Account through the operation of the Optimization Program will involve an automatic mechanical process, pursuant to certain prescribed investment restrictions and objectives from an Independent Account Representative, and will not involve any exercise of investment discretion by BFM. With respect to each potential cross-trade transaction, the Optimization Program will determine, in the ordinary course of its considering all available equity securities in the applicable universe, that another Account or Accounts participating in the program should purchase some or all of the available equity securities. In addition, each cross-trade transaction will occur within three business days from the occurrence of the triggering event which establishes the cross-trade opportunity. 4. BFM represents that there are two fundamental components to its investment process_the Stock Evaluation Process and the Portfolio Construction Process. With respect to the Stock Evaluation Process, BFM evaluates all of the equity securities in the applicable universe by applying a variety of objective criteria and mathematical computations to rank the equity securities and characterize each security with a ``buy'', a ``hold'', or a ``sell'' classification. BFM states that it does exercise some degree of discretion in the Stock Evaluation Process portion of the investment process. For example, BFM selects the particular strategic themes that are utilized from time to time in this process. 11 However, BFM states that the Stock Evaluation Process and the strategic themes used at a particular time are applied in exactly the same fashion for all Accounts which have directed BFM to invest in a particular universe of securities. Thus, the exact same stock rankings and buy-hold-sell classifications are applied uniformly for each security in every Account within such universe. The Stock Evaluation Process will never, in and of itself, give rise to direct cross-trade opportunities because the results of the Stock Evaluation Process will be the same for every Account in the particular universe. BFM states that it is only in the second part of the overall investment process (i.e. the Portfolio Construction Process), when the specific investment objectives and restrictions which have been established by the Independent Account Representative for the Account are overlaid against the results of the Stock Evaluation Process, that differences appear for the various Accounts within a particular universe. 11 Some of the strategic themes which have been utilized by BFM include the following: (a) Acid Cash_stocks of companies with high cash flow, measured by changes in corporate liquidity relative to market price; (b) Buybacks_stocks of companies that have announced intentions of buying back a meaningful percentage of their own stock; (c) High Yield_stocks of companies with above average yields relative to the overall market and within their own industries; (d) Low-Priced Growth_stocks of companies with below average price-to-earnings ratios and above average growth; and (e) Insiders_stocks of companies where corporate insiders have purchased the company's stock on the open market. With respect to the Portfolio Construction Process, BFM represents that the results of the Stock Evaluation Process are brought together with the particular facts applicable to each Account to generate the optimal portfolio for that Account and suggested trades to arrive at that optimal portfolio. The Portfolio Construction Process is driven by the Optimization Program. The Optimization Program receives the relevant information and automatically generates the optimal portfolio and the suggested buy and sell decisions that are designed to move a particular Account toward ``optimality'' (i.e. maximum expected return for a prescribed level of risk). The information utilized in the Portfolio Construction Process consists of (i) the existing make-up of the portfolio of the particular Account, (ii) the investment objectives and restrictions which have been established by the Independent Account Representative for the Account, and (iii) objective economic data (such as existing market prices for equity securities, price-earnings ratios for such securities, etc.) which is obtained by BFM from independent sources.
