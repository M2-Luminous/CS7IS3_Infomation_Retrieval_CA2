It was called to protest over a pay award the workers didn't get because the government took it to court. The government hit back by warning the strikers that they will be dismissed, and arresting a number of union leaders. The union, itself struggling financially backed off, but not all the workers have heeded the call to go back. From Harare, Rachel Rawlings reports: [Begin Rawlings recording] Eight senior members of the union were picked up in the early hours of this morning and taken to Harare Central Police Station for questioning. They were told they had contravened the law and order maintenance act by inciting a strike in an essential service where strike action is forbidden. But union officials said this afternoon the strike was called because the existence of the union itself was under immediate threat, and strike action in such circumstances was allowed under the Labor Relations Act. Union President (Wilfred Chanaiwa) said the management of the Post and Telecommunications Corporation, PTC, seem to be trying to destroy the union by interfering with the collection of subscriptions and harassing union officers. The PTC is challenging in the Supreme Court a Labor Tribunal ruling giving workers a 12.5 percent pay increase. According to Mr. (Chanaiwa), if union subscriptions aren't collected in full, they won't be able to hire a lawyer or even pay their own phone bills. After a meeting this morning at the Ministry of Labor, union officials called off the strike because of a threat by Minister John Nkomo to issue an immediate disposal order which would suspend the union and get the PTC the right to sack all union members. Instructions to return to work were broadcast on the radio this afternoon, but certainly in Harare went unheeded. The capital's central post office, usually extremely crowded and busy, was deserted, and canvass bags covered the unemptied letter boxes. Representatives of the union and PTC management are due to meet tomorrow with officials from the Ministry of Labor to address the union's grievances. [end recording]
