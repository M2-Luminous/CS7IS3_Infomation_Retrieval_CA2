He was reacting to a series of Serb provocations against the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia since U.S. warplanes launched two small attacks on Serb positions outside the Moslem enclave of Gorazde last Sunday [10 April] and Monday [11 April]. The public Western response to the Serb provocations has been low-key, with diplomatic pressure taking precedence over military threats. The NATO source said: "I think there is a mood of caution and hesitancy.... My hope is that there will be a cooling-off period.... We on our part are not going to be doing anything to escalate the situation." Insisting on being identified only as a NATO source, he discounted any quick repetition of a February ultimatum by the U.S.-led alliance that Serb artillery around Sarajevo would be bombed unless it was withdrawn. The source said such action was unlikely unless there was some atrocity which triggered a "welling up of emotion" on the scale of the shell which landed on a Sarajevo market-place in February and killed 66 people. The atrocity motivated the ultimatum, which is credited with forcing the Serbs to relax their artillery siege of Sarajevo, and giving impetus to a new U.S.-Russian thrust towards a peace settlement in Bosnia which has since stalled. Any more such ultimatums, or attacks beyond surgical strikes to protect UN peacekeepers, would need fresh authority from the UN Security Council and NATO. Within the UN, Russia is hostile to such an escalation, as is Greece within NATO. Both countries have traditional links with Serbia. The Russian Foreign Ministry criticised this week's U.S. air attacks outside Gorazde, saying that they had "considerably worsened" the chances for peace and objecting that Moscow had not been consulted first. Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said in Moscow Friday that he was against Russia signing up to NATO's "Partnership for Peace" programme of military cooperation with the former communist bloc. NATO had hoped that Moscow would join the partnership this month, becoming the 15th country to do so since January. Grachev said "we had the impression that our partners are acting behind our back" -- a clear expression of anger at the U.S. air attacks. Since February, NATO threats in Bosnia have been restricted to warnings that Serb forces threatening the safety of UN personnel would be bombed. The U.S. air attacks on Sunday and Monday, the first fulfilment of the threat, aimed officially at stopping Serb shelling of Gorazde, a UN-protected "safe area," because it placed eight UN peacekeepers there in danger. They hit a small command post and four vehicles. The Bosnian Serbs said two male nurses had been killed. In response, the Bosnian Serbs swooped on scores of UN peacekeepers around Bosnia, keeping them immobile and virtual hostages, shooting at some and abducting others. They stepped up the shelling of Gorazde, fired on other Moslem areas including the UN-controlled airport at Tuzla, and tried to seize two UN-guarded weapons stockpiles at Sarajevo. The western response was low-key. But at a meeting of NATO ambassadors here Wednesday, "there wasn't a hint" of a Sarajevo-type ultimatum or military action beyond carefully-targeted air strikes if UN lives were in danger, the NATO source said. He added that the United Nations was relying on a Russian-UN diplomatic mission rather than public military threats to defuse the crisis. Special Russian envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin, UN envoy Yasushi Akashi and UN negotiator Thorvald Stoltenberg were meeting together with the Bosnian Serbs on Friday.
