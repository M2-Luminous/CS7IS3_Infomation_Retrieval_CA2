Gen. Chawalit, a former Army commander-in-chief, made the comment while talking with reporters about the conflict between the military-dominated Senate, the House of Representatives and the Government over the constitutional amendment issue. "Civil servants (military) are valuable. They are responsible for the country. "Whenever they feel the country is about to come crashing down, they will be the first to act. We can't blame them," he said. Gen. Chawalit said it was good for senators from the military wing to band together and express their opposition to the amendments. They are helping to create unity in the thinking and understanding of the Upper House. The minister, asked if the move could lead to a coup, said: "Some people still look at it that way because they still have bad dreams." He insisted there was no conflict hetween the two Houses over the amendment issue. "They are just speaking differently," he sald. Both MPs and senators are responsible and adult and know what they should do when the time comes, he said' Gen. Chawalit said people were confused about the amendments but this did not mean there would be any problems. The political situation at the moment is "strange," he said, because never before have senators united to oppose the Government. "This time some 200 of them are united. But that's not bad." The Interior Minister said the situation in Parliament contained an element of conflict and this made people feel uncomfortable.
