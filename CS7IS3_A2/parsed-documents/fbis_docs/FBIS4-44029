The two commitments mean the continuation of the cooperation between the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] and CiU, which could take the form of program agreements when the 1995 budgets begin to be debated in September. Gonzalez and Pujol -- who met for over two hours at the Moncloa Palace, following the former's return from Colombia yesterday and before the latter leaves today for Indonesia on an official visit -- were in agreement in rejecting the method of a confidence motion in order to restore an image of stability to political life and on the fact that the important thing is the support of a sufficient parliamentary majority. "The prime minister," Pujol said, "has asserted very emphatically that he intends to continue the policy that has been conducted so far, especially in the economic sphere. We are in complete agreement on the country's needs right now and on how matters must be directed. These months are very decisive for the future for several years ahead, because the recovery is beginning in Spain and in Europe, and we must take advantage of it by adopting effective measures." Pujol, who paused for several minutes on leaving the meeting, explained that he put it to Gonzalez that for CiU "the important thing is for us to reach agreement on certain aspects of a program nature," because for CiU a pact on the economic and autonomy spheres is vital. With respect to the former, it is "essential" that "support for the productive economy" continue, and that measures can be adopted to reduce unemployment. For these aims to be achieved, there must be a "parliamentary majority" that will operate as such, and CiU will continue to guarantee it as long as the program agreements last, Pujol added. He specified that if they did not come about, "our support would cease to exist." The premier cited as instances the nationalist coalition's support for some of the most important laws debated so far, as well as the fact that the government is receptive to other proposals, such as the proposal for the right to write-offs for the replacement of production equipment, which is being approved by the cabinet today. Pujol also stated that Gonzalez told him with "conviction" that, although there are discordant voices, the PSOE is determined that the policy conducted so far will continue. With respect to autonomy matters, Pujol stressed that CiU's demands are "advantageous" not just for Catalonia but for all the autonomous communities, and specified that the Generalitat has always proposed aims that lie within strict observance of the statute [of autonomy] and that "can be accepted" by all the parties and the public. The Generalitat premier went to the meeting with the intention of succeeding in stabilizing the political situation until September, in a desire to gain time for the negotiation on autonomy with the government to take place and for the outline of the 1995 budgets to begin to take shape, and thus be able to support Gonzalez in a confidence motion if he decided to submit one at that time. The analysis that Pujol and the prime minister make with respect to the messages of 12 June have many points of agreement, and in view of this the most likely thing is that the government will reach agreement with CiU on a parliamentary strategy starting from September. Yesterday, two hypotheses were being put forward: There could be a confidence motion on the basis of a policy statement by the government, which CiU would support, or the debate would be confined to the discussion of the 1995 budgets. This option was the one that initially aroused the greatest interest in the government, although the impression has subsequently spread that CiU's support in the budget debate would not be sufficient; rather, that a more forceful and general expression of support for the government's activity is needed, and this can only be achieved through a confidence motion.
