The United States recognized Jerusalem's status in Resolution 672 of 1991. Resolution [904] did not discuss the main issue of settlements and their gravity. Hence, this resolution is a serious step back. I believe that what is needed now is a mechanism that can be translated on the ground with regard to international protection. We are awaiting the crystallization of this issue. ['Ubaydat] But after this resolution, talks will resume between all Arab parties and Israel. ['Urayqat] Mr. Christopher actually talked about the return to negotiations by the three Arab parties; namely, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. This, regrettably of course, shows the impairment from which Arab coordination is suffering. Regarding the Palestinian track, however, the matter concerns the protection of people's lives because the peace process means preserving people's lives. I believe that without placing the issue of settlements at the top of the agenda, without providing real international protection for the Palestinian people, and without evacuating the settlements from Hebron, Gaza, and Nabulus, the negotiations will be useless, even if they are resumed, especially since Israel has not yet committed itself, even orally, to the principle of withdrawing from the territories it occupied in 1967, whether Palestinian, Syrian, Lebanese, or Jordanian territories. ['Ubaydat] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat: Will the Peres-'Arafat meeting give a glimmer of hope? ['Urayqat] I believe that what is important is not formalities, procedural matters, and the level of the meetings. What is important is the substance of the meetings. Regrettably, the Israeli Government has been taking successive formal procedures that have not yet risen to the required serious level. Thus, I do not pin much hope on this expected meeting. However, all I am saying is that the ball is now in the Israeli Government's court. This government should make a decision on evacuating the settlers from the centers of Gaza, Hebron, and Nabulus and on not objecting to real international protection for the Palestinian people. ['Ubaydat] Dr. 'Aziz al-Duwayk: Security Council Resolution 904 condemned the al-Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre in Hebron and called for international protection in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Do the Islamic circles have reservations over this resolution? [Al-Duwayk] Yes. This resolution disappointed all political currents in the occupied territories. As a matter of fact, this resolution shows that the United Nations, led by the United States, is totally biased toward Israel. This resolution does not contain any mechanism to achieve security for the Palestinian people who were afflicted by the terrible bloody massacre. Thus, the resolution is deficient in this regard because it canceled the known fact that Jerusalem is an indivisible part of the occupied Palestinian territories. ['Ubaydat] But some circles have welcomed the deployment of Palestinian police forces in Hebron. [Al-Duwayk] We, in fact, do not need security forces that lack the power of enforcement. The whole world is already witnessing what is taking place. The media informs the world of what happens. Thus, we do not need a new observer to tell the world about the number of victims and losses. We are in a dire need of real security and peace. In my opinion, this can only be achieved if the occupation and settlements are removed.
