This can be seen from the "Situation Report on Extremism" in Hesse, which was presented by Interior Minister Herbert Guenther (Social Democratic Party of Germany) yesterday. Despite assertions to the contrary, such indications are found both in programs and fliers of Schoenhuber's party as well as in statements by various functionaries. According to the report, the number of right-wing extremist crimes rose to 972 last year, compared with 888 the year before. About 4,600 persons are organized in the right-wing extremist scene in Hesse. The efforts to link the various organizations with the help of the so-called Anti-Antifa Campaign [Anti-Antifascist Campaign] and to call for actions against the political opponents are watched with concern, Guenther said. The minister noted that it is alarming that left-wing extremists are increasingly using violence against right-wing extremists. Of 151 violations of the law with left-wing extremist motives registered in Hesse, 87 were acts of violence against rightists. The concentration of such excesses after spectacular actions by right-wing extremists -- e.g. after the neo-Nazi march in Fulda -- shows "that an unacceptable form of lynch justice is being exercised here." Concerning the Red Army Faction (RAF), Guenther noted: "Even after the latest announcements by the RAF, an end of the `armed struggle' is not in sight." The minister called on the large number of Kurds, who live peacefully in Germany, to distance themselves from the banned PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Only 600 of the 40,000-50,000 Kurds in Hesse are PKK members.
