A top Chinese Government official said the law would be ready after it is approved by the National People's Congress this month. Foreign trade management will be one of the major topics of the Congress, which convenes in Beijing next week to take up a wide range of economic issues. The impending trade law will be the first comprehensive one passed by China. "The law will unify the national foreign trade policies and create a fair environment for competition among all domestic enterprises," said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Disparities between central and local government policies regarding foreign trade and investment have turned away many potential investors from overseas. In the past local governments have extended tax breaks to foreign investors that run counter to central regulations and resulted in considerable losses to the State. "The foreign trade law will also set the stage for open and fair competition between domestic companies," the official said. Many Chinese enterprises are prohibited from dealing in foreign trade, but the official said foreign trade rights would be granted to more companies and scientific institutions in the years to come. But she did not say if the law would open the way to extending "national treatment" to foreign investors. National treatment means applying the same policies to all enterprises operating in a country or region. Such treatment is required by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which China is seeking to rejoin. However, she maintained that foreign investors now enjoy nearly the same treatment as their Chinese counterparts, especially in taxation. China has been drafting the foreign trade law for many years. At times policy makers have been split over difficult issues, like whether to allow individuals to conduct foreign trade . The official declined to comment on that point. But one thing is clear: More units will be able to have foreign trade rights under the macroeconomic control of the State. China is ready to allow more scientific institutions to engage in foreign trade. Conservative statistics show that less than 10 percent of China's scientific findings have been applied to making products for export. Approval of the law is timed to coincide with China's latest move to unify its two-tier foreign exchange rate system, which cancels discriminatory measures for different types of enterprises. Chinese analysts believed the foreign trade law will hasten China's re-entry into Gatt. China will sign the final package of the Uruguay Round of GATT talks in Morocco in April, paving the way for the country to rejoin GATT. In another development, the official said China this year will revise its regulations guiding the use of foreign investment. A national meeting on foreign investment is to end in Beijing on Monday. Reliable sources said that the conference will signal some changes of policy in favour of foreign investors. China has been planning to open its service sectors, like banking and transportation, wider to foreign investors. And it is ready to invite more foreign investment to develop its vast inland regions this year. An unsettling factor is that the bulk of foreign investment still ends up in the coastal regions, leaving the hinterland farther and farther behind.
