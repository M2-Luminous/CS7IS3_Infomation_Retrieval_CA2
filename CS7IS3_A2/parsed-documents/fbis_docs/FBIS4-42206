This document was adopted unanimously by the Defense Committee -- including, the author stresses, by the French. The document was a long time in coming, taking the Liberal deputy to Washington, Moscow, Paris, and London. One of its main conclusions is to invite the WEU to create a strategic study group charged with eventually setting up a true European nuclear deterrent policy. Armand De Decker says that in Washington he witnessed "a veritable cultural revolution in the nuclear domain." It is true that the Americans have considerably revised their positions since the end of the Cold War -- "now they have pulled all their nuclear weapons out of Europe with the exception of 700 small airborne bombs whose significance is more symbolic than military." De Decker attributes this shift in direction to the absolute supremacy that the United States has acquired in the field of conventional warfare. In Moscow, on the other hand, the nuclear issue appears to be returning in force. The document continues: "It seems to us to be less and less likely that the Russian Parliament will ratify the Start II agreements. The Russian military world is today much more independent and dominant than it was during the Communist era." Moreover, since the Russian authorities can no longer base their supremacy on conventional weapons, they appear to be taking an interest in the nuclear domain: "They justified this by stressing the threat that China will pose in the 21st century. A nuclear China therefore has indirect repercussions on security in Europe." De Decker accepts his previous mistake by revising his critical positions with regard to the Partnership for Peace being proposed to the Russians: "The United States was right. We must go along with Russia and increase our exchanges on the political level, civil servants, students, etc." To establish a real European nuclear deterrent, it is vital to be able to count on the two European powers that already possess a nuclear strike capacity, namely France and Great Britain. The British view appears to be clear enough: Their nuclear force is integrated into NATO's resources with the aim of "defending the vital interests of Great Britain." This definition also covers Britain's allies. On the French side, things are less clear. The idea of vital interests has never been precisely defined. "However," De Decker continues, "the doctrine inherited from General de Gaulle proved itself to be the most reasonable. France never took part in the arms race. When the Russians and Americans were talking of limited response, the French stuck to the policy of a final warning followed by a massive response. That is the most credible deterrent." Could France agree to abandon sovereignty over its nuclear arsenal? De Decker assures us: "The question cannot be couched in those terms. Things will be done gradually, not overnight. For example, we could start by setting up a nuclear planning group based on the NATO model. The Americans always retained the final say on when their missiles were to be used, even if they were carried on Belgian, Dutch, Turkish, or Italian planes." Armand De Decker optimistically claimed he was convinced that if General de Gaulle were president of France today, "he would be very much in favor of a European nuclear deterrent." The situation has changed considerably since de Gaulle initiated the French nuclear doctrine, he said: "Today France has its nuclear weaponry and Great Britain is involved in the process of European integration. De Gaulle would today defend the importance and autonomy of Europe." De Decker moreover sees in this the reason why the Russians and the Americans are now fighting for a ban on nuclear testing: "It is to prevent Europe from designing its own weapons system and thus to respond to a threat that could come from the East, the Middle East, or North Africa."
