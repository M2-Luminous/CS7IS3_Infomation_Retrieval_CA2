Glebov under the rubric "Under the 'Interkosmos' Program": "A Plasma Experiment"] [Text] The Interkosmos-25 (IK-25) satellite, with orbital parameters of apogee 3,083 km [kilometers], perigee 440 km and inclination 82.5°, was launched into orbit from Russia's Plesetsk cosmodrome using a Tsiklon launch vehicle on 18 December 1991. The mass of the spacecraft is 1,350 kg [kilograms], and the instruments and scientific gear 340 kg. The dampening, orientation and stabilization system provides three-axis orientation in an orbital system of coordinates with a precision of 25° along the pitch axis and 10° on the roll and yaw axes. The goal of the launch is to conduct an active plasma experiment (APEKS) for the scientists of various countries, in order to continue their basic study of the electrodynamic links of the ionosphere and the magnetosphere of Earth within the context of the overall Interkosmos program. The magnetic storms and the attendant incursion into the planet's atmosphere of powerful flows of active electrons and ions leads to the formation of the polar lights, intensive bursts of radio noise and other phenomena that affect the biosphere and business and economic activity. The mechanism of the occurrence, relaxation in the atmosphere and generation of wave emissions of such electrons has been largely unclear up to now, and it is thus very important to conduct the study and model the processes with the injection of electron beams and plasma clusters into the ionosphere and magnetosphere of the Earth. The possibility of creating a structureless antenna for long-range communications using plasma-stream systems of generators and emitting systems was verified in practice in the course of the scientific experiments. Specialists and organizations from our country, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Germany, Rumania, Czechoslovakia and Cuba took part in preparing the flight program and developing and manufacturing the on-board scientific instruments and ground systems. The artificial injection of a beam of electrons and plasma from the satellite, with the synchronous measurement of the physical parameters of the environment, beam and fields generated using two separated spacecraft whose orbits make it possible to perform the measurements both at various distances (from 0.01 to 1,000--2,000 km) and at various (in relation to the areas of excitation of the environment and dissemination of the beam) zones of the ionosphere and magnetosphere, was at the foundation of the APEKS. The experiment envisaged study of the nature of the electrodynamic links of electromagnetic waves in the ionosphere and the magnetosphere, determination of the radio-emission properties of the modulated particles and plasma clusters, research of their dynamics in near-Earth plasma, modeling and initiation of the polar lights and radio emissions and research on the generation and propagation of waves at frequencies of 30 Hz--10 MHz and 0.1 HZ--10 KHz with the injection of modulated electron beams and plasma streams into the Earth's ionosphere and magnetosphere. The scientific gear on the IK-25 includes two sets of instruments. The first has the active excitation apparatus--accelerators of electrons and plasma--and the second has diagnostic apparatus to study the propagation of electron energy (ions, flows of charged particles at the satellite), parameters of the plasma and low-frequency fluctuations in the magnetic field, as well as to measure the temperature of the plasma, the electrical and magnetic components of the low- and high-frequency electromagnetic emissions, the components of the quasi-permanent magnetic and electrical fields and spectral analysis of the electrical fields. A subsatellite of 50 kg manufactured in Czechoslovakia was released from the IK-25 on 28 December 1991 in accordance with the flight program. It moved, without the use of corrective means, into an elliptical trajectory on the orbital plane. After separation the initial larger axis of the ellipse was about 450 meters, and the smaller about 220 meters. The distance between the satellite and the subsatellite could increase to five kilometers in view of the differing friction from the atmosphere. There is the possibility of keeping the subsatellite at a distance of dozens of meters to a hundred or more kilometers for a time sufficient to conduct the experiment using the corrective engine installation on the principal craft. The subsatellite is equipped with apparatus that allows it to measure virtually the same set of physical values as the main satellite. The large spectrum of the same types of instruments of both satellites is supplemented by a system of technical support that includes a radiometer, a decoder of radio commands, interactive receivers, an orientation analyzer, a telemetric measurements unit and antenna-feeder devices. The results of measurements are recorded on board the satellites with the aid of radio-telemetric systems and technical support systems. The information from the telemetric system is received on Earth by a command and telemetry complex on the territory of our country, supported by personnel from the space units; from the technical support system the information is received by domestic stations at Tarusa, Apatity, Troitsk and Medveziye Ozera as well as foreign stations as Panska Ves (Czechoslovakia), Neustrelitz (Germany), Havana (Cuba) and Stara Zagora (Bulgaria). The flight and the operation of support and scientific instruments of the satellite are controlled from the Flight Control Center (TsUP) for spacecraft for national-economic and scientific purposes (Moscow), while the subsatellite is controlled by specialists and technical apparatus from the Panska Ves scientific station. The control of both satellites is coordinated by the main operations control group at the TsUP. There are three to five communications sessions a day with the IK-25 satellite, in the course of which radio monitoring of the orbit, the transmission of command programs to the satellite and the downloading of telemetric and scientific information are accomplished. The on-board scientific apparatus is able to function in active and passive modes. The active mode is characterized by the injection of electron accelerators and plasma against a background of the operation of the remaining instruments in conjunction with the radio-telemetric system in the information-recording mode. The observations of natural geophysical phenomena, in the absence of injections of electron beams and plasma streams, is an important part of the program, since the spatial and temporal dependencies in ionospheric-magnetospheric processes can be researched with the aid of the two separated satellites. There is a regular exchange of data among the participants in the international space program for planning and operational control (current ballistic parameters, operating modes of the scientific apparatus, readiness for operation of the technical gear and reporting on the receipt of telemetric data, among others). The APEKS project is being executed successfully. COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.
