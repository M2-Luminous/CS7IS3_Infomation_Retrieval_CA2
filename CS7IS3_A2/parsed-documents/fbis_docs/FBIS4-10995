The merit of this meeting with emigres lies in the fact that even in abnormal conditions, Cubans from inside and outside the country have decided to hold a dialogue to resolve their common concerns, Robaina said. Robaina said that during his Latin American tour, he confirmed there is concern among Cuban emigres and residents of the countries he visited over the critical situation of the Cuban economy and interest in helping the country resolve it.
