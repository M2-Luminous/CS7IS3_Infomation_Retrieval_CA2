FBIS3-9336 "dreeu056__a94020" FBIS-EEU-94-056-A Document Type:Daily Report 22 Mar 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Survey Shows Bias Against Romany Citizens AU2203173594 Prague CTK in English 1630 GMT 22 Mar 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2203173594 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, March 22 (CTK) -- Almost two-thirds of Czechs think citizens should not be equal before the law, and over half think legislation should be different and tougher for Romanies (Gypsies), a recent poll reveals. While 53 percent of those questioned believe Gypsies ought to be singled out, other minority groups cited as deserving special legal attention are Vietnamese citizens living in the Czech Republic, in the opinion of 6.3 percent, refugees (according to 5.8 percent) and skinheads (4.2 percent). Thirteen per cent of respondents said they felt repeat offenders and criminal elements should be placed lower on a hierarchical scale before the law. As regards the respondents' level of education, seventy-one percent of people with basic education hold the above views, as opposed to 56 percent of those with a school leaving certificate and 50 percent of higher educational students. The view that Romanies should face tougher laws seems to be linked to indifference to the preservation of Romanies' distinctive lifestyle. Only six per cent of people questioned consider more care should be taken to respect Romanies' rights. The poll was conducted by STEM, the Prague Empirical Research Center, in March. 1,627 people over the age of 18 were questioned. A STEM poll carried out last May showed that only one percent of Czechs trusted Gypsies and 72 percent said they would find it very hard to tolerate having a Romany neighbor. As many as 88 percent then said a Romany son- or daughter-in-law would be totally unacceptable.
