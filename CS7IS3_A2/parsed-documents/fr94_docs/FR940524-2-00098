FR940524-2-00098 FR940524-2-00054 6. The investment policies of the Portfolios permit each Portfolio to enter into repurchase agreement transactions with financial institutions such as banks and broker-dealers (each a ``Seller''). The Seller would not be the Adviser or any other affiliated person of the Portfolio, or any affiliated person of such an affiliated person. On the day the Seller and the Portfolio enter into a repurchase transaction, the applicable master agreement requires the Seller to sell to the Portfolio and on the same day transfer to the Portfolio or applicable custodian the particular eligible securities subject to the repurchase transaction against crediting the sale price of the securities to an account of the Seller in immediately available funds. The particular eligible securities would be identified in and defined by reference to that day's confirmation of the transaction. The Portfolios presently intend to use an agreement substantially similar to the Master Repurchase Agreement developed by the Public Securities Association. At the time of the Seller's transfer of securities to the Portfolio, the Seller is required to take action to perfect a security interest in favor of the Portfolio in the transferred securities. Each repurchase agreement transaction will be ``collateralized fully,'' as that term is defined in rule 2a&hyph;7. 7. To the extent that the repurchase transaction was sufficient to make a Portfolio fully invested with respect to its sweep funds, the Portfolio's records would reflect the specific amount it had in fact invested in the transaction. If the repurchase transaction was not sufficient to make the Portfolio fully invested with respect to its sweep funds, the Portfolio's records would reflect its investment in the entire amount of the repurchase transaction, and the Adviser would retain an uninvested cash position with respect to funds in excess of the agreement. Any amounts invested by the Adviser that exceed amounts available for reinvestment will be deemed to have been purchased by the Adviser for its own account. Because of its experience and relationships with its customers, the Adviser normally has the ability to predict accurately the amount of the sweep funds and normally would enter into a transaction in an amount greater than its estimated proceeds from the sweep. 8. Until the Completion Time, the Portfolio would have a perfected security interest in all of the transferred securities. However, only those specific securities described in the trade ticket confirming the amount of the transaction that the Portfolio in fact had entered into with its own assets, which would be prepared the next day by the Adviser, as custodian, would be subject to the transaction. The Adviser also would confirm the amount, if any, that the Adviser had purchased with its own funds. 2 Apart from the different amounts of the repurchase transactions, the terms of the transactions and the confirmation of the allocation to the Portfolio and the Adviser would be identical. 2 As a matter of practice, the Sellers issue confirmations for the repurchase transactions on the same day as the transaction. Therefore, the confirmation will not show the allocation of the repurchase transactions between the Adviser and the Portfolios. In order to create a written record of the dollar amounts allocated to the Portfolios and the specific securities purchased by the Portfolios, the Adviser would issue a trade ticket on the next business day, after the facts are known. 9. Ordinarily, each repurchase transaction effected with sweep funds would be secured by one issue of Treasury notes or other securities. To the extent that any repurchase transaction is secured by two or more issues of securities differing as to quality, maturity, or rate, each security will be apportioned between the Portfolio and the Adviser pro rata to the extent possible. Where such apportionment is not possible, securities will be apportioned in a manner that the Adviser believes will leave each party in a comparably secured position. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 17(d) makes it unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company, acting as principal, to effect any transaction in which such registered investment company is a joint or a joint and several participant with such affiliated person in contravention of such rules and regulations as the SEC may prescribe. Rule 17d&hyph;1 provides that, in passing upon applications for an exemption from section 17(d), the SEC will consider whether the participation of the registered investment company in the joint enterprise, joint arrangement, or profit-sharing plan on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the other participants. 2. Applicants acknowledge that, to the extent that assets of the Adviser, as an affiliated person of a Portfolio, are used with those of a Portfolio to enter into repurchase transactions, they may be deemed to be participating in a joint arrangement or joint enterprise prohibited by the Act. Applicants contend that a Portfolio's participation in the proposed transactions will not be on a basis different from, or less advantageous than, that of the Adviser. 3. Applicants contend that the proposed procedure for helping to ensure that the Portfolio is fully invested provides only benefits and no disadvantages to shareholders. The Portfolio's rights vis-a-vis Sellers under repurchase transactions will be protected by a standard industry agreement. In addition, the Portfolios will comply with the SEC's position concerning repurchase agreements set forth in Investment Company Act Release Nos. 13005 (Feb. 2, 1983) and with other existing and future positions taken by the SEC or its staff by rule, interpretive release, no-action letter, any release adopting any new rule, or any release adopting any amendments to any existing rule. 4. Applicants submit that the proposed repurchase transactions are reasonable and fair to the Portfolios, do not involve overreaching on the part of any person, and are consistent with the provisions, policies, and purchases of the Act. Applicants state further that the requested order is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment, Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
