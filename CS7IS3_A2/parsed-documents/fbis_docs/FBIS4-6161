The device is designed for use by small-scale businesses which have a limited number of dedicated circuits and is capable of priority transmission of compressed voice signals, while using blank spaces among voice signals to transmit image data via facsimile. Compared with pulse code modulation (PCM) methods of communication, it is said that channel volume can be increased 8.5-fold. The newly developed multiplexer will be installed on the output side of private branch exchanges (PBX) and digital signals will be transmitted through the device over dedicated circuits. Since only about 40 percent of the time consumed for voice communications is used for actual transmission of voice signals, a separate set of call signals will be transmitted using the blank spaces. Additionally, voice signals will be compressed to a maximum of one-fifth of their original volume. This procedure resulted in a modest drop in the quality of the voice communication, but enabled an 8.5-fold increase in channel volume. Image signals are handled so that they are first accumulated in the multiplexer and transmitted in small increments in packet format when circuits are not congested with voice communications. The system provides for consolidated output via PBX, when a complete package of image data reaches the receiving multiplexer. Further, at the time the sending multiplexer receives an input signal for image data, a signal is sent to the receiving number to confirm the availability of a facsimile machine. Image data is accumulated only when a confirmation is received and a data receipt message is sent to the facsimile machine handling the data input. Whenever the multiplexer is not used, blank spaces between signals do not occur during image data transmission and circuits are subject to exclusive use. This being the case, businesses with a limited number of dedicated circuits would at times be unable to engage in voice communications during transmission of images. Experimental devices made by KDD have been confirmed to have the capability to simultaneously transmit 17 types of voice communications on one dedicated circuit assuming the capacity to transmit at the rate of 128 kilobits per second. In the future, KDD hopes to increase the number of terminals that can be serviced and commercialize the device for use in international communications directed at businesses with a limited number of dedicated circuits.
