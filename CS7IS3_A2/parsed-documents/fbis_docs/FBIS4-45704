"This measure is neither overly expensive, nor threatening to other productions", she said, recalling that the "long-term objective does not exceed 5 percent of fuel consumption in Europe". The so-called "Scrivener" proposal, whose goal is to generalize the fiscal advantages granted since 1993 to bio-fuel products in the framework of pilot projects by making them compulsory in all Member States and no longer limiting them simply to these projects, is now on the table of the Ecofin Council. The Council will have to decide through unanimity and, according to Mrs. Scrivener, the decisive stage will occur between now and the summer. The Twelve should, notably, agree to confirm the compulsory nature of the measure proposed or, according to the wishes of the European Parliament, make it optional. For the moment, they are divided: some Member States are indeed tending towards this latter option, but others are ready to accept a compulsory lower taxation on these fuels as, without that, they fear traffic will be defected and thus a loss in fiscal revenue.
