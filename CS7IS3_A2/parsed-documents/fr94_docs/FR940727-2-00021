SUMMARY: EPA has established a temporary tolerance for residues of the herbicide cadre in or the raw agricultural commodity peanut hulls or meat at 0.1 part per million (ppm). DATES: This temporary tolerance expires May 31, 1996. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Robert Taylor, Product Manager (PM) 25, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 245, CM#2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, (703) 305&hyph;6800. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: American Cyanamid Co., Agricultural Research Division, P.O. Box 400, Princeton, NJ 08543&hyph;0400, has requested in pesticide petition (PP) 3G4203 the establishment of a temporary tolerance for residues of the herbicide cadre Ammonium salt of ( # )-2-[4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)-5-oxo-1 H -imidazol-2-yl]-5-methyl-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid in or on the raw agricultural commodity peanut hulls or meat at 0.1 part per million (ppm). This temporary tolerance will permit the marketing of the above raw agricultural commodity when treated in accordance with the provisions of the experimental use permit 241-EUP-125, which is being issued under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended (Pub. L. 95&hyph;396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136). The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that establishment of the temporary tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerance has been established on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit and with the following provisions: 1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental use permit. 2. American Cyanamid Co., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. This tolerance expires May 31, 1996. Residues not in excess of this amount remaining in or on the raw agricultural commodity after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerance. This tolerance may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). List of Subjects Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a(j). Dated: July 5, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs.
