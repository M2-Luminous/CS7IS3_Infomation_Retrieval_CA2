This information was disclosed a few hours after Gen. Guido Tavera Leyton, commander of the 7th Army Division, said that next month, there will be an "active" presence of military units in the tropical regions of Cochabamba Department to verify the presence of subversive groups in that zone. In La Paz, Army Commander Gen.

He denied, however, that his command had ordered the deployment of members of the Rene Barrientos Ortuno and Capitan Victor Ustarez Regiments, which are stationed in Tolata and Colomi respectively.
