Saez] [Text] Among the measures discussed by the Cuban parliament on 1 May to reverse the country's difficult financial situation is the possibility of changing the currency. Deputy Lazaro Barredo presented the above measure to the parliament, which is in special session to find a solution to end the excess of currency in circulation, estimated at some 11 billion pesos (official exchange rate is one peso per dollar). Barredo told PRENSA LATINA that a change of currency would be one of the most effective, pivotal methods to cleanse and improve the economy. He added that the measure, within the framework of others to be adopted later, would allow the country to expedite the economic recovery and would represent an improvement of the economic model the country is implementing. The deputy pointed out that price policies alone will not solve the problem. He added that among other issues being analyzed it was found that a shortage of cigarettes on the official market has driven prices up to 30 pesos per pack on the so-called black market. A consistent change of currency would be less disturbing to the lower-income population and for those who have managed to save some money. When asked if the legalization of the possession of freely convertible currency (summer of 1993) was one of the causes of the current imbalance, he said that in all cases, a strong currency (foreign exchange) acts to the detriment of a weak currency, as is the case with the national currency. Barredo underscored that this economic distortion is primarily caused by the lack of demand for goods and services in terms of Cuban pesos. This special session of parliament is being held with the sole objective of analyzing the nation's financial situation and making a number of decisions to end that problem.
