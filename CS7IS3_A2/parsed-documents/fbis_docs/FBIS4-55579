Mirko Marjanovic, who has been prime minister since March, was a well-known business manager before. He took office in a complicated political and -- notably -- economic situation. The program of stabilization, which has been implemented since the end of January 1994, has, however, already yielded the first positive results. Marko Winter talked to the 56-year-old government head in Belgrade. [Winter] You were trying to set up a government of national unity, but the majority of the opposition did not participate. [Marjanovic] My main target was a government that would implement the program of financial reform and economic recovery of the country as successfully as possible, for that is in the interest of all citizens, regardless of their political orientation. This explains my desire to get people from all the parties represented in parliament into the government. At the same time, I also insisted in personalities that were not linked to any party, but have expert knowledge, and are clearly committed to the program of the modern market economy. The deputy prime minister and other ministers are, therefore, not members of the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS]. It was a mistake for the most important parties of the opposition not to have accepted the offer. Particularly since the majority of the population supports the program. [Winter] What are the consequences of the sanctions against Yugoslavia in your country so far? [Marjanovic] The direct economic damage currently stands at $20-30 billion. Almost 1 million men and women of the total work force of 2.2 million are without work. Capacity utilization in the industry only stands at 30-40 percent. The gross per-capita national product has been halved within a period of two years. We have lost many markets in the world and on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The standard of living, particularly of low- income earners and pensioners, has fallen dramatically. Considerable disturbances have been created in the spheres of education and social insurance. We had to spend a lot of money on taking care of more than 600,000 refugees. [Winter] And the political effects? [Marjanovic] Despite the severe economic and social consequences, the sanctions have not been able to destabilize the country politically. In principle, the great majority of citizens sticks to its support for that part of the Serbian people that now live outside the borders of the FRY. Since the beginning of the "Yugoslav crisis" we have struggled for a fair and peaceful solution that protects the interests of the Serbs in the same way as it protects that of the Croats and Muslims. The sanctions have become useless, anyway, because we have fulfilled all UN demands. In Serbia and Yugoslavia we are creating a democratic society and a modern market economy, which is why we have the right to be a member of the international community with equal rights. [Winter] What does your program of stabilization focus on? [Marjanovic] Our main objective is to overcome hyperinflation and restore trust in the dinar. In addition, stable conditions should be created for an increase in production and for more jobs. In the first three months we managed to put a halt to the increase in prices. Our foreign currency reserves are sufficient to guarantee the convertibility of the dinar. The state budget is again fed by real revenues, and there are first signs for a recovery of production. These are encouraging results and great changes compared to 1993. [Winter] What is most important for you now? [Marjanovic] Well, now it is most important to maintain discipline in the state budget and to reduce last year's deficit radically. The austere financial policy must continue to guarantee the stability of the dinar. Third, we will practice active social policy to help those that are temporarily without work as a result of the sanctions and the transition to the market economy. I am primarily thinking of programs of reeducation and support for a rapid development of small- and medium-sized enterprises. I am an optimist in this connection, and expect that we will conclude the year 1994 under considerably more stable conditions, with economic growth, and a higher standard of living.
