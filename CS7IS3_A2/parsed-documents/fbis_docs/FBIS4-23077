V. Akselrod, A. A. Kozyrenko, Institute of Applied Astronomy, Russian Academy of Sciences,St. Petersburg; UDC 621.397.611.037.372] [Abstract] A device to isolate syncrhonizing sequences at 5 MHz from a playback signal in an RT-1 VHS recorder (recording speed 5 megabits/second using a self-synchronizing Miller code) has been developed at the Institute of Applied Astronomy for ultralong baseline radio interferometry. The device operates on the principle of digital phase automatic frequency adjustment. Digital operation is easily implemented even at rather high frequencies. Tuning is reliable and easy. The space-saving design may be used in the construction of multichannel systems. Figures 3; references 3 (Russian).
