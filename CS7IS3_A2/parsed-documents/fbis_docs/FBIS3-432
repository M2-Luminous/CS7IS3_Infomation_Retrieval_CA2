In a memorandum submitted to the president of the republic, the opposition parties say under the prevailing conditions it is difficult for them to take part in the elections on an equal footing with the Mozambique Liberation Front and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]. The memorandum says the government has no right to monopolize the State General Budget, alleging that the budget comes from tax payers, including members of the unarmed political parties. The political parties rejected what they described as Renamo maneuvers designed to divide the country into two occupied areas. The parties demanded the immediate abolition of so-called Renamo areas and their rapid reintegration into state administration. Speaking to newsmen after he received the memorandum, the president of the republic said he believed the unarmed opposition parties will not demand an immediate response to their grievances because these require an in-depth assessment of the situation. Joaquim Chissano said it is necessary for the country's leading forces to work closely. Yesterday's meeting was requested by the unarmed political parties.
