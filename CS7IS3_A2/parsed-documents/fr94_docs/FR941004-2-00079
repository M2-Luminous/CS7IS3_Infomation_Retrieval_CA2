FR941004-2-00079 FR941004-2-00050 The training materials consist of a student handbook which is not only intended for use during the course but also may be used as a reference by the operators after completion of the course, and an instructor guide which provides the basic materials for use by the instructor of the training course. The instructor's guide includes the course description and agenda, course goals, lesson plans, copies of an initial test and a final course examination, and audio-visual aids. Activities for developing this training course performed since mailout of the draft student handbook include revision of the student handbook based on comments received from the mailout, development of the instructor's guide, a trial run of the course, revision of the training materials based on comments received from the trial run, and publication of the final student handbook. The trial run of the training materials was conducted in April 1994. The trial run presented the course materials and obtained comments from participants concerning areas that could be changed to improve the course materials. Among the twenty-eight attendees were operators, training specialists, and supervisors of utility and industrial facilities. Also in attendance were representatives from boiler insurance, inspection, and licensing organizations. Comments received from the trial course were incorporated into the final student handbook, as appropriate. The chapters which required the most significant revisions were those pertaining to the water and steam circuits, package boilers, and safety. Also, the materials presented in the chapters on combustion principles and air pollution fundamentals were simplified without compromising the material content. The instructor's guide was then modified to reflect changes to the student handbook. The operator training materials include testing materials that indicate a student's satisfactory completion of the training course. The EPA will provide the final student and instructor manuals to the States so they can use them to implement an operator training program for high capacity fossil fuel-fired plant operators.
