In doing this, the British side unilaterally released some information about the talks between the Chinese and British Governments on the arrangements for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong. This constituted a breach of the understanding reached between the two sides before the opening of the talks, in which they committed themselves not to reveal the substance of the talks. Furthermore, the British side also misrepresented and lashed out at the Chinese side's stance, in an attempt to lay blame on the Chinese side for disrupting the talks. In response to this, the Chinese side had no choice but to release its version--"The Facts Concerning Several Major Questions on the Sino-British Talks on the 1994/95 Electoral Arrangements for Hong Kong," with the aim of dispelling confusion among the public. This dispute between China and Britain is not about arguing whether Hong Kong needs democracy, as alleged by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, but whether it is still necessary to keep international commitments and whether the local constitutional development still needs to converge with the Basic Law so as to ensure a stable transition in Hong Kong. The substance of the dispute is that the Chinese side wants to uphold national dignity, to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled, to found the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] -- which will be placed directly under the central people's government -- and to set up an SAR government primarily constituted by Hong Kong people who love China and Hong Kong. Britain, on the other hand, is not willing to give up its colonial rule over Hong Kong but is attempting to extend its influence on Hong Kong as a former colony after 1997, by knocking together a pro-British clique under the pretext of "constitutional reform." This is our key to understanding the disputes between China and Britain on a series of issues. Ulterior Motives Behind Major Changes Section 3 of Article 3 of the Sino-British Joint Declaration provides that "the laws currently in force in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged;" Section 5 provides that "the current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and so will the life style." The Basic Law provides: Hong Kong's political structure should evolve "in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress." However, Chris Patten's "constitutional reform package" intends to substantially change Hong Kong's existing political structure. This obviously goes counter to the stipulations of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. Over the more than 100 years of British occupation, Hong Kong's political structure has always been based on the principles laid down in the "Letters Patent" and the "Royal Instructions" and was seldom changed. Then why is it necessary to introduce such major changes in the political structure of Hong Kong during the late transitional period? All clear-thinking people can see the ulterior motive behind this illogic and faith-breaking act by Britain. Let us review the following facts: Hong Kong has always upheld an executive-led political structure. The term "executive-led" means that ruling Hong Kong is primarily the responsibility of the executive organ. The Legislative Council [Legco] is merely a consultative organization for the Hong Kong governor in the legislative process which does not hold any real power of legislation. Any law bill adopted by Legco must be ratified by the Hong Kong governor before it comes into force, otherwise it cannot be implemented. What is more, laws that have been ratified by the Hong Kong governor can still be overruled by the British royal family, which can even create legislation for Hong Kong directly. In the past, Britain upheld the executive-led structure. Britain's ultimate purpose in doing this was to ensure that the British monarch and the Hong Kong governor appointed by him could exclusively hold power and maintain Britain's absolute rule over Hong Kong, so that Britain's interests in Hong Kong could be safeguarded. Given this objective fact, the executive organ -- free of interference from the legislative organ -- could have a free rein in handling affairs, which enabled the government to make decisions and operate in a highly efficient manner. With his "constitutional reform package," Chris Patten has been trying very hard to introduce the representative government system practiced in western countries into Hong Kong, augment the Legco's power, and change the existing executive-led structure, so as to develop a structure under which "the legislative branch dominates the executive branch." Hong Kong, however, is not a state-like entity but merely an area. The above development will inevitably lead to a loss of stability in the decisionmaking process within the executive organ, thus weakening the government's management efficiency. What is even more serious is that, once the executive organ is dominated by the legislative organ, Hong Kong will land in a position in which it is vulnerable to endless disputes on political affairs, the executive organ will be faced with difficulty in exercising its power, and is likely to experience intervention by foreign political forces in local affairs. Consequently, the sovereignty that the Chinese Government is to exercise over Hong Kong after 1997 will be nullified, and Britain will be able to sustain its control over Hong Kong through this legislative body which plays a dominant role. The Basic Law has already expressly described the process for introducing the democratic system into Hong Kong and developing democracy in the territory, and it has set a rather rapid pace for the process. For example, the future SAR legislative organ will be completely constituted by elections (including direct and indirect elections -- the number of seats returned by direct election will be increased with every round of elections until finally all the seats will be returned by general election); the chief executive will be selected through consultations or election; the legislative organ will be vested with genuine legislative power, and so on. Therefore, this dispute is not to argue whether democracy is wanted or not. Whether the executive-led political structure is to be changed or not is in substance a major issue of principle which has a bearing on the smooth exercise of sovereignty and ruling power over Hong Kong by the Chinese Government beyond 1997. Breaking Faith and Going Back on Their Word As far as the issue of Hong Kong's political structure is concerned, the British side has violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law, and the agreements and understandings already reached between the Chinese and British sides. Examples of the "three violations" by the British side are numerous in the "constitutional reform package" put forth by Chris Patten. According to the decision of the National People's Congress [NPC], the first Legco of the future Hong Kong SAR will be formed by 60 members, of whom 30 are to be returned by functional constituencies. If the term of office of the last Legco to be formed in 1995 is to stride past 1997 to become the first Legco of the future Hong Kong SAR, then the last Legco will have to be formed in accordance with the above principle. However, Chris Patten's package proposes that 21 of the 30 seats returned by functional constituencies should be selected through vote by individuals rather than through vote by corporate bodies, and, for the nine newly installed seats, the method of election by functional constituencies should be replaced by a method in which "every individual member of every functional sector will have a vote." In other words, the package intends to make the indirect functional constituency elections into a disguised form of direct elections based on trades. At present, of the 60 seats in the Hong Kong Legco, 21 (or 35 percent) are returned from 19 corporate bodies based on different social functions. These seats are called seats returned by "functional constituencies" (or "functional sectors"). In the Basic Law, election by functional constituencies is called "election by functional bodies." It is obvious that elections by functional constituencies is an indirect election based on the votes of functional bodies, which is different from direct elections based on a vote by the entire electorate. Election by functional constituencies was first proposed by the White Paper on representative government published by the British Hong Kong Government in November 1984. In 1987, when reviewing this system, the British Hong Kong Government maintained that it had been approved by the majority of the population, and therefore it decided to retain the system. Since then, the number of Legco members returned by this form of election has been increasing, going from six members in 1985 to 21 in 1991. During the drafting of the Basic Law, the British side continued to recommend this form of election to the Chinese side again and again. The number of seats returned by direct election, even when it was referred to in the letter that the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd wrote to Foreign Minister Qian on 12 February 1990, did not include seats returned by functional bodies. This is more proof indicating that the British side always considered elections by functional bodies as indirect elections. In the belief that this form of election had been accepted by the Hong Kong people and did have some advantages, the Basic Law drafting committee included in the Basic Law this form of election by functional bodies, based on the principle that what has been practiced and proved useful in Hong Kong shall be retained, and this decision had the endorsement by the National People's Congress. Thus it can be seen that Chris Patten, in changing the election by functional bodies as a form of indirect election into a kind of disguised direct election, has totally violated the Basic Law and the understandings and agreements reached between the Chinese and British sides in the past, as well as the original idea behind the introduction of seats for functional constituencies. Even the former chief secretary of the Hong Kong Government, David Akers- Jones, who was also the author of this form of election, criticized Chris Patten's constitutional package for contravening the original purpose of elections by functional constituencies. This change will also result in inequality in the right of election among citizens because, of the more than 6 million population in Hong Kong, 2.7 million members of the working population will enjoy an extra chance to vote in the disguised form of direct elections based on profession, in addition to their first chance to vote already granted on the basis of geographical divisions, while those retired from these selected professions and other people outside these professions enjoy only one chance to vote in the direct election based on geographical divisions. This man-made discrimination regarding the citizens' right to vote is definitely unreasonable. It also violates the principle of "gradual and orderly progress" for the development of the elections by functional bodies. Although the British side later submitted a revised program, it still will drastically expand the electorate for the election by functional constituencies to nearly 900,000, which means the 90,000-strong electorate, as originally set for indirect election, will be drastically increased by eight times. This obviously does not conform with the principle of "gradual and orderly progress." Then why did the British side recommend to the Chinese side the form of election by functional constituencies in the past but now intend to change it into a disguised form of direct elections? The basic reason is that, as 1997 draws nearer and nearer, the British side wants to arrange for more of its followers to enter Legco. Indirect elections by functional bodies can more easily return candidates who are prestigious and influential within their functional sectors and who are willing to assume responsibility for the Hong Kong community, and it is more difficult for the British side to manipulate these people. In direct elections, however, many professionals have neither adequate financial resources nor the intention to run for election. Thus, the British side will be able to manipulate the elections behind the scenes and arrange for its favored candidates to be elected to Legco. The True Color of the Colonialists Who Attempt in Vain To Infringe Upon China's Sovereignty When it comes to the issues of the "through train" program and the electoral committee, the British side has more blatantly exposed its true color as a colonialist attempting in vain to infringe upon China's sovereignty over Hong Kong in regard of the constitutional system issue. The so-called "through train" refers to an arrangement by which the members of the last Legco formed under the British Hong Kong authorities; specifically, that Legco members elected in 1995 will have their term of office carried forward beyond 1997 and thus they will become members of the first Legco of the Hong Kong SAR of the PRC. When drafting the Basic Law, the Chinese Government adopted some opinions put forth by the British Government. The Basic Law has included some provisions related to the "through train." When the Basic Law was ratified by the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh National People's Congress [NPC] on 4 April 1990, the session also adopted the "Decision of the NPC on the Method for the Formation of the First Government and the First Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR." Paragraph 6 of this decision reads: "If the composition of the last Hong Kong Legco before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR is in conformity with the relevant provisions of this Decision and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, those of its members who uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC and pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR of the PRC, and who meet the requirements set forth in the Basic Law of the Region may, upon confirmation by the Preparatory Committee, become members of the first Legco for the Region." In other words, whether the incumbent Legco members can benefit from the "through train" program is conditional; it is not unconditional. As long as the requirements as cited above are met, the "through train" program will work. However, Chris Patten is attempting to slap together a Legco lineup according to his "constitutional reform package," which he expects will take the "through train" and operate beyond 1997 as the future Hong Kong SAR Legco. It is obvious that this is wishful thinking on his part, by which he is attempting to ensure that this lineup will play a "legislative-led" role to extend the influence of British colonial rule in Hong Kong. Now let us review the disputes provoked by the British side over the formation of the election committee. According to the provisions set forth by Annex I and Annex II of the Basic Law, the chief executive and some members of the Legco of the future Hong Kong SAR will be elected by a broadly representative election committee. Annex I of the Basic Law also expressly provides: "The Election Committee shall be composed of 800 members from the following sectors: Industrial, commercial, and financial sectors, 200; the professions, 200; labor, social services, religious, and other sectors, 200; members of the Legislative Council, representatives of district-based organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the NPC, and representatives of Hong Kong members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, 200. The Election Committee's term of office shall be five years." As far as this question is concerned, the Chinese and British sides reached an understanding through an exchange of letters in the spring of 1990 before the NPC adopted the Basic Law. By that time, the British side had already agreed in principle on the composition and ratio of members of the election committee as prescribed by Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law (Draft). However, with his constitutional reform package, Chris Patten wants the 1995 election committee to "be composed completely or mostly of members of district boards returned by direct election." According to Chris Patten's package, both Hong Kong deputies to the NPC and Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National Committee will not be able to become members of the election committee as prescribed in Annex I of the Basic Law, nor can the four categories of people join the election committee to make it more balanced as prescribed in the Basic Law. British Ambassador to China Alan Donald handed a written note to the Chinese side on 6 February 1990, putting forth five principles on the formation of the election committee and a proposal that the committee be formed by four categories of people. The Chinese side gave a written reply to the British side on 8 February that year, expressly stating that "the Chinese side agrees with the five principles concerning the election committee proposed by the British side in the document. However, the Chinese side maintains that the provisions on the composition and ratio of the election committee as specified in Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law (Draft) must be followed in terms of its proportional composition. This is because Annex I was approved by a two-thirds majority of the membership of the Drafting Committee at its eighth plenary session. China believes that its provisions on composition and ratio are appropriate and should therefore not be subject to change." Then, in his letter to Foreign Minister Qian Qichen dated 12 February, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd confirmed: "I agree in principle with the arrangements which you propose for an Electoral Committee, which could be established in 1995. The precise details of how this should be done can be discussed between our two sides in due course." This evidence in black and white shows that the British side did agree at that time to have an election committee formed in 1995 in accordance with Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law. In other words, the Chinese and British sides at that time had already reached an agreement and understanding on the formation of an election committee in 1995. According to Chris Patten's package, all Legco members elected in 1995 should be allowed to board the "through train" to become members of the first Legco of the Hong Kong SAR of China, whereas Hong Kong deputies to the NPC -- China's highest organ of power -- and Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National Committee -- China's highest consultative organ -- will not be admitted into the Electoral Committee that is to elect some of the Legco members. This is an extremely absurd plan which constitutes an infringement upon China's sovereignty and the Hong Kong people's rights. The Old Trick Is Played Again; Their Character Remains Unchanged Hong Kong has been a part of China since ancient times. Following the Opium War of 1840, with solidly built warships and powerful cannons, Britain forced the Qing government to sign three unequal treaties and thus occupied Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories. After the founding of new China, the Chinese Government has been consistently upholding its stance of not recognizing the three unequal treaties that the imperialists forced upon China but has maintained that Hong Kong as a whole should be recovered in due course through negotiations. In 1982, Chinese leaders officially informed the British side that the Chinese Government had decided to recover the entire Hong Kong area in 1997. After that, in the Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue, the British side first argued that "the three treaties are valid," then put forth the idea of "exchange of sovereignty for ruling power," and later on the idea of "largest extent of autonomy," with the aim of changing Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity subject to Britain's influence. After all these tricks failed, Britain finally put forth the "constitutional reform package." As the old saying goes: Reviewing the past helps one understand the present. In modern world history, each time that Britain was forced to withdraw from one of its colonies, it consistently sowed discord and created conflicts and confrontation by playing the trick of pseudo-democracy, thus placing the new regime under the control of pro-British agents so that it would be able to retain the political and economic advantages that it enjoyed in its former colonies. The British side has been trying to do this again with regard to the Hong Kong issue. Back in 1946, as the British felt that their rule over Hong Kong might not last long, then Hong Kong Governor Mark Young made a statement on transforming Hong Kong's political framework and planned to set up a "municipal council." In June 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army was heading south, and the liberation of all of China was within sight. Under such a circumstances, then Hong Kong Governor Alexander Grantham gazetted the "municipal council" program. This was in fact the very first "constitutional reform package" set forth by Britain for Hong Kong. According to this package, Britain would withdraw from Hong Kong only nominally but would actually maintain British influence in Hong Kong through a British-style political framework. New China did not send troops across the Shenzhen River to expel the British out from Hong Kong, however. Britain realized that it was possible for it to continue its rule over Hong Kong without withdrawing from the territory. This being the case, the introduction of a "constitutional reform" in preparation for withdrawal from the territory would obstruct the British Hong Kong authorities' rule over Hong Kong. Therefore, without hesitation, Britain gave up Mark Young's plan for establishing a "municipal council." The Churchill administration even announced: "Introducing any more far-reaching political reform in Hong Kong would not be appropriate." We are now getting closer and closer to 1997, when Hong Kong is to return to China, and the British will soon terminate their colonial rule in Hong Kong forever. So we see Britain playing its old trick again, sending Chris Patten to Hong Kong to launch his "constitutional reform package" characterized by the "three violations." If we compare what is happening today with historical facts, Britain's covert intentions will become obvious. The Chinese Government today is different from the Qing Government of the past, however, and the Chinese people of today are no longer the "sick men of East Asia" that they used to be. China's sovereignty brooks no infringement by anybody. As pointed out by Deng Xiaoping: "The question of sovereignty is not one which can be discussed." China will never barter away principles. China hopes that the Sino-British talks can achieve positive results and that China and Britain can cooperate with one another since it will be beneficial to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. Nevertheless, this does not imply that it will not be possible for Hong Kong to maintain stability and prosperity without Britain. Even if the British side shows no sincerity in reaching an agreement through negotiations and persists in undermining Sino-British cooperation, China will still be able to ensure a stable transition and long-term prosperity in Hong Kong.
