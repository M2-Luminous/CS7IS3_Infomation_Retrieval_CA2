The attitude the British side takes toward the PWC is a touchstone for judging whether the British side is willing to maintain Hong Kong's smooth transition and is willing to cooperate with the Chinese side. Chen Ziying pointed out: After the breakdown of the Sino-British political talks, the Chinese side is still willing to cooperate with the British side on other issues, but this is contingent on the British side's attitude. We hope that the British side will show sincerity and will not repeat its practice concerning political issues in the past. He said: Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland are situated in the Asia-Pacific economic belt, which has recorded the fastest development in the world. Maintaining a smooth transition for Hong Kong is not only beneficial to the mainland and Hong Kong, but also to other sides with economic interests in Hong Kong. Some people in the British Hong Kong authorities always misjudge the situation and draw erroneous conclusions. This will just cause losses to their own interests. He added: A distinct difference between clever people and foolish people lies in the fact that the former do not repeat the same mistakes they committed before. It is hoped that they are clever now. Chen Ziying said: The recent meetings of the political and economic affairs groups of the PWC were quite successful. First, the PWC members had an opportunity to listen to opinions from people in various circles in Hong Kong. Second, the PWC's mainland members had a chance to know more about the actual conditions in Hong Kong. This enabled them to put forth proposals and opinions more pertinent to the actual conditions of Hong Kong and to the wishes of Hong Kong people. Therefore, the other three groups of the PWC will also hold meetings in Hong Kong next year. When talking about the economic relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland, Chen Ziying said that the two sides were closely integrated with each other. For example, there are tens of thousands of Hong Kong-funded enterprises in the Zhu Jiang Delta area, almost all of the major new property projects in Beijing involve Hong Kong investment, and more mainland state-owned enterprises will be listed on the Hong Kong stock market. All this shows that cooperation between the two sides has been speeding up, and the scope for cooperation is expanding with bright prospects for the future. Finally, Chen Ziying said that Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-term prosperity will eventually depend on Hong Kong people themselves. Even if the British side refuses to cooperate in the last stage of the transitional period, Hong Kong will maintain its status as an international financial and trade center after 1997. Zhang Liangdong, director of the Hong Kong Economic Affairs Department of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, attended the meeting held at the Xindadu Hotel in Beijing. The 42-member delegation from the Hong Kong plastics industry is headed by Mr. Leung Kei-yau.
