Miguel Sandoval, member of the URNG's diplomatic team, criticized the government delegation for "trying to evade the negotiation, rejecting the civilian society's position, and refusing to discuss in Oslo immediately the creation of a Truth Commission." In a communique transmitted to this newspaper, the CERIGUA News Agency quotes Sandoval and describes as "tense" the meeting that closed yesterday without agreements and in which the Army, the government, and the rebels held contradictory positions on the displaced population subject. According to CERIGUA, another point of disagreement was the government's intention to center the discussion on a cease-fire, which contradicts the already signed agreements, rather than the proposals of the sectors involved, proposals outlined in a Civilian Sectors Assembly document.
