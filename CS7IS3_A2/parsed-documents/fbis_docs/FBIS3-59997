Investigations have revealed that the 22-year-old man from Vienna's 12th district and the 19-year-old man from Boeheimkirchen in Lower Austria bought the heroin from a Czech in Bratislava. They paid 300,000 schillings and offered the Viennese man's BMW 325i as security. The police are still searching for the organizers of the deal. About 800 grams of heroin with a street value of 170,000 schillings were smuggled by a Tirolian couple from Zurich to Vorarlberg since August. On Sunday [26 December], the 25-year-old man and his 32-year-old girlfriend were arrested at the Lustenau border crossing.
