SUMMARY: The Federal Communications Commission is adopting range for the underlying factors that are used to compute depreciation rates for the local exchange carriers (LECs) regulated under the price cap incentive regulatory plan. This Second Report and Order establishes ranges for 22 of the 33 depreciation rate categories. LECs may make streamlined filings for changes in depreciation rates for these categories, if their underlying factors fall within the prescribed ranges. The rule change will lessen the depreciation prescription burden on price caps LECs in light of regulatory and market changes without sacrificing protection for consumers.

Frequency of Response: On occasion; Triennially; Annually. Estimated Annual Burden: 12 responses; 7500 hours per response; 90,000 hours total. Needs and Uses: In the Report and Order in CC Docket No. 92&hyph;296 (released 10/20/93), the Commission streamlined its depreciation prescription process for local exchange carriers (LECs) regulated under its price cap regulatory scheme by adopting a modified form of the basic factor range option. The Second Report and Order adopts the initial set of accounts and ranges for the price caps LECs. The Commission has modified its information collection requirements whereby large LECs must submit analyses on proposed changes in depreciation rates. The changes should reduce by 25% the amount of time needed to prepare and review these analyses. The information will be used by the Commission staff to establish proper depreciation rates to be charged by the carriers pursuant to Section 220(b) of the Communications Act, as amended. 47 U.S.C. ยง220(b).
