In Churkin's opinion, it is precisely due to the use of this term that various misunderstandings have resulted and a negative reaction has come from some former USSR union republic capitals. In Churkin's opinion, the Baltic countries can in no way be included in the near abroad because those countries left the USSR even before it disintegrated and are not likely to seek CIS membership. At the same time, Churkin emphasized that the term near abroad should not be interpreted as a threat against the sovereignty of any state because Russia, the CIS, and the Baltic countries were united into a country for years; consequently, they also have many problems in common, including the issue of the Russian-speaking population, said Churkin. A meeting of representatives of Russian communities living in the near abroad took place in Moscow, with nearly 70 people attending. All those present found that there are human rights violations taking place in Latvia and Estonia, a fact that lifts international legal acts above the national ones. As a consequence, the Russian-speaking population has become stateless in those countries. [passage omitted]
