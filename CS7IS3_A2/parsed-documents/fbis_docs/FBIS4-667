FBIS4-667 "drafr072_a_94017" FBIS-AFR-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda RPF Says Mission Accomplished, Rejects Cease-Fire RPF Says Mission Accomplished, Rejects Cease-Fire EA1304185694 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in English to Rwanda 1645 GMT 13 Apr 94 EA1304185694 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura English BFN [Text] The Rwanda Government Army chief of staff and nine other senior officers of the Rwanda Government Army today requested for a cease-fire. These officers should first explain whether they have been fighting. A cease-fire is arranged between two fighting forces. The Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] is fighting that small clique of Presidential Guards and elements of the government Army who took it upon themselves to massacre innocent banyaRwanda [Rwandans]. These officers should explain whether they are in league with or fighting alongside these murderous criminals, which they are. Then they need not waste their breath requesting for a cease-fire, since the RPF went to Kigali to reinforce its battalion, which was under attack, to restore order and security and to stop the indiscriminate killing of innocent people by the Presidential Guards and elements of the government Army. The RPF soldiers have accomplished their mission. If these officers are in the clique of murderers, then they should not ask for a cease-fire or later on expect it. If they are not with the murderous Presidential Guard and have disassociated themselves from the government Army elements who kill and loot, then they should not be requesting for a cease-fire. Instead they should be fighting alongside the RPF soldiers against the criminal elements of the government Army and the notorious Presidential Guard. How could they be asking for a cease-fire when the criminal elements are still killing innocent people? How could they be asking for a cease-fire when the retreating government soldiers are killing people in Kigali, Butare, Cyangugu, and Kibungo. How could they be asking for a cease-fire when the extremist radio RTLM [Radio Television Libre des Milles Collines] speaks the whole day and night calling upon the population to kill each other just under the very noses of these officers? These officers should know that as long as all this is going on, the RPF will fight on until it restores order and security. Having said that, should these officers have separated themselves from the Presidential Guard, then they should join the RPF, fight the criminals and help restore order and security in the country. In this case, they should not be requesting for a cease-fire. Instead they should be disarming the Presidential Guard and the bad elements of the Army. They should be making statements to the effect that they have joined the RPF in the country in stopping the criminals from committing atrocities. On the other hand, if these officers are in league with or are part of the criminal elements, then they leave the RPF no option but to fulfill its patriotic duty of restoring order and security and protecting not only the Rwandan nationals but also the foreigners in the country.
