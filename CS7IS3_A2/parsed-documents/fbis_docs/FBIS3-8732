In the meantime, he continued with his pressure over Japan because of the large U.S. trade deficit and opened North Korea's doors for the international inspection of nuclear plants. Therefore, it is no wonder that the majority of Americans are concerned about the President's foreign policy, and our people, on their side, are worried about Macedonia's position in all that, aware that the events in the Balkans are far from a happy ending. Namely, after Greece's latest blockade, it looks as if Greece is once again in the offensive in relation to the Republic of Macedonia, although the West strongly condemned this act. While the majority of Americans seem to be mainly content with the way Clinton is conducting the foreign policy, the majority of foreign political experts, diplomats, and observers, criticize it for lack of concept, for insecurity of power, for naivete, and for delayed foreign political decisionmaking. What is U.S. policy in the Balkans, naive or thoughtful, timely or tedious? Many of those following the events in the Balkans, experts and journalists, have for some time warned about the increased danger of the war spreading to the south. Some reporters go so far, for instance the one from the BBC, who explained to his viewers the reason why he left Sarajevo and moved to Skopje from Sarajevo, saying he was now waiting for the war to start in Macedonia. After such statements we cannot but ask ourselves whether it is the journalists who sometimes create events in order to make exclusive reports. Talking about sensitive zones such as ours, or as was in the Gulf, it is known in Washington that sometimes even the U.S. State Department is informed of journalists' reports. Therefore, it is possible to push the events violently and create an image that is totally opposite to reality. Although many such events, terrifying for us, are based on the exclusivity of some journalists at any cost, one should not underestimate the persistent warnings of some experts about spreading the war. However, they are wrong in one thing, in their claims that the war is threatening from the north, totally leaving out Greece, whose present act of a full embargo against Macedonia represents the greatest war threat. The U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, at the so-called interrogation in the Congress Subcommittee for outside operations on 1 March, said: "As far as Macedonia is concerned, we have a strong feeling for maintaining the territorial integrity of that country. We have 300 soldiers there and we urged all the countries in the region to be concerned about Macedonia. I think its future is of importance for the United States," Christopher emphasized and also added: "We put it clearly to Serbia that if they harmed the independence of Macedonia in any way, it would generate a sound reaction from the United States." This stance was the answer to the question of Congressman Allver, who asked the secretary of state to explain why Macedonia was not mentioned on page six of his statement, where it said that the United States was directing its efforts to the south, to Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania. According to the aforementioned explanation given by Warren Christopher, it seems that the document was prepared preceding the recognition of the Republic of Macedonia, and it is totally clear that the United States attaches extreme importance to Macedonia on its list. According to some State Department announcements the situation is cautiously monitored and, if necessary, they are ready to react, which is nothing new, if we recall that last May the Pentagon announced that, in case of a threat to Macedonia, U.S. planes will directly attack Belgrade. Nevertheless, despite such mental acrobatics, there still remains the question of how real the danger for Macedonia from Serbia is, and whether the threat from Greece is not greater. In other words, as a U.S. colleague said, trying to explain the Greek act, when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal in 1967 for Tehran, it was considered to be a war act. Therefore, if there actually is a threat to peace in the south of the Balkans, like he said, it certainly is because of the Greek chauvinism. The U.S. Administration has, in this context, admonished the Greek act and this was explicitly stated to the Greek ambassador in Washington, Tsilas, at his meeting with the deputy Secretary of State Oxman and Tarrioff [name as transliterated]. Despite all that, the embargo has been carried out for more than three weeks. Therefore, instead of forcing the threat of a war situation from the north, it might be preferable if the West, and even the United States, were more direct toward Greece, because it is not only Serbia's best ally, but with the present embargo against Macedonia, it is clearly generating damage that can push it and the Balkans into an abyss. For the United States there is no dilemma that it would be fatal for the region and that it would provoke conflict within NATO. The West should ultimately bring its "spoiled child" to its senses and explain to it that there is no more cold war. That is why Greece can no longer write history as it suits it, and claim that Macedonia is an artificial product, forgetting that it was thanks to the interests of the big powers that it once got a part of Macedonia, guaranteed to it with all possible international acts, to which Macedonia has added and continues to offer additional guarantees. Greece should at last stop its hostile propaganda against the Republic of Macedonia, stop claiming that the Macedonian people does not exist, and of course, it should stop interfering in internal affairs by putting forward thousands of conditions. Only the West can awaken it from that dream, before the dream turns into a coma. Macedonia is not only in the U.S. zone of interest, but also in the Russian, because Russia will not cede the full world's leadership to the United States, especially after it apparently stood on the side of Serbia in the Bosnian war, which implies that its position in the Macedonian-Greek dialogue would be more significant.
