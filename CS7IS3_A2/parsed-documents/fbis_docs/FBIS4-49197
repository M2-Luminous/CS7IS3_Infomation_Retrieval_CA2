What is the significance of this? When interviewed by this reporter, Chen Jinhua, minister of the State Planning Commission, said it was a positive measure taken by the party Central Committee and the State Council to promote the establishment of the socialist market economic structure with the overall situation of reform, development, and stability in mind. Practicing Market Regulation Does Not Mean Letting Things Drift Chen Jinhua pointed out: The general situation is fine, the market is brisk, and the public feeling is stable. However, an outstanding problem is the soaring prices. He said: This chiefly manifests itself in chaotic market price order, indiscriminate price increases, and indiscriminate collection of fees. Some enterprises have taken advantage of the introduction of tax system reform, exchange rates, and prices to drive up prices. For the sake of local interests, some localities have exceeded their own power in fixing prices and indiscriminately collecting fees. Some businessmen, disregarding the regulation on putting goods on sale with the prices clearly marked, have asked for exorbitant prices, sought staggering profits, sold fake and shoddy products, cheated people in the same trade, and played the bullyboy. To a certain extent, all this has disrupted the market order and affected normal production and circulation. The party Central Committee and the State Council have paid great attention to this problem. Since the second half of last year, they have taken economic, legal, and the necessary administrative measures to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control over prices. The current nationwide general price inspection is aimed at pushing the implementation of various regulation and control measures further ahead, to create a better external environment for enterprises to develop fair competition, promote the change of operation system, improve operations and management, and raise economic efficiency. Chen Jinhua stressed: In line with the requirement to establish a socialist market economic structure, the prices of the overwhelming majority of commodities and service fees are now regulated by the market. However, lifting price controls does not mean letting things adrift, still less does it mean refusing to have anything more to do with it. No country in the world takes a completely laissez-faire attitude toward prices. Countries practicing the market economy like the United States and Japan impose strict but effective controls over the prices of important commodities which have a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood and also over service fees. It is the aim of our party and government to serve the people heart and soul and it is the fundamental duty of our government to be concerned with the vital interests of the masses. To develop a nationwide price inspection and punish price violators is an important action in protecting the interests of the masses, stabilizing the people's livelihood, and maintaining social stability. The Main Emphasis of the Inspection Is on the Prices of the Basic Necessities of Life and Service Fees Chen said: The price inspection this time covers all enterprises, small industrial and commercial businesses, and administrative and public institutions which collect fees and charges. It will inspect those price violations which have happened since the latter half of 1993 while serious violation cases will be traced back to the latter half of 1992. The main contents of the inspection are as follows: First, the action of taking advantage of tax system reform to arbitrarily raise prices, increase the purchase and sales price differentials as well as the wholesale and retail price differentials, and increase the prices of goods or service fees by adding value added tax rate to the original prices. Second, in violation of the price control jurisdiction, the action of arbitrarily raising commodity prices or service fees which should be fixed by the state; the action of arbitrarily raising prices and collecting fees in railroad, highway, and shipping transportation and forcibly asking people to purchase insurance when selling or handling tickets. Third, the action of selling, without price ceilings or in excess of the stipulated price differentials or profit rates, those commodities whose prices have been liberalized and raising prices in disguised forms such as giving short measure, adulterating, and using inferior goods in place of proper ones. Fourth, the action of violating state regulations regarding the system of putting on file and submitting reports on price adjustments and the procedures for controlling price differentials and setting temporary price limits and also the action of failing to clearly mark prices. Fifth, the action of arbitrarily raising the prices of agricultural capital goods, such as chemical fertilizer, plastic film for farming, farm chemicals, and diesel oil for farm use, as well as electricity prices in rural areas, in violation of the relevant state regulations. Sixth, the action of exceeding one's authority in introducing new fee collection items, enlarging the scope of fee collection, and raising the fee collection standards at random. Chen Jinhua demanded that all units and individuals under inspection voluntarily accept inspection by providing actual data. Those who find pretexts to create difficulties and refuse inspection will be punished heavily. Inspectors and those who report and inform against misconduct should be protected and no retaliation against them will be tolerated. Those who shield, are partial to, or connive at price violations will be held accountable and seriously dealt with. Meanwhile, in light of the problems discovered during the inspection, we should strengthen management of those commodities whose prices have been liberalized. At the same time, we should also help enterprises to establish sound rules and regulations, promote their change of operational mechanism, and strengthen their ability for self-restraint. Investigate and Punish Illegal Conduct According to Law and Protect Consumer's Interests Chen Jinhua said: The nationwide price inspection is based on the following laws, regulations, and policies: The "PRC Regulations on Price Management"; the State Council's "Circular on Launching Nationwide Price Inspection" and "Circular on Strengthening Supervision and Inspection Over the Prices of the Basic Necessities of Life and Service Fees"; the "Stipulations on Putting Goods on Sale and Offering Services With Prices Clearly Marked" promulgated by the State Planning Commission with State Council approval; the "Circular on Views on Verifying and Handling Items Involving Peasant Burdens" by the CPC Central Committee General Office and the State Council General Office; the Finance Ministry's "Regulations on Bringing Unauthorized Fee Collection Under Control" transmitted by the CPC Central Committee General office and the State Council General Office; the "Circular on Ensuring Price Stability After Tax System Reform" by the State Planning Commission and the State Administration of Taxation; the "Regulations on Punishing Cases of Price Violations" by the former State Price Bureau; and a series of other administrative rules and regulations and normative documents. During the nationwide price inspection, we should continue to carry out the policy of "being lenient toward those who check themselves and severe toward those who are checked, seeking truth from facts, and treating with appropriate leniency and severity". The units and individuals who have violated relevant price regulations will be ordered to return their illegal gains to the purchasers or users. The illegal gains which cannot be returned will be confiscated by price inspection institutions. At the same time, the units and individuals concerned will be fined according to the seriousness of their cases. When necessary, the industrial and commercial administration will be requested to revoke their business licenses. If they refuse to return the illegal gains or pay the fines, the price inspection institutions can instruct the bank wherein they have their account to transfer the money in accordance with the relevant regulations. If they do not have any bank account, or there is no money in their bank account, the price inspection institutions have the right to sell their goods to cover the sum they should return or pay as a fine. The inspection institutions can impose fines on those who assume direct responsibility and those in charge of the enterprises and public institutions according to the seriousness of their cases. It can also suggest that the department concerned take disciplinary sanction against them. Those who violate the criminal law, thus committing a crime, will be investigated by the judicial department and their criminal responsibilities affixed. In conclusion, Chen emphatically pointed out: In the general price inspection it is necessay to step up the study on drawing demarcation lines in applying a policy and strive to solve new problems, with new ways of thinking and new methods, in accordance with the goal of establishing a socialist system of market economy to ensure the implementation of the macroeconomic regulation and control measures and promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy.
