Custom tariffs will remain greater for products such as fresh cheese, grapes, coffee, wheat, and cigarettes than those agreed upon at the multilateral level, a policy which is intended to protect national industry. Sources close to the Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat (Secofi) have said despite the commitments decided during the Uruguay Round of agreements, there will be no negative impact on the Mexican agricultural sector, because nearly 80 percent of the trade in this area is with the United States and Canada. The Uruguay Round of negotiations, which concluded on 15 December, were incorporated into the text of the Free Trade Agreement between Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Experts on the issue have said despite the fact the multilateral negotiations were less in-depth than the ones that took place at the trilateral level, Mexico had to compromise on deregulating agricultural products included in NAFTA. This means as of 1 January 1995, when the World Trade Organization (WTO) [Organization Mundial de Commercio] is scheduled to become effective, any of the 118 GATT member countries will be able to export sensitive agricultural products to Mexico if they decide to pay the custom tariffs. Goods which for years were protected as part of the country's national development strategy and are now open to international trade include: corn, beans, malt, barley, poultry, turkey, animal fat, and potatoes. The negotiated tarrifs, despite Mexico's opposition to tax sensitive products, fluctuates between a minimum of 128 percent for barley and 282 percent for animal fat. The only agricultural products for which Secofi negotiators were able to ensure tariffs greater than those granted to the United States and Canada as part of the NAFTA agreements include: fresh cheese, with 139 percent, which in NAFTA was downgraded to 40 percent; grapes, 50 percent, up from 20 percent in NAFTA; coffee, with 80 percent, up from 20 percent in the free trade agreement; wheat, 74 percent, up from 15 percent during the trilateral agreement; and cigarettes, 75 percent, up from 50 percent during the trade pact. This means implementation of noncustom tariff barriers despite Mexico's opposition along with Canada, Korea [north or south not specified], and Japan. In exchange, Mexico was able to incorporate all NAFTA agricultural quotas as part of its commitments with GATT. The reduction in agricultural products, which will allow an increase in agricultural exports from third countries to Mexico, are not expected to hamper national industry, because the basis for trade transactions will take place as per consolidated tarrifs, not according to applied tariff levels. Mexico has consolidated tariff totals by 50 percent, while applied tariff levels fluctuate between 10 and 20 percent. According to GATT estimates, world trade between 1985 to 2000 is forecasted to grow by 12.4 percent, an estimated increase in the world's annual gross national product totaling $230 billion. Mexico negotiated the Uruguay Round as part of a bloc of developing countries, although individually was able to ensure agricultural tariff concessions from Switzerland, Australia, the Soviet Union, Japan and the Nordic countries. Switzerland decreased its importation of Mexican products such as natural honey, melons, papayas, avocados, skins of citrus fruits, and cotton by more than 36 percent. Australia cut its importations of frozen strawberries, frozen orange juice, rum, and taffia by more than 20 percent. On average, the European Union decreased its importation of goods such as natural honey, coffee, tobacco, avocados, safflower oil, guava jelly, mangoes, frozen broccoli, horse meat, roses, gladiolus flowers, carnations, frozen orange juice, pineapples, papaya, and mushrooms by 31 percent. Secofi sources believe Mexico is in a position to increase its international market share in sectors that have definite competitive advantages such as textiles, garments, agricultural, food, and beverage products.
