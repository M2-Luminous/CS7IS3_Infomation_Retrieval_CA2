In violation of the international arms embargo against the Bosnian belligerents, trucks loaded with light arms, anti-tank weapons and ammunition have been leaving the Croatian coast regularly for Bosnia since a Croat-Moslem federation pact was agreed in March, the sources said. The agreement to form the federation ended a year of bloody conflict between the two ethnic groups. The sources in Zenica, headquarters of the Moslem-led Bosnian army's Third Corps, said most of the weapons were destined for the Brcko corridor in northern Bosnia -- a strategic lifeline linking Serb-conquered territory in eastern and western Bosnia which UN officials fear is the next Bosnian army target. The federation agreement also freed Moslem troops who had been deployed against the Croats to launch attacks last week on Serb positions in northeastern Bosnia. The Serbs have protested the attacks as a clear violation of a month-long ceasefire which started on June 10 and they began over the weekend hindering aid convoys into the Moslem-majority Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, in retaliation. "Croats from both Croatia and Bosnia are letting convoys go through in exchange for part of their cargo," a UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officer told AFP on condition he not be named. "They only tolerate light arms and anti-tank guns, to shift the balance of power in the Moslems' favour just a little, but not more," he said. "There's no question of heavy arms for the moment -- the distrust (between the Moslems and Croats) is not about to disappear," he said. "One thing is certain, money is no object," he said. "Suitcases full of dollars and deutschmarks enter the country every day, supplied notably by Islamic countries," the UN officer said. A Bosnian Army officer at the Third Corps headquarters here acknowledged that his forces lacked artillery and air power, but said the weapons getting through were sufficient. "Give us modern anti-tank weapons and we will liberate our land," he told AFP. The Bosnian Government has long called for an end to the blanket arms embargo on all former Yugoslav republics, imposed when fighting first broke out three years ago, saying it would not need proposed international aid against Serb aggression if it could defend itself properly. The Bosnian Army has a large infantry, but is not as well equipped in heavy weaponry as the Serbs, who had access to the former Yugoslav army's arsenal. A European military expert in the region confirmed that Moslem-Croat cooperation in this field, at least, was working "very well." "Convoys pass through Croat zones without being looted outrageously, which is what often happened before," he said. A reliable source in Zenica said 200 tonnes of Chinese arms were delivered at the end of May, including Norinco Red Arrow 8 anti-tank missiles. The arms came by air to Ancona in Italy, continuing by boat to Split on the Croatian coast before being unloaded onto 34 trucks, he said. The convoy, fronted by four truckloads of food and escorted by Croatian police, crossed into Bosnia without difficulty. It was then handed over to Bosnian police, continuing through Visoko, Tuzla and Maoca near the Brcko corridor, he said. The European military expert said another convoy of 50 trucks, probably carrying arms, was seen at the Croat town of Prozor on the road linking the Croatian coast with central Bosnia. An article appearing this weekend in the London-based JANE'S DEFENCE WEEKLY showed a photograph of the Red Arrow 8 missiles near the front at Gradacac. The missile has a range of 3,000 metres (yards) and can pierce armour eight centimetres (around three inches) thick.
