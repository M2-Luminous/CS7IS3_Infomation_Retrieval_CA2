FR940328-0-00023 FR940328-0-00012 The island of Oahu was formed from the remnants of two large shield volcanoes, the younger Koolau volcano on the east and the older Waianae volcano to the west (Department of Geography 1983). Their original shield volcano shape has been lost as a result of extensive erosion, and today these volcanoes are called mountains or ranges, and consist of long, narrow ridges. The Koolau Mountains were built by eruptions that took place primarily along a northwest-trending rift zone (Macdonald et al. 1983) and formed a range now approximately 37 miles (mi) (60 kilometers (km)) long (Foote et al. 1972). Median annual rainfall for the Koolau Mountains varies from 50 to 250 inches (in) (130 to 640 centimeters (cm)), most of which is received at higher elevations along the entire length of the windward (northeastern) side (Taliaferro 1959). The vegetation communities of the Koolau Mountains, especially in the upper elevations to which many of the 11 plant taxa are restricted, are primarily lowland mesic and wet forests dominated by Metrosideros polymorpha ('ohi'a) and/or other tree or fern taxa. Much of the Koolau Mountain Range is vegetated with alien plant taxa. Most of the remaining native vegetation is restricted to steep valley headwalls and inaccessible summit ridges. The windswept ridges are very steep and are characterized by grasses, ferns, and low-growing, stunted shrubs (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990). The land that supports these 11 plant taxa is owned by the City and County of Honolulu, the State of Hawaii (including land classified as natural area reserve and forest reserve), the Federal government, and various private parties. Plants on Federal land are located on the boundary of Schofield Barracks Military Reservation, under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army, and Lualualei Naval Reserve, under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Navy. Populations of five taxa grow on land leased by the U.S. Army from private parties and the State. Discussion of the 11 Plant Taxa P.E. Boissier (1862) described Euphorbia deppeana based on a 1835 collection by Ferdinand Deppe that had been erroneously labelled as being from California (Millspaugh 1916; Sherff 1941, 1944). Otto and Isa Degener and Leon Croizat accepted the elevation of the section Chamaesyce to the generic level and published the necessary combinations for the Hawaiian taxa (Croizat 1943; Degener and Croizat 1936a, 1936b, 1937; Koutnik 1987; Koutnik and Huft 1990). Other names by which Chamaesyce deppeana has been known are Anisophyllum californicum (Koutnik 1987), Chamaesyce festiva (Degener and Croizat 1936b), Euphorbia festiva (Sherff 1936), and E. pauciflora (Koutnik and Huft 1990). Chamaesyce deppeana , a member of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae), is an erect subshrub up to 4 feet (ft) (1.2 meters (m)) tall with fuzzy branches. The hairless leaves, generally oval-shaped and often notched at their tips, are between 0.2 and 0.8 in (5 and 20 millimeters (mm)) long and 0.2 and 0.5 in (5 and 12 mm) wide; they are arranged in two opposite rows along the stem. The leaf margins are usually toothed, rarely toothless. The small, petalless flower clusters (cyathia), 0.06 to 0.1 in (1.5 to 3 mm) wide, are borne singly in the leaf axils (point between the stem and leaf stalk) and produce small capsules about 0.1 in (2 mm) long. Seeds have not been observed. This species is distinguished from others in the genus by the following combination of characters: leaves arranged in two rows on opposite sides of the branches; leaves glabrous; leaf apex notched; leaf margin toothed; and cyathia width (Boissier 1862, Koutnik and Huft 1990, Sherff 1936). Historically, Chamaesyce deppeana was known only from southern Oahu. Because the few collections that were made were collected prior to the 20th century, it was thought to be extinct (Koutnik and Huft 1990). In 1986, Joel Lau and Sam Gon of The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii (TNCH) rediscovered C. deppeana on State land in the southern Koolau Mountains of Oahu in Nuuanu Pali Wayside State Park near the Pali Lookout, a popular tourist attraction (Hawaii Heritage Program (HHP) 1991a). About 50 to 100 individuals grow near there, with such plant taxa as 'ohi'a, Bidens sandvicensis (ko'oko'olau), Casuarina equisetifolia (common ironwood), and Phyllanthus distichus (pamakani mahu) (Hawaii Plant Conservation Center (HPCC) 1990a; Joel Lau, TNCH, John Obata and Steve Perlman, HPCC, pers. comms., 1991). The most visible and accessible plants, comprising about 30 percent of the population, are confined to a 200 square foot (sq ft) (20 sq m) area, portions of which extend to within 15 ft (5 m) of the Pali Lookout parking lot (HHP 1991a). The remaining plants are scattered on an adjacent steep, exposed, windswept slope growing with grasses and shrubs (HHP 1991a; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1991). This population is found at an elevation of approximately 1,000 ft (300 m) (Center for Plant Conservation (CPC) 1989b, HHP 1991a, HPCC 1990a, Koutnik and Huft 1990). The major threats to the single known population of Chamaesyce deppeana are competition for water, space, light, and nutrients with various alien plant taxa (common ironwood, Paspalum conjugatum (Hilo grass), and Schinus terebinthifolius (Christmas berry)), and stochastic extinction due to the limited number of individuals and restricted range. Fire and impact by humans threaten the species as well.
