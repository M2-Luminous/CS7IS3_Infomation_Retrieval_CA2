Marco Fritella reports: [Fritella] Sure -- no, very sure -- of victory, the leaders nevertheless continue to argue without even taking a pause. In other words there is continual bickering on the Right. We will end up like Renzo's capons [as heard], said Pierferdinando Casini, leader of the Christian Democrat Center party, inviting the parties to call a truce. However, no one is willing. Gianfranco Fini, secretary of the National Alliance, said that the Northern League will lose votes, in fact it will collapse, and after the elections Umberto Bossi would be left holding a worse hand than before. Bossi retorted during the presentation of the League's manifesto that Fini was and remains a fascist, and as for Forza Italia, it is an instrument of the old regime. He said that the League had made a pact with Silvio Berlusconi only because otherwise the party's vote would have split. Raffaele Costa from the Liberal Party observed rather worriedly that a little more unity was necessary. The reality is that both the Right and the Left have created artificial alliances which will shatter immediately, Giorgio La Malfa, secretary of the Republican Party, maintained, weighing in for the center parties. The Left has breathed a sigh of relief at the fact that today Fausto Bertinotti, secretary of Communist Renewal, said that he wanted at all costs to maintain the unity of the progressive alignment. It is a pity then that he has different ideas on treasury bonds and NATO from the other members of the alignment. However, the Right means reaction, Lucio Magri and Armando Cossutta, of Communist Renewal, stated, and so it is necessary to stick together. And what of Achille Occhetto? Tomorrow he is leaving for Brussels and NATO headquarters -- the umbrella which was so liked by Enrico Berlinguer [former Communist Party leader].
