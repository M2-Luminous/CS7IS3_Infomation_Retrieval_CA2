Austerity is a taboo word in wealthy Fujian, which posted a 25 percent growth rate in 1993, double the national average and displeasing to the central government. The two economic engines in the coastal region, the capital Fuzhou and the special economic zone of Xiamen, have forecast respective growth rates of 17 and 27 percent in the face of futile government calls to limit growth to 9 percent. "This rhythm suits perfectly the needs of our city," said Xiamen deputy mayor Zhu Yayan, who is in charge of economic matters. For most of the province, planning called for a modest and politcally acceptable 11 percent growth. "The forecasts are in general on the low side. We didn't foresee such a rapid rise for last year," said Wang Dexian of the Fujian planning commission. And when Wang and other provincial officials reel off the impressive list of projects in store for Fujian in 1994 and subsequent years in the fields of construction, transport, energy and telecommunications, it is difficult to imagine growth coming back into single digits soon. The province's cities seem to work 24 hours a day, and factory after factory appears in the countryside. "Public investment will undoubtedly be less important this year than last, but it's difficult to pinpoint an amount," said Wang Wengui from the communist party in Fuzhou, a city in which growth topped 33 percent last year, among the highest in the country. The most difficult task facing authorities here is to control expansion in the private sector, which is playing an increasingly important role in increasing the wealth of Fujian residents. Joint ventures now account for over half the province's industrial production, and have left state stores back in the stone age of Chinese commerce. The frenzied pace of economic development has authorities deeply worried not only about inflation, but of the lapse in social order that uncontrolled inflation could spark. But the authorities know that official attempts to dampen down the economy could anger traders and the public alike. The public is already fed up with power cuts that regularly hit stores, restaurants and Xiamen's increasingly popular video games rooms. "We must satisfy the population," Zhu said in the face of an inflation rate of over 20 percent for the first part of 1994. "Our sincere wish is to avoid consumer panic like in 1988, and we have already taken macroeconomic control measures," said Zhen Longyang of Xiamen's economic commission. "For certain essential goods such as pork and several types of vegetables we have established ceiling prices, and have started stockpiling grain, oil and cotton," she said. "Our politics are summed up in three words: Reform, development, and stability," Zhu said, refusing to enter into the debate curently taken up in Beijing about the importance of stability in relation to the other two goals. And if it is suggested to him that Fujian's rapid growth will only widen the chasm between China's rich and poor areas and so affect the country's stability, Zhu answers: "Deng Xiaoping has fully explained that some have to get rich before others."
