Nevertheless, a high-ranking Argentine Foreign Ministry source, who is well-versed on diplomatic rules, explained: "The fact that the issue is not included on the agenda does not mean it will not be discussed." Preparations for Gore's visit included a 30-minute meeting in Buenos Aires between Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella and U.S. Ambassador Cheek and a meeting in Washington between Argentine Ambassador Raul Granillo Ocampo with the U.S. vice president's advisory team. "Controversial issues have been exempted from the agenda (...). The patents law issue has been rejected because it is believed this is an excessively technical issue and all the points have been made." When he presented his credentials, Ambassador Cheek took the trouble to explain that the main priority on his agenda was to pressure for the prompt approval of a new patents law that would specifically recognize the intellectual property of U.S. laboratories. Moreover, representatives from Bill Clinton's administration have threatened to include Argentina on the list of countries that deserve to have economic sanctions imposed for violating intellectual property. The list of these countries will be disclosed on 30 April, that is, one month and 10 days after Gore's arrival in Buenos Aires. The U.S. vice president will travel to Buenos Aires to attend a UN-sponsored world telecommunications conference. He is scheduled to dine with Menem on Sunday [20 March] evening. They will see each other again on 21 March, and during this meeting the official agenda will not necessarily be respected.
