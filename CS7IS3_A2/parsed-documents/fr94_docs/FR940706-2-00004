FR940706-2-00004 FR940706-2-00002 Food Distribution Program; Value of Donated Foods from July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995 AGENCY: Food and Nutrition Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces the value of donated foods or, where applicable, cash in lieu thereof to be provided in the 1995 school year for each lunch served by schools participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) or by commodity schools and for each lunch and supper served by institutions participating in the Child and Adult Care Food Program. This notice also announces that the value of agricultural commodities and other foods provided to States during the past school year met the level of assistance authorized under the National School Lunch Act. Thus, there will be no shortfall cash payments to States for the NSLP for the 1994 school year. The annually programmed level of assistance was met in food donations by June 30, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Philip K. Cohen, Chief, Program Administration Branch, Food Distribution Division, Food and Nutrition Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, Virginia 22302&hyph;1594 or telephone (703) 305&hyph;2662. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: These programs are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under Nos. 10.550, 10.555, and 10.558 and are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, and final rule related notice published at 48 FR 29114, June 24, 1983.) This notice imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping provisions that are subject to Office of Management and Budget review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). This action is not a rule as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) and thus is exempt from the provisions of that Act. This notice has been determined to be exempt under Executive Order 12866. National Average Minimum Value of Donated Foods for the Period July 1, 1994 Through June 30, 1995 This notice implements mandatory provisions of sections 6(e), 14(f) and 17(h)(1) of the National School Lunch Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1755(e), 1762a(f), and 1766(h)(1)). Section 6(e)(1)(A) of the Act establishes the national average value of donated food assistance to be given to States for each lunch served in NSLP at 11.00 cents per meal. Pursuant to section 6(e)(1)(B), this amount is subject to annual adjustments as of July 1 of each year to reflect changes in the Price Index for Food Used in Schools and Institutions. Section 17(h)(1) of the Act provides that the same value of assistance in donated foods for school lunches shall also be established for lunches and suppers served in the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Notice is hereby given that the national average minimum value of donated foods, or cash in lieu thereof, per lunch under NSLP (7 CFR part 210) and per lunch and supper under the Child and Adult Care Food Program (7 CFR part 226) shall be 14.50 cents for the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995. The Price Index for Food Used in Schools and Institutions is computed on the basis of five major food components in the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Producer Price Index (cereal and bakery products; meats, poultry and fish; dairy products; processed fruits and vegetables; and fats and oils). Each component is assigned a proportional value using the appropriate relative weight as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The value of food assistance is adjusted each July 1 by the annual percentage change in a three- month simple average value of this Price Index for March, April and May. The three-month average of the Price Index increased by 2.92 percent from 123.23 for March, April and May of 1993 to 126.83 for the same three months in 1994. When computed on the basis of unrounded data and rounded to the nearest one-quarter cent, the resulting national average for the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995 will be 14.50 cents per meal. This is an increase of 0.50 cents from the school year 1994 rate. Section 14(f) of the Act provides that commodity schools shall be eligible to receive donated foods equal in value to the sum of the national average value of donated foods established under section 6(e) of the Act and the national average payment established under section 4 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1753). Such schools are eligible to receive up to 5 cents of this value in cash for processing and handling expenses related to the use of such foods. Commodity schools are defined in section 12(d)(7) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1760(d)(7)) as ``schools that do not participate in the school lunch program under this Act, but which receive commodities made available by the Secretary for use by such schools in nonprofit lunch programs.'' For the 1995 school year, commodity schools shall be eligible to receive donated food assistance valued at 31.50 cents for each lunch served. This amount is based on the sum of the section 6(e) level of assistance announced in this notice and the adjusted section 4 minimum national average payment factor for school year 1995. The section 4 factor for commodity schools does not include the two cents per lunch increase for schools where 60 percent of the lunches were served in the second preceding year free or at reduced prices, since that increase is applicable only to schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. Cash in Lieu Payments_Value of Donated Commodities for School Year 1994 Section 6(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1755(b)) and the regulations governing cash in lieu of donated foods (7 CFR part 240) require the Secretary of Agriculture by June 1 of each school year to estimate the value of agricultural commodities and other foods that will be delivered to States during that school year. Under the food distribution regulations (7 CFR part 250), these foods are used by schools participating in NSLP. If the estimated value is less than the total level of commodity assistance authorized under section 6(e) of the Act, the Secretary is required by July 1 of that school year to pay to each State educational agency funds equal to the difference between the value of programmed deliveries and the total level of authorized assistance for each State. During the past school year the adjusted minimum national average value of donated foods or payments of cash in lieu thereof per lunch was 14.00 cents. In accordance with section 6(e) of the Act, the mandated level of commodity assistance was $566,188,578 for school year 1994. The Secretary has determined that at least that amount was available for delivery nationally by June 30, 1994 to meet the mandated level of assistance. Notice is hereby given, therefore, that no shortfall cash payments will be made for the school year ending June 30, 1994. Authority: Sections 6(e)(1) (A) and (B), 14(f) and 17(h)(1) of the National School Lunch Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1755(e)(1)(A) and (B), 1762a(f), and 1766(h)(1)). Dated: June 29, 1994. William E. Ludwig, Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16295 Filed 7&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;30&hyph;U
