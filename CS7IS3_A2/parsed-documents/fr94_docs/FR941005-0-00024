FR941005-0-00024 FR941005-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Parts 672 and 675 [Docket No. 921058&hyph;4257; I.D. 090892B] RIN 0648&hyph;AD44 Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NMFS implements a regulatory amendment to establish standard groundfish product types and standard product recovery rates (PRRs) for purposes of managing the groundfish fisheries off Alaska and specify certain product types and PRRs that may be used to calculate round-weight equivalents of pollock for purposes of calculating amounts of pollock roe that may be retained onboard a vessel during the pollock fishery. These actions are necessary to facilitate enforcement of existing regulatory measures and to implement a statutory prohibition against the wasteful use of pollock by stripping roe (eggs) from female pollock and discarding female and male pollock carcasses without further processing, commonly known as pollock roe stripping. The intended effect of this action is to promote the purposes and policies of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). EFFECTIVE DATE: November 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the environmental assessment/regulatory impact review/final regulatory flexibility analysis (EA/RIR/FRFA) may be obtained from the Alaska Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802 (Attn: Lori Gravel). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ronald J. Berg, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) is managed by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) according to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Act and are implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675. General regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620. An explanation of, and reasons for, the establishment and specifications of standard product types and standard PRRs are contained in the notice of proposed rulemaking (58 FR 44643, August 24, 1993). The notice invited comments through September 23, 1993. It also proposed a regulatory amendment to reduce the proportion of pollock roe that may be retained onboard a vessel while participating in the directed pollock fishery. That regulatory amendment has already been implemented by a final rule (59 FR 14121, March 25, 1994). Six letters of comments were received that addressed standard product types and standard PRRs. They are summarized and responded to in the Comments Received section, below. Changes in the Final Rule From the Proposed Rule Table 2 is redesignated as Table 1 in 50 CFR 672.20(j)(1), (2) and (3)(i) and (3)(ii). The newly designated Table 1 in 50 CFR 672.20(j)(2) is revised as follows. 1. Product codes and standard PRRs are established for rex sole in the GOA to accommodate a new target species category at 50 CFR 672.20(a) resulting from 1994 groundfish specifications.
