Mikhaylov report: "In the Sea of Japan, for All That!: That's Where Our Liquid Radioactive Waste Will End Up, It Would Seem"] [Text] Journalists of Vladivostok and also foreign correspondents accredited in the kray center satisfied themselves of this once again at a news conference conducted by Ye. Stomatyuk, chairman of the Natural Resources Committee of the administration of the kray. It is he, incidentally, who was head of the kray interdepartmental commission inspecting the state of radiation safety in the handling of radioactive waste at the Zvezda Plant, which was in the city of Bolshoy Kamen on 30 March of this year. Quite a lot has already been written about this problem (KRASNOYE ZNAMYA of 17 February, "Nuclear Scrapes," and of 31 March, "Large Dollar Sum for Moscow," and a mass of publications in the local and central papers), and I will emphasize merely that the above commission reached yet again the conclusion concerning the impossibility of the storage of liquid radioactive waste in the current tanks in direct proximity to a center of population. The situation has deteriorated particularly at TNT-5, at which leaks were discovered. A real threat of radioactive contamination hangs over the waters of the Gulf of Ussuriysk and Bolshoy Kamen Bay, especially since the development of an emergency situation is expected in April-May with the arrival of settled warmth. The commission recommended in May that the liquid radioactive waste be dumped in the Sea of Japan at the points determined in the 1980's. It had not been considered possible doing this earlier on account of the fact that the liquid radioactive waste had frozen to a thickness of 60-70 cm. And, second, the urgent building of repositories and an industrial plant for decontaminating and reprocessing the liquid radioactive waste. The first recommendation could be canceled if in the very near future Moscow either allocates the funds for the designated construction or permits Japanese firms to embark on the realization of their own proposals. In this case the tankers would temporarily be taken to a place presenting no danger to people's lives. Journalists had attempted to take part in the work of the commission, incidentally, but the Pacific Fleet representative barred them from the liquid radioactive waste storage sites. And the question at the news conference as to whether the Pacific Fleet would submit to a decision of the administration on the dumping of liquid radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan if such were adopted was not inappropriate in this connection. According to the constitution, the fleet is required to submit inasmuch as local authorities are entitled, when it comes to questions of the environment, to adopt independent decisions. But Russia has yet to act so rectilinearly in accordance with the law. It is not known what Moscow will tell the Pacific Fleet. The work force of the Zvezda Plant and the population of the city of Bolshoy Kamen will have something to say also, for that matter. Their opinion cannot be relegated to the last positions, I believe.
