There had always been plenty of problems there even in quiet times, but now there are all the more. During the recent government reorganization the problems for which the Goskomsever had been responsible were transferred to the new Russian Federation Ministry for Nationalities Affairs and Regional Policy, where Pozdnyakov is deputy minister. "Does this mean that concern for northerners is taking more and more of a back seat?" I asked Aleksandr Mikhaylovich. [Pozdnyakov] Our former state committee was tasked above all with making maximum use of the brief summer shipping season to provide timely shipments of prime necessities to remote areas and to ensure that people could work uninterrupted during the long winter period. If there is any disorganization in this area, it will not be possible to avoid a major disaster -- after all, for most of the year these areas are cut off from the rest of Russia. The Goskomsever also considered it its duty to protect before the federal authorities the interests of all those who find themselves remote from the "mainland." But it protected them on the basis of its actual abilities and in its own way -- most often it asked for additional funds to be allocated for certain measures. Problems were driven underground and covered up by additional spending, instead of eradicating the root cause that had given rise to them in the first place. With our broad powers within the ministry today we are entirely capable of investigating all problems of territorial development and of resolving them by combining both local and federal interests. The first major discussion on our problems was conducted at a recent conference in Tambov. Taking part in it were representatives of major interregional associations covering the historically established economic areas of the country. These include the center of Russia, the Northwest, the Volga, the North Caucasus, the Urals, Siberia, and the Far East. Within the framework of the associations they set up several years ago, republics, krays, oblasts, and autonomous okrugs have already amassed experience of cooperation, but the associations' relationships among themselves and with the federal authorities have still not been properly organized. The conference distributed the spheres of powers for each structure. The government has not imposed its will on Federation components, but has consulted with them about how to be more successful in resolving the tasks of the country's further economic development. As a result, all the conference participants signed a document designed to avoid in the future the disappointing confrontation that has sometimes occurred between Moscow and a territory. [Bondarenko] Some time ago the major Siberian Accord association was accused of having certain separatist tendencies. To what extent was this true? [Pozdnyakov] I am well acquainted with the Siberians and I can assure you that they had no intention to engage in any kind of isolationism. The fact that statements by some of their representatives have voiced alarm and resentment about the lack of attention paid to their vital needs by the center is merely a reflection of reality. The unduly temperamental tone of the statements is also entirely explicable, and, indeed, it did have an effect. One way or another, both sides' positions have converged to a considerable extent. [Bondarenko] How do you view the attempt by the leaders of the Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenetsk Okrugs to secede [obosobitsya] from Tyumen Oblast, of which they were part? [Pozdnyakov] They can, of course, be understood. After all, the [oblast] center is in the south of the oblast, and the okrugs are in the permafrost region. Even though working and living conditions in the North are immeasurably more difficult, the lion's share of the okrugs' revenue from oil and gas previously went, apart from the capital, to Tyumen. But we are talking about natural resources -- a national asset rather than just the property of the extraction workers. It would hardly be right to close our eyes and pretend that there is no problem. A well-judged balance of interests should be maintained everywhere.
