FBIS4-6288 "dreas075_d_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 South Korea U.S., Japan `Examine' Sanctions Against DPRK U.S., Japan `Examine' Sanctions Against DPRK SK1904080894 Seoul YONHAP in English 0754 GMT 19 Apr 94 SK1904080894 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 19 (YONHAP) -- The United States has hinted that if North Korea refuses to allow additional nuclear checks before the end of April, it will go its own way to impose sanctions on the Stalinist state even before the United Nations adopts any resolution and seek Japanese cooperation in that case, the SANKEI SHIMBUN reported Tuesday. Quoting both Japanese and American diplomatic sources, the newspaper said the idea had been put to Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata by U.S. Vice President Al Gore during last week's meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, to sign the Uruguay Round trade accord. Gore, noting that North Korea's nuclear program has a greater impact on Japan's security than his own country's, suggested that the United States might impose sanctions on its own if North Korea failed to permit additional IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspections of its suspected nuclear sites by the end of April, the report said. Foreign Minister Hata told the vice president that Japan would examine the plan but did not give him an immediate answer in view of the need for the ruling coalition to first coordinate policy differences among its member parties in naming a new prime minister to replace the outgoing Morihiro Hosokawa. Entering the equation is a demand made by Shinseito, a major party in the coalition, which called for strong measures Monday to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue, it added. But a basic strategy proposed by the Nihon Shinto, another party of the coalition, urges "responsible Japanese action according to U.N. policy" in handling the issue: This would preclude Japanese cooperation in any U.S. sanctions imposed before U.N. action. Shinseito's Ichiro Ozawa, a behind-the-scenes strongman in the coalition, met Foreign Minister Hata -- a likely bet to succeed Hosokawa as prime minister -- at the latter's office on Tuesday, raising speculation that they discussed dealing with North Korea when Hata becomes prime minister.
