Beijing Jiacheng Assets Appraisal Co Ltd disclosed its appraisal of the intangible assets of five enterprises early last month. They are name recognition of the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel Beijing, worth 264 million yuan ($30 million); of Hong Kong Yizhou Ltd's mainland branch, 213 million yuan ($24.5 million), of Beijing Ye Guangbei Distillery, 54 million yuan ($6.2 million ), of Hainan Airline Co 203 million yuan ($23 million); and Hainan Pisk International Airline and Tourist Club, 107 million yuan ($12 million). Name recognition is a measure of an enterprise's ability to profit from the popularity of its name or the trademark of its products. Other intangible assets are copyrights, patents, service symbols, software, management systems and permission to make a product. "Our work aims to popularize the concept of intangible assets," said Zhu Sheng, managing director of Beijing Jiacheng Assets Appraisal. "Now, many Chinese are still blind to the value of intangible assets, which hinders the development of China's market economy. Neglecting to appraise intangible assets may result in loss of valuable fixed assets, Zhu said. For instance, while co-operating with foreign investors many Chinese enterprises fail to calculate the value of intangible assets. And an inexact appraisal of intangible assets could lead to losses as enterprises shift to shareholding companies. At the same time, appraisals may help reduce the number of trademark infringement cases by fixing a trademark's value. Underestimating trademark value is a major problem in current appraisals of intangible assets, Zhu added. A famous trademark like Tsingtao beer is valued at only 200 million yuan ($23 million) and Fenjiu is worth 30 million yuan ($3.5 million). In comparison, the trademark value of the immensely popular Marlboro cigarettes exceeds $31 billion, twice the brand's annual sales. And for Coca-Cola it is $24.4 billion, compared with annual sales of $8.4 billion. "It is a pity that China is not represented on the list of the world's top 10 famous trademarks, although it has many high-quality products bearing nationally famous trademarks," Zhu said. "One goal of China's intangible assets appraisal is to establish the concept among people that trademarks may mean much, as well as to help its own famous trademarks tap the world's market."
