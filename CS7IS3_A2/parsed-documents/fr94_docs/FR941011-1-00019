ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes to approve the state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Florida for the purpose of correcting minor deficiencies in the Motor Vehicle Inspection Program and revising the air quality classifications in Florida's SIP to coincide with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rational for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should do so at this time. DATES: To be considered, comments must be received by November 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: Alan Powell, Regulatory Planning and Development Section, Air Programs Branch, Air, Pesticides & Toxics Management Division, Region IV Environmental Protection Agency, 345 Courtland Street, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365.
