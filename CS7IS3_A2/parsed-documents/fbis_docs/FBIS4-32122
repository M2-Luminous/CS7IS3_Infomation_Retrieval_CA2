This would mean the defrocking of all Macedonian metropolitans and the church excommunication of Macedonian believers. The goal of forming eparchies in Macedonia had been to protect the basic human and religious rights of the Serbs there, which are being violated, Pahomije said in his interview for the Belgrade paper POLITIKA. They also aimed to reveal the Holy See's intention to place the Macedonian Church under its jurisdiction, he added. The decision to bring criminal charges against the Macedonian Church will be delivered to its head, Father Mihail in person by a Serbian delegation, Pahomije [words indistinct]. Meanwhile, the A1 television reports the Holy Synod of the Macedonian Church claims it has not received any letter or facsimile informing it of such a decision. The Holy Synod will discuss its relations with the Serbian Church at its next Wednesday session.
