Up to now, decisions on selection and thickness of coating materials for gas turbines were largely left up to experts' experience. The gas turbines were coated with highly resistant materials against severe environmental conditions. The new development has made it possible to assess proper thickness and stress by specifying materials and the condition under which the materials are being used. It now will be possible to design coatings to prevent thermal stress quantitatively, a serious problem in the past. The equipment used in high performance gas turbines, fast breeder reactors, and nuclear fusion reactors are coated with highly durable materials to enable them to stand up under high temperatures. The newly developed system is automatically able to analyze thermal stress and residual stress of functionally gradient materials with Toshiba's notebook personal computers. The thermal stress analysis software uses a steady thermal stress analysis routine based on steady heat conduction analysis and the strain control method. This enables easy analysis of thermal stress and residual stress in layered composite materials such as FGM. A database in the computer contains material constants for various kinds of heat resistant materials and severe environment resistant coating materials which Professor Toyoda and his group at Osaka University have developed. The new system develops new data of actual gradient coatings using this database. Once the type of FGM to be used is decided, the properties of intermediate compositions of FGMs can be calculated automatically by specifying the number of layers, surface materials, and bonding materials which will be used. Stress distribution within the FGM at particular temperatures can be calculated easily when temperature conditions are entered. The conventional finit element method calculated the properties of films incrementally. This required use of large computers. But the new system solves the problem through analysis of models based on strain control theory, calculations that can be done using personal computers. As a result, in addition to continuous solutions, all solutions of boundaries which had previously delayed thermal stress analysis of coating materials such as FGM, can be obtained. The finit element method provided only discontinuous solutions. For now, Toshiba plans to use the newly developed system for designing severe environment resistant coating materials in-house in their energy-related research programs.
