Rabin decided that Israel would henceforth bar the establishment and operation of political Palestinian bodies in Jerusalem. He ruled that only the Israeli Police is authorized to maintain security and enforce the law and that consequently the activities of Palestinian security bodies in the city should be prevented. The prime minister instructed Israel Police and security elements to meticulously monitor what goes on at Orient House (seat of the Palestinian delegation in East Jerusalem) and immediately terminate any illegal activities detected in the place. After being briefed about the activities of the Palestinian rejectionist organizations in East Jerusalem, Rabin instructed security elements and Israel Police to conduct a thorough investigation into their activities and to close down any institution or body affiliated with them. [passage omitted] At yesterday's meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Likud Knesset Member Beni Begin quoted Faysal al-Husayni as stating in a news conference at Orient House on Sunday that "Jerusalem will be the capital of Palestine." According to Begin, "the Arabs claim they were given a commitment to discuss the future of Jerusalem. Knowing Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, I suggest that we believe them." Reacting to this allegation, Rabin said that "to the best of my knowledge, 'Arafat was given an excerpt of Peres' speech in the Knesset about freedom of worship and free access to the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. Even today, the Arabs are in charge of administering their holy shrines." A senior PLO official stated yesterday that Israel and the PLO had exchanged official messages about the status of the Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem. The exchange took place in February, in the final days of the deliberations about the first Cairo agreement. "We are not talking about a section of the Cairo agreement, but about an exchange of messages signed by the most senior officials on both sides in the final days of the negotiations about the first Cairo agreement," the senior PLO official asserted. The messages deal with the status quo in Jerusalem in general, and that of the Palestinian institutions in particular. They include a general commitment on the part of Israel to honor the existence of these institutions and to abstain from taking any measures that might adversely affect them. The names of the institutions in question are not cited in the messages. An urgent debate on the issue was held yesterday in al-Husayni's office at Orient House, with the participation of the directors of Palestinian institutions in and outside Jerusalem and other figures. The participants would not divulge the content of the deliberations or the resolutions adopted. [passage omitted]
