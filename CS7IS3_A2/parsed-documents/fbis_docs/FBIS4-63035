It appears that it is in someone's interest to keep bombarding public opinion with all sorts of speculation about resignations, dismissals, and reshuffles in the top echelons of power. The purpose of this permanent campaign is to break the rhythm of reforms and to prevent society from consolidating, Filatov said. Sergey Filatov, who has been at the head of the presidential administration since the end of January 1993, believes the top priority for Russia's top leadership at this stage is purposeful work aimed at strengthening civil peace and carrying out economic reforms.
