Regarding the Haitian crisis, he backed the OAS and UN efforts to reestablish democracy in that country. He also referred to international commerce and the current trend to liberalize it. He said that statements of principles are not enough if events continue to show that nations are denied the right to participate in this new commercial order because of protection measures being implemented. He especially regretted the difficulties of gaining access to European and United States markets encountered by several Central American products. He asked Spain and Portugal to back initiatives to resolve those problems "in their position as the intermediaries between Europe and America." In his speech at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which is being held in the Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, Figueres asserted that the democratic system had become stronger in Central America, "great improvements" had been made in human rights, and the economies had advanced to the opening of markets. "We must ensure those advances in the coming years," Figueres emphasized. He, however, expressed his concern for the social effects caused by policies to improve economic indicators. He insisted in benefits of the "Alliance for a Feasible Development" program, established by the Central American presidents on the basis of respect for their people's social needs and the conservation of their natural resources. To attain a feasible development, the governments' efforts to further the economic sector have to be carried out in conjunction with their social investment, he asserted. Concurrently, we have to "strengthen our democratic institutions" because, he insisted, feasible development requires a solid pluralist base as growth "can only be parceled in a society that lives and produces in a democracy." Figueres, who assumed the presidency on 8 May and who participated in the continental summit for the first time, asked for international understanding of the problems confronted by Central America after the wars and political instability suffered in the region during the past decades. Costa Rica, he said, intends to give priority to its social objectives and to "change the market and the state in a creative manner." The Costa Rican head of state believes the objective is to gain access to the upper levels of international competition, but not by offering advantages based on low wages or on the excessive exploitation of natural resources.
