His idea is to give the right wing enough time to realize that an independent state for Afrikaners is unattainable, writes Z.B. du Toit. Proponents of a separate state for Afrikaners achieved some measure of success this week when the Volkstaatraad [homeland council], whose task it is to formulate a plan for such a state according to the constitution, met for the first time. This happened amid growing suspicions that right-wingers are the target of a long and well-planned maneuver by President Mandela to do away with the idea of a volkstaat as well as to defuse the threat of right-wing politics. The essence of this is that President Mandela wants right-wingers to come to the realization that the establishment of a white homeland is an impossible task, or at least to show them that the idea is so unfeasible that they will abandon it. For a while now, the ANC has apparently carefully been trying not to show its strong opposition to an ethnic home for Afrikaners, with the knowledge that the current delicate constitutional process should not be exposed to the threat of disruptive action by right-wingers. No Feasible Plan What has led to the ANC finally accommodating the right wing is the absence thus far of any practical plan for a homeland. All the major right-wing political parties, primarily established to promote apartheid, were until recently strongly opposed to an independent state for Afrikaners. With its strategy of accommodating the right wing the ANC will also be able to gain the advantage because of the strong differences in opinion among those in favor of a homeland. Some are emotionally committed to a homeland somewhere in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, while others are dogmatic in their attempts to establish one in the northwestern Cape. During negotiations Mr. Mandela and the ANC threw the ball neatly into the court of the right wing with their invitation: Draw up a plan, put it on the table and let us take a look at it. The ANC must realize that any expert investigation into a homeland in the north will have to bow down to the harsh reality of an overwhelming majority of blacks in the region, and Afrikaners totally dependent on an economy dominated by black labor. An Afrikaans state in the region will lead to either the large-scale movement of people or disenfranchisement, the two biggest sins of apartheid. This is of course not practical. Rejected If the Volkstaatraad had to approach the Constitutional Assembly with such a plan, it would immediately be rejected. The ANC knows it will have world support when it does this. The only remaining option is that a relatively uninhabited region of the country be selected in which Afrikaners can resettle themselves over a long period so that a white majority can be assured and a new country established. If President Mandela wants to do something practical about his accommodation politics then he could even suggest that such an area, for example Northwestern Cape, be cordoned off temporarily as a possible future Afrikaner state. This would present a challenge to the far-right to develop the area, including setting up basic services which forms part of any new state; however, will Afrikaners be able to do this? The impression is created that President Mandela wants to find out now if Afrikaners really are in favor of a homeland, if one takes into account his reference to a referendum among Afrikaners to test support for a white homeland. It is also possible that he will wait for the first concrete proposals on the homeland to be presented so that all Afrikaners are aware of its content, because the ANC apparently reasons that large-scale uprooting will be necessary and will not exactly be enthusiastically received among the majority of Afrikaners.
