Lin Xinshu, 51, interviewed by telephone, said he believes his four-day detention was due to a letter he and nine other Fuzhou intellectuals and students sent in late May to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The letter called for the resignation of Premier Li Peng, the promotion to prime minister of Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and for compensation for those killed when the Chinese Army opened fire upon unarmed citizens in the streets of Beijing in 1989. Lin was picked up by plainclothes police on June 2 and released Monday, he said. He did not know the whereabouts of the other nine signatories. He was forced into exile in Fuzhou from his native Beijing in 1992 and has been detained six times since the 1989 pro-democracy protests, he said. Three previous letters he sent to the central committee demanded the resignation of Li, who signed the martial law order of May 1989, Lin said. The letters also called for the rehabilitation of ousted Communist Party general secretary Zhao Ziyang, he said. The Chinese Government in March ordered a nationwide crackdown on political dissent aimed at weeding out those who are opposed to the official verdict that the peaceful demonstrations in 1989 was a "counterrevolutionary rebellion."
