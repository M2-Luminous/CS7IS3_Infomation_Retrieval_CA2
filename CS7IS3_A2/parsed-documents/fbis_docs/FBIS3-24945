He was enthusiastically received when he told the crowd that already jobs were being created by the lifting of sanctions and by progress made in South Africa. The National Party [NP] federal congress this week had been paralysed by a spirit of gloom as the party leadership had no vision. "They say they removed apartheid, how selfish. It is you people here and your leaders who went to jail that forced the removal of apartheid. The people brought an end to apartheid." Mr Mandela said NP was paralysed and terrified by the rightwing. "The rightwing started a radio station illegally, but instead of closing them down, they went to the courts and when they were issued a court order they went and were frightened when the rightwing said they could not enter this radio station." He said President F. W. de Klerk was frightened and had no fighting spirit. The ANC vision of moving the country forward had been lauded by foreign heads of state, business people and executives of international lending organisations. "We have done all this, what has been done by the National Party?" Mr Mandela said the Conservative Party [CP] was now in the same situation as the National Party was in a few years ago. "The ANC was able to put the NP's fears about ANC to rest, and we could do the same for the CP and the Freedom Alliance," Mr Mandela said to loud applause. "The people are shunning the NP like lepers. They are still a racist party, still clinging to racism in some way or another, that is why their list of election candidates is predominantly white." White NP members wanted to hold on to the party leadership, this was the reason why there were so few people of colour on the NP's list. Mr Mandela also called for the preservation of Afrikaans. The local branch of the ANC presented Mr Mandela with a rocking chair. Mr Mandela left Sasolburg for Bothaville in the heart of the wealthy maize triangle.
