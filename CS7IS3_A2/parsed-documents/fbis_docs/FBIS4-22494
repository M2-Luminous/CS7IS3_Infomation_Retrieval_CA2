The problem of making the Russian regions sovereign did not arise out of nowhere; during the radical transformations being carried on in the country an objective trend toward weaker inter-regional links appeared. They were caused by the general, critical worsening in manageability of the country's economy, the drop in production, the liberalization of foreign economic activity, the increase in rates for transportation services, and the universal development of "barter economy." The economic space of Russia is formed from significantly different regions which are distinguished by level of economic development, sectorial specialization, and natural-climatic conditions. At the same time these regions are strongly dependent on one another. For one, they are closely interlinked by deeply specialized high-tech production. For two, for a large majority of the regions the output produced in them can only find users in the domestic Russian market. During the prolonged period of joint development a certain social division of labor among regions and sectorial specialization of regions within the framework of a single Russian economic complex took shape. This led to the situation where a large share of the output in each region is being produced for these partners or received from them. In the late 1980s this proportion was at a level of roughly 23-30 percent, that is, from a quarter to a third of the output was produced for other regions and consumed as the result of import it from them. A further disruption of links among regions will inevitably intensify the drop in production, which in turn will inevitably lead to growth in social tension. Science has the essential tool for modeling economic processes, which makes it possible to forecast deformation, weakening, and even the disintegration of links among the Russian regions and to assess the impact of changes in these links on local economies. A cycle of these modeling calculations for 11 consolidated Russian economic regions was made at INP RAN [Institute of National Economic Forecasting of the Russian Academy of Sciences]. The calculations showed that the decrease in domestic final product of a region is directly proportional to the degree of weakening of its external links. For each region the coefficient of this proportionality shows the magnitude of change in its final product (in percentage) for a one percent change in external links, that is, it shows how dependent the region is on its external links. If this coefficient is zero, the region is completely independent of external links. This means that its regional reproduction process is capable of being carried out on an autonomous, isolated, autarkic basis. If the coefficient of dependence of the region's economy on external links is equal to one, the region is completely dependent on external links and if they were fully broken the region would not be able to carry on the reproduction process. This fits regions with the most open economic systems. As a result of the modeling calculations the following values were obtained for the coefficients of dependence of the economies of the Russian regions on their external links: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Coefficients of Dependence on External Links | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ural |0.49 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |West Siberian |0.62 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Volga |0.65 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Central |0.67 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Northern |0.69 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Eastern |0.71 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |East Siberian |0.74 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |North Caucasian |0.75 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Volga-Vyatka |0.76 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Northwestern |0.78 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Central Chernozem |0.92 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A kind of "experimental" confirmation of our theoretical calculations is the fact that it is precisely in the most "independent" of the Russian regions, the Urals, where the Republic of Bashkortostan, which declared its sovereignty as early as 1990, and the Ural and South Ural Republics, which in July 1993 tried to emerge on the basis of Yekaterinburg and Chelyabinsk Oblasts of the Russian Federation respectively, are located. The oil and gas workers and miners of the West Siberian region, who are next after the Ural Region in level of economic "independence," conduct themselves quite independently. The Republic of Tatarstan, the main constituent part of the Volga Region, acts with great confidence in dealings with Russian federal authorities--this is the third-ranked among the Russian regions in level of economic "independence." So the less the economy of a region depends on external links, the higher the level of objective preconditions for its economic sovereignty. And vice versa. What paths can the Russian regions take, and what awaits them if these preconditions become reality? Possible Strategies Modeling the behavior of the Russian regions according to the strategies of their possible behavior produced the following results (see Table No 1 below). Table 1.

At the same time, the weakening of links among regions makes the strategy of regional free trade objectively possible, above all for the Ural, West Siberian, and Volga regions. In the transition to this strategy they even experience a certain increase in internal final product, mainly from sale of the output of their oil and gas industry at world prices. For all the other regions the strategy of regional free trade appears to be a definite lesser evil than the strategy of autarky because the decline in their economies within the framework of one of the strategies will be fundamentally less than in the other. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Diagram of Russian Economic Space and Regional Distribution (by percentage)| | of All-Russian: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |(Region) |Production Volume |Fixed Production |Number of Persons | | | |Capital |Employed in Produ-| | | | |ction | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Northern |4.2 |5.3 |4.1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Northwestern |5.9 |5.5 |6.2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Central |20.6 |15.4 |20.3 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Volga-Vyatka |5.5 |4.9 |6.2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ural |14.6 |15.1 |14.0 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |West Siberian |12.1 |13.8 |10.8 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |East Siberian |5.9 |7.7 |5.9 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Far Eastern |5.7 |6.3 |5.2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Central Chernozem |5.1 |5.4 |5.4 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Volga |11.8 |12.6 |11.9 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |North Caucasus |8.6 |8.0 |10.1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- But not all of these regions will be able to carry out the strategy of regional free trade in reality. This is tied, first of all, to the correspondence between output exported from the Russian regions and the requirements of the world market, that is, with its competitiveness under world price conditions. For the Northern Region, where export of output from the timber industry and ferrous metallurgy predominates, and for the Far Eastern and East Siberian regions (export of output from timber industry and nonferrous metallurgy) these requirements and conditions are feasible in principle. Consideration must also be given to the traditional export orientations of the sectors themselves in these regions. The machine building output that dominates in the export of the Central, Volga-Vyatka, and Northwestern regions will hardly be able to become competitive under world market conditions in the near future. This also applies to the machine building, light, and food industry of the North Caucasian and Central Chernozem Regions. Therefore, five regions (Central, North Caucasian, Volga-Vyatka, Northwestern, and Central Chernozem) will lose the possibility of supplying themselves on an equivalent basis with energy media, construction materials (or raw materials to process them), and output from timber and wood processing industry from the other six Russian regions which, within a strategy of free trade, would be oriented primarily to the world market. For this reason the five old industrial regions of Russia will be doomed, against their will, to a strategy of regional autarky. As a result, within the unified Russian national economic complex two alternative strategies of behavior will begin to be realized by its constituent parts, which is shown in Table 1 by means of arrows pointing in the appropriate direction. This will inevitably lead to further weakening of links among the Russian regions. Evaluation of the Consequences The consequences of realizing both strategies for the Russian regions will be extremely negative. The disastrous decline in production has already been discussed. However, the strategy of regional free trade will also be accompanied by extremely negative consequences for a number of regions. As the result of its implementation, agriculture and light and food industry, unable to withstand competition with the corresponding products in the world market, will cease to exist in the Ural and West Siberian regions. In the West Siberian region they will lose, in addition to these, the ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, machine building, timber, wood processing, and building materials industries. In the Volga region light and food industry will be forced out of existence. The table shows how this factor has caused a sharp decrease in the volume of aggregate product in these three regions. Because of the deep decrease in the level of integration in economic development in these three regions the coefficient of dependence of their economies on external links is rising sharply and will be equal to one, that is, they will become economic systems that are absolutely dependent on world economic links. This will mean a complete loss of their economic sovereignty because they will become resource appendages of the world market. At the same time, owing to the significant decrease in production volumes because of the elimination of whole groups of sectors in the West Siberian, Ural, and Volga regions, an equally significant rise in unemployment is inevitable--from 27 to roughly 60 percent of the total number of persons employed in material production there. This will inexorably lead to such an intensification of social tension in these regions that the slight economic advantage from realization of the strategy of regional free trade will be far outweighed by the social costs, above all the loss of social stability. The consequences of a transition to the strategy of free trade will be entirely different for the Northern, East Siberian, and Far Eastern regions. In the first two regions the decline in material production will not exceed two percent. The Far Eastern region is somewhat of an exception; the decline in production there will be at the level of 11 percent (mainly because of a decrease in production volume in the food industry, construction, and agriculture). By contemporary measures such a decline is not disastrous, so one need not fear a tangible increase in unemployment in these three regions as a result of their transition to the regional free trade strategy. Realization of this strategy also will not have a significant impact on the level of these regions' economic dependence on external links. For all three regions this coefficient will decrease slightly: from 0.69 to 0.66 for the Northern Region, from 0.71 to 0.61 for the Far Eastern Region, and from 0.74 to 0.72 for the East Siberian Region. At the same time realization of the strategy of regional free trade will make it possible, using the opportunities of the world market, to sharply improve supply of food and light industry products to the population of these three regions and supply of fuel, metal, chemicals, and machinery and equipment to their production sectors. The situation with consumer goods will be especially critical. The proportion of import in consumption of light industry products in the Far Eastern and Northern regions exceeds 65 percent. The proportion of import in consumption of food industry output in the East Siberian Region is roughly 37 percent. These regions significantly exceed all other Russian regions for these indicators; in other words, they are too dependent on deliveries of food and light industry products (mainly from the Russian Central Zone and South). But forecasts made by the INP RAN of the development of these sectors show that light industry production for Russia as a whole will decrease by one-half in 1995 compared to 1990, while food industry production will decrease by more than one-third. Under these conditions it is hard to talk about normal supply of essential products to inhabitants of the Northern Region, who mostly live in extreme natural conditions. It is even harder to solve the problem of supplying light and food industry output to inhabitants of the East Siberian and Far Eastern regions. The great remoteness of these regions, given liberalization of prices for energy media and the corresponding sharp increase in transportation charges, will inevitably create an economic barrier that hinders the economic links of the Far Eastern and East Siberian regions with the rest of Russia. Therefore one need have no doubt that realization by the Far Eastern, East Siberian, and Northern regions of an "open door" policy with the world community within the framework of the strategy of regional free trade will get the necessary support from a large majority of their populations. Social stability in these regions may be a promising guarantee that they will receive essential investment from the world market. This will make it possible to solve one more of the most critical problems of the Far Eastern, East Siberian, and Northern regions. Their sectorial specialization is oriented to the extraction and primary processing of natural resources under harsh natural-climatic conditions. Throughout the world this kind of production has extremely high capital-output ratio and capital investment intensity. According to INP RAN forecasts, however, by 1995 the volume of capital investment in the Russian economy may decrease by more than one-half compared to 1990. This will inevitably force the Far Eastern, East Siberian, and Northern regions, before anyone else, to start looking for the vitally necessary investment in the world market, and this investment will be offered only on condition of a transition to the strategy of regional free trade. The analysis permits us to conclude that the objective preconditions for economic sovereignty are minimal for five Russian regions in the Central Zone and South of European Russia--the Northwestern, Central, Volga-Vyatka, Central Chernozem, and North Caucasian regions. These regions have the greatest interest in preserving the integrity of the Russian economic space, because otherwise they are doomed to the strategy of regional autarky with its disastrous economic and social consequences. The Ural, West Siberian, and Volga regions, who receive some economic benefit from possible realization of the strategy of regional free trade, have the objective preconditions for economic, and therefore also political, sovereignty. But vigorous implementation of a policy of achieving sovereignty will have negative social consequences in these regions. These regions will therefore be characterized by a "smoldering sovereignty" that is ready to flare up in "bright flames" every time there is a general deterioration of the socioeconomic situation in the country, because against this background the costs of the policy of achieving sovereignty will not be so notable, while the economic benefit will be particularly tangible. Given preservation of the current situation in Russia, realization of the strategy of regional free trade, that is following a policy of economic sovereignty as a minimum, will, in our opinion, be the only possible way for the Northern, East Siberian, and especially the Far Eastern regions to survive. They have all the essential preconditions--economic, social, and geographic--to implement this strategy. This means that it will not be held up by political considerations. The Path to Concord and Unity How can the disintegration of Russia be avoided? In looking for a way out of the situation that has developed we should consider first the real, historically established characteristics of the Russian economy. The objective economic foundation of the equality of the different regions within Russia is interdependence and mutual complementarity in the framework of a unified reproduction process that is weakly linked with the world market. It presupposes equality of political and economic rights, conditions, and accountability of the different Russian regions within the framework of a single country. But the market to which the reforms being carried out in Russia is oriented never does anything but intensify the territorial differentiation of economic, and accordingly also political, space; in principle it cannot ensure political and economic "equality among subjects who are different." Therefore the political equality of subjects of the Federation which is proclaimed in the new Russian Constitution, not reinforced by economic equality among the regions, will in fact be illusory, and therefore federalism in Russia will be unstable and ineffective. To overcome the contradiction between good political intentions and objective economic reality we must forego the orthodox principles of market fundamentalism, base ourselves on an understanding of the actual characteristics of Russian economic space, and prevent the transformation of the profound, historically established differences among the Russian regions into insoluble political conflicts among the corresponding subjects of the Russian Federation. While creating the necessary conditions for democratization of the political and economic life of Russia its economic system must differ in that the state should play a fundamentally greater economic role. In the specific situation of contemporary Russian reality this can be realized under the conception of inter-regional institutionalism. It presumes that state regulation of Russia's economic space in the interests of all Russian society is not limited to just budget-finance and credit aspects, but actively employs the methods of planned regulation. It is used to implement equal strategic roles for economically different but politically equal, in decision-making under the Constitution, subjects of the Federation in shaping, jointly with federal organs of state power, a unified system of basic socioeconomic goals of agreed-upon development of Russia's unified economic space in the interests of all its regions and establishing national economic, intersectorial, and inter-regional proportions in the Russian economy appropriate to these goals. Within the framework of this federal strategy the state institutions of the subjects of the Federation must work jointly to perform the coordinating function of ensuring purposeful agreement on direct contract links between suppliers and consumers of output in the different regions. The appearance of independently cooperating subjects of the Federation who are managing collectively in the Russian economic space, and bear mutual accountability for the results of their economic activity, and their coordinated joint activity toward planned regulation of the Russian economy make it possible to ensure equal rights, equal conditions, and equal accountability to enterprises located in significantly different Russian regions. In this way federal-regional planned regulation in the interests of the entire society is a means of realizing the principle of "equality among equals" not only in relation to the regions, but also in relation to all Russian enterprises. With the functioning of such a system of economic activity the heterogeneity of the Russian economic space and the interdependence and mutual complementarity of its regions become crucial, objective preconditions for the integrity of Russia and create conditions for the political equality of the economically different subjects of the Federation. The country's political system, built on the foundation of such an economic system, will ensure a stable state arrangement for the new Russia and guarantee the unity of its economic space.
