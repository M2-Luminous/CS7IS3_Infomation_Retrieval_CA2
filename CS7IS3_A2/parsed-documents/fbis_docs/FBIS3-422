"The immediate source of pressure, of course, is the election, with its necessary deadlines." "However, the truly relentless pressures lie deeper, beyond the reach of mere politicians, and it has been these underlying pressures that came into play, especially in Bophuthatswana, this week." "The people who have all but brought down Mangope's regime are South Africa's hidden actors. They are million of ordinary black folk who destroyed apartheid, and in whose hands the destiny of South Africa lies.....they, and not President de Klerk and his reformers, ended apartheid." In conclusion the paper writes that "South Africa needs only political stability and reasonably sensible economic policies to burst out of the stagnation of the past three decades, and the elections are the first, necessary, step towards stability. At the same time, there is an vital role for men like Chief Buthelezi and General Viljoen to play in fashioning the final constitution, in curbing the lust for power which is evident in the ANC [African National Congress], and in ensuring representation for the widest range of views in Parliament. Welcome them to the fray." SUNDAY NATION IFP Registration for Election -- "Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's decision to `provisionally' register for the elections, should be treated with caution," begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 6 March in a page-6 editorial. "It should be remembered that before his meeting with ANC leader, Nelson Mandela, he shot down the whole idea of participating in the elections." Buthelezi's "vacillation" "simply deepens the opinion of political observers who have found Buthelezi to be a man who is simply interested in shifting goalposts to avoid the elections at all costs. Creating an uncertainty about the future has been one of the effective instruments in creating tension in the black townships. This has also planted fertile seeds of political violence and wanton criminal acts of lawlessness." "While the ANC's commitment to an all-inclusive settlement is commendable, Buthelezi should not be allowed to delay the long-awaited elections for his personal reasons." "ANC and the government should not bend over backwards for Buthelezi anymore. Now is the time to go forward with or without him." TEC Standstill Criticized -- In a second editorial on the same page, the SUNDAY NATION reports that "with less than two months to go before the April 27 election, the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] seems unable to perform its tasks adequately." "As things stand now, the TEC has been unable to reassure people in Bophuthatswana and kwaZulu-Natal about" whether or not they will be able to vote. Additionally, items brought before the TEC are "never finalised immediately after presentation. They are often referred to later sittings. Occasionally the TEC has had to wait until certain situations were out of control before taking a decision." Concluding the SUNDAY NATION writes that "the TEC really needs to jack up if we are to continue having confidence in it. We want to believe that there is no better structure to turn to during this transition. But the TEC should sharpen its teeth and take its rightful place in the hearts of our people." RAPPORT ANC Propaganda Machine Running Out of Steam -- A page-22 editorial in RAPPORT of 6 March in Afrikaans writes that in the Western Cape the ANC "is no longer so talkative, and in Natal this week it was dealt two stiff blows." President F. W. de Klerk's visit to this province and the type of reception accorded him should be something that not only Mr. Nelson Mandela "should sit up and take note of, but also the communist archenemy, Mr. Harry Gwala. Even those opinion polls that predict a runaway victory for the ANC have been more cautious lately. The premature ANC choruses of demands and those big promises also seem to have taken -- hopefully for good -- a back seat." Mr. de Klerk's campaigning had resounding successes among the Indian and colored populations in Natal where he made no attempt to glorify the National Party's past mistakes, but instead asked for forgiveness. "But," he asked, "has the ANC ever said sorry for its wrong deeds? Has it become a new party?" The second blow for the ANC was Mr. Mandela's meeting with Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The ANC propaganda machine had tried to make it appear as if it were the biggest gesture of reconciliation and a victory for Mr. Mandela. "With dubious success." It is no longer a question of what did Mr. Mandela say to Mr. Buthelezi to change his mind, but rather "what did Mr. Buthelezi say to Mr. Mandela to make him sing a different tune?" Mr. Mandela's grim face after the meeting told a story. "The shrewd Mr. Buthelezi had unmasked Mr. Mandela and the ANC's propaganda."
