Indeed, the Council approved conclusions by which it: -- recalls the conclusions of the Brussels Summit which admits the possibility of "fiscal measures which could, inter alia, relate to the environment" (to compensate for the drop in social contributions); -- recalls that the Ecofin Council of 13 December invited the ad hoc group to continue examining the project of a CO2/Energy tax; -- declares that, in this context and in the light of the Community's commitment to stabilize CO2 emissions in the terms agreed by the joint Energy/Environment Council of 29 October 1990, it is necessary to create the mix of additional various instruments at EC level and to conclude ongoing work taking account of the Commission's proposal on energy/CO2 taxation as soon as possible, and at the latest by the end of 1994; -- requests the Commission to take, as soon as possible, the necessary decisions on the methodologies to be used for the national reports in the framework of the Council Decision of 24 June 1993 establishing a monitoring mechanism in order to have a good basis for analyzing national efforts. At the same time, the Commission is requested to present an evaluation on the progress made towards reaching the Community's CO2 stabilization target; -- requests the Commission to report on the national instruments, in particular economic and fiscal instruments, which have been implemented or which will be implemented shortly by the Member States to attain the aim of stabilization; -- requests the Commission to prepare and submit to the next Council meeting a plan showing how the Community and its Member States will be able to attain the goal of stabilizing CO2 emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000; In this context, the Council agrees to adopt the decision relating to the Community's concluding the Convention on climate change, recognizing the importance of the Community (and its Member States) ratifying this Convention before it comes into force so as to the fulfilment of the commitment relating to the limitation of CO2 emissions through action by the Community and its Member States, within their respective competencies.
