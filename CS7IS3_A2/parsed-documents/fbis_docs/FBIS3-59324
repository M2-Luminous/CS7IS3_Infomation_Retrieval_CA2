There is an important prerequisite in establishing the socialist market economic system. That is to persistently uphold the predominant role of the socialist public ownership system. In his report delivered at the 14th National CPC Congress, Comrade Jiang Zemin explicitly pointed out: "The socialist market economy is a component part of the basic system of socialism. So far as the ownership structure is concerned, for a long time to come we should allow diverse sectors of the economy to develop side by side. The public sector, which includes enterprises owned by collectives, is to remain predominant, with the private sector, which includes individually owned and foreign-owned enterprises, as a supplement." Right now, naturally very few people would openly oppose the predominant role of the public ownership system. However, there are also people who adopt various forms to covertly or overtly express their different views on this issue. If we act in accordance with these views, we would either make the predominant role of the public ownership system totally vanish, or change it into something that only exists in name but not in essence. The so-called "theory of predominance" is one of these views. Those who advocate the "theory of predominance" have said: To let the public ownership system play the predominant role does not mean that the socialist public ownership system must play a predominant role in quantity and in production value in the national economy. The predominant role in terms of "quantity" is a "burden and encumbrance" which should be discarded and changed into a "predominant role of a guidance nature." What is a "predominant role of a guidance nature"? That is, it is only necessary to maintain the public ownership system in a limited number of "non-competitive basic industries." It share should be lowered to 10 to 20 percent. It should not exceed a maximum share of 30 percent. The large portion of the remaining industries must be left to the non-public economical sector. It is said that by managing this limited number of "non-competitive industries" well, it would be able to "guide" the whole national economy to forge ahead. "Although it is small in size, it functions efficiently." Therefore, it is called the "theory of predominance." Can we agree with this kind of view? Any thing or event, either a natural phenomenon or a social phenomenon, must have a definite quantity to be its carrier. Without a definite quantity, there will be no definite quality. To have a definite quality, we must have definite quantity. Quantitative changes of a thing have their limits. If quantitative changes exceed their limits, the quality of the thing or event will change. This thing will become something else. Let us take water as an example. It is a transparent liquid composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Under standard atmospheric pressure, water will become ice when its temperature reaches zero degree Centigrade. It will start to boil and become steam, when its temperature reaches 100 degrees Centigrade. That is to say that quantity and quality are conditional and interchangeable. Both quantity and quality have their own limits. "When quality reaches its limits, it becomes quantity." "Pure quantitative changes may also become qualitative changes." Social phenomenon is of no exception. In a capitalist society, there not only exists the capitalist ownership system, there also exists the individual ownership system, the capitalist cooperative system and so on. However, the main basic means of production is in the hands of the bourgeoisie. A large number of labor forces are commodities, and the capitalist relations of production become the "light which illuminates everywhere." This society is exactly the capitalist society. To replace the capitalist system with the socialist system, the most important sign is that the proletariat must seize the political power and that workers hold the capitalists' means of production in their own hands, and establish the system of ownership of means of production. One of the basic special features of socialism with Chinese characteristics is to make the public ownership system of means of production the predominant and the other economic sectors a supplement. Without the predominant role of the public ownership system of means of production, there will be no socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is simple and sound reasoning. Naturally, in the course of building socialism, it is difficult to define the share of the public ownership system and the share of the non-public ownership system in the different stages of development of the productive forces. However, as far as the whole country is concerned, if the share of the public ownership system drops to the extent that it no longer plays the predominant role, is not strong enough to restrain or decide the development of the whole national economy, and its status as the economic foundation of the socialist system is shaken, while the share of the non-public ownership system rises to the extent that it may greatly affect or even overpower the public ownership system, can it still be said that the predominant role of the public ownership system is being maintained? No matter what kind of high-sounding names such as "guidance nature" or "qualitative type" are bestowed upon the public ownership system, the answer is self-evident. It also makes people feel doubtful if it is said that the public economic sector will be able to play a "guidance" role if it is limited to control a small number of "non-competitive basic industries." People realize that according to labor sequence and degree of processing, industries can be divided into infrastructural facilities, basic industries and the processing industry. Once again the processing industry can be divided into rough (primary) finishing and precision (fine) finishing. Infrastructural facilities and basic industries are important industrial sectors which play a basic role in the development of the national economy. Without the development of infrastructural facilities and basic industries, the development of the processing industry and the entire national economy is out of question. Particularly the energy industry, the raw and semi-finished product industry and the communications and transportation industries are bottlenecking economic development. It was precisely for this reason that as soon as we had the political power in our hands, we confiscated the basic industries with the capital of imperialists and Kuomintang bureaucrat-capitalists, and turned them into state properties. During the 40 some years after the building of New China, we have once again amassed a large amount of manpower and material and financial resources, and invested hundreds of billions of yuan to build and develop, batches after batches, infrastructural facilities, basic industries and major engineering projects which have laid a solid material foundation for socialist construction and played a significant role in the development of the national economy. However, as seen from the entire national economy, infrastructural facilities and basic industries only provide a part of the material foundation. It is impossible to develop the national economy without a decent processing industry in high technology even if there are infrastructural facilities and basic industries, because these facilities and industries are unable to provide the finished products. People can neither eat nor wear them. Separating basic industries from the processing industry is just like developing the processing industry without basic industries. The national economy will become a deformed lame duck. In addition, the development of today's productive forces and science and technology are, to a great extent, manifested in the processing industry. We cannot develop basic industries if our technology in the processing industry is backward. It is necessary to bring into full play the predominant role of the public ownership system not only in the development of infrastructural facilities and basic industries, but also in the development of the major processing industry. Let us ask this question: Would it work if we let the public economic sector withdraw from all key departments in machine building industry, electronics industry, astronautics industry, chemical industry and other industries of high technology and let the non-public economic sector fill in its vacancies? It would not work even in the light and textile industries, let alone the major industries mentioned before. The development of light and textile industries directly affects people's livelihood and the state accumulation. Right now the overwhelming majority of state-run large and medium-sized enterprises which account for a large portion of China's light and textile industries are running well. Their varieties of designs, colors, quality and even management are better than the small enterprises of the non-public economic sector. In this connection, the state-owned enterprises are playing an exemplary and guiding role. The original management system of state-owned enterprises are full of problems. It must be reformed; its technology upgraded, and its structure readjusted. Other economic sectors must also be allowed and encouraged to develop themselves. However, is there any good reason why we should bring about economic changes and replace the public economic sector with the non-public economic sector? Right now, basic industries account for approximately 28 percent of China's total industrial output value, while the processing industry about 39 percent. If we change the public economic sector which account for 39 percent of the output value into non-public economic sector and if the public economic sector is only allowed to develop "non-competitive" basic industries in accordance with the views of those who advocate the "theory of predominance," what portion will be left over for the public economic sector to develop? (What does it mean by "non-competitive" anyway? Under the conditions of the market economy, what sector of the economy is "non-competitive"?) Important special features of infrastructural facilities and basic industries are large investments, long construction cycle, slow investment returns, high labor intensity for workers, and small profits. These features are more conspicuous in "non-competitive" basic industries. However, things are reversed in the processing industry. Right now, many departments in China's basic industries have yielded low economic results. Several trades suffered losses continuously for many years. Perhaps such losses can be attributed to the special features mentioned before. Another reason for the losses is the excessively low price which is even below the production cost. The public ownership system cannot be blamed for the low price. It is not caused by poor enterprise management. It is mainly because of an unreasonable pricing structure. An enterprise has no authority to fix the price. When the price is being determined, it is necessary to take into consideration the needs of the macro-economic control and the abilities of all sectors to take the burden. In other words, these lines of business offer lower prices and suffer losses, because they often take the overall national economy into consideration, sacrifice their own interests, shift a part of "economic results" to the private enterprises, "Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative and solely foreign-funded enterprises" and individually owned enterprises which use infrastructural facilities and the products of basic industries when they sell their products at lower prices or even profit-free to the processing industry or other departments. This kind of situation reflects the role of state-run enterprises and the macro-economic control. However, can we go on like this forever? What would be the result if we continue acting in such a way? Why should we let the public economic sector engage in trades that make small or almost no profit or even suffer losses, while allowing the non-public economic sector handle those trades which are able to sell their products at higher prices, and reap larger profits with little investments and a quicker turnover rate of capital funds? What kind of role would the socialist public ownership system play? Is there a need for us to let the state-run enterprises forever take the blame of "operating with low economic efficiency" while covertly shifting their large amount of profits to others?
