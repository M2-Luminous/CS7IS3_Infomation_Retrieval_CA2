The draft rolls with respect to these people are to be published and their names included in the final voters list after claims and objections, if any, are disposed of in accordance with law. Legal experts said today's suo moto order by a division bench comprising Chief Justice R.K. Manisena Singh and Justice Neera Sharma clarifies the operative portions of the court's earlier ruling. On Friday, the court held Clause 7.4 of the Election Commission's special revised instructions issued on May last year, unconstitutional and violative of the Representation of People Act (1950). The controversial commission clause prohibited the inclusion of names of all encroachers on village grazing reserves (VGR), professional grazing reserves (PGR), forest land, khas land or any other government land, in the electoral rolls. Later the commission modified the directive under pressure from various quarters, including the state government. It said the instructions would not apply to those Indian citizens whom the Assam government does not intend to evict from the lands under their encroachment until the end of 1993. Today's court directive has given a new turn to the rolls revision process in Assam. The final voters list in 86 of the state's 126 Assembly constituencies have already been published last month. A special revision of rolls was ordered in the 40 remaining constituencies, perhaps due to a suspicion that they still contained names of illegal aliens. Subsequently, the election commission ordered an up-date on the rolls in all the 126 constituencies in the state, with January 1, 1994, as the qualifying date. The commission has finally set May 17, 1994, as the deadline for completing the entire rolls revision process in Assam that began with its directive for a special intensive revision on August 21, 1992. However, the task is far from over. The commission will now have to prepare draft rolls for the encroachers on government land who are otherwise eligible to vote. This process has to be carried out in each of the 126 constituencies, including the 86 where the final voters list have already been published. The names of such persons in the draft roll can be included in the final loss only after claims and objections are disposed of. Minority leaders have welcomed the court order to include names of encroachers in the draft rolls and their subsequent publication. They feel this will help those 1000s of other people whose names are in List II of the draft rolls and whose citizenship, they claim, is unnecessarily doubted. Many of them could not put up claims for including their names in the voters list since they lack the documents stipulated by the election commission. Many of the encroachers also do not possess proper documents to prove their relationship.
