FBIS3-36042 "drsov022_d_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-022 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Feb 1994 Regional Affairs Ossetian, Ingush Leaders on Aspects of Conflict LD0102184994 LD0102184994 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First Channel Network in Russian at 1521 GMT on 1 February carries a "Path to Accord" program, which examines the continuing problem of ensuring the return of people displaced by the conflict between North Ossetia and Ingushetia. In the first 11 minutes of the program, the announcer interviews ordinary people on both sides of the conflict, some of them refugees. The program then shows alternating excerpts of separate interviews with North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov and President of Ingushetia Ruslan Aushev. In his interview, Galazov denies that any interethnic conflict has occurred in North Ossetia, saying that what happened was "an aggression by Ingush national extremists." Aushev says on this topic: "The motives behind this conflict were to push out the Ingush, carry out ethnic cleansing, then to declare that coexistence was impossible, and then to play at these lengthy negotiations." Galazov says: "North Ossetia is, essentially, the only republic, not just in the North Caucasus but in the Caucasus as a whole, to which so-called Russian-speaking people flee. Today we have approximately 50,000 refugees. These are refugees from Georgia, from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Abkhazia, Chechnya, and Ingushetia, and this fact alone probably says much." Aushev says that but for the housing problem the influx of Russian-speaking refugees into his republic would be more intensive. He claims that Ingushetia has done more for its ethnic minorities than Ossetia, for instance by guaranteeing them a set number of seats in parliament. Asked if he regards the tens of thousands of Ingush refugees who fled from North Ossetia to Ingushetia as citizens of his republic, Galazov disputes the numbers and questions whether all of them were refugees, adding: "I believe that the Kislovodsk agreement is a very reasonable agreement and it should be implemented in full. There must be an investigation into who was not involved in the bloody tragedy which was committed on the territory of North Ossetia. After all, no one even fired from a toy catapult on the territory of the Ingush Republic. The tragedy occurred on the territory of North Ossetia and the North Ossetian side, that is the leadership and public organizations and movements can bear no responsibility whatsoever for what occurred." On the question of whether the two peoples could live together, Aushev says: "Whoever does not wish to live with the Ingush is free to leave. All the more so, since they have been living in other people's houses since 1944. According to highland customs, they should really have long since asked forgiveness of the Ingush for moving into their homes and should have left, as was done in Georgia, Dagestan, and Stavropol Kray." Asked about the idea of joint ownership of the disputed territory, Galazov says that he finds such attempts to resolve the problem at a stroke "unacceptable," and adds: "In actual fact there is no disputed territory in North Ossetia. Prigorodnyy Rayon, like all the other rayons of North Ossetia, is an integral part of the Republic of North Ossetia. And according to the constitution of the Russian Federation and our constitution, the whole territory of North Ossetia is at the disposal of the multinational people of that republic alone. Neither the president nor the Supreme Soviet [as heard] has the right to do anything with this territory. And I would ask both the leadership of the Russian Federation, and moreover the leadership of the Ingush Republic, to stop conducting experiments." Aushev says that his attitude to people's ideas is positive "as long as they produce results" and adds: "I believe that at this stage we should not be talking about new formulae. The first stage should be a stage of people returning to their homes and a stabilization of the situation to the level of October 1992." Galazov says: "The impossibility of the coexistence of Ingush, Ossetians, and representatives of other nationalities is not an Ossetian nor a Russian invention. This is something which people of Ingush nationality have proved in practice." On this same subject, Aushev says: "This is a fascist slogan. How can one speak of the impossibility of one living with another?" In conclusion, Galazov says: "All conflicts on this planet will sooner or later be resolved peacefully. There is no other way. But I believe that events should not be hastened because any use of force, any attempt to settle the problem immediately will result in more tragedy, will result in more bloodshed and human victims." Aushev concludes: "In order to emerge from this conflict we need to live strictly according to the law and to the constitution and to observe human rights." Vladimir Lozovoy, head of the Interim Administration on the territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, rounds up the program by saying that the only way to settle the conflict and reconcile people is by political methods. He adds: "I believe the main thing today is for the leaders of these two republics to sit down at the negotiating table and work out there what each side should do, not only to extinguish but also to settle the conflict and to begin returning people to their previous homes."
