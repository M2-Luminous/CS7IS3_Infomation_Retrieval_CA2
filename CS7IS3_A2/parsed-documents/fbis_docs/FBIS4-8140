This action of the ruling party is openly backed by Minister of National Defense Gheorghe Tinca and tacitly supported by the head of the general chief of staff, Lieutenant General Dumitru Cioflina. During the recent electoral tour of Adrian Nastase, also nicknamed "Sweety" [Bombonel], he tried to make the army division heads and even the army commanders join the PDSR. Specific similar cases were reported in Buzau and Craiova. After a strong rapprochement with the East, Gheorghe Tinca accepts the excessive politicization of the army personally attending to the PDSR's electoral actions, along with the head of the chief of General Staff. After the elimination of [former Defense Minister] Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, the chiefs of the National Defense Ministry departments were actually expecting a concentrated counteroffensive from the PDSR. Currently that counteroffensive is stronger than ever, and the "mastermind" behind this politicization campaign being none other than Adrian Nastase, also nicknamed "Sweety."
