With a gross light industry output worth 12.5 billion yuan last year, Anhui now has an industrial set-up, mainly in domestic electrical appliances, chemicals for daily use, and the wine-making industry. Of the 49 key products listed by the China National Light Industry Council, Anhui's output of 29 products ranks among the top ten in the country, with the number of refrigerators coming the second. A provincial official attributed the good results to the reform and opening further to the outside world. Since China began its reform in the late 1970s, Anhui has focused on importing and absorbing advanced foreign technology and equipment. It spent four billion yuan on technically upgrading 80 percent of its light industry enterprises during the 1978-93 period. As a result, the provincial light industrial set-up has developed an annual output of 2,500 new varieties of products in recent years.
