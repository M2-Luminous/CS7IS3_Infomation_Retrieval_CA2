He pointed out that the Armed Forces and the People's Defense Forces were capable of protecting the homeland and deterring those who intended to cause it harm. He said this yesterday when addressing a big rally at Port Sudan, Eastern State, on the occasion marking the promotion of 5,000 recruits of the People's Defense Force. He affirmed that the revolution from the outset had declared that it would surrender power to the people. It had now undertaken to redivide the states, following acceptance by the states' salvation committees, representatives of the governorates and local councils in a conference recently held in Khartoum on the basis of a new vision. Al-Bashir saluted the people of the Red Sea area for their bold stand and unity.
