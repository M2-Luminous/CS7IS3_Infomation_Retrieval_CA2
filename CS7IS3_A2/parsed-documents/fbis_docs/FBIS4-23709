According to newspaper reports, her hotel bill came to more than 12,000 rands. Mrs. Mandela said that by asking the state to give a ruling on who should pay the account, Education Director Bernard Louw was trying to undermine her position and embarrass her. Mrs. Mandela said the newspaper reports were incorrect, but did not elaborate other than to say that she had been accompanied by four bodyguards, and not eight.
