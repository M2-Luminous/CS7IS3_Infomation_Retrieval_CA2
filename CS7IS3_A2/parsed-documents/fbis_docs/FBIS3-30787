This is a man who came to the position of deputy prime minister from the post of special advisor to Slobodan Milosevic. According to Belgrade assessments, Simic was one of the main strategists for all of Milosevic's moves; he is a man who Milosevic trusts very much, and who is expected to soon become chief of Yugoslav diplomacy. He is a sociologist, educated in England and France. [Nedeljkov] What are your expectations of the trip to Zagreb? [Simic] I believe in tolerant talks and equal negotiations, and I believe that it is possible to resolve many disputed and difficult political issues through talks, so I see no good reason for the Croat-Serb issues not to be resolved on these methodological principles! I am going to Zagreb with a certain amount of realist optimism, because I think that we and the highest Croatian officials have found a good political method for resolving all the disputed issues. The mere fact that I will come to Zagreb on 12 February, and that I am coming without any prejudices, shows that tolerance is a dominant trait of Yugoslav politics. [Nedeljkov] You therefore believe in the normalization of relations? [Simic] I have no illusions about one trip to Zagreb, or one declaration, being able to solve all the issues that are now a stumbling block in relations between Zagreb and Belgrade. My wish is to show by this visit, which I hope will not only be governed by protocol, that there is a willingness in my country to normalize relations, that a realistic and rational politics is being conducted in the FRY, and that its aim is to solve all the problems in a primarily peaceful way and on equal bases. I believe that both we in Belgrade and the most prominent political figures in Zagreb are aware of the existence of great problems, and of the fact that they cannot be solved during one visit, but this visit, as well as all the visits that will follow, can mark the start of solving the problems that are at present in the way of a general normalization of relations between Croatia and the FRY. [Nedeljkov] What precisely do you expect will happen in Zagreb? [Simic] I hope that there is good will on both sides, and during the talks that I have had with the Croatian officials so far I received the impression that there is. Moreover, although this may sound immodest, all the participants in the recent efforts to establish more stable relations between Zagreb and Belgrade were given a kind of international acknowledgment, primarily that of the International Red Cross, and Mr. K. Somaruga saw in our agreement a symbolic, but also pragmatic act that, in the foreseeable future, could yield mutually beneficial political results. We have simply turned to the specific, existential issues. It is more than evident that solving these vital problems can have a favorable effect on solving those that are eminently in the political sphere. Solving extremely ambitious political issues can sometimes slow down the normalization of total relations, although I do not deny the possibility of achieving such a situation in the near future. To summarize, I would say that this "political inversion," so to speak, could be extremely fruitful for both sides and for improvedr future relations. [Nedeljkov] Could you be more specific about those "vital issues" from which the start would be made? [Simic] For instance, it would include the resolving of the issue of missing persons, and all issues regarding the area of human rights. Once these issues are resolved, then favorable preconditions will be created for resolving the bigger political issues, which everyone is familiar with. [Nedeljkov] Does the deputy prime minister of the Federal Government know if there are Croatian prisoners in the FRY? [Simic] I can claim that, to my knowledge, and according to the knowledge of all the members of the Federal Government, there is not a single Croatian citizen in any of the prisons on the territory of Yugoslavia. However, I allow that some people may be imprisoned on some other basis, perhaps, and if there are such cases, we will investigate them and give the Croatian authorities the real information. All our prisons are open to international institutions, and if there are any indications, anyone from Croatia can also visit those prisons, because there are no camps or anything of the kind in Yugoslavia. Therefore, anyone can come and see for themselves that what I have said is true. [Nedeljkov] What follows after solving these cases? [Simic] All the efforts in the normalization of relations between the Republic of Croatia and the FRY are aimed at avoiding any possibilities and thoughts, let alone a specific act, that would lead to war. I believe that the aim is mutual: establishing permanent peace on the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia, while any other solution would be unacceptable both for Croatia and Yugoslavia. [Nedeljkov] The opposition in Croatia and that in Serbia do not accept the present agreements on the normalization of relations. [Simic] I believe that this criticism is exclusively connected to internal political effects, and this is how it should be viewed, because the arguments used to dispute our efforts make no political sense. If what we are doing and what we are resorting to is so fiercely criticized, the alternative is aggravating relations and departing from peace. What could be the alternative to peace if not war?! [Nedeljkov] How do you see Knin in this context? [Simic] There is a corps of issues, of vital as well as political importance, that can be solved directly between Zagreb and Belgrade. In my opinion, we can thus pave the way for a further normalization of relations, and then, naturally, toward the resolving of the most difficult political and other issues. However, it is certainly not possible to solve the most vital problems without considering all the disputable issues between the Serb Krajina and Croatia. The political reality is that these disputable issues can only be resolved by the legitimate representatives of the Serb people in the Krajina and the legitimate Croatian representatives. [Nedeljkov] Is this possible if Milan Martic [president of the republic of Serb Krajina] states in VECERNJE NOVOSTI that, in the course of this year, all the Serb lands will unite (including the Knin Krajina), and that he will then immediately hand over his "presidential staff" to Milosevic, who will be the president of all Serbs, and the capital will be Belgrade? [Simic] There are many individual statements that, taken out of the context, can serve as an alibi for giving up the peace efforts. For instance, we could view, rather suspiciously, the statement of Mr. G. Susak, the defense minister of Croatia, who recently spoke about the relations between Zagreb and Belgrade in a rather militant tone. He was speaking an intolerant language that anticipated war rather than peace. [Nedeljkov] Let us go back to Mr. Martic's statement. [Simic] I can not speak on behalf of the legitimate representatives of the Serb Krajina, nor do I wish to interpret their statements, because it is quite natural to ask them about something like this. I think that the task of all the prudent political forces that bear a certain political weight both in the FRY and in Croatia is to find the solution for the establishment of democratic forms of political communication, and not for the encouragement of the forms that will make the relations between the Serb and Croat peoples, which are strained as it is, even more difficult. In short, no general conclusions should be made on the basis of the statements of any individual political figure, but the problems should instead be viewed as a whole. Fear and mistrust should be thrown out of these strained Croat-Serb relations, which were, until recently, dominated by intolerance, and it should be displayed, through specific acts, that it is possible to have no conflicts in the relations between the two peoples and that such relations are both possible and desirable. [Nedeljkov] What is happening with the opening of the Croatian Office in Belgrade? [Simic] We have completed all the details, the location has been determined, there are no technical obstacles, and I think that 15 February is a realistic date for the beginning of the activities of the offices both in Belgrade and in Zagreb. Naturally, if it is postponed for a day or two it will mean nothing significant in the political sense. [Nedeljkov] There is much talk about the Serbs, but almost no one mentions the Serbs in Zagreb, Rijeka, Split, Pula.... [Simic] We did not talk about that specifically. However, if I go to Zagreb, and I see no reason not to go, I will try to get the answer to that question too. However, all this must be done in a tolerant tone, and the political forces that support a peaceful solution to the Serb-Croat problems should be encouraged, both here and there. There are such forces here, and I believe they also exist in Croatia. [Nedeljkov] Do the "AVNOJ" [Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders stand any chance? [Simic] In my opinion, these borders need not be a stumbling block, but a subject of negotiations instead. They are extremely ambivalent when it comes to reality. We have come to realize that if we talk about the right to self-determination, it is the people who create these borders by their own will, and not some political power-wielders. However, I believe that this issue is so delicate that it should be left for later negotiations and talks, and now everything should be done to establish relations between Croatia and Yugoslavia on the basis of mutual trust, and to mark them with maximum tolerance on both sides. It would perhaps be fatal if we were to raise these issues, which are the most delicate, first. However, if we start from smaller, but vital ones, and if both sides realize that there is mutual good will, these most delicate issues could soon be on the agenda too. [Nedeljkov] Will this year be the crucial one in Croat-Serb relations? [Simic] Yes, though it could perhaps sooner be said to be a turning point, but only in the sense that real negotiations and agreements should start. It would be illusory to expect the issues that partly concern the past to be solved overnight. The most important thing is that the opinions and forces see a way to solve relations between the two countries only through negotiations prevail on both sides. [Nedeljkov] Are you saying that you are going to Zagreb with a peace offer? [Simic] Yes, that is the way to say it. We are prepared for dialogue, and we see tolerant communication as the only possible way to resolve the problem. I speak on behalf of those political forces in Serbia and the FRY that are dominant. The wounds are heavy on both sides, and I am not saying it is easy to forget everything, but we have to start going the peaceful way. [Nedeljkov] Were the problems of the Croats in Vojvodina mentioned in the talks with the Croatian delegation? [Simic] Not at all, but that does not mean there will be no discussion of that.
