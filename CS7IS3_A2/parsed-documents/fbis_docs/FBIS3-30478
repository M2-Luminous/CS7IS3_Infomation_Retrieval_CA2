Solana ended his visit to former Yugoslavia this afternoon. Our special correspondent Pedro Fernandez Cespedes reports. [Cespedes] Good evening. Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic met Minister Solana and denied the direct intervention of regular Croatian troops in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Spanish foreign minister was forceful and clear when it came to asking the question in Zagreb at midday today. Valentic gave an assurance that it is not the case and Javier Solana spoke about a different report. [Begin Solana recording] Whatever the case may be, the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces, the UNPROFOR commanders, say that Croatian troops have indeed been seen on the ground. [end recording] [Cespedes] A negotiated solution to the problem of Srebrenica without the need for air strikes is on the way, and hopes of a similar -- though more distant -- outcome for the opening of Tuzla Airport have not been ruled out. These are the two most important pieces of information obtained by Minister Solana following his talks with the UN secretary general's representative for the military conflict in the former Yugoslavia, with whom he agrees that the threats of air strikes are bearing fruit.
