Minister Samahah said: [Begin recording] [Samahah] First of all, I would like to say that I do not like posturing. While the meeting with the officials in charge of media organs was under way, I had hoped that the source of this report would reveal its identity and say what it had to say at the meeting and not outside it. The meeting was held in a normal manner at the request of some representatives of media organs. The atmopshere was very calm, very responsible, and nothing of what one local paper has reported took place. The presence of his excellency the director of the Public Security Department was natural because in the Press and Publications Law, which is currently in force in Lebanon, the prerogatives of the Public Security Department concerning political censorship are very clear. I wanted his excellency the director general to attend this meeting with the media officials to prevent any future clamor on the contents of the cabinet's decision. The meeting was normal, and the media officials who attended showed a sense of responsibility. I thank them for their cooperation during and after the meeting. [Kustantin] Your Excellency, it has been said that some questions were raised about broadcasting Friday sermons and Sunday sermons, and that some Friday sermons have disturbed you? [Samahah] There was no anxiety. There was only complete understanding. The banning of broadcasting Friday sermons or those delivered during Sunday masses has not been discussed at all. What is usually said in these sermons deals with religious topics and has nothing to do with politics. Therefore, there is absolutely no need for interpretation on this topic. [Kustantin] Your Excellency, two points still need to be clarified. The first deals with one of the radio stations which you were reportedly asked to ban because it transmits from outside Lebanon. Is this true? [Samahah] There is some ambiguity concerning a specific radio station which transmits from outside Lebanon, and has... [Kustantin, interrupting] An intermediary office, station in Lebanon? [Samahah] An intermediary station in Lebanon. This issue is being tackled, and I do not want to discuss it now. We want to tackle all issues in a calm manner. [Kustantin] Your Excellency, one last point. It has been mentioned that the owners of the media organs have asked you to submit a list of what is prohibited and what is allowed and you promised to present it at the next meeting, on Wednesday? [Samahah] I reached an understanding with them. I do not believe that among us, we need to set lists and limits which can be harsh. We agreed on a group of things which have a direct bearing on the implementation of the cabinet's decision. They abide by this and implement them in a responsible manner. We agreed to hold periodic meetings to discuss in detail everything to do with the implementation of the decision and the law on visual and audio media. [Kustantin] Your Excellency, thank you.
