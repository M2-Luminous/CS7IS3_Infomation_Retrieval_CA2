Speaking at the council's meeting, the president stressed that this program did not contradict the Declaration on Independence and Sovereignty of Moldova and the results of the sociological poll on the sovereignty of Moldova. "These documents provide for cooperation between all countries of the world in many ways," he emphasized. Snegur also pointed out that the intention of Moldova to neutrality must not isolate it before possible political or other cataclysms. According to him, the signing of the NATO program did not mean that Moldova would immediately reorientate itself to the West. "Our economic and political priorities will remain the same -- enlargement of mutually beneficial relations with all countries of the world, including the CIS republics," the president reassured.
