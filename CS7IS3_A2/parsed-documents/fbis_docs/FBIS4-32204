The government in Bucarest was the first to grasp -- and to do so with great eagerness -- NATO's offer of Partnership for Peace. Openly and pragmatically the Romanians realize that it will take time before both NATO and the EU [European Union] open their doors for full membership for former Warsaw Pact countries. But when this finally happens, these countries must join as a group. "Nondiscrimination is a clear precondition," Foreign Ministry Under Secretary of State Ion Gorita told AFTENPOSTEN. "Partnership expressly lays this down and opens up a host of possibilities, from Bucarest's viewpoint. Integration in Atlantic cooperation has absolute priority in Romanian foreign policy." For good or ill Romania sees itself as a Balkan country. Ideally an "island of stability" in the most troubled region in Europe, a diplomatic intermediary with open channels to all the republics in the former Yugoslavia. But in strategic terms a country without allies, wedged between areas of explosive conflict in the Balkans and in the former Soviet empire. The conflict surrounding the lifting of the arms embargo against the sides in the Yugoslavia conflict is causing cold shivers in Bucarest. People are convinced that more arms and military intervention from the East or West would lead inevitably to the spread of the war. The rest of the world must continue to apply political pressure, but today no one other than the partners themselves can resolve the conflict, in the view of the Romanians. The Romanians' traditional friendship with Serbia gave rise to some skepticism in Western circles, but the government says that it is endeavoring to loyally observe the international blockade. Even thought this means enormous losses for a country which was already poor. Romania is a large nation with 23 million inhabitants. A unified state, the government points out, despite all the unrest surrounding the Hungarian minority which is calling for autonomy. The most repressed and backward of the countries of Eastern Europe also emerged from 1989, the year of revolution, with the greatest number of problems. Despite all the economic and democratic shortcomings today's leaders refuse to accept a place last in line for Europe. "Romania has strongly opposed the more rapid integration into NATO of certain states. Hungary before Romania is therefore out of the question," Defense Ministry Under Secretary of State Ioan-Mircea Pascu said. "This would not solve any of the problems, but rather reinforce the divisions in Europe," he warned. Well aware that the four richer Visegrad states -- Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and in part Slovakia -- consider themselves to be in a group of their own on the doorstep of both NATO and the EU, the leaders in Romania reel off counterarguments. Relations with Hungary are and will remain the stumbling block, even though there is a confidence that socialist leader Gyula Horn will bring more pragmatism into foreign policy. "The outgoing government were historians almost to a man. Could you expect anything other than history to become the driving force in politics?" Pascu asked. Now he sees a chance of directing the gaze toward the future instead. "But until we achieve an agreement between the two countries as a guarantee of stable and normal good-neighborly relations, it is unthinkable that Hungary should be integrated before Romania. We are not asking for special friendly relations, only ordinary civilized relations," the under secretary said. These are strong, but significant words about the situation today. Ion Gorita of the Foreign Ministry gave the direct warning: "A NATO frontier between Hungary and Romania would be a new Iron Curtain -- a frontier that would offer a new conflict situation." Nor do the Romanians see any reason why Russia should be given special status, even though the country is one of the most sensitive security problems in Europe at present. But the Romanians have to ask themselves the key question: When will Romania become "mature" enough for admission to the European Union and to security structures? Certain economic and democratic minimum standards must be met. "From the democratic viewpoint we are already mature enough," Gorita claimed. "All the institutions are in place, and we have been found worthy of admission to the Council of Europe in line with similar standards." Many officials I spoke to in Bucarest admit that President Ion Iliescu was a problem in relations with foreign countries in the initial phase. He was a figure symbolic of the "stillborn revolution," a communist who refused to reform the old structures. Today this "psychological barrier" has been removed, Gorita claimed. And this week Czech President Vaclav Havel is coming to pay an official visit -- a figure symbolic of democracy in Europe. Economically a good deal remains before Romania comes up to the EU's standards, but the under secretary of state sent back the challenge to Brussels: "You must help us with investment and capital; alone Romania has scarcely a chance."
