This meeting will decide the fate of quite a few people and of several nations and even whole countries. Therefore, next week's meeting in Moscow will be on a par with the Yalta and, more recently, the Malta meetings. The Iron Curtain came up at Yalta, through Stalinist-type methods that did not bother about or waste time with niceties. At Malta, Mikhail Gorbachev's reasoning (with its Brezhnev-type limitations) -- faced with the economic disaster of the entire Eastern bloc but also with President George Bush's adroitness -- had to make important concessions to the free world. There, the Russians lost their former empire, but secretly hoped that that crash will be short-term. At the forthcoming meeting in Moscow, we will see if that failure is going to be sealed or whether the Russian forces are going to turn against the United States and the West asking for their rights. What has happened since Malta? In the past four years, the repressive communist-centralist system has collapsed noisily, amidst the cheers of the crowds. But quite paradoxically, and parallel to this visible downfall, the old structures were restored more or less enigmatically from one case to another and from one country to the other, in a function of the specific conditions of development or backwardness prevailing in the respective state -- to use the well-known phrase. The former German Democratic Republic was the first to escape and was swallowed by the strong machinery of West Germany. Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia brusquely remembered that they do not belong to Eastern Europe, but rather to Central Europe; consequently they felt that they must strictly distance themselves from their former Council for Mutual Economic Assistance [CEMA] and Warsaw Pact partners. Thus, the "Trilateral" came into being, out of conceit and the desire to forestall would-be future surprises. These surprises began to appear from the moment when a country like Romania, where the anticommunist revolution had been the most radical and violent and whose interwar record has been obviously hostile to the left, went astray as early as 1990 both internally and externally. Internally, by convincing the foreign countries -- something which not even our most hated enemies would have managed to do so well -- that the communists are still in power. Externally, by signing the shameful treaty with Moscow, which basically sanctioned our previous relationship with our master beyond the Dniester. The comeback we have made of late, particularly in 1993 (the Council of Europe and so forth), has come rather late and has only had a formal significance -- it was just dust in the people's eyes, only that our dignitaries are wearing protective glasses. The true integration is not ensured by our national flag being hoisted in Strasbourg, but rather by our admittance to the Euro-Atlantic security bodies, which everybody craves for, but few will achieve. That is why the U.S. President's visit to Europe, correlated to the NATO meeting, acquires an overwhelming importance. Will we be sold out for the third time? The theory of the Iron Curtain has been ever-more successfully replaced by the theory of the sanitary cordon in the propaganda campaigns of the international media. Faced with scores of millions of hungry hordes from Russia, the West has been obliged to take defensive measures. For this, it must knowingly sacrifice a group of countries, which will thus become a buffer between it and the convulsions of the Russian colossus. These countries will definitely not be the "award" countries of the Visegrad treaty, with whose representatives Clinton will also meet in Prague. Neither will they be the Baltic countries, which, in the opinion of historians, represent a jewel of Catholic civilization in the north eastern part of the continent. These countries will be the pitiable Ukraine, Romania (Moldova), and Bulgaria. Maybe the Red Army's triumphant march of 1944-45 up to the gates of Berlin cannot be undone in only 50 years, but rather in 100 years! What is our only chance? That Bill Clinton's saxophone mind will clear up and realize that a strategic zone for NATO is not so much Central Europe as the Balkans, where the much desired stability cannot be ensured by Greece alone. The much flaunted theory that Romania is a bridgehead in this convulsed region must be implemented. Otherwise, by selling us out for a third time, the West will sell itself out.
