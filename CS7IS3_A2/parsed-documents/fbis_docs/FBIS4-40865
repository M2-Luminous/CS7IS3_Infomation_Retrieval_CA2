[Khetsuriani] Batoni Iveri, what does the Reformers Union represent and what are its aims? [Prangishvili] First and foremost, the Reformers Union is not a political party but an organization whose aim is to conduct reforms in a correct manner in the Georgian economy. To all intents and purposes, we do not have an economy today; at the moment, we can only dream of producing goods. In order to restore the economy, it is necessary, first and foremost, to restore the old ties with the republics of the former Soviet Union that have been ruptured. According to our model, by the end of 1994, 50 percent of enterprises will be made bankrupt, there will be no more state subsidies, and any enterprise that is unable to produce goods will be unable to exist. The economic decline will reach its peak at the end of 1995 and then come to an end and we will have regulated the situation by about 2000; so, there exists only one way of reviving the economy and this is by concluding treaties with the CIS countries, restoring ties with enterprises, renewing relations with factories and institutes, exchanging specialists and carrying out joint work; we should inform the people in detail of the first successful steps and their positive results. [Khetsuriani] Do you think that structural changes are necessary in industry and agriculture? [Prangishvili] The Reformers Union understands full well that, in order to transfer to a market economy, structural changes should gradually be made in industry and agriculture. However, we should remember that, in the transitional period, we should first invigorate and revive existing economic and management structures and subsequently set about modernizing them. At the same time, new economic and management structures should be formed and there should be a stage-by-stage transfer to them according to our state of readiness. It is necessary to carry out evolutionary reforms gradually and thereby the revival of relations between existing enterprises and management structures and their future modernization will be less painful for society than neglecting what exists and forming something new. [Khetsuriani] What factors could prove effective in halting the economic decline? [Prangishvili] First: Inflation will slow down. Its rate will fall to 7-10 percent per month. This will continue for eight to 10 months and this will already be an indicator of stability in the financial system. Second: Price rises will be checked! If, in 1993, prices rose by a factor of 20, they will rise by a factor of only four or five during this period. The third factor: Unstable enterprises will go bankrupt. The number of such enterprises will rise from the current level of 30 percent to 70 percent. Against this background, I would like to remind you once more how important it will be to restore economic ties between enterprises. Today, our enterprises do not have funds and sufficient cadres. They only have premises and old useless equipment. The principal branches of industry are not functioning; for example, the textile industry is at a complete standstill. It is impossible to change this situation and revive production and the economy without restoring the aforementioned ties. Naturally, the establishment of ties with other countries as well will render great service to the revival of our economy; for example, a treaty will be concluded with the United States in accordance with which we should be allocated credits to construct 200 small hydroelectric power stations. We hope that we will also be given help in constructing a 600 megawatt thermal power station in Kutaisi. All of this lies in the future. It is precisely the realization of these prospects that forms the aim of the Reformers Union. If we achieve the development of our country's economy, we, both the founders and members of the union, will feel that we have fulfilled our duty to Georgia.
