Following is our radio comment: A joint press conference was held in Hanoi by Chairman of the State Planning Committee Mr. Dau Ngoc Xuan and German Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger. The two ministers voiced their countries' will to strengthen relations and cooperation in many fields between the two countries in accordance with the potential of each country. The German minister also briefed on the outcome of his working visit to Vietnam. He said that Vietnam and Germany have achieved positive progress in political, trade, and economic areas. Over the past two years, high-level delegations of both sides have exchanged visits. The most important has been the visit to Germany by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet at the end of June last year and the visit by Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to Vietnam in April last year. The nomination of a special envoy in charge of relations between Germany and Vietnam at the German Embassy was an illustration of Germany's evaluation of the political importance of Vietnam. The decision was in conformity with Germany's foreign policy to broaden relations with Asia, the most promising region in the world. Commercial activities and investment between the two countries have also increased. In 1992, the total trade turnover between the two countries was more than 440 million Deutch marks and this year this figure might double. At present, Germany has invested in nine projects with a total capital of 13 million Deutsche marks. However, German businessmen and the German media think that the economic ties between the two countries are not big enough in both scope and scale in comparison with Vietnam's expectations and present conditions, as well as Germany's economy. The German business newspaper (HEINDORF PRESSE) commented that German business circles were following with keen interest developments in Vietnam and held that the process of renovation in Vietnam has achieved positive outcome. Vietnam has a skilled labor force with its industry and intelligence. Another favorable condition for German businessmen was that Vietnam has 5,000 people who studied and graduated in Germany and about 100,000 people who work in Germany. It means that in Vietnam, the number of those who speak German is higher than in any other Southeast Asian country. These are factors for further development of relations between Vietnam and Germany.
