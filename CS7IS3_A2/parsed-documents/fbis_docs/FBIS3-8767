[Wolfart] No national minority group represents a danger to the state's territorial integrity and sovereignty. No serious politician in Hungary would claim this. On the contrary: our national minorities are suitable for playing a role of mediator in our relations with other countries. Our treatment of national minorities is also an internal training for our international relations, even if these national minorities are small in number. Including the Gypsies, their number is estimated at 1 million. However, only a quarter of this figure is confirmed by the census. There are traditionally-acknowledged national minorities, like Germans, Slovaks, Croatians, Romanians, Serbs, and Slovenes. Gypsies make up the largest minority group, and they are both the most heterogeneous and most divided group. There are also groups that have almost been forgotten, sometimes even by themselves, like Poles, Greeks, Ukrainians, Ruthenians, Armenians, Bulgarians. The law on national minorities lists 13 groups with special rights. They are Hungarian citizens and have been living in Hungary for more than 100 years as a group; they differ from the majority nation through their own culture and language. [passage omitted] [Javorniczky] We know who the law regards as minorities. However, who regard themselves as minorities? To what extent do the people in question want to fall under a "dual evaluation?" [Wolfart] This is changing. An increasing number of people are asking questions about what they are, where they come from, and where they are heading. This does not mean that a lot more people regard themselves as minorities on paper too. Besides, I think that it takes a longer time for someone to feel that he belongs somewhere and to also acknowledge this, and regulations and a proper atmosphere can reduce this time, but this should nevertheless be left to the individual to decide. Those who acknowledge that they belong to a certain ethnic group today are doing this more deliberately today than 30-50 years ago or in the last century. Belonging to an ethnic group and coexistence with the Hungarian nation does not lead to tension in Hungary; one does not have to deny one's own culture or one's Hungarian friend. It also derives from the fact that there is a very close coexistence and there are not homogeneous communities isolated geographically. The number of mixed marriages has also increased in recent years. [passage omitted] The national minorities living in Hungary do not feel threatened; nor do they represent any threat to the Hungarians. The current situation can be called basically friendly, and we hope this will continue. It is another matter that the national minorities will strive to represent their interests more firmly than hitherto and to increase the importance of their institutions. We should not be surprised and doubtful if they also formulate demands and problems, in addition to positive things. We should forget the idea that the national minority issue can be solved. Today we legislate a good law and make a few good decisions tomorrow, and everything is solved. Regulations are meant to enable the national minorities to make use of their rights and express what they find improper and press for the things they want. Obviously, the state and the political echelons will have tasks to fulfill. We must treat the national minorities as partners, because we cannot prosper otherwise. [passage omitted] [Javorniczky] What are the major national minority rights? [Wolfart] The basic national minority rights are also included in the Constitution. The state-founding role, the right to create self-governing bodies, the right to be represented, and the banning of discrimination are such basic rights. The law on national minorities stipulates that the national minorities have important rights as communities. The right to create their own organizations, the right to learn and use their mother tongue, and the right to have systematic contacts with their mother country are such rights. It is also the obligation of the state to guarantee and partially finance all this. [passage omitted]
