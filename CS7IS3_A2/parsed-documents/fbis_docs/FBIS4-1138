Merton] [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] would start "a major voter education blitz" in Natal on Thursday [21 April] to reassure voters about the voting procedure after agreement on the addition of the Inkatha Freedom Party's sticker on ballot papers. IEC Voter Education Director Albert Mokoena said that with the exception of no-go areas, the commission's voter education programme had exposed most people to the voting procedure. "It does not matter how many parties appear on the voting paper," he said. IEC electoral administration training division head Kumi Naidoo said electoral officers would affix the sticker to ballot papers at a "supplies desk" before the papers were handed to voters at national and regional "issuing desks". The IEC would require an additional staff member at each voting station to cope with putting the stickers on ballot papers, but was confident this could be achieved within the short time before elections next week. Mr Naidoo said positive feedback had been received from Natal, where about 600 electoral officers each with a staff of 25 were now needed. People who had previously been hesitant to come forward, were volunteering, he said. The IEC expected to set up more than 9,000 voting stations countrywide, Mr Naidoo added.
