FR941102-0-00075 FR941102-0-00021 Neither Standard No. 108 nor SAE J576c ``requires'' coating, although that process may, in fact, be the most practicable way to meet the requirements of both. The present requirement may imply the absence of haze after weathering, but an absolute requirement of zero haze is neither practicable nor appropriate. Industry studies used by the SAE Lighting Committee have demonstrated that degradation of reflex reflector performance can be limited to less than 17 percent by preventing haze in excess of 7 percent, but that degradation increases rapidly with further haze to a loss of over 80 percent of initial performance at 21 percent haze. To control reflex reflector degradation and to make the haze test more objective, the SAE amended its Recommended Practice to establish a maximum allowable limit of 7 percent haze for plastics used for reflex reflectors. The proposal was opposed by AAMA, Ford, Chrysler, GM, and JAPIA. AAMA (supported in these views by Ford, Chrysler, GM, and GEP) believes that the rulemaking is premature for two reasons. The first is that ``the agency has not identified any safety problem arising from inadequacies'' in the existing requirement. The second is that ``there is no currently available information [to motor vehicle manufacturers] that relates haze test data for plastic materials currently used to the performance of reflex reflectors.'' It recommended that the agency withdraw its NPRM and issue an ANPRM on the subject. The comments of JAPIA were similar in that it requested an effective date for the final rule 5 years after its issuance to review its appropriateness. NHTSA disagrees that the rulemaking is premature. The purpose of the rulemaking is to ensure that an existing requirement will more closely conform to that portion of the statutory definition of a Federal motor vehicle safety standard that it ``provides objective criteria.'' (15 U.S.C. 1391(2)). The ``inadequacy'', to use AAMA's term, of the existing requirement is that it is subjective. As for the second argument, the SAE considered industry data on reflector performance with various haze filters fitted in front of a reflex reflector to quantify performance loss with increased haze, and it reported a subjective demonstration test also using haze filters (haze filters were used in the experiments rather than reflectors in various weathered states because reflector facets prevent the use of a hazeometer to measure the degree of haze). NHTSA believes that the needs for safety are met by the current requirement that plastic materials used in optical parts such as lenses meet the weathering test. Absent any treatment of the raw materials that affects its ability to meet J576 (see discussion below), optical parts fashioned from complying plastic materials ought to have the same haze resistance. AAMA also commented that the proposal would increase the stringency of haze requirements: ``[w]hereas the current Standard calls for no visually-perceptible change in haze resulting from outdoor exposure, the proposed revision would set a limit on the total haze of the exposed sample. Even unexposed samples exhibit some measurable haze that would be additive to any incremental haze produced by the three year outdoor exposure test.'' AAMA is not aware of any body of test data demonstrating whether plastic materials used in current reflex reflectors are capable of meeting a post-exposure limit of 7 percent. The present requirement contained in 4.2.2 of SAE J576c states that ``the exposed samples, when compared with the unexposed control samples, shall not show surface deterioration, crazing, haze, dimensional changes, color bleeding, delamination, or loss of surface luster.'' The determination of surface deterioration, dimensional changes, and color bleeding require comparison with control samples. But the SAE bases its interpretation of the haze requirement on the premise that low levels of haze are invisible to the naked eye, and it is certainly inappropriate for the samples to have visible haze before exposure. Therefore, the haze test is actually absolute; the only criterion is whether the exposed sample has visible haze. The ``comparison'' of visible haze to invisible haze is nothing more than a determination of the visible haze. Implicit in the visual test requirement is a mutually exclusive concept of haze_it is either visible or it is not visible. The concept of relative haze has little meaning unless the instrumentation of the proposed method of measurement is used.
