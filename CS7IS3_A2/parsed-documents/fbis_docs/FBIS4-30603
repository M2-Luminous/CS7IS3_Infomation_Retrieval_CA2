SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, in a meeting with LDP President Yohei Kono, said the SDP, the second largest opposition party, cannot hold such talks with the LDP as it will open a policy dialogue with the ruling coalition Wednesday, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference. But Kubo later said his party will officially respond to the LDP request by 6 p.m. Wednesday. The coalition and the SDP agreed earlier Tuesday to kick off talks to narrow differences over major policy issues and explore the possibility of fashioning a fresh coalition government. The SDP walked out of the latest ruling union in April, leaving Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata overseeing Japan's first minority administration since 1955. Hata resigned Saturday with his entire cabinet. In his meeting with Murayama, Kono said the LDP, the biggest opposition force, will back the SDP chief as a candidate for the premiership if the two parties share in a government, Kubo said. But Murayama only thanked the LDP for its proposal and explained that the SDP cannot begin talks on the framework of a new government with the LDP, citing the scheduled policy dialogue with the coalition, Kubo said. Murayama and Kono reportedly agreed that their parties will do their utmost to sort out the present political confusion within Wednesday, when the term of the current 150-day ordinary Diet session expires. In a separate news conference, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said Kono repeatedly urged Murayama to start negotiations for a possible coalition government with the LDP but failed to win approval. The LDP would have to put up Kono as a candidate for the next premier if no conclusion is reached by Wednesday evening on whether the SDP will rejoin the coalition or team up with the LDP. The LDP and the SDP, archrivals under the LDP's 38-year unbroken rule that ended last August, are widely apart on key policy issues such as diplomacy and national security, raising doubts about the possibility of a successful alliance.
