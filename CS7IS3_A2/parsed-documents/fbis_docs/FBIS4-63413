So said Yevgeniy Yasin, leader of the Russian Federation Presidential Staff Analysis Center, in an exclusive interview for a BIZNES-TASS correspondent. What would the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations do, given that there are no state foreign economic associations? It would be expected to work out customs tarrifs, foreign economic regulation, and so on. But these instruments also constitute highly important instruments of structural policy. "So it is that, from my viewpoint, the concentration of forces in the Ministry of the Economy is the sensible option for the purposes of hammering out a uniform economic policy. There are a number of new people right now who think rationally and who are capable of taking decisions which would be useful to the country," Yevgeniy Yasin concluded.
