SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Department may revoke a countervailing duty order if the Secretary of Commerce concludes that it is no longer of interest to interested parties. Accordingly, as required by the Department's regulations (at 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)), we are notifying the public of our intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on rebar from Peru, for which the Department has not received a request to conduct an administrative review for the most recent four consecutive annual anniversary months. In accordance with §355.25(d)(4)(iii) of the Department's regulations, if no domestic interested party (as defined in §§355.2(i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), and (i)(6) of the regulations) objects to the Department's intent to revoke this order pursuant to this notice, and no interested party (as defined in §355.2(i) of the regulations) requests an administrative review in accordance with the Department's notice of opportunity to request administrative review, we shall conclude that the countervailing duty order is no longer of interest to interested parties and proceed with the revocation. However, if an interested party does request an administrative review in accordance with the Department's notice of opportunity to request administrative review, or a domestic interested party does object to the Department's intent to revoke pursuant to this notice, the Department will not revoke the order. Opportunity to Object Not later than the last day of November 1994, domestic interested parties may object to the Department's intent to revoke this countervailing duty order. Any submission objecting to the revocation must contain the name and case number of the order and a statement that explains how the objecting party qualifies as a domestic interested party under §§355.2(i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations. Seven copies of any such objections should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Room B&hyph;099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(i). Dated: October 25, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.
