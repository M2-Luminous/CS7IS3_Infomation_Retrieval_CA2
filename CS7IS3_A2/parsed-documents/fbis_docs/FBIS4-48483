The conference, which is expected to start on 27 June, is a priority for the regime, which seized power in November, 1993. The conference is expected to discuss national problems and threats to the country's unity. A statement signed by Olaitan Oyerinde, chairman of the Lagos State branch of the CD, said that its members will not allow elections to be held in the state on 23 May, a day which has been declared a public holiday by the government in order to ensure that voters turn out to participate in the exercise. The statement called on polling agents, generally recruited from among teachers and civil servants, not to show up at the polling stations on 23 May. The CD, which described the constitutional conference as a "trick," expressed support for the call made on 16 May by the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), for General Sani Abacha to leave office before 31 May, and for the holding of a "sovereign national conference." NADECO is a new prodemocracy organization, which was formed on 13 May.
