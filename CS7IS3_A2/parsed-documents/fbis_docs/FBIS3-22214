All Marxism-Leninism did was make that thesis the basis of its economy and policy and introduce it into the day-to-day life of an actual society. On the basis of this fundamental thesis nature became nothing more than a resource and a raw material that needed to be processed in order for it to have any purpose. It was necessary to improve it, reshape it and transform it as required by the projects that were to build communism (e.g. the ``Great Stalinist Plan for the Transformation of Nature''). As if nature could create a being much wiser than nature itself! But here in the late 20th century humanity is turning its attention to ecology. We are beginning to realize that we must not elevate human beings above nature and not remove them from it, but, insofar as is still possible, make them a part of nature, and we also realize that human beings' needs are infinite, while natural resources are finite. The Ministry of Ecotourism The state structures of all countries now have ecological services --assessment agencies, departments and committees. Predictably, here in Russia we have the biggest of them all: a ministry. In terms of its staff size that ministry is also at the top, with 630 people, almost twice as many as previously worked for a USSR ministry serving all 15 republics. The parliament has officially adopted a ``Law on Environmental Protection.'' But can that be considered satisfactory, when the 1993 federal budget (though it has not yet received final approval) does not even contain a separate heading for environmental protection? What about the fact that this law still is unaccompanied by various sublegal acts like a definition of environmental disaster areas and a statute on state environmental assessment, on monitoring of and compensation for damages to the natural environment, on economic indicators governing environmental protection activity, and on incentive measures? Environmental protection officials at the local level claim they are more likely to spend time overcoming bureaucratic obstacles in the ministry's 22 departments than they are to receive assistance and support from them. In the United States 85 percent of all projects with an impact on the natural environment end up in court. That is understandable: even if a person cuts down his own forest he can cause damage to air quality far beyond the boundaries of his own property. Our Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources has not filed a single serious case against those responsible for many truly state-originated disasters. It seems that the ministry's favorite hobby is ``international relations'' -- i.e. innumerable symposiums, roundtable discussions and ``joint projects.'' What about the regions? They are completely uninteresting -- they have no round tables and no luncheon meetings! One example of this sort of ``ecotourism'' was the World Environmental Conference held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Russia sent a group of 150 people to Rio, including a group of ministerial employees and the minister himself. What were the results? Where are they to be found? In what materials? There was apparently no room for those materials in our tourists' suitcases, nor could they stand the test of meetings, attending them on something of a rotating basis. A few words about our public environmental movement. It is fading away. Once the movement was in a position to become a source of support for activities by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the government. But it did not -- a missed opportunity. There have been many missed opportunities. Just recall the idea of establishing an Ecological Fund. The time is past when the public could force the government to withdraw its plan to divert Siberian rivers' flow into the Caspian Sea, when the people of Volgograd were able to stop the construction of a second Volga-Don Canal, and when Leningraders, though not always successfully, at least energetically protested the construction of a dike across Neva Bay. Another woe: public and scientific ecology are degenerating into semi-legal private companies. One example: the Ecology and Peace Association has among its members a company called the Center for Urban Ecological Studies, which could be called ``N. P. Yurina and Co.'' It makes dubious deals with Europe's ``Ecological Building Blocks Initiative.'' Ecology: The Science of Stabilization Up until now science has worked for progress, and only ecology makes stabilization its goal. Science is undergoing a difficult time, a dramatically difficult time. Under the conditions that exist today scientists are out of the loop on environmental issues -- doing nothing and achieving nothing. During this ``time out of balance'' others are making their careers and reestablishing the positions they lost during the period when projects like the diversion of Siberian Rivers into the Caspian Sea, diversion of the Ob River into the Aral Sea, of the Volga into the Ural and Stavropol regions, the second Volga-Don Canal and many, many more were under development. One should not think that all these thoughts of ``diversion'' and huge projects have disappeared from the minds of those who came up with them and implemented them. Those same minds intend to maintain the state's monopoly over major construction, and if that is the case then both canals and water diversion projects will be back in the state's budget. Even now we have before us the findings of certain experts claiming that the second Volga-Don Canal is essential, as it will divert a portion of the Volga's flow into the Don River and thereby help lower the level of the Caspian Sea. But the second Volga-Don Canal's annual capacity is three cubic kilometers. That would lower the level of the Caspian Sea by only three millimeters, while the sea's level is rising by 10 centimeters or more each year. Who stands to benefit from the canal: the Caspian Sea or the canal builders? At stake are trillions of rubles, so would it not be more reasonable to invest that money directly in agriculture instead of in the construction of irrigation canals? The primary goal of the ``diversionists'' is to revive the great construction projects. Well-known engineer P. Polad-zade, former head of the former Ministry of Water Resources, is currently selling shares in the remains of that monster, the Vodstroy Concern -- the ministry's offspring, but an odd one, with authorized capital of R32.4 million. That is the price of one or two pieces of earthmoving equipment, even though the concern owns hundreds if not thousands of pieces of such equipment. This is who desperately needs a second Volga-Don Canal! G. Voropayev, a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences and one of the most active proponents of the idea of adding water to the Caspian Sea using northern rivers, is currently head of a council whose task is... to combat the flooding of coastal areas along the Caspian Sea, the level of which even without river diversion is already rising year after year. Yet many scientists had predicted that rise in sea level and warned Voropayev about it. Voropayev's council -- comprised of more than 30 people -- is successfully snaring millions of Russian rubles and selling information on the Caspian Sea to Iran for a pittance, with no other fruits of its efforts to be seen. Nor has the position of the ``diversionists'' on solving the problem changed: as before the focus is on water management, not on broader socioeconomic principles. The Russian Academy of Sciences Presidium twice sustained a motion of no confidence in Voropayev's nomination when he was appointed head of the current Caspian Council, yet the bureau of the Division of Oceanology, Atmospheric Physics and Geography (Academician V. Zuyev) stuck by its guns: the man who saved the Caspian Sea from ``drying up'' a few years ago would now save the land that the same sea is inundating! An equally strange situation is emerging in connection with the plan for a hydroelectric power station on the Katun River. A dubious project. Over a period of many years the project was never proven to be justified, but now there is only one consideration: Gornyy Altay has become a component of the Federation. That is all that is needed to proclaim: on with the construction! There is no money, the region's geology and geochemistry are cause for concern, the republic's economy does not justify the project, but still we are going ahead with it! Next door in Barnaul is the Institute of Ecological and Aquatic Problems (corresponding member O. Vasilyev). That is who should have the final word, but the institute's scientists are hedging: they are afraid to say ``no,'' but it is also dangerous to say ``yes.'' So many people are happy saying both ``no'' and ``yes'': some money is being allocated toward this unresolved issue, but only a little. Pressure From the Nuclear Industry On 24 December of last year the government decided to build a number of new nuclear power plants in the Russian Federation. The decision was made unexpectedly, without the prior knowledge of the scientific community. Ministry of Atomic Energy officials were well aware, as were their predecessors in the USSR Ministry of Medium Machine Building, that any open discussion of projects would elicit many justified objections. The Ministry of Atomic Energy needs these plants, that is clear. But does the country need them, a country whose industry is declining with each passing year and consuming less and less energy? The majority of our nuclear power plants have reactors of the same type that are at Chernobyl, and the International Atomic Energy Agency considers them dangerous. IZVESTIYA has repeatedly reported on the dangerously dilapidated condition of the Leningrad Atomic Electric Power Station. Those in the nuclear industry say that we must not lag behind France, which gets more than half of its energy from nuclear power. Yet they forget to mention that in France all nuclear power plants are located at a distance of at least 15 kilometers from population centers and are equipped with less dangerous reactors. They also forget to add that France has a powerful nuclear waste processing industry, while we store such waste on the surface (on the Kola Peninsula) or only lightly covered with earth, as at Sergiyev Posad near Moscow. Plus we have radioactive wastes both of our own origin and from abroad -- from nuclear power plants that we have built in other countries. Such were the terms of the contracts under which they were built. Radiation from underground nuclear weapons testing at sites near Semipalatinsk, and to a lesser degree on Novaya Zemlya, covers extensive areas of the former Altay Kray, Novosibirsk Oblast, the northern Komi Republic, the Arctic Urals and the West Siberian coastline. Do not let them tell you that the radiation is slight, harmless and not in excess of permissible standards. Those ``standards'' are very provisional and have repeatedly been revised. And Chernobyl showed us that the residents of similar ``favorable'' areas in terms of their degree of radioactivity have become very ill and died agonizing deaths from cancer of the thyroid gland, liver and blood. Yet Russia possesses tremendous reserves of natural gas, primarily in Tyumen Oblast. The portion of those reserves that has been explored and is ready for use totals tens of billions of cubic meters, with projected reserves of tens of trillions of cubic meters. That does not include fields that are beginning to be discovered on the floor of the Barents and Karsk seas, as well as along both coasts of Sakhalin. We produce approximately one billion cubic meters of natural gas annually, and that is the one industrial sector where there has been no drop in production. That means we have enough natural gas to last for at least 300 years. By that time dangerous nuclear fission energy will have given way to safe nuclear fusion energy. According to assurances from American physicists, that will occur in the first decade of the 21st century. Why are we about to build many dangerous nuclear power plants that will soon be outdated yet conserve our natural gas, the burning of which would produce energy that is environmentally clean and much cheaper? Or are we saving that natural gas so we can sell it at a low price to our foreign partners and buy from them at high prices capron, nylon and porolon clothing made from that same natural gas? That might be to someone's benefit, but it does not benefit the state. Sweden does not have any coal, oil or natural gas fields. Nevertheless, after Chernobyl the Swedish Riksdag decided not to build a single new nuclear power plant and to shift all the country's further power development to heat and electric power generating stations using imported natural gas from seafloor deposits. The Nature Giveaway In 1917 Russia, or a substantial portion thereof, came to believe that its greatest wealth in the world -- factories, plants, railroads, lands with their forests and mineral wealth, and rivers -- should be forcibly expropriated from their private owners, including the Romanov dynasty, and become truly the people's property. That was precisely how Soviet slogans and decrees framed the issue. And what happened? What happened was that all that wealth wound up in the hands of the party elite, which not only had complete control of the country's entire natural environment, but also arbitrarily experimented with nature, plundered it and crippled it with gigantic construction projects. In our country privatization is like a giveaway. It would seem that a giveaway is not acquisition, so the matter should be much simpler. In fact, it is much more complex than a direct requisition of the socialist type. Why is that so? Because both those who are doing the giving (the state apparatus, the state bureaucracy) and those who are receiving (the ``new capitalists'') have virtually the same opportunities for personal enrichment. Neither group wants to miss those opportunities. Neither group currently has the slightest interest in ecology or any concern over how to preserve forests, soils, mineral resources, rivers and a clean atmosphere. All current programs in this regard are not worth the paper they are printed on, if only because they are in no way connected with the theoretical principles, much less the practical application, of privatization. That practical application, in turn, should be based on new principles of ownership, from which it would be clear who would have the right to possess what, in what amount and on what terms. Until we establish those principles of ownership there can be no civilized privatization, nor any point in discussing ecology -- it will just be pushed aside. An oblast boss calls a rayon boss: ``Petr Ivanovich! Sell this guy a piece of land! With a little garden plot! Do it!'' That is all that has to be said. The ``guy'' is not just anybody, he is a restaurant owner! And so Russia's forests, minerals resources and water are being exploited (and plundered and polluted) at an unprecedentedly frenzied rate. It is impossible to say where privatization will lead under the current system (i.e. disorder and chaos). Politics without well-founded projection is nothing more than adventurism. And so the richest country in the world is going around the world with its hand outstretched. Not Under Public Scrutiny The problem is also with our level of ecological awareness. Each of us could make various suggestions to the government. For example, we feel that state authority today requires three police forces: civil police, tax police and sanitary-environmental police. But that is just one small detail. The awareness of every citizen of the Federation is another matter. It is clear that police forces, even a dozen of them, cannot fix this situation if citizens today are indifferent to the task of preserving their greatest wealth -- nature -- and if each of us does not feel ourselves in at least some way the owner of that wealth and thus obligated to pass it on to our children and grandchildren. There is still time to think and realize. Not much, just a short time, but there is still time. The reader has probably noticed that articles on environmental issues have become a rarity in our newspapers. Not one of our large-circulation publications has launched even a weekly or monthly environmental column. We can say with certainty that if our scientific community and our culture ignore the problems of ecology the cause is doomed to failure.
