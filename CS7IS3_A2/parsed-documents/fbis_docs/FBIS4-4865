Power consumption for nonindustrial use rose 6.9 percent to 33.6 billion kilowatt-hours, while that for industrial use edged up 0.2 percent to 35.3 billion kilowatt-hours, the ministry said in a preliminary report. Of the nonindustrial consumption, household use grew a marked 7.2 percent thanks to lower temperatures from a year before during the reporting month, while use at office buildings climbed 7.5 percent. Large-lot power consumption for industrial use decreased 0.9 percent for the eighth straight month of declines from a year earlier. The slack demand reflected the long-stagnant business activity in the materials sector and sluggish demand from the machinery industry, MITI said.
