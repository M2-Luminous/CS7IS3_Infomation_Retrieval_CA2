Chen Jinhua said: The state economic information network was established in 1984 with the State Council's approval. In the eight years or so since its inception, the network has expanded to cover the entire country. More than 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government; all cities with provincial-level economic decisionmaking power; 280 key cities and regions; and 1,500 counties have become information hubs sufficiently outfitted with technology and equipment, and staffed by professional teams. The network has played an important role in serving the party and government in macroeconomic policy-making, macroeconomic regulation and control, and macroeconomic management, as well as in providing information to enterprises and people in society. At the conference, Gao Xingmin, director of the State Information Center, reviewed last year's achievements, discussed new problems, and laid down several key tasks for this year.
