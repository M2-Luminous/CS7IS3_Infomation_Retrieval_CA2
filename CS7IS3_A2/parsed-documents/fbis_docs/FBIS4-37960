The Council discussed several issues and national developments on the political, military, security, and economic levels and adopted the appropriate decisions. The National Defense Council reiterated that the Republic of Yemen is committed to UN Security Council Resolution 924 and is responsive to all the good efforts seeking an entrenchment of the cease-fire which the rebels who broke away from legitimacy violated every time with the aim of internationalizing the Yemeni crisis. The Council stressed that the authorities in the Republic of Yemen and all units of the Yemeni Armed Forces--forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy--are very eager to safeguard and spare the blood of civilians in the suburbs of brave Aden and in all Yemeni cities and governorates because this is part of their national responsibility. In response to the call made by UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali yesterday; in order to give the rebels a new chance to stop fighting and end their rebellion; and in response to all good efforts by the brothers and friends to cease fire and solve the Yemeni problem through peaceful dialogue within the framework of the Republic of Yemen by maintaining unity and respecting the constitutional legitimacy; the National Defense Council announced a new initiative to entrench the cease-fire as of 2400 yesterday, Saturday [2100 GMT on 25 June]. The U.S. and French military attaches in the Republic of Yemen will directly supervise the cease-fire until the other members of the joint military committee arrive. This initiative is a proof of credibility and a confirmation of the extent of the Republic of Yemen's desire to abide by UN Security Council Resolution 924 in letter and spirit.
