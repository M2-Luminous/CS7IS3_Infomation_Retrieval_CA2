A significantly updated document was submitted for their perusal following the work done on it by the government commission in conjunction with representatives of Duma committees. As a result the parameters of the proposed budget underwent rather major alterations. Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin told deputies that the amendments amount to increases in the expenditure and revenue parts of the budget. But the proportions have significantly shifted in the direction of increased expenditure. It is envisaged that budget revenue will now increase by 3,776.5 billion rubles [R] and will thus be R124,477 billion. Where will it come from? Primarily from the 1 July change in customs duties and corresponding change in value-added tax. The tax collected specifically for the needs of the agro-industrial complex and coal industry is to increase by a little over R1 trillion. Revenue will also be swelled as a result of duty changes and increased revenue from privatization. As we can see, all these sources are rather problematic, and the implementation of them will depend on many factors. As for expenditure, the situation is far more definite. This part will certainly be implemented. The plan is for expenditure to increase by R10,188.3 billion. That will make it R193,324 billion. As a result the budget deficit will rise from R62 trillion to R68.847 trillion, constituting 9.5 percent of gross domestic product. What is the increase in state expenditure? The lion's share goes to the agro-industrial complex. As Sergey Dubinin explained, a solution has been found which will not have serious inflationary consequences, since the increased budget appropriations will be accompanied by reduced Central Bank credits for the countryside. The components of the Federation will be allocated more than R5 trillion on a repayment basis to give agricultural producers advances and to purchase products. Moreover, the agro-industrial complex will be allocated more than R2 trillion from the budget for other purposes. There is yet another item on which more budget money will be spent -- social and cultural needs. An extra R968.4 billion is to be allocated for this purpose. Nearly half of it will go to the media, mainly television and radio. An extra R345 billion is to be allocated for the purchase of drugs. According to the minister, the protracted examination of the budget was a lesson for the government and for parliament, so the intention is to submit the draft budget for next year to the deputies by September.
