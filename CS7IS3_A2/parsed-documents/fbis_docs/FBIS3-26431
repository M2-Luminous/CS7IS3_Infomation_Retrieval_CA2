The projects are mainly in the transportation, telecommunications, energy, water conservancy and raw material production sectors, according to officials of the provincial office for the construction of key projects. The projects include an expressway between Chengdu and Chongqing, the second-phase construction of a digital telecommunications network, the Tongjiezi Hydropower Station, the second-phase construction of the Panzhihua Iron and Steel Company, the Longchang-Luzhou railway line, a chemical fertilizer plant, a chemical plant and a cement plant. The Sichuan section of an optical fiber telecommunications cable line between Xian, capital of Shaanxi Province in northwest China, and Chengdu, capital of Sichuan, have been completed. For a long time the backward infrastructure had hampered this inland province's economic development. Last year Sichuan invested nearly nine billion yuan (over one billion U.S. dollars) in the construction of 60 construction projects -- both figures setting records for the province. The responsibility system has been used for the construction of some projects, as a reform measure, to ensure quality and progress of construction, production, management and repayment of loans.
