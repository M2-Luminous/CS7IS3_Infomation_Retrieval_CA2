It not only has political importance but also economic importance. We are witnessing deep forms of fraternity and friendship between the Georgian and Russian peoples, and these are at the stage of restoration. It is necessary for us to restore them. We pin great hopes on this large package [of agreements] that was just signed. This will provide an impetus in the development of the economy in our republic. [Correspondent] Thank you. [Pavel Grachev] These issues were agreed upon at the level of working groups. A consent has been acquired from the two presidents. I had a talk with Eduard Ambrosyevich Shevardnadze on this subject yesterday. He confirmed all these intentions, and this morning our experts finished the text of the protocol we signed. [Correspondent] Will the issue of the return of refugees to Abkhazia be discussed, and how safe would it be? [Grachev] All issues linked with the further work, even the the principal treaty our presidents will sign, will certainly be linked with the situation in Abkhazia as well as the situation in South Ossetia. Indeed, without a stable political situation in the Georgian state, all of these good undertakings, good protocols, and all other good things will not gain momentum. A firm, good, and stable political situation is required. [passage omitted]
