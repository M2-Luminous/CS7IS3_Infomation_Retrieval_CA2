This is a topic arising from the process at work centers, the workers parliaments, during which workers have suggested increasing the prices of regulated products. [Rodriguez] Yes, I believe these ideas refer not only to products listed in the industrial-consumption or food-consumption catalogs, but also to other products such as gasoline for personal use. There are those who suggest we return to a parallel market. That would be marvelous. But how would we establish a parallel market? Resources are needed to import products, resources, or raw materials in order to produce things in Cuba, or a combination of these items, which is how we carried out a parallel market. The parallel market would be a good solution, but we do not have the conditions for a parallel market. [Roque] Nevertheless, there are some products today that are still being subsidized. [Rodriguez] Yes, there are basic products for human consumption that are subsidized, and I believe that for now, we cannot even think about increasing prices on them. I am talking about milk. Milk is sold at 25 cents. Nevertheless, the production cost of a liter of milk in Cuba, the cost not only at the dairy farm, but at the marketplace as well, is much more. That is a subsidized product. Obviously, today we are discussing -- and I tend to believe we should subsidize people, not products -- whether that is how things should be. I believe they should. I believe we should subsidize people with lower incomes so they can purchase that milk at 25 cents. [Roque] I am referring to products that are not basic, but other products -- we could say industrial products -- that are priced very low. [Rodriguez] Yes, I believe our pricing policy has been a bit generous in that sense. In the world, raw materials have increased in value, fuel prices have increased, labor costs have increased in Cuba. The general salaries reform increased the cost of labor. Yet, we remain static, with the same prices for dozens of years. [Roque] What should we do then? [Rodriguez] Well, I believe a policy of prices in harmony with the current situation should be considered. That is the suggestion many workers have made. The problem is that we lack products. Today, when you look at the spectrum of what we are receiving through the official market, rum and cigarettes are two of those products that we would not call "necessities." [Roque] "Necessities" in quotation marks. [Rodriguez] That is right -- in quotation marks. I believe these could be easy targets, explainable and reasonable, for a noticeable price increase. Some have even suggested eliminating the cigarette from the quota because right now cigarettes are being sold at three different prices: 30 cents for those regulated by the quota; the other, which they call additional, for 1.60 pesos; and when sought on the free market, another at 8 pesos. [Roque] Could all these be joined together? [Rodriguez] I believe they could. That is the suggestion the workers have been making in the parliaments. [Roque] This idea is for cigarettes. People may be able to understand that, but there are other ideas, about rum, that people have not been able to accept. [Rodriguez] The problem is that we are talking about two different products that should not be lacking in that market. Yet there is a shortage. Way before cigarettes, I remember there began to be a shortage of rum. At the time, they claimed that there was a problem with the bottles. [Roque] That was the first problem. [Rodriguez] Yes, the first problem. Nevertheless, since then, we have seen other causes. The recent sugar harvest was a small harvest. A harvest of 4.2 million tonnes, a sugar harvest that left little molasses. When you have little molasses, you must decide whether you are going to produce more alcohol or use it for animal feed. Today, we need to recover our livestock, so the decision is obvious. Now, when you allot a quantity to the production of alcohol, you must maintain a level of supply on the world market because it is a way to generate income. It is a product that has a market, which we cannot give up. Renato [Recio] discussed this not too long ago on a program on this subject. With a bottle of rum, we could probably buy three packages of aspirin -- with just one bottle on the world market. We need that money and the hard currency. At the same time, this goes against the very production of the domestic market. The domestic market has suffered, even though the international market has also suffered because when you distill molasses, you do not always obtain alcohol at a level of quality for that international market. Then there are two or three grades. When one reduces the amount of molasses distilled, one also reduces the amount of product to be allocated for the foreign market. [Roque] In view of the fact that there is little production, there are provinces such as Havana City that maintain distribution of the regulated rum, and it becomes an obligation to the consumer having to guarantee that bottle every month. [Rodriguez] I believe this is a mistake. My personal opinion is -- and I believe we have come here to speak frankly -- that this is a mistake. When you regulate, you are obligated. The same thing happens with cigarettes because when you regulate a product, you are obliged to maintain a supply per capita. You give to the person who drinks as well as to the person who does not drink. [Roque] This creates a black market for rum and cigarettes. [Rodriguez] Of course. [Roque] This is something we discussed a few days ago on this program. Nevertheless, I believe we must also seek acceptable criteria so that the new prices are reasonable, because we cannot let some drink rum and smoke while others cannot. [Rodriguez] Well, this thing about being reasonable is a bit difficult. This topic on prices is very complex. When you think that your salary is around 150 or 200 pesos and you have to face a market to satisfy a vice or addiction, as in the case of the cigarette, you need to buy it at an exorbitant price. This undoubtedly might irritate smokers. As a matter of fact, there are many smokers who are so addicted to cigarettes that they become anxious. Their nervous systems are affected. There are some who cannot even eat. it It is therefore a very delicate subject. I want listeners to understand the suggestion: If the price of cigarettes would increase -- I am not being specific because I have no idea of what the state would be willing to place as a cap, or how much the consumer would be willing to pay -- this price would effect both sides, the consumer and the seller. In the case of cigarettes, if the cigarette quota was eliminated, smokers could still get cigarettes. There would be a supply. The same could happen with rum. I do not believe there would be an abundance since there is not enough of the product for abundance. But, if only those people who wish to drink rum were to go to the market to buy it, then to some degree we could solve the problem of demand. Now, I do not believe that regulating these products by price would be legal or ethical, as in a market economy, supply and demand. But if prices were to increase slightly, we might be able to stabilize supply and demand. [Roque] Osvaldo, I am not clear on what you said about the mechanisms of the market economy. [Rodriguez] Well, I was referring to one thing -- how the market economy operates. Prices are increased until they regulate and stabilize the balance between supply and demand. That is not what I am talking about. [Roque] That is not the case. [Rodriguez] I am simply saying that if prices were a bit higher and regulation of these products was eliminated, we would be able to achieve the goal of stabilizing supply and demand and could recover some of the excess currency. If today you consider the price a person who drinks rum is willing to pay for the bottle, and the person who smokes for a box of cigarettes, you would realize that there is undoubtedly a high level of buying power, or liquidity, as it is commonly called in accounting. [Roque] Yes, but not everybody has the purchasing power or the money to buy the rum or cigarettes at the exorbitant prices being charged. [Rodriguez] That is why I am saying that they would not be sold at those prices. The price should not be the black market price. A bottle of rum should not be sold at 120 or 100 pesos. That is hyperbole. [Roque] Because then it would be a privilege to drink rum and smoke in this country, and that cannot be. [Rodriguez] You are right. I agree that it should not be a privilege. I believe it should be an option, and that everybody should have access to these products, but at an increased price. [Roque] Undoubtedly, we are discussing a complex topic because these are suggestions that are being made at the workers parliaments. It does not mean that these measures are going to be adopted immediately. That requires a great deal of analysis. Furthermore, not everything that is suggested in these parliaments is going to be implemented. They are suggestions that arise and are later carefully analyzed to determine at what point it is convenient to adopt measures. [Rodriguez] Soon, there is going to be an extraordinary session of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] and that is where policies will be established -- not measures. Measures cannot be seen separately from the economy. In other words, you cannot adopt a series of measures for this, which we call internal finance, and other measures for the other part of the economy. That is why the workers parliaments today analyze two basic issues: how to increase efficiency at the work center, and suggestions for national measures. [Roque] You mentioned efficiency. If we were capable of producing some of the products that we give to the population today, at a higher quality, we could also charge a lot more. This would be another way of collecting the excess currency that is circulating on the street. I repeat, these are initiatives and ideas that need to be analyzed because they are important. Bread is an example. I would rather pay 40 cents for a loaf of good bread than 5 cents for a loaf that is not good. [Rodriguez] Not only that, we need to look at the raw material that is invested to make that bread. The large quantities of materials that are wasted or that spoil. [Roque] Or the materials that are stolen. [Rodriguez] Yes, the materials that are stolen. That quantity is also pretty high. But if they could use all the raw materials and resources we have, efficiently, we could undoubtedly have more. [Roque] Well, we began talking about rum and cigarettes and we ended up talking about bread. In this program we have analyzed some suggestions regarding price as a method of absorbing excess currency.
