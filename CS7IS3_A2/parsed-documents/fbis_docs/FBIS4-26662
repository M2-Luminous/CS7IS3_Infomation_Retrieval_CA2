Tong Zhiguang, chairman of the Board of Directors, said the bank will start operations on July 1, and accumulate total assets of 5 billion yuan ($570 million) by the end of this century. Its registered capital is 3.38 billion yuan ($388 million). Established on April 26 with the approval of the State Council (China's cabinet), the bank is one of the three policy banks that provide preferential loans to State key industrial and trade sectors. The other two are the State Development Bank and the Agricultural Bank. The government decided to set up policy banks so that they can help State key projects stay afloat by providing more long- and medium term loans. Lei Zuhua, governor and vice board chairman of the bank, said the bank will focus on export credit initially. "At the same time, we will prepare for credit insurance and guarantee business," he said. The bank is expected to approve 3 billion yuan ($345 million) worth of loans to domestic exporters this year. The loans actually delivered, how ever, would be 2 billion yuan ($230 million), he disclosed. Tong said the bank will gradually increase the amount of export credit as the country has vast potential in tapping the export of technology-intensive machinery and electronic products. In 1993, the export of machinery and electronic products. including complete plant systems, accounted for only 24.7 per cent of the nation's total export volume. About 60 projects have sought loans worth over 10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion) from the bank. But Lei said that three projects are likely to receive loans worth a total of 500 million yuan ($57.5 million). They involve the launch of an overseas satellite and the export of a ship to Norway and training aircraft to Pakistan. Lei also said that his bank is expected to issue 1 billion yuan ($115 million) to 1.7 billion yuan ($195 million) worth of domestic bonds this year. Besides export credit, credit insurance and guarantee, the bank can also deal in government loans and mixed loans, which are related to the export of China's machinery and electronic products. International inter-bank and syndicated loans, the issue of financial bonds overseas and project assessment are also part of the bank's business scope.
