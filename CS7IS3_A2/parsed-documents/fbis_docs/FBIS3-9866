The just struggle for the physical survival of the Serbian people of Krajina has put back on the world political scene the need for Serbian national unity, which was interrupted at the end of 19th century and the beginning of 20th century. In this I see the greatest contribution of the Krajina people to the universal struggle of the Serbian people for national unity. This is what, among other things, Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, said in an interview to VOJSKA KRAJINE. Martic pointed out the following: "Being positioned at the far western outpost of the Serbian nation and surrounded by the hostile politics of Croatia, the Serbs in Krajina have managed, over three years and with many casualties, to withstand all the assaults of the Ustasha state and to preserve their freedom. We have managed to create a state with all the attributes of statehood except international recognition. The world's politicians are already getting used to this state as a reality, and I think that, regardless of their wishes, Croatia's politicians will also have to respect it because there will be no peace in these regions without that." Not Only Defensive I expect, Martic says, that this year a solution will be found to the clashes on the territory of the former Yugoslavia and thereby to the question of the unification of Serbian states. This was my election program and, even more important, it was with such an orientation that we set off into this new pan-Serbian struggle in which we have suffered huge losses for the umpteenth time. Nobody, including those of us who now lead the people, has the right to betray these ideals that have moved our people into new sufferings and self-denials. Pan-Serbian unification is our strategic aim and our program. How we will implement that strategy is another question. I think that the obstacles will be huge and that a lot of political wisdom and skill, and a lot of unity and patience will be needed to realize this great aim. In reply to the question about the defense of the republic of Serbian Krajina, Martic said the following: Our defense has so far been based on outdated and inefficient principles -- on the principle of armed people and defending of one's own home. We mobilized almost all the citizens who could fight but we nevertheless had poor results in some military operations. A large proportion of the armed men were disorganized and resorted to their own initiative, something that can be fatal in war. Therefore, changes that will fundamentally modify the defense system are needed. On the one hand, we will be working on creating a professional core of the army, which will consist of mobile and stable maneuver units, well equipped and paid. Such units would be able to perform all tasks, be it defending an section of our territory under attack or dealing a blow to the enemy where he is most sensitive. We must no longer exclusively base our defense on a defensive strategy, that is, on defending the regions under attack. On the other hand, our global policy will be directed toward creating conditions for peace, above all through political negotiations with the side at war. We can enter these negotiations only if we have forces that the enemy respects. The Return of Officers According to some people, professionalization in the army, in the way it should be, will weaken our defense force, which is completely wrong. As I have already said, now we only have armed people, but that cannot be considered a real army. The working population will still be military reservists who, if need be, can be mobilized at any moment. It is important to distribute the load of war more equally among all republic of Serbian Krajina citizens. When I say this I mean that all those who have so far not felt the war should in a way in the future be included in what we call the united defense system. As regards deserters, there are measures to deal with them, and as regards private entrepreneurs, we have nothing against them doing their job, but they should also perform their duties in defense. One component upon which we will build our defense system is good cooperation with the armed forces of the Srpska republic and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Now we can create a model of armed forces that may be a basis for a united army in the future joint state. For this, of course, we need the help and cooperation of military and civilian structures in other Serbian lands. As regards this help, it has never been lacking so far. However, we must insist on the return of all militarily fit citizens who are in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] at the moment. Officers are particularly valuable to us and, in this regard, we have received understanding among the FRY authorities in helping us have these people return to the Krajina.
