The Iranian National Resistance Council (INRC) said in a statement that the homes in Iraq of families connected to the Iraq-based Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) were destroyed in the attack on Friday. However the report could not been confirmed by independent sources. The KDP, which is the main Kurdish opposition to the Tehran regime has bases in Kurd areas in northern Iraq, many of them near the border with Iran. Mas'ud Rajavi, chairman of the INRC and leader of the People's Mojahedin [Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization], the main armed opposition to Tehran based in Iraq, denounced what the press statement termed a "criminal and terrorist attack". He called on the UN Security Council to take measures urgently "to prevent the slaughter of the Iranian people and of the population of Kurdistan". The INRC was founded in 1981 and brings together the People's Mojahedin and other closely-related Iranian opposition groups.
