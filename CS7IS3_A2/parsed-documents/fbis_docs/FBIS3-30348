In the region of Zavidocici and Zepca, central Bosnia, antagonism between Moslem military and civilian authorities is more marked, the sources added citing local Bosnian Croat military sources. Croatian refugees from Sarajevo are also giving accounts of growing divisions among Moslems in that city and the rising number of those who are now in favor of a political solution, and not the continuation of war in Bosnia. Serbian military sources report about continued Moslem-Croat clashes in central Bosnia, especially in the region of Prozor, Gornji Vakuf, Kiseljak and Zepca, as well as in the region of Mostar, in the south-west of that former Yugoslav republic. In attacks of Croatian forces on parts of Mostar under Moslem control one civilian was killed and seven were wounded in the last 24 hours, Moslem Radio Sarajevo reported on Tuesday. At the same time, Croatian military sources claim that 15 civilians were wounded on Monday in the part of Mostar under Croatian control. Despite heavy casualties, the Moslem army continued its offensive in the region of Zepce, the Zagreb-based Croatian Radio reported. In the region of Sarajevo, Moslem forces continued attacks on the Serbian parts of the city, targetting especially [word indistinct], Grbavica, Lukavica, Nedzarici and Ilidza, Serbian military sources added. Serbian positions in northern Bosnia, in the region of Doboj, the mountains of Ozren and Teslici, were also targetted by Moslems. Moslem forces continued with their armed provocations of the Serbian side from the direction of Olovo, Kladanj and Kalesija (north-east Bosnia), as well as from the eastern Bosnian enclave of Gorazde -- a zone under U.N. protection.
