Prior to that, the U.S. ambassador to the UN [Albright] and the U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [Shalikashvili] had talks with Defense Minister Lajos Fur and Head of State Arpad Goncz. Jozsef Barat reports on the latter meeting. [Barat] The Partnership for Peace program is a serious step towards political integration rather than being just an ersatz [potcselekves], Arpad Gocz said during talks with Ambassador Albright and General John Shalikashvili. The terms of the complex political and military cooperation program are mutually acceptable, the president of the Republic stressed, and he called it important that the U.S. initiative treated the region as a whole. According to Arpad Goncz, it is also shown by the fact that Prague was chosen for the venue of next week's meeting. The president agreed that the Partnership for Peace program was of extensive and not exclusive character, that is it will do no damage, it will not harm sensitive areas in fostering ties with the East. President Clinton's special envoys assured Arpad Goncz that the security of the United States and that of Central Europe were interrelated. For Washington, the security of all countries in the region is equally important.
