In terms of form, however, the escalation is quite significant. The heavy guns Washington is bringing to bear against the foreign trade practices of Japan and other states -- which are felt to be discriminating -- marks a new round in the trade conflict between the two biggest economies, a conflict that was predetermined by the failure of the American-Japanese summit two weeks ago. While the yen, as the most efficient correction instrument for disparities in Japanese foreign trade, boomed as expected after the failure of the summit, the United States is now voicing threats. The President, represented by Trade Representative Kantor, made it quite clear who the primary U.S. target is: Japan and, still unexpressed, South Korea. Tokyo's first reaction was almost one of relief. The stock exchange reacted with friendly restraint, as the yen declined markedly, and the United States will do nothing but complete their list of complaints against Japan until 30 September. Although government and economic spokesmen in Tokyo expressed concern and criticism about the reactivation of Super 301, the certainty prevailed that a compromise will be achieved before a trade war breaks out. So far, Tokyo has not been irritated by the pressure undoubtedly exerted by Super 301 and the ensuing deterioration of the political climate that signal danger for world trade. This will change. A petty, and probably embarrassing, list of Japan's sins will follow, drawn up by a still inexperienced U.S. Administration, and presented to a Japanese Government that largely is worn out. For the Hosokawa government the escalation with Washington means another diplomatic failure, that will further undermine the prime minister's authority. During the next few weeks, while the United States is formulating its charge, composure in Tokyo will give way to hectic research into where Japan can compromise without losing face. In today's calm before the storm, Tokyo hopes it will be able to report the beginning of an upswing in 12 months' time, which the United States -- quite mistakenly -- considers to be the precondition for reducing its deficit with Japan. But the economic shift is significantly influenced by the external value of the yen. If, during the long procedure of Super 301 or because of excessive U.S. demands, the trade conflict is transferred back to the foreign exchange market, Japan's upswing will be delayed and America's patience strained. The scenario is so alarming that Washington and Tokyo are wooing Europe for assistance, and Japan wants to mobilize Asian neighbors as well. This opens up a position of mediator for Europe, which, if successful, might improve its position in Japan. But, if Japan's loneliness turns into isolation, it will withdraw to Asia even more quickly than it is doing anyhow.
