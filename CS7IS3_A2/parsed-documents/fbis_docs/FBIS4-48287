NP sources claimed Mandela had reneged on two undertakings: that he would announce the new cabinet only after consulting Deputy President F.W. de Klerk, and that he would share the four security portfolios of defence, safety and security (formerly law and order), justice and correctional services between the NP and the ANC. The NP also fears that real power will not reside with the cabinet, but that important policy decisions will be taken by the ANC's National Executive Committee [NEC], with cabinet serving as a mere rubber stamp. ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa's decision not to join the cabinet was described as "a worrying development". Senior Nats consider Ramaphosa highly ambitious and likely to assert his influence from outside the executive, leading to a shift in the balance of power between the NEC and the cabinet and the isolation of NP cabinet members. Ramaphosa is known to have made enemies, some within his own party, since the Transitional Executive Council began operating last year. Opponents say the wide powers he wielded during the transition have gone to his head, and that he has become "aloof and arrogant". Said one senior NP source: "We cannot conceivably be satisfied with serving as a rubber stamp for decisions taken by the ANC's NEC. The next few weeks will show whether everyone in the ANC's top echelons understands the notion of consensus government and nation-building." The sources said Mandela's "premature announcement" last Friday of the ANC's list of cabinet proposals contradicted agreements with the NP leadership. Discussions with De Klerk had not been finalised when the names were made public, they said. Rumour had it this week that the early announcement of the ANC's cabinet list -- before negotiations between De Klerk and Mandela were completed -- was the result of pressure from senior NEC members. One NP parliamentarian speculated that members of a "cabal" in the NEC had dismissed NP claims that a mutiny might follow the failure to appoint an NP person as minister in a key security portfolio. "They want the security forces to know right away who's the boss" he said.
