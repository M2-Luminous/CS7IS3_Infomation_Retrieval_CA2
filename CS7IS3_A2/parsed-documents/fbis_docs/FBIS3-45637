A commentator's article released yesterday by the official XINHUA News Agency entitled "Parallel Progress in Reform and Development" stressed that the current reform situation is good, the objectives are clear and the opportunity is rare, while admitting that reform is facing a very difficult job. Faced with the new situation of "dual speeding up" in reform and development, we should have the following understanding: Learn how to speed up reforms under a more rapid pace of economic development and more complicated economic relations. The year 1994 will be the most important for China's reform and economic development and should be a year of "double harvests" The article says that the general view inside and outside China is that China's economy is facing a "dual speeding up" situation in which China must speed up both reform and development. If the opportunity offered by the current stability in the political and economic arenas is well exploited, then, with painstaking and practical work, China's economy shall reap a "double harvest" in which both reform and development will have made great strides. The article pointed out: To achieve the "double harvest" objective, we must -- as we surely will if we take a look at national economic development in 1993 -- understand this: Reform must create new structures, and development must take a new path; the two are symbiotic. Only through reform and creating a new economic structure can the productive forces be released to any significant extent and can we ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy [as published] development of the national economy. In terms of the economy at the macro level, GDP grew approximately 13 percent last year, industrial production grew 19.5 percent, and fixed-asset investment was up 47 percent from the previous year. Even though it was operating at such a high speed, the economy was not disrupted by any major problems precisely because reform had been deepened. As a result, enterprises' production and operating power increased and combined national power entered a new dimension. On the other hand, the official JINGJI XINXI BAO [Economic Information] pointed out in a front-page commentator's article that the current audacious reforms might result in social turmoil and sternly warned that the authorities must strike a balance between reform and stability. The article says: "Without stability, we have nothing, and without a stable social environment we can achieve nothing." The article says: The current reform effort signals that Beijing is abandoning the socialist planned economy that it has practised for the last 40 years and represents the deepest probe yet into the market economy, bringing with it "a redistribution of power and interests." The article stressed: "If enterprises pay wages or can only pay them by raising loans, then there is a problem in the distribution of interests, which, if handled improperly, may cause trouble." The article daringly touched on the "taboo" subject of the end of the "Deng Xiaoping Era." The article said that any problems in the process of transferring power from 89-year old Deng Xiaoping to leaders of a younger generation will plunge the world's most populous country into disaster.
