The Social Democratic Party [of Japan, SDPJ] (SDP) and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) issued separate statements on the eve of the 47th anniversary of the Constitution. The SDP, which quit the coalition last week to turn [as received] the No. 2 opposition party, said it wants to protest against what it called the "dangerous intentions" of the administration. "We are worried that some members of the Hata administration are supporting collective defense, forbidden under the Constitution, and supposing `emergencies' on the Korean peninsula, and that they have spoken with the intention of changing the Constitution in order to deal with the situation," the SDP said. The JCP said, "the new administration is trying to impose an extraordinary system and an emergency system on the people, on the pretext of `sanctions' against North Korea." "We take it seriously that some ministers have urged the government to change its current interpretation that resorting to collective defense is a violation of the Constitution," the JCP said. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai have expressed support for legislation to deal with emergencies including possible international sanctions against North Korea related to Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons development.
