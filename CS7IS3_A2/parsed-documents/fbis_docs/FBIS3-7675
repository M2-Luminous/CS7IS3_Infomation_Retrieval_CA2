Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said the reforms, which take effect today, feature both lower tariff rates for 417 items of goods under those categories and lesser tax rates to be applied to those goods. The average tax rate for those products has been reduced by half from 28 percent to only 14 percent and 39 different tax rates for those 417 items have been reduced to only six rates to make taxation easier. The reduction of the number of rates has been made through reclassifying those products according to their nature -- namely, finished products, semi-finished products and raw materials. The minister said total imports of the 417 items last year reached 120 billion baht or 11 percent of the country's total imports. The reforms would deprive the Government of 6.4 billion baht in tax collection a year, he said, adding that this would be compensated by benefits to local industries in the long run. Export-oriented industries in particular would benefit from the scheme as their production costs would become more competitive in the international market while other producers in the country would have to improve efficiency to compete with cheaper imports. The details of the rate adjustments are as follows: -- Imports of 78 items of electronic goods including capacitors, resistors, diodes and transistors will be subject to a new tax rate of 1 percent against 0-35 percent in the past. -- Imports of 37 items of machinery such as movie cameras, machinery used together with boilers, and construction machinery, engines, fans, air and oil filters for automobiles, and high voltage regulators will be subject to a new rate of 5 percent instead of 5-40 percent. -- Imports of 94 items of semi-finished products including ball bearings, electric motors, switches, fuses, plugs and relays, cathode tubes, optic fibre and cable and camera lenses will be subject to a new rate of 10 percent instead of 1-35 percent. -- Imports of 208 items of finished products such as copying machines, cash dispensers, coin sorting machines, hair dryers, telephone sets, light bulbs, batteries, movie projectors, slide projectors, camera flashes, vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens, microphones, loudspeakers, tape and video tape (recorded) and disc players will be subject to a new tax rate of 20 and 30 percent instead of 0-60 percent.
