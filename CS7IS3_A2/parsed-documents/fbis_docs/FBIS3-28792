The Finance Ministry unveiled earlier Thursday a tightened 73.08 trillion yen draft budget for the year beginning April 1, projecting a mere 1.0 percent growth but virtually shrinking from the initial fiscal 1993 budget. The ministry seeks to complete a government budget bill by next Tuesday following the negotiations. The officials said the negotiations will focus on public works spending, for which 100 billion was reserved for possible reinstatement. A total of 200 billion yen was set aside for restoration in the whole budget. The talks will also center on the defense and official development assistance (ODA) budgets, the officials said. The proposed defense budget was up a scant 0.8 percent to mark the lowest growth in 34 years, while the ODA budget was up 4.0 percent, the lowest increase on record.
