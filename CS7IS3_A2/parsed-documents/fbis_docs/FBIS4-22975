Results are submitted of solving problems of control of combat operations of the system of guiding antimissile missiles [AMM] toward targets and evaluation of firing effectiveness are discussed. There is a brief description of the qualities of solutions, which were obtained from the results of full-scale tests. Introduction. Problems of control and effectiveness of PRO systems were further developed in connection with establishment of the PRO system in Moscow. It conformed to the increased requirements of the system due to refinement of an enemy's attack equipment. Development of this system and of its experimental firing range prototype (Aldan system) was ordered by decree of the USSR government in 1960, and subsequent updating of the system was done in accordance with decrees adopted in 1963, 1971 and 1975. By that time, the team of developers of of the PRO system left the KB-1 [design office] and formed the Vympel experimental design office enterprise, subsequently renamed the Research Institute of Radio-Instrument Building. The system was developed with the same cooperation as system A, under the supervision of general designer G. V. Kisunko, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and at the updating stage, under the supervision of chief designer I. D. Omelchenko. The chief complex of the system (incomplete complement of firing complexes) with the A-350Zh AMM was approved for experimental operation on the basis of the results of testing the first stage, and the updated system A-35M with A-350R AMM was received to arm the Soviet Army on the basis of the results of the second stage. 1. Composition and structure of system. At the first designing stage, the system was built on the same principles as experimental system A. A range finder method was used to determine the coordinates of ballistic targets and AMM, that provided remote-controlled high guidance precision. In this regard, it was planned to use a relatively low-power nuclear warhead to destruct target heads. The purpose of the system was to intercept ballistic missiles equipped with solid heads (paired targets). As established in the course of designing them, the feasibility of enhancing appreciably the destructive action of nuclear warheads, virtually without increasing their weight and dimensions and, consequently, without changing the appearance and characteristics of the designed A-350Zh AMM, made it possible to turn to a simple single-station method of determining target and AMM coordinates at the second stage of designing. This increased appreciably the channel features of the system with the same amount of information equipment, while the diminished guidance precision was compensated by the destructive action of the more powerful nuclear warhead. The new PRO equipment that was developed and built conformed to the increased requirements of the zone of target interception according to its top and distant boundaries and higher characteristics of ballistic targets. The system included the following: main computer command center of the system consisting of the main command post and 5E92-B computer complex; radar center of early warning stations, Dunay-3; eight firing complexes each part of the command post of the complex, one radar for the target, two for AMM radar, two firing positions with ground-based launchers; A-350Zh AMM; system for transmitting data. The developed system was subsequently updated and improved. At the first stage of modernization, conditions for organizing interception of several ballistic missiles attaacking a defended object simultaneously by the AMM detail were substantially improved. Development of strategic offense capabilities (development of separating warheads and equipment to overcome PRO) put a new task to PRO: to assure interception of complex ballistic targets. As a result, in 1975-1977 an updated system was developed aimed at assuring destruction of single complex ballistic targets, which consisted of a solid or separating warhead, and means of overcoming PRO. The task was accomplished mainly by combining with algorithms the channels for measuring target coordinates into a single information system and developing a new algorithm for centralized control of combat operations. Concurrently, there was expansion of the range of early warning by adding to the system two new radar stations for early warning of targets. Subsequent refinement of the A-35M system was aimed at providing for interception of ballistic missiles attacking Moscow, in the broader sector of responsibility with use of radar plots from the SPRN [missile attack warning system], as well as interception of targets of the Pershing-2 type. 2. Control of system A-35 combat operations. A new technical problem that developers encountered was the problem of organizing the system's combat operations in the course of using AMM with special firing equipment to strike at several ballistic missiles in the case of a dense raid by a group of them. The consequences of a nuclear explosion could blind the radar resources on the one hand and, mutual destruction of AMM, on the other. The question arose of organizing ballistic missile strikes in such a way as to minimize the negative effect of nuclear explosions on operation of the system's equipment. This task was resolved by an algorithm for target distribution, as part of the general combat algorithm for centralized system control, which consisted of a set of problems of organizing combat operations of equipment and the system as a whole, aimed at achieving the highest effectiveness. The main purpose of the algorithm for organization of combat operations was to assign firing channels for the targets with provisions of conditions for intercepting them, under which the probability of destructing each target earmarked for interception would be close to maximum. Provisions for organized interception of targets by means of orderly assignment of points of impact of AMM and targets also took into consideration the time of possible ``blinding'' of radar equipment. An original method of interception was developed to organize interception of ``compact'' groups of ballistic missiles, which rendered the final stage of interception independent of ground-based equipment and thus more resistant to external interference from the nuclear explosion. The task of organizing combat operations of the system, which is related to the need to search through a large number of combinations, was formalized as a mathematical programming problem, and it was solved in the system using the ``Hungarian method,'' so that it could conform to the available performance of computer resources of the main computer control center. 3. Anti-missile missile guidance system. The main requirement of the guidance system was precision, which was determined as a result of predesign integration of the obtained precision of radar measurement of target and AMM coordinates with dimensions of the strike region of nuclear warheads with the required high firing effectiveness. The other requirements of the guidance system were governed by the chief goal, and aimed at having it function normally in real combat use of firing complexes. The most important of these, which were new as compared to requirements imposed on system A, were: need to use AMM in the guidance system that had considerably greater strike distances and altitudes than the V-1000, including ranges beyond the atmosphere; the need for simultaneous guidance of a large number of AMM toward the firing units of complex ballistic targets with the time of impact with targets preset in the course of preparation of the firing cycle; feasibility of re-aiming the AMM while in flight. The use of long-range AMM was motivated by the desire to move firing positions beyond the limits of a defended object of great length, and use of high strike altitudes is needed for the safety of the defended object against the harmful factors of explosions of the firing unit nuclear warheads of targets and our own AMM. A preset time of impact between the AMM and targets of a given raid is needed because of the above-mentioned method of intercepting compact ballistic missile groups, and it is required to assure stable interception. Feasibility of re-aiming the AMM in flight is necessary due to the dynamics of identifying firing units of ballistic missiles in the presence of false targets. These requirements put basically new scientific-engineering tasks to the guidance system, which had no analogs in previously developed systems for control of different classes of interceptors -- use in the guidance system of the principle of jet control of AMM and development of a means of controlling its longitudinal movement. Use of firing equipment in this system that was considerably more effective than in system A made it possible to obtain contact of AMM with targets on a head-on or intersecting course and thereby have a rather large interception zone. Under such conditions, it became desirable to guide the AMM toward a predicted point of impact, calculated on the basis of predicted trajectories of the target and AMM. It first became possible to apply this method because of existence of a control computer in the ground-based part of the guidance system. A ballistic trajectory, being energetically the most advantageous, was chosen as the kinematic AMM trajectory traversing the predicted point of impact. Processing of current data about the target and AMM was carried out on the basis of Kalman's filtration theory. Forecasting the trajectory of a ballistic target was made as it was in system A. To estimate parameters of AMM motion a new method was developed, which is based on including in the guidance algorithm of a model of controlled AMM motion that responds to the same control commands as an actual AMM. The information obtained with the model about the regular (expected) motion of AMM, in particular about the vector of its acceleration, was taken into consideration along with information about its true (observed) motion. This permitted data processing with a lower-order filter and thereby reducing the filtration error component due to fluctuations of the signal at the filter input. The wide range of parameters of target trajectories as related to the AMM launch point, with the long range of its flight and the chosen guidance method increased appreciably the range of AMM approach aspects to the target, as compared to the range of system A. Under such conditions, in developing principles for AMM control, it became desirable to reject the use of a fixed plane of AMM roll stabilization, as well as control on the principle of plane turns. Instead, a new three-command method of AMM control was developed, that permitted orientation of the vector of control acceleration in any direction, i.e., a complete sphere. Joint work with the staff of the KB-1 SKB-36 [special design office] (now called the Almaz Central Design Office) resulted in development of principles for forming the AMM stabilization circuit and choice of autopilot structure and parameters consistent with this method of control. Since this control method was based on controlling the AMM in relation to three (rather than two, as it was in conventional GAAM [guided antiaircraft missiles] linked axes, a master gyroscope was chosen as the main sensitive unit in the AMM. The angles measured by this gyroscope were used at the first autonomous stage of flight and during flight of the second stage AMM in rarefied layers of the atmosphere in order to monitor responses to control commands. In addition, these data from the master gyroscope were used throughout the flight of the AMM to control its angle of roll. Linear acceleration sensors were used as sensitive elements to control response to AMM control commands during flight in dense layers of the atmosphere. To reduce AMM oscillation about the center of gravity, feedback was used, as it is ordinarily, in the circuit for AMM stabilization upon signals of damping gyroscopes. An algorithm for generation of control commands programmed into the computer of the main computer control center, which conformed to the three-command control method and chosen autopilot system, was obtained on the basis of methods developed in optimum control theory and refined on technological and complex mathematical models. In order to execute the concept of interception adopted and described above, it was necessary to solve a problem that was new for this class of systems: assure arrival of the AMM to the point of impact with the target within the time set in a given firing cycle, which led to development of a special circuit to regulate thrust of the second stage AMM engine. Since thrust at the boost and throttling stages could not be changed by design in the A-350Zh AMM, it was the moments of change from these engine modes that were regulated. The method and corresponding algorithm to control longitudinal AMM movement were based on juxtaposition of the estimated predicted path that could be traveled by an AMM with this profile of engine thrust in the time remaining before impact, to the nominal path which is the distance between the AMM and estimated point of impact with the target. In the event of discrepancy between these parameters, the previously estimated times of switching engine running modes were corrected in the required direction. The choice of parameters of this algorithm, which was programmed in the computer of the main computer control center, was made analytically with subsequent refinement on a mathemtical model of the system of AMM guidance. Altogether, the different algorithms, the principles of design of which have been discussed above, were mutually integrated with the special control algorithm and made up the general combat algorithm for AMM control, which is one of the most important and large parts of the general combat algorithm of the system. There was further development of ideas and principles, which had been advanced and applied in developing the guidance system for V-1000 AMM in system A, in the course of refinement and testing of the guidance system (as the aggregate of information resources, general combat algorithm of AMM control programmed in the computer of the main computer control center, and the anti-missile missile that carried radio equipment and an autopilot). The chief one was the use of a real-time mathematical model, which was executed on standard computers in the system of the main computer control center, as the principal tool for refining the guidance system. A set of software of system equipment simulators and characteristics of the ballistic target were used on one of the computers and the programmed algorithm for AMM control on another, in the standard execution. At a certain stage of system refinement, registration documents were prepared for the equipment simulators on the basis of results of full-scale testing of this equipment. Development of this model made it possible to use the experimental-theoretical method extensively in assessing the characteristics obtained in the AMM guidance system. Full-scale testing of the guidance system with AMM launches was carried out on the Aldan system firing range complex organized in the same place as the system A experimental complex. It was carried out in two stages: up to 1971 with the A-350Zh AMM, and after 1971 with the A-350Zh and A350R[.sup]2[/]. The methodology of full-scale guidance system tests was essentially the same as in testing guidance systems of the V-1000 AMM: testing conditions were increasingly complicated in stages: from launches of AMM in an open circuit by stepped control commands to launches of AMM in a closed circuit with real ballistic targets. At the final stage of system testing in 1976-1977, there were 7 AMM launches (2 of which were A-350R) with reference targets of the 8K63 and 8K65 types, including some with false targets, as well as 3 A-350Zh AMM launches with real type 8K63 ballistic targets. The results of trials of the A-35 system revealed that the AMM guidance system met the imposed requirements and specified operating conditions. 4. Firing equipment of AMM, control of its use, assessment of AMM firing effectiveness. All three problems mentioned in this heading were solved of necessity concurrently and in close relationship to problems of control of AMM and the system as a whole. However, in the course of development, it was necessary to solve some problems in the first approximation, rather than in full, with consideration of their link, as is the case when developing real systems that are complex. For the sake of convenience, we shall first discuss these problems separately in this article. The choice of type of firing equipment to arm AMM in the A-35 system was determined by the results of firing in the A system, which revealed that firing had relatively low effectiveness and the effects of fragmentation striking elements on the warheads of the AMM were ambiguous. To defend Moscow it was necessary to obtain warhead damage that would virtually preclude the standard action of a nuclear charge in the warhead, as well as premature action of the nuclear charge caused by AMM firing equipment over the entire zone of its use. The latter was needed to minimize the effects of nuclear explosions on system elements and the environment. Thus, even with the guidance precision that could be achieved by the three-range method, it was necessary to use a nuclear warhead on the AMM. This became doubly necessary with the change from the three-range method to the usual one for measurement of coordinates with radar (two angles and range). Use of nuclear warheads was also desirable because the effectiveness of modern nuclear warheads depends substantially less on their weight than does the effectiveness of fragmentation warheads, so that it was possible, as noted in Section 1, to leave the AMM payload virtually unchanged with change in precision of its guidance and detonation. Plans were made for full-scale experiments and for several years they were carried out, enabling us to obtain rather reliable data on effects of nuclear explosions on the AMM warheads, AMM and its instruments, on ground-based PRO equipment, on the environment, including space and the top layers of the atmosphere. It was found necessary to take these physical phenomena into consideration in designing equipment and the PRO system as a whole, and in a number of instances substantial additional work was required (see sections 1-3). Of course, substantially new approaches were also needed to the choice of judicious characteristics for the firing equipment, methods of controlling it and assessment of firing effectiveness. The first steps were developed of a new methodology for optimization of AMM firing equipment, which differed considerably from approaches inherent in the choice of ordinary firing equipment of GAAM. At this stage, in-depth work was done on different problems, and full synthesis of methods was achieved only with the design of the second generation PRO system of Moscow. We should include, among these important methodological problems, development of methods of assessing firing effectiveness of AMM with nuclear warheads targeting the warheads of ballistic missiles. Use was made of data from the above-mentioned experiments and more detailed studies of the physics of nuclear explosions on ballistic missile warheads, with consideration of the complex effect of nuclear explosions on warheads and design features of nuclear warheads, AMM and warheads, which required close interaction among developers of the different items and theoretical physicists. The results of their work were formalized in relevant manuals and methodological publications approved by supervisors of the work in different agencies, including the customer. The results of the physical studies and their processing made it possible to obtain ``laws of target strike.'' At that time, coordinate target strike laws were used, i.e., probability of target strike as a function of coordinates of point of AMM explosion relative to the target. These coordinate laws were arbitrary, i.e., they depended on impact conditions such as altitude of strike, angles of attack of AMM and warheads. Since the complete probability of striking the target W was described by a multidimensional integral, it was impossible to calculate it under real conditions. Analytical methods were developed to calculate W for a number of simplified cases; however, statistical simulation modeling on a computer turned out to be the most accurate and convenient method. The results of calculating W were used at the first stage of designing the system in order to coordinate the characteristics of the destructive effect of possible variants of nuclear warheads of AMM with the requirements of precision of guidance system and AMM detonation. In developing algorithms for organizing combat operations, the results of more accurate design estimates of W, calculations of W were used to select optimum conditions for AMM impact with targets. Finally, calculations of W were used to carry out State testing of the system to assess overall effectiveness on complex system models. The results of developing methods of calculating W were generalized in research carried out by several civil and military institutes under the supervision of one of these authors. The method of command control of detonation, which was proposed and developed for system A, had to be enlarged and elaborated for system A-35. In the first place, in a combat system the conditions of AMM and target impact expanded considerably, and or this reason it was necessary to develop a universal method of optimum precision to detonate nuclear warheads of anti-missile missiles. In addition to conditions of impact in the case of a particular launch, this method also took into consideration statistical characteristics of processed coordinates of the target and AMM (different processing algorithms were used in the channels for AMM guidance and nuclear warhead detonation), presence of dynamic AMM guidance errors and some other factors. With this method, determination was made of optimum detonation time for effective firing. In the second place, as noted above (see Section 2), for the first time in design practice and development of interceptor missiles, engine cutoff was used in the A-350R AMM in order to hold to the preset time of impact. In the third place, in determining the time of transmission of the ``main command'' with information about detonation of a nuclear warhead, consideration was given to the special importance of this command, and it was relayed by algorithm in the intervals without noise related to nuclear explosions of AMM in both the environment and in the AMM BRA [expansion unknown]. For this purpose, predicted times of impact of all AMM with targets (i.e., estimated times of nuclear explosion of AMM) were input in the detonation algorithm of a given firing complex. Thus, it was necessary to use data on the level of the entire system for algorithmic protection of the channel for AMM detonation. All of the described problems tasks were performed by a combination of the algorithm for detonation of SBCh [expansion unknown, could be typo for nuclear warhead] with the algorithm for generating the command to cut off the power plant of the AMM. The combined programmed algorithm was checked on the firing complexes of the main computer control center system. The entire system of detonation of nuclear warheads and power plant cut-off was tested on the range in actual launches. System trials revealed the high effectiveness and reliability of command detonation of nuclear warheads under conditions of actions simulated with algorithms of multiple nuclear explosions of AMM. 5. Designs for Taran and Avrora PRO systems. These systems have not been built, so that we shall mention here only the basic distinctive features in their design. At the first stage of development of system A-35 (in 1963), the well-known ballistic missile designer, Academician V. N. Chelomey suggested that the UR-100 ballistic missile be used for PRO purposes. It was proposed to launch the UR-100 toward points of impact with an enemy's ballistic missile far from the defended territory and to destruct them by nuclear explosions of the warheads of UR-100, in response to reports from the missile attack warning system. N. S. Khrushchev liked this idea very much because in building up the arsenal of ballistic missiles we were also developing PRO. The inconsistency of this idea was apparent to specialists in PRO and missile attack warning systems who participated in its discussion; however, development of the Taran system, as V. N. Chelomey called it, stopped only after N. S. Khrushchev's retirement. At approximately the same time, the design for the territorial Aurora system was being developed under the supervision of G. V. Kisunko. The design proposed several interesting solutions concerning radar (radar stations with phased array), rockets (A-351 AMM with a wide range of combat altitudes, A-900 long-range antimissile missile), variable power nuclear warheads for different combat altitudes, and others. However, the main flaw of this design was that it did not take into full consideration all the problems arising at a PRO if an enemy would use modern equipment to overcome PRO. For this reason, the commission that reviewed the preliminary design of the Avrora project did not recommend continued development of its experimental design. Footnotes 1. Continuation.
