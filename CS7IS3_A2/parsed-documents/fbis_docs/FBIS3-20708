This is his promise. However, can this promise be kept by the person who was, up to now, the chief of government propaganda? [Priesz] Mr. Dumitru Popa, you are in a very "hot" seat. Do you consider yourselves appointed by an interim statute or a permanent one? [Popa] I consider it to be a provisional position in which the evolution of the law places me. When the law on the organization and operation of the TVR company appears, the election of the director general and of other persons in the leadership will be organized in accordance with the law. My situation, and, if you will, my luck, is that I am in a temporary situation. I could measure my efforts and escape "with my life" from this very difficult, but not unbearable, position. [Priesz] What was the official mandate with which the prime minister invested you? [Popa] The decision of the prime minister specifies a mandate which lasts until the publication and application of the law. [Priesz] After that date, would you be willing to remain director general of TVR? [Popa] I took the position for this period, with a contented conscience. I believe that the interim period will probably last a month or two. I hope that Parliament will hurry to adopt the law. I do not think that I will continue.... Each person has his chance. A person's chances do not depend only on hierarchies but also on an interior life, on cultural and moral options. [Preisz] What, do you think, are your special traits which caused you to be preferred by the prime minister at the present time? [Popa] It is hard for me to talk about myself. I believe that I have a special trait. It could be balance. I am not a political employee; I am not a member of any political party. Thus, I have to say that I would like TVR to be an apolitical and credible public service. But these issues of content take shape with great difficulty. [Priesz] Did you ever work in the audiovisual field? [Popa] Not directly.... [Priesz] Don't you think this is an obstacle to understanding the operations of this institution? [Popa] In the Faculty of Journalism, we had laboratories dealing with this field. I am sure that this medium is not absolutely foreign to me, but I cannot say that I would be able to give precise, concrete technical guidance to my colleagues here. Probably I would not be able to.... [Preisz] What do you think about the fact that you were appointed from outside TVR? [Popa] Outside TVR, but I am lucky that I am not from outside the press.... If you note carefully, very rarely is anyone from the press appointed to the job. I would like to say something in all honesty. I believe in the professionalism of the people in TVR and in my own professionalism, in general. My work principle will be not to do alone what I cannot resolve alone. Therefore, I have to have some support, an adviser, an exchange of thoughts and ideas on what we should present to the public. Professional discussion in TVR will become a work method. When we have any doubts, we will consult at least two or three people. This seems to me to be normal and natural. [Priesz] The board of directors of TVR, in its present form, was critcized, along with the way in which Mr. Everac ran it. What is your relationship to him, in this context? [Popa] In all honesty, I must tell you that -- at this time -- I do not have a full response. So far, I have met with the members of the Board of Directors. I already knew quite a few of them. The meeting was absolutely normal. This week I will delve more deeply into matters and will see what the situation is. So far, I have not seen anything which indicates disfunctionality or disharmony on the Board. It seems to me that, up to now, what you said was true.... I do not have complete information yet but that moment, the moment of the resignations, was a moment like so many others. However, I have confidence in the TVR people, in their choices and comments, in all the areas of activity of TVR. It will be natural for me to delve into the problems and to receive all the comments. Do not expect me to make television in my image and likeness, to conform to my views. [Preisz] What is the status of resignations from the Board? [Popa] I cannot give you a precise answer. I do not know exactly what has happened or who has reconsidered his signature. I will be concerned about this, if necessary. But, I believe that it is a matter of something in the past... [Priesz] You were a professor at Stefan Gheorghiu Academy. Are you marked by this period? [Popa] Up to now, I have not spoken publicly about what is called the period as "professor at Stefan Gheorghiu". I do not want to exonerate myself, in any way. Of course, we cannot compare the situation in the Faculty of Journalism to that in other faculties. However, there were some aspects of conditioning. The most important was that there were some students who were recruited in advance by the publications and who received a scholarship. [Preisz] Mr. Popa, don't forget the essential criterion! -- that of unconditional subservience to the ruling elite of the Romanian Communist Party! [Popa] The most rigorous political criteria were introduced... More rigorous than those in the faculties of law or philosophy. We had students who were simple members of the Union of Communist Youth or party members. There was no problem. Of course, at a given moment, a certain type of candidate was in the majority. At least formally, it was a state faculty.... [Preisz] Recently, as head of the Government's Department of Information, you learned about the "documentary" of the evening of 30 December? In your official capacity in the Department, should or shouldn't you have learned about the intention to produce and show such a film which members of the executive organ subsequently officially withdrew? [Popa] I don't know anything about the 30 December documentary. Indeed, the prime minister could never have known about the existence of the images, about the possibility of producing this documentary and its possible showing. There was no official order from the government to make such a documentary. Heaven forbid! It was said and it was explained that, in fact, the Government Studio had the contribution since it was made there. On the other hand, it was not necessary for me to know about the existence of this documentary... [Preisz] As director general of Romanian Television, have you been asked to show the entire film on the execution of Marshal Antonescu? [Popa] Currently, I do not know of any intention to show this documentary. I believe that such documentaries, with such an importance and such effects in history, should be seen by everybody. The problem is the need to put them in the given historic context and not to charge them with political burdens and tasks. As for the 30 December documentary, I think that, from what I have seen of it, it has a polemical character. [Preisz] Mr. Popa, the leadership of TVR is accused of censorship -- by Mr. George Borcescu, producer of broadcasts in the Social Editorial Staff of TVR -- for failing to show the film "Punct de ruptura" [Breaking Point]. Exactly what is the background of the last-minute withdrawal of this material? [Popa] It is a simple problem and it should be treated this way. I know that ROMANIA LIBERA is a newspaper which is somewhat provocative but there was no intention to stop the showing of this film. On Wednesday evening, President Iliescu met with the leaders of the Romanian Democratic Convention [CDR]. This moment put relations, political consultations, and constructive attitudes in a different light. It was considered that a "Special Edition," dealing with the consultations at Cotroceni, was absolutely necessary to mark this moment. [Preisz] But why was the "marking" of this moment done in the time period set for a film produced by one of the "inconvenient" producers of TVR? [Popa] I believe that, in the given context, such a documentary would have produced unexpected effects and, perhaps, disservices to the parties carrying on the dialog at Cotroceni. I did not see this documentary but, if the description in ROMANIA LIBERA is accurate, we can even speak about disservices which the CDR, itself, might have brought about. However, things have to be analyzed with lucidity. You can imagine how difficult it is to present a broadcast in which the political stake does not determine the commentary and the editing.... This is the most difficult thing which I am proposing: Romanian Television will become apolitical. Returning to the documentary, the things written in the article about Dionisie Sincan are true. But I do not think that Mr. Sincan deserves treatment from the censor since the issue should be treated simply as a professional one. We discussed the opportuneness of showing the film at this time and not the prohibition on showing it on the television station. It is possible that it will continue to be shown. The discussion was not about prohibition or censorship but about timeliness. These things happen and they are discussed in every institution of the mass media.
