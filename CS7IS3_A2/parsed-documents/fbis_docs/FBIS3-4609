The article points out that the president's remarks will inevitably result in the adjustment of the repeated three conditions in resolving the nuclear issue: First, the retreat from the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty; Second, acceptance of International Atomic Energy Agency inspections; and Third, agreement on mutual inspections between the South and the North. The article goes on to say that the related government departments are embarrassed by the president's remarks deeming them as "spontaneous" rather than well studied and planned in advance. The author of the article points out that although Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for security affairs, tried to extensively explain that this does not run counter to the government's past North Korean policy, his effort only highlights the difference between the president's past and present remarks regarding the nuclear issue and summit talks. Recalling President Kim's remarks made at the 100-day news conference on 3 June, 1993 when he said "We cannot shake hands with someone who possesses nuclear arms" and in his inauguration speech on 25 February, 1993 when he said "I could meet with Kim Il-song anytime, anywhere" the reporter notes that it could be said that there have been temporary changes in policy but that the president's philosophy of the national issue remains unchanged. However, he adds, what embarrassed officials in charge of North Korean affairs was that the remarks were made at a sensitive time when the North Korea-U.S. contacts in New York were ongoing. The article asserts that the president's remarks caused suspicion over the consistency of the government policy on North Korea and may affect North Korea's strategy on contacts with the United States. The article notes that the concern over the consistency of the president's North Korean policy is also based on the president's contradicting remarks made on two occasions at the Asia Pacific Economic Council on 24 February and during the 26 June interview with the BBC. The article says that in the former, Kim Yong-sam said "the North Korean issue should be resolved in the view of partnership for the prosperity of Asia Pacific," and in the latter, he said "the ROK is fully prepared for the potential of military conflict." The author of the article explains that some believe that President Kim's frequent change of position is for "domestic use" but it will be difficult for the working-level officials to establish consistent policy if the supreme leader is shaken. Finally, the article states that as far as the North Korean policy is concerned, the president should have a firm philosophy regardless of the public opinion and have frequent conversations with the senior presidential secretary for foreign and security affairs and reunification-related ministers so that they can properly assist the president.
