FBIS4-5131 "dreas067_j_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-067 Daily Report 26 Mar 1994 Indonesia Locally Made Aircraft Delivered to Air Force Locally Made Aircraft Delivered to Air Force BK0604130494 Jakarta REPUBLIKA in Indonesian 26 Mar 94 p 3 BK0604130494 Jakarta REPUBLIKA Indonesian BFN [Text] Bandung, REPUBLIKA -- The Nusantara Aircraft Industry Company Limited [PT IPTN] has handed over another CN-235 aircraft to the Indonesian Air Force. The CN-235 aircraft manufactured by PT IPTN was the fourth of the six aircraft ordered by the Department of Defense and Security of the Republic of Indonesia as part of a contract for the realization of its third strategic plan. A simple transfer ceremony was held at a hangar of the PT IPTN Production Area II in Bandung on Friday (25 March). The transfer documents were signed by Ir. [academic title] Hari Laksono representing the president director of PT IPTN and Major General I Made Sadha A.R., master of economics, director general for services of the Department of Defense and Security, who represented the commander of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia [ABRI]. The Department of Defense and Security will later hand over the aircraft to the Indonesian Air Force. The documents were also signed by Commodore Sugiarto, deputy chief of the Air Force for personnel affairs. The transfer is part of the contract for the realization of the third strategic plan, which was signed by the minister of state for research and technology and concurrently president director of PT IPTN and the minister of defense and security in Jakarta in March 1988. The contract covers the purchase by the Department of Defense and Security of six CN-235 aircraft from PT IPTN -- two units used to transport paratroopers, two units of the low altitude parachute extraction system or LAPES type, and two units used for medical evacuation or medevac. The two paratrooper units were handed over by PT IPTN to the Department of Defense and Security in January 1993. One LAPES-typed unit was handed over to the department in December 1993. With the transfer of the other LAPES-typed unit on Friday (25 March), only two medevac-typed units which are undergoing finishing touches are yet to be handed over to the department. The two remaining units are scheduled to be personally handed over by Prof. Dr. B.J. Habibie, president director of PT IPTN, to Armed Forces Commander General Feisal Tanjung in June 1994. The aircraft, which have been handed over to the department, are specifically designed for ABRI operations. The Indonesian Air Force can rely on the capability and agility of the aircraft to carry out its major duties. For example, a paratrooper unit is superior because it can simultaneously transport military personnel and drop them in a designated terrain.
