This is contained in a statement issued today by the Serbian Citizens' Council. At their assembly held on 27 March of this year, citizens of Serbian nationality and Serbian ethnic origin again sent a clear message to the international community, explaining that the theory of the impossibility of coexistence in fact conceals the aggressor's aspirations to occupy territory and expel Bosniak Muslims from their homes. For this reason we demand from all those responsible international subjects that can influence the course of solving the bloody Bosnia-Herzegovina drama to prevent further expulsions of Muslims and Croats from their homes, and to create the conditions for a speedy return of refugees and displaced people. This, in our view, is the precondition for peace in this region, reads the statement by the Serbian Citizens' Council.
