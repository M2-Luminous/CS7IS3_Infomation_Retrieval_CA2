According to Radio Velkaton in Velika Kladusa, the capital of the province, the heaviest fighting was reported in the Liskovac region and the forces of the autonomous province tried to prevent Izetbegovic's forces from penetrating their defense lines. The same source says that Izetbegovic forces continued with heavy shelling of Pecigrad. Muslims in the western part of the former republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina declared their autonomy last September standing up against the war-mongering policy of Izetbegovic and disassociating themselves from the decisions of the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo. Since then, Western Bosnia-Herzegovina has been the scene of fierce intra-Muslim clashes, where Izetbegovic has sent his troops against his countrymen instructing them to stifle the new autonomy `with all available means'.
