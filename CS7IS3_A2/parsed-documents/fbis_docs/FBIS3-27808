Umyong in Seoul. Because of war exercise commotions, residents in Socho-ku and Kwanak-ku in Seoul, and in Kwachon City, were terror-stricken all day. On 21 January, troops from the puppet Capital Defense Command also staged a war exercise by blindly firing rifles in areas around Socho-ku, Seoul, thus arousing a protest from the residents. The war exercise commotions staged every day by the South Korean puppet clique, which is advertising itself as a civilian government, outdistances the war frenzy of successive military fascist dictators. Such commotions are part of desperate maneuvers designed to divert the attention of the people, who are filled with complaints against the incumbent regime. The South Korean people will never tolerate the maneuvers of the civilian warmongers who are attempting to evade the crisis in their rule by war exercise commotions.
