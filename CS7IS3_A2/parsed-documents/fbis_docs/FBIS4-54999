FBIS4-54999 "dreeu089_i_94010" FBIS-EEU-94-089 Daily Report 7 May 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Krajisnik Says Attack on Brcko Would Start War Krajisnik Says Attack on Brcko Would Start War LD0705155694 Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service in Serbo-Croatian 1450 GMT 7 May 94 LD0705155694 Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] Novi Sad, 7 May (TANJUG) -- We will accept no compromise on Brcko under any conditions and any pressures, because the corridor in that area "is the main artery in the blood system of the entire Serb nation," Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the republic of Srpska assembly, said in an interview for tomorrow's issue of DNEVNIK of Novi Sad. "An attack by Muslim-Croat armed forces on the corridor in the Brcko area would be the end of all peace initiatives and war would break out with all ferocity and with unforeseeable consequences," Krajisnik said. He stressed that the conflict in the Brcko area could be effectively prevented by reaching a global peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and certainly not by proclaiming Brcko a safe area. "For days, efforts have been made to make the whole of the world public believe the disgusting lies broadcast by West European and U.S. media that Brcko is allegedly a Muslim town, and that the Serb army is allegedly preparing an attack on Brcko. All this is aimed at proclaiming Brcko a safe area so that the Security Council can insist on the demilitarization of Brcko under the threat of violence," Krajisnik stressed. "We must warn the world public that Brcko is in Serbian hands because it has a Serb, and not a slim, majority. That is why the Serbian side will at no cost allow its units in the Brcko area to be disarmed because, by doing this, they would allow the noose prepared by Western strategists to be put around their neck. This would cut the corridor for both Krajinas [in western Bosnia and in Croatia], that is for the republic of Serb Krajina and the republic of Srpska, or more precisely, its western part -- the Banja Luka Krajina," the president of the republic of Srpska assembly stressed. Krajisnik recalled that a session of the republic of Srpska assembly will be held in Brcko on 10 May, in order to "prove to the whole world that Brcko is a Serbian town and that it will remain Serb."
