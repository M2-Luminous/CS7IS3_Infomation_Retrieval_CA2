This requirement results from both the changes that have taken place in the area of the former USSR and the changes in our relations with the Russian Federation. The main subject of the policy that has been carried out so far was the rapid establishment of equal relations with the 15 newly independent states. The activity of Poland focused on: --establishing diplomatic and treaty relations with them; --creating foundations for regular political dialogue by establishing contacts at various levels; --taking steps aimed at the withdrawal of former Soviet troops from Poland; --concluding economic agreements; --fostering processes of democratization and the building of a market economy; --explaining the responsibility of the repression apparatus of the former USSR for crimes committed against Poles, and for deportations; --protecting the sites of the martyrdom of Poles and monuments of Polish culture. We have made considerable progress in these areas by creating the foundations for an East policy of the fully sovereign Republic of Poland. The tasks of the East policy. We are currently facing new challenges and new possibilities. To measure up to them, we must focus our East policy on the following three tasks: First, we seek to develop comprehensive and good relations with those states which are of particular importance from the point of view of our political interests, as well as the interests of security and economy. The necessity of making a choice here also results from the fact that we have only limited resources at our disposal. For obvious reasons, priorities include, first of all, the neighboring states; the entire group of states, in which we are particularly interested, consists of the following: Russia, Belarus, the Baltic states, Kazakhstan, and Moldova. Russia and Ukraine occupy a special place due to their economic potential, as well as their political and military significance: the development of our relations with these states will spell either the success or failure of our policy. The second task is backing up political and military stability in the region. Since the threats are of a regional character, that is, they do not pertain exclusively to Poland, our policy should be as synchronized as is possible with the policies of our western, northern, and southern neighbors. As much as possible, Poland should be the initiator and an active participant in joint activities; it should take on the role of a regional "stability exporter." It is authorized and obliged to do this by the maturity--outstanding in the region--of democratic establishments, economic dynamism, and respect for civil rights. Third, we aim to create new possibilities for taking advantage of economic opportunities. This task must be approached realistically, which means that we must see that the changes which are taking place in the area of the former USSR are resulting in new possibilities and opportunities for Poland; however, dangers are still prevalent today. In addition, if we want to be able to take advantage of the chances to make a profit in the future, we must take certain steps and pay some costs today. Bilateral Political Relations Poland treats all of its neighbors to the east, as well as other countries, as fully independent and sovereign states. It is in our vital interest to see them strengthen their national identity as well as their democratic and promarket transformations. This does not mean, however, that we will be against any close relations among those states, unless their establishment is accompanied by violence, dictate, or the violation of democratic procedures, we treat them as natural processes which are in accordance with the international legal order. We want a substantially warmer climate in our relations with Russia. We will intensify and extend the scope of diplomatic consultations in bilateral and international issues, including those concerning security and disarmament. We are ready for intense contacts at the level of governments and parliaments; we will also create possibilities for frequent regular extragovernmental contacts. We seek to broaden the scope of the exchange of information and experience, especially in the area of local democracy and individual agriculture. We intend to propose a joint international initiative which will aim at coordinating the fight against organized crime. In the international arena, we would like to be of assistance in regulating the status of Russian minorities in line with European standards. We will support the membership of Russia, as well as other states of the former USSR, in the Council of Europe after they accept the formal conditions. We hope that the Russian Federation will participate in the "Partnership for Peace" initiative. This will enable us to intensify our dialogue on military issues and to take the initiative in multilateral practice and training with the participation of Russia, the states of the region, and NATO members. The "lower" border of the policy of openness and friendliness in the relations with Russia is respect for the fundamental strategic option of Polish foreign policy, which is participation in three Western establishments: the European Union [EU], NATO, and the Western European Union [WEU]. In our relations with Ukraine we will take similar steps as in the case of Russia: steps aimed at extending the comprehensive neighborly cooperation. Their special dimension will be the establishment of Polish cultural agencies in Kiev and Lvov, as well as the building of milieus friendly to Poland around them. However, the fundamental issue in our political relations is obviously the issue of Ukraine's independence, which presents a strategic dimension for Poland. The recently concluded trilateral agreement among Ukraine, Russia, and the United States is favorable for the consolidation of this independence. On the one hand, we will encourage Ukraine to implement this agreement fully; we will also want more vigorous political and economic forms; on the other hand, we will take action to help this state achieve a deserved position in international politics, a position that would better correspond to its potential. In particular, we would like one of the agencies of the CSCE to be relocated to Kiev; we would like Ukraine to be included to the projects that are implemented within the framework of the Central European Initiative; we would also like dialogue on some elements of the Kravchuk plan [not further identified]. We also expect intensive military-political cooperation in the "Partnership for Peace" with Ukraine. We are especially alarmed by the statements concerning "particular interests" and a "special role" for Russia in Ukraine. We do not accept them and we believe deeply that Ukraine's independence is in the long run favorable for the development of democracy and economy in Russia as well. In our political relations with the Baltic states, a special position will be reserved for activities underscoring the independent existence of these states in the international arena and supporting the process of gradually including them in European structures. We expect that very soon the Polish-Lithuanian treaty will finally be concluded. It will provide foundations for a rapid development of comprehensive relations, especially in the area of economic ties. We will pay special attention to the issue of national minorities, including the issue of the Polish minority in Lithuania. It is worth recalling that Poland supports the idea of civil integration of ethnic minorities, where cultural and lingual autonomy would be maintained. We do not support political-economic autonomy, but we agree that the rights of minorities should be respected in line with the standards of CSCE and the EU. Any act violating these minimum standards will meet with our forceful response. Similarly, demands going beyond these standards will not receive our support or our friendly attitude. In the development of good-neighborly relations with Belarus, we want to place emphasis on long-term activities--first of all on economic and cultural activities. The example of the latter is the opening of a diplomatic mission in Minsk. In the case of Kazakhstan, diplomatic activities will be focused on creating a positive image of Poland as a friendly state. The main subject of the consular activities of the embassy, which is being set up there, is obviously the large Polish community. Finally, in the case of Moldova, where we are also opening a diplomatic post, our political cooperation will chiefly be of a multilateral dimension; our promising economic contacts will be extended. Activities for the Stability of the Region The most important task that helps enhance stability in the region is active contribution toward the building of all-European security. Good relations with our neighbors to the east are undoubtedly an important and joint contribution as well. Poland definitely supports the progressive process of combining East and West into one whole. This process, however, does not include and cannot include liquidating the forms of cooperation that have been present so far, departing from the fully shaped and freely implemented methods of cooperation, abandoning the ambition to take part in the ones which seem to be particularly close. This process does envision, however, the tightening of cooperation among states and establishments, as well as increasingly closer cooperation based on the principle of the indivisibility of European security. In this process, there is a role to be played by NATO, the EU, the WEU, the Council of Europe, and the CSCE. An important place should also be occupied by the CIS, if it opens up to cooperation with other structures and, just like them, it is based on democratic foundations and values. We all want an efficient, all-European security system. But it will not appear all of a sudden like some magical illusion. It will be the result of common efforts and of an evolution taking place in and among existing structures. We are watching attentively the changes that are under way. The establishment of NATO's North Atlantic Cooperation Council, as well as the establishment of the WEU Consultative Forum, "Partnership for Peace," and the prospect of widening these structures--these are very important steps. They are not about forming new divisions but about overcoming the old ones. Through our participation in the "Partnership for Peace" we not only strive for membership in NATO, but we also want to use this frameworks for cooperation with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania for the sake of a common strengthening of security. Intensifying regional dialogue on security issues is also desirable. Part of that dialogue is in the form of consultations, not just within the framework of European and Euro-Atlantic structures, but also within regional ones, such as the Visegrad Group or the Council of Baltic States. Possibilities are emerging for setting in motion a mechanism of regular, multilateral consultations with the participation of the states of East and Central Europe which are particularly sensitive to issues of regional security (such is the intention of, for example, the consultations among planners from eight countries of the region which are currently taking place, including, among others, representatives of Germany, Austria, and Sweden). We are very thoroughly examining initiatives and proposals relating to our region's security, including plans by Balladur and Krawczuk. Any constructive regional cooperation is a significant factor for strengthening security and stability. Cooperation among the Visegrad Group countries is an example of this kind of cooperation, in particular the free-trade zone (CEFTA) [Central European Free Trade Association]. That cooperation, while being a clear example of understanding and cooperation among countries going through a period of transformations, is an example for other countries to follow in terms of how to achieve European integration. Bilateral relations obviously contribute greatly to increasing regional security and cooperation. The partnership between Poland and Ukraine, which is still taking shape, provides good evidence of that. The two countries have a difficult history of mutual relations, but thanks to imagination and political will, they managed to overcome the rankling resentments and claims. Economic Cooperation Eastern markets are oftentimes portrayed as untapped, mainly because of a not very active foreign policy geared in only one direction. While agreeing with the accusation of insufficient activity, one should at the same time state very clearly, that a systematic analysis leads to a conclusion that what prevails in those markets today, is a risk of loss and not a possibility of profit. One should also very clearly state that the political and systemwide changes indeed created some big opportunities for significant and permanent benefits, but they cannot be implemented soon and without significant investments. One should also state very clearly that Polish enterprises, both private and state-owned, will not be able to use this potential without significant assistance from the state. The most important dangers linked to the systemwide transformations and to the uncertain future of the countries of the former Soviet Union, include: A possibility of using economic cooperation and commercial exchange for political goals; destabilization (intended or unintended) of supplies of raw materials; unfair competition in Poland and in third markets; systemwide incompatibility and instrumental treatment of the law; disorganization and mafia activity; and the destabilization of Polish financial institutions in case of over involvement in transactions with the East. Perceiving Poland as a country in an unstable region is also a special kind of danger. That danger is not linked with Poland's bilateral relations with the countries of the region, but it may be a consequence of political and economic instability in the individual countries, or of conflicts between them. On the other hand, the most important opportunities which have opened up at this time in front of Polish entrepreneurs, include: establishment of foundations for a significant and permanent capital-related position; achievement of a permanent position in certain merchandise markets; potentially large demand for transit services and for mediation in transactions between Eastern and Western companies; signing of contracts for significant supplies by state-owned partners; and, finally, the possibility of importing services, merchandise, and technologies at prices which are lower than on the world market. The "Fundamentals of Pro-Export Policies," which were recently adopted by the government, as well as the listing of financial resources for that goal in the draft budget for 1994, mean better possibilities of support by the state for Polish economic activity in the East. The forms and extent of that support are still too modest to efficiently enable use of opportunities and counteraction of dangers. That is why I intend to suggest to the government that it implement four programs which will comprise urgently needed measures. We named these programs: "Contact," "Associates," "Wokulski," and "Transit." "Contact" comprises measures supporting contact among people at all levels and in all aspects, among others making border crossings more efficient and enlarging them. "Associates" is a program of measures aimed at establishing mutual capital relations which would render economic cooperation more permanent. "Wokulski" is a program of measures which will support Polish exporters of merchandise and services. Finally, the "Transit" program covers measures aimed at improving and enlarging the infrastructure which would make it possible to profit from Poland's geographical location. A fifth program, which we would like to implement, is named "Market and Democracy" and it will cover both governmental and extragovernmental drafts supporting the development of market and democracy in the countries covered by East policies. Specific measures within these programs which have already been identified, will be subjected to interministry consultations followed by their presentation in front of the Council of Ministers. Their implementation does not require significant additional financial resources this year. Coordination of East Policies Most of the tasks being planned within the framework of East policies, will be performed by Polish diplomats. In particular, we will submit several international proposals over the next few months, such as an East European Commercial Initiative, a Consultative Committee for Democratic Transformations and Market Reforms, an Association for Prevention of Organized Crime, an international data bank on investment possibilities, a draft for a trilateral institute of Polish-Ukrainian-Belarusian culture, and the establishment of an informal forum for regular meetings among leaders and political elites of East and Central European countries. We will also undertake many bilateral initiatives. We are in the process of widening the network of our agencies in the East. With regard to diplomats, both in the headquarters and in their missions, we must prepare them better for the implementation of tasks envisaged by the programs. We must also coordinate our measures better and more efficiently, both within the Foreign Affairs Ministry and in the entire administration. With that goal in mind, I will establish in the near future the post of plenipotentiary for East policies within the Foreign Affairs Ministry; he will exercise supervision over subsequent work on the programs and their implementation. In terms of the state as a whole, to minimize the syndrome of "ministry policies," which is unfortunately so common in Poland, I will propose before the government the establishment of an East Policy Council, the goal of which would be: Consultation of proposals for resolving specific issues, exercise of operative supervision over the implementation of initiatives and programs, and consultation on ways of financing programs while using the resources which are spread over various institutions. Apart from the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the council should also include representatives of the President's Office, the Office of the Council of Ministers, the Foreign Economic Cooperation Ministry, and other institutions. Danger I think that Poland's activity vis-a-vis its Eastern neighbors defined and organized this way, will serve the interests of Poland, its neighbors, and the entire region well and efficiently. We want to implement the activity with enthusiasm and openness. But for the policy to bring about the desired results, we must encounter a similar enthusiasm and openness on the part of our partners. We have no reason to doubt their good intentions; we can feel they have a lot of cordiality and a will to undertake joint measures. We all feel that, as my Russian colleague Minister Andrey Kozyrev said on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of Poland's independence , right now we have an "historic chance to build genuinely friendly relations, without anybody dictating, without paternalism, without ideological patterns and false embraces." Nations which differ between them and which respect the differences, are still friendly toward one another; if there were no differences between them, then they would merge into just one nation, and if they did not respect the differences, then they would be enemies. Poles differ from their neighbors. Our neighbors differ among themselves. We can see those differences, we respect and appreciate them. Our culture and identity have used them for ages. We are ready to become friends. This idea could be endangered by an intolerance by one of the countries. We can see signs of such intolerance in Russia. We are afraid of intolerance. Right now, it is the biggest danger to the development of friendly ties in our region. The Russian Federation is today a superpower going through transformations which is not capable of completely meeting or efficiently protecting some global ambitions which had been aroused in the past. That facilitates the emergence of the "besieged fortress" syndrome, which is a result of the reluctance of part of the political and military elites to change traditional ways of thinking and acting, the reference point of which is Russia as an empire. Consequently, the concept of a strong superpower, which Russia is and will be, becomes synonymous with the idea of neoimperialism. That is why the neoimperial direction in Russian foreign policy must be regarded as a real danger. On the other hand, one would have to have bad faith not to see the positive changes in Russia and the progress in that country's hard but consistent path toward democracy, a market, and the people's prosperity. We believe that, just like other nations, Russians are aware that building a power and an empire has high costs, and that it is taking place at the expense of their personal poverty. They will not allow for politicians to return permanently to past goals and slogans. They demonstrated that during the most recent elections, in which only a minority expressed support for the imperial slogans of nationalistic groups. It is that minority that we fear. But we are optimistic. We believe in the majority: Our Russian friends, Russian democrats.
