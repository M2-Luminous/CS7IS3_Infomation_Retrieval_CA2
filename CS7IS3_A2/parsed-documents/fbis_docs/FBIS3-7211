In Vietnam today, we have just developed a commodity economy and so the production forces have low standards and development is not balanced. But the ownership model has certain special characteristics: a. The capital concentrated in the hands of the state in the form of state-owned enterprises [Footnote 1] is dispersed among the sectors and regions. In reality, this is divided among the sectors and regions. b. Ownership rights to the assets at the state-owned enterprises are not clear. c. The asset ownership rights of the state and the commercial rights of the enterprises have been merged. Because of this, the ownership model has been made single too soon, and it is not in accord with a commodity economy or the standards of the production forces, with the result that the state enterprises lack vitality. It is difficult for them to respond promptly in the face of market changes. Approximately 70 percent have encountered many difficulties (they are operating at a loss, debts are piling up, assets are depreciating, there is a lack of capital, and so on). It is difficult for capital to move from sectors and regions with poor results to sectors and regions with good results in order to improve the economic results of all of society. Given the specific conditions mentioned above, how should the state enterprise model be renovated? It can be said that this is a key point in the theory of a socialist commodity economy and the central element in the renovation of our country's economy system. In this article, I want to contribute ideas on this issue. The ineffectiveness of the traditional state enterprise model and the historical roots of this. [passage omitted] The contract enterprise model--strengths and weaknesses. In this historical search, many countries have vacillated to the point of forgetting the principles, jumping from one side to the other and from "nationalization" to privatization, with the result that they have suffered economic defeats and political collapse. Some countries, however, have resolutely adhered to the basic guiding principles and "tied the eternal to the ephemeral." As a result, they have scored major victories in renovation and gained international recognition. In our country, renovation of the state enterprise model got underway later, but in recent years, this model has undergone notable changes. The state has given up some of its powers, strengthened the rights of the state enterprises, greatly reduced the legal plans and norms and expanded the use of guiding plans and norms, and started collecting taxes instead of appropriating enterprise profits. Today, the state has switched to a "contract enterprise" model on a broad scale. The commercial assets of the enterprises are being evaluated based on the actual assets of the enterprise, rational profit levels are being determined, and norms to increase the assets, bonus-fine norms for the use of the assets, and profit-sharing norms in capital business are being established. At the same time, tests are being conducted in decentralizing state ownership at a number of state enterprises based on the "public enterprise" model. As compared with previously improved state enterprise models, the "contract enterprise" model has several positive effects. Above all, this gives the enterprises greater independence with respect to managing and using the assets in accord with the laws. This encourages the laborers to pay attention to the results of the labor of both individuals and the collective (because their interests and income are tied to fulfilling or exceeding the contract norms). This encourages the enterprises to make production and the internal structure more efficient, provides a stable source of revenues for the state, and so on. However, this also has basic weaknesses: This does not separate ownership functions from commercial functions, and because of this it does not eliminate direct interference by the administrative apparatus in the commercial production activities of the enterprises (in many cases, a number of localities and sectors even include their own tasks and contracts, which generates even greater interference). As Marx pointed out more than 100 years ago, capitalist commodity production will give rise to a wide gap between private ownership rights and command labor. Thus, capitalists do not have to be responsible for command labor. The person who owns the musical instruments of an orchestra, for example, does not have to be the conductor of that orchestra. The realities of our country show that the reason why enterprises outside the state sector are thriving is not because they have the "favor" of the state but because they have adequate commercial independence and are rarely subject to direct administrative interference. This does not solve the problem of enterprises taking responsibility for profits and losses. To make up the losses, an enterprise must either use some of its existing capital or increase the price of its products. But no enterprise has sufficient existing capital to do this. And if an enterprise raises prices, how can it sell its goods, particularly at a time when cheap imports are being smuggled into the country in huge quantities? The contracts cannot be met when outside factors (such as exchange rates, profit margins, prices, transportation conditions, the supply of raw materials, and energy) change. This makes it difficult for the production factors to change, because the contract factors in the contract period do not change, it is difficult to change the payments, and the dependent relationship does not change. Furthermore, if a number of enterprises are achieving little or even suffering losses, all that needs to be done is to improve the situation a little and they can survive and keep from being disbanded. Clearly, this will block improving the results of all of society. Because of the above weaknesses, even though the "contract enterprise" model is still attractive, in my view, in the future it will not be the best enterprise model in socialist ownership conditions. Switch to an equity enterprise model For a long time prior to the sixth party congress, we mistakenly thought that the equity enterprise model was a separate sphere of capitalism and that this served capitalism. We thought that developing an equity economy would lead to privatization and smash the public ownership system, the foundation of socialism. Actually, the seed of an equity economy has existed since Roman times. By the first half of the 17th century, particularly after equity companies in England were legally recognized as independent legal persons, the first relatively stable equity corporations appeared consisting of shareholders and long-term investors. They could not withdraw their capital, but they had the right to transfer and trade shares. During the period 1820-1830, because of the requirements of the industrial revolution and the needs in building national markets, much capital was needed to build an infrastructure (relying just on the capital of individual capitalists would not have provided sufficient capital). Because of this, a number of equity corporations (such as railroad, mining, and power corporations) came into being and expanded quickly in Europe and America. Now, equity enterprises have become a widespread organizational model in many countries, particularly in the economically developed countries. In England, in 1862 there were only 165 equity corporations. By 1890, the number had risen to 4,066 and by 1962 the number was 428,000, of which the majority were limited equity corporations. In the United States, in 1904 only 23.6 percent of the enterprises were equity corporations. By 1947, this percentage had risen to 69 percent, and by 1962 the percentage had risen to 78 percent. Today, the United States has more than 1.2 million equity corporations. When studying the equity enterprise model under the capitalist system, Marx said that in an equity corporation, private ownership rights are separate from asset control rights, and these control rights are turned over to the "united laborers," that is, society. Through the equity enterprise system, the assets of the private capitalists invested in the corporation are transformed into direct social assets. From that, Marx concluded that the equity system will do away with private capital. As the equity economy expands and penetrates deeper and deeper into new production sectors, it will eliminate private capital more and more. This is a purely transitional point leading to a new form of production (meaning socialist production). Viewed in this way, the equity enterprise model is not the product of capitalism. It is both the product of a commodity economy and the condition for expanding the commodity economy and expanding large-scale production and socialization. The striking characteristic--and also a strength--of the equity enterprise model is that it separates ownership rights from commercial rights, it separates administrative management from commercial management, and it really transforms the enterprises into relatively independent producers who are commercially independent, who are responsible for the profits and losses, and who are responsible for their own development. Under the equity system, the production rights of the enterprise are determined by the enterprise, and the share rights of the state and other shareholders are all equal. As the manager of society, the state collects taxes, and as an owner, it shares in the profits. Thus, the state will not have to concern itself with managing the enterprises as it did in the past. Because of this, it can concentrate its efforts on such things as formulating projects, setting guidelines for the growth of the sectors, monitoring and inspecting things, gathering information, and so on. Enterprise managers will be selected by the shareholders. They will form a management board to control the use, preservation, and growth of the capital and to ensure that better and better use is made of the capital. Implementing the equity enterprise model is an effective way to improve the isolated state enterprise model, create a competitive market system, encourage adequate competition, put an end to dividing state-owned assets by sector and region, and create channels for easily transferring production factors. With the equity enterprise model, the profitable enterprises will be able to issue and sell shares in order to expand production. As for those enterprises that are operating at a loss, because share prices will be low, they will go bankrupt or be taken over by other enterprises. This means that the sources of social strength will be integrated in an optimum way, and the results of the entire economy will improve. Based on the above analysis, I think that the equity enterprise model should be the main guideline for renovating the ineffective state enterprise model in our country. Naturally, this model cannot reject the necessary existence of the state economic sector consisting of non-competitive state enterprises and enterprises that have a decisive effect on the national welfare and the people's livelihood and that maintain production stability and stabilize the markets. With respect to these enterprises, the state has a monopoly on investment for expansion and on control of production and markets. The path of equitization in our country today is not one of turning private capital into social capital as under capitalism but one of restructuring the state enterprise model based on switching from absolute ownership by the state in which there is no competition to pluralistic ownership by society in which there is competition. At the same time, this will solve the problem of separating the ownership rights of the state from the commercial rights of the enterprises, eliminate direct administrative interference by authorities in commercial production, and eliminate domination and division of state-owned assets among the sectors and regions. At the microcosmic level, this will improve the production structure of the enterprises, accumulate capital, and strengthen vitality for production, and at the macrocosmic level, this will improve the traditional production system throughout society and effectively integrate national assets in order to improve economic results in general. If we are to solve these two fundamental problems, we must not follow the privatization path of Western economists, who say that to develop a commodity economy, you must carry on privatization, develop a private economy, and then, when the private economy has accumulated capital, sell the state-owned enterprises to them and then equitize them. And we can't follow the path of shared-ownership enterprises, in which the state-owned assets are divided between the state and the enterprises. That would be unfair (because the assets of an enterprise are not created just by the labor of the workers and civil servants at that enterprise), and it would actually be harmful. In my view, the acceptable path is: 1. A state-owned asset management system must be built from the central central echelon to the localities. This must be independent of the state administrative management system. State-owned asset management rights must be separated from social administrative management rights, and the economic functions of the state must be directed toward the main tasks mentioned above. Only in this way will it be possible to maintain the independence and vitality of the enterprises, and thanks to this, the socialist system of public ownership will be solidified. 2. Under the unified control of the various-echelon state-owned asset management system, state-owned asset commercial corporations having a competitive nature must be built. These commercial corporations will not directly control or use the assets, but as owners, their function will be to monitor the use of the assets by the enterprises within the corporation. 3. After separating the two rights, pluralizing the ownership of the assets of the state enterprises, and building competitive markets, the large corporations and equity groups must actively be expanded and tied to each other with respect to occupations or products without regard to administrative boundaries in order to gradually establish social equity groups that are capable of carrying on commercial activities effectively and that have competitive strength on the markets. At the same time, an effort must be made to spread propaganda and guide people having capital (including cadres and workers) or social mass organizations in buying shares of the enterprise in order to attract the idle capital among the masses, reduce currency pressures on the markets, transform the idle capital into useful capital, and encourage the formation of a socialized investment mechanism and a pluralistic production structure. The widespread implementation of the equity enterprise model requires that the necessary conditions be prepared: There must be a fundamental change in viewpoint concerning socialist ownership, an equity economy, and the equity enterprise model. In guiding equitization, by sticking to 51 percent equity ownership in an enterprise, not only will the state control the assets of that enterprise but it will also control other assets, which will enable the socialist ownership system to be solidified and expanded. Even if private individuals own a majority of the shares in a number of state enterprises, that will not be a problem, because even though the state-owned assets may have changed with respect to material form, they will not decline in value, and the state will recover capital for investment in other enterprises. This will improve the investment structure and benefit the expansion of the country's important projects. The state-owned assets must be evaluated, and there must be rational measures to allocate these assets by ownership level in order to transform the absolute ownership rights of the state into the plural ownership rights of society. The market system and market mechanisms must be improved. This includes the various production factors (such as capital, labor strength, technical materials, and information). Steps must be taken to enable input factors to move easily throughout society. Prices and profit margins among the sectors must gradually be "marketized," and prices must be regarded as a function of market supply and demand in order to ensure fair competition between enterprises. The financial and national tax systems must be improved, and budget revenues and expenditures must be tied closely to each other. Tax measures that will benefit fair competition and stimulate production must be implemented. The tax collection and after-tax profit laws used by the ownership echelons must be relied on. Smuggling must be dealt with appropriately. Ranks of equity enterprise and corporation leaders who know how to manage business and who have a thorough knowledge of markets, particularly bond markets and international markets, and the business principles of equity enterprises must be built. Unemployment and unemployment insurance measures managed by the state and housing measures managed by the cadres and workers must be implemented in order to simplify the targets of the enterprises and help the enterprises reach the markets.
