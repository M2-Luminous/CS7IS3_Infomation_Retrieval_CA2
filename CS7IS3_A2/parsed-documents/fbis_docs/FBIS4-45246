Speaking from her cell yesterday, Patricia Fury, a convicted prostitute, said: "I honestly didn't know it was drugs. A Nigerian boyfriend called Paul told me he dealt in gold and jewellery. When he asked me to take something, I assumed it was gold or jewellery." When customs officials arrested her at Bangkok airport as she arrived to catch a flight to Singapore, they found her bag contained heroin with a street value of Â£100,000. The Nigerian, who claimed to be a bullion dealer, had vanished. Fury, a mother of two boys aged ten and five, works the Manchester red-light district near her home in Longsight and was last arrested for prostitution on April 12. She is also known as Hussein and has convictions for soliciting going back to 1986 and a suspended jail sentence for shoplifting but she has no drug convictions. Fury's story is similar to that of Birmingham's Karyn Smith and Patricia Cahill, convicted in 1990 and 1991 of trying to smuggle heroin out of Thailand. They were pardoned after three years in jail.
