Col. Mykola Hnidenko, chief of the Department of Science and Informatization of the Main Directorate of Military Education of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, candidate of technical sciences, docent, under the rubric "Building the Armed Forces of Ukraine: Experience, Problems, Prospects": "Military Science Should Already Be at Work" -- first paragraph is NARONA ARMIYA introduction] [Text] On 23 March, NARODNA ARMIYA published an interview with Colonel Oleksandr Safronov, head of the scientific center of the Kiev Air Force Institute, who holds a doctorate in technical sciences and the title of professor. The interview dealt with the difficult problems involved in organizing the work of the scientific center's scientists, as well as in developing military science in general to enable it to provide for the needs of the Armed Forces and the military-industrial complex of Ukraine. In an afterword following the interview, we invited all those interested in these issues to join in the discussion. As part of this discussion, the editors have received an article from the Main Directorate of Military Education of the Ministry of Defense, which contains answers to some of the questions that were posed in the March interview. We offer this material to all interested specialists. Military science in Ukraine is currently in a difficult situation. The result of historical circumstances has been such that now that Ukraine has become independent, 95 percent of her military-scientific potential is comprised of scientists at military educational institutions (vnz). Meanwhile, the system of organizing military-scientific research, which we inherited from the former Soviet Union, was focused mostly at military scientific-research institutions, almost all of which are located in Russia. Unfortunately, the military educational institutions played a secondary role in this system. As a consequence of this kind of scientific-technical policy in the Armed Forces of the USSR, the normative documents that regulated the organization of scientific work did not provide for scientific research to be done by military educational institutions under direct contract from the Ministry of Defense, the branches [vydy] of the Armed Forces, and the component services [rody viysk]. Essentially, the educational institutions were barred from participating directly in developing new types of weapons, military equipment, etc. These were the prerogative of scientific-research institutes, test ranges [polihony], and the military-industrial complex. The military educational institutions, including those that remained in Ukraine, lacked scientific subdivisions that could perform, if only partially, the functions of military scientific-research institutes. With some exceptions, the scientific potential of the military educational institutions was underutilized by the Ministry of Defense. As a result, the professors and instructors and the auditors and students [slukhachi ta kursanty], having had no opportunity to be directly involved in scientific research, proved (as our "Soviet" experience demonstrates) unprepared to master new types of weapons quickly and at minimum cost. Unfortunately, they lack the tools for achieving new scientific results independently [vony ne volodiyut instrumentom samostiynoho zdobutku novykh naukovykh rezultativ], which makes their training [pidhotovka --preparation ?] economically unprofitable and thereby unable to meet today's needs. This was one of the main reason why the level of training of a large portion of the graduates of the USSR's military schools failed to meet the standards with respect to the professional qualifications that their diplomas should have guaranteed. Small wonder that as a result of this circumstance military educational institutions were often accused of being too remote from military issues and that the dissertations and diploma projects of their graduates had little practical orientation and their practical application was slow. Of course, this situation did not hold true for all military educational institutions. There were and still are among them academies and schools, at which the level of scientific work is high. These include, for example, the Military Engineering Radiotechnical Academy of the Air Defense Forces [PPO], the Kharkiv Higher Military Command Engineering School of Missile Troops, the Kiev Higher Engineering Radiotechnical School of the Air Defense Forces [PPO], the communications school, the aviation school, the Sevastopol Naval Engineering School. It was not by chance that these military educational institutions were chosen to serve as the foundation for establishing Ukraine's system of military education. But we should underscore once again that these institutions were exceptions to the rule. Even these "elite" military educational institutions had the shortcoming described above. The scientific-research subdivisions at these institutions were focused on narrow, primarily exploratory and theoretical research. We should also draw attention to the legal status of military scientists. The normative-legal basis governing scientific work inherited by the Armed Forces of Ukraine prohibits military personnel from performing scientific research and teaching for additional pay by holding more than one job [vklyuchayuchy sumisnytstvo posad]. It thus limits the rights of military scientists which are guaranteed by Ukraine's laws and deprives them of equal status with civilian specialists. These conditions have forced many military scientists, especially in our difficult times, to look for ways to apply their skills and talents outside the Armed Forces of Ukraine -- in other ministries, departments, and in commercial structures... In other words, it is necessary to work out fundamentally new documents to regulate scientific work in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This need is dictated not only by the special features of the structure of the scientific-research institutions that remained in Ukraine after the division of the Armed Forces of the USSR, but also by the need to bring these features into conformity with the laws of Ukraine. It is worth noting that the situation that exists in the field of scientific-technical work in other ministries and departments, as well as in Ukraine as a whole, is not much better. One of the main reasons for this is inadequate funding of science. So far, the Law of Ukraine "On the Fundamental Principles of State Policy in the Sphere of Science and cientific-Technical Activity..." has also not produced results. There are thus two key tasks that need to be performed in the realm of building military science in Ukraine. The first is to create a scientifically well-founded, rational system of scientific-research institutions and organizations within the Ministry of Defense, which would include the scientific centers of military educational institutions, so that the needs of the Armed Forces and the military-industrial complex of Ukraine can be provided for in the shortest possible time. The second is to prepare a new normative-legal foundation for scientific work in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. It should be recalled that as early as at the end of 1991, the concept for creating a system of military education of Ukraine stipulated the need for creating scientific centers within military educational institutions to assume some of the functions of the scientific-research institutes of the different branches of service. Thus their primary purpose would be to work together with the scientific-research institutions of the Ministry of Defense and other ministries and departments, as well as the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, to solve military-theoretical and military-technical problems as required by the branches of the Armed Forces and the component services. A second and no less important task of the scientific centers, which is dictated by the state national program for "Education" ("Ukraine in the 21st Century"), is to promote the integration of science and education in military educational institutions. The Main Directorate of Military Education is also developing a normative-legal base for scientific research. Thus, in order to provide the Armed Forces of Ukraine with a mechanism for realizing state guarantees for military personnel carrying out contracted work to produce scientific-technical output [naukovo-tekhnichna produktsiya], retaining and making wide use of the military's scientific potential in scientific research to serve the needs of the Ministry of Defense, and providing material incentives for those engaged in this research, the Department of Science and Informatization of the Main Directorate of Military Education has worked out a new Statute on the Procedure for Creating (Transferring) Scientific-Technical Output According to Contracts in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This statute has been put into effect by an order of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. What does this document provide for that is fundamentally new? First of all, the statute provides for both a directive and a contractual approach to the organization of scientific-technical work [NDR] in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and grants the right to military educational institutions, scientific centers, and other institutions and organizations of the Armed Forces that have the capacity for carrying out scientific-technical work to be the principal contractors to perform scientific-technical work for the Ministry of Defense. Second, the commanders of military units and heads of institutions and organizations of the Ministry of Defense are granted the right to: create temporary creative collectives with the participation of military personnel to perform contracted work to create (transmit) scientific-technical output; permit military personnel to engage in scientific and creative activity to create scientific-technical output in military units and institutions and organizations of the Ministry of Defense, as well as in the institutions and organizations of Ukraine's other ministries and departments on terms that involve the combining of staffs [na umovakh shtatnoho sumisnytstva]; pay military personnel and other personnel [viyskovosluzhbovtsi i sluzhbovtsi] who take part in creating scientific-technical output on their own time [u pozasluzhbovyy chas]; establish bonuses for military personnel and other personnel, taking into account their individual creative contribution, for top-quality performance in creating scientific-technical output delivered to the client; there are to be no set limits in the amounts of individual bonuses; pay military personnel and other personnel in accordance with effective legislation in Ukraine for providing expert opinions and consultation in military-scientific and military-technical research and development and on projects in the process of creating scientific-technical output. At the same time, the statute provides an appropriate mechanism for supervising the activity of officials who are members of temporary creative collectives and engage in scientific work at more than one job [za sumisnytstvom]. Thus, military personnel in the Armed Forces of Ukraine are being provided with wide-ranging opportunities to realize their scientific and creative potential. It should be noted that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were the first among the armed forces of the former Union to take decisive steps in this direction. We would like to note that this important document was worked out with the direct assistance of officers from the Department of Science and Informatization of the Main Directorate of Military Education Lt. Col. O. Babenko, Capt. third grade I. Dolhov, and Docent V. Tkachenko, chief specialist of the department and candidate of technical sciences, as well as specialists from military educational institutions, scientific centers, and the Armaments Staff [shtab ozbroyennya] of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The latter include Lt. Gen. I. Olenovych, Maj. Gen. O. Kovtunenko, colonels O. Matov, A. Dorovskyy, O. Safronov, M. Lukhanin, V. Kasatkin, V. Sereda, and others. But the sphere of activity involved in creating a system of scientific-research institutions in the Armed Forces of Ukraine is much broader and its problems go well beyond those raised in this article. Therefore, all specialists and scientists, all those who are involved in this work, must make a great effort and exhibit enough will, wisdom, and patience to realize the goal that has been set to develop military science in Ukraine.
