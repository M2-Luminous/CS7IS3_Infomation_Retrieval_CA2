They lambasted the Liberal Party for seeking China's blessing for its proposal, saying that was an invitation for Beijing to interfere. "In the Liberal Party's proposals we see the face of naked self-interest," said Democrat chairman Martin Lee Chu-ming. Independents, whose votes will decide today's debate, "will surely be held accountable if Hong Kong's last efforts to have a modest measure of democracy are never to be realised", he said. The plea came on the eve of the marathon debate on the second, and final, part of the political package proposed by Governor Chris Patten. The debate will start at 9 am and is expected to last until early tomorrow morning. There was only a "very, very marginal" difference in the number of supporters and opponents of the Liberal Party's proposal, said member Henry Tang Ying-yen. He was"cautiously optimistic" the blueprint, widely known as the 1994 package, would be endorsed. Sources said the party had secured 27 votes, while 26 would vote against it. Martin Barrow was said to have changed his position recently from supporting the 1994 package to abstaining. Jimmy McGregor was also said to have decided to abstain. Timothy Ha Wing-ho had made clear he would not support the proposal. The Liberal Party was trying to persuade him to abstain. Hui Yin-fat was also said to be wavering between abstaining or opposing the Liberal Party's proposal. But Philip Choi Shing-kiu of the Hong Kong Social Workers' General Union last night said he would be extremely disappointed if Mr Hui, the social workers' representative, did anything other than oppose the conservative model. Democrat leader Mr Lee said: "(The Liberal Party's proposal) would not be accepted even under former Governor Sir David Wilson's government. They believe that if Patten's proposal is carried into law, the liberals would sweep the elections and would form a majority and would cause instability to Hong Kong, which is of course a lie." He called on six independents -- namely Roger Luk Koon-ho, Simon Ip Sik-on, Mr Barrow, Vincent Cheng Hoi-chuen, Mr Ha and Marvin Cheung Kin-tung -- to think twice before voting for the Liberal Party. They had indicated support for the Government's proposal in three debates. "They owe it to the people of Hong Kong, they owe it to history to explain (their change of position) on such a critical matter if they do so," Mr Lee said.
