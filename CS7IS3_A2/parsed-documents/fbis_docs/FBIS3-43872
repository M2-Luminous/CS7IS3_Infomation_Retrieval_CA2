However, Mr Botha warned at the end of a one day visit to the tiny mountain kingdom South Africa would not recognise any Lesotho government which came to power by force. Pretoria would bring such a government to its knees, he told a press conference before jetting out. "We will make it impossible for such a government to survive," he said. "We will close the border." Mr Botha was confident a new South African Government would also not recognise a Lesotho Government which came to power by a coup. He was leaving the enclave confident, however, that the critical situation had been defused. He had received a commitment from the two opposing defence force factions which clashed on Friday that they would negotiate a truce. The cause of the clash supposedly was a demand by the rebel group for a doubling of army salaries. But Lesotho and SA [South African] Government officials told SAPA on Saturday it appeared the dissidents had political grievances, and were preparing for a possible coup. The ruling Basotholand Congress Party swept to power in March last year, ousting [words indistinct] on on Friday, but said the pilots and their aircraft were being looked for. They are expected to return soon to Lesotho. SAPA was informed four helicopters landed in Ladybrand across the border in the Orange Free State. The reason for the pilots' [words indistinct] that their commander, Lt-Col Patrick Matare [name as received], was injured in Friday's clash and they feared the rebel soldiers were after them too. Mr Botha said he had been assured Col Matare was in a satisfactory condition in hospital in the capital, and there was no need to accept a SA Government offer to have him treated in Bloemfontein. The commander, who was still being held hostage by the rebels on Saturday afternoon, was reportedly shot in the shoulder. A civilian doctor operated on him. Mr Botha first met separately with all the parties involved, including the two army factions, before bringing them together face- to-face. The minister and his hosts were at pains to point out he had been invited to Lesotho to assist and was not "barging in". "I did not come here to preach," he said, pointing out South Africa had its own problems with violence. He said his basic message to the parties was the region could ill-afford more confrontation if it wanted to attract foreign investment. Any problems in Lesotho could also affect the highlands water project. He had also pointed out the Lesotho Government, like South Africa's, did not have the money to increase salaries willy-nilly. "The future of Africa and the world will depend very heavily on economic development," Mr Botha said. He added he had urged the soldiers to tackle the "real enemy" -- the social upliftment of Lesotho's people.
