He will conclude his term in August, after almost five years as head of the Colombian Government. This man has carried out social security plans, enforced efficient strategies in the struggle against the drug cartels, and sponsored an active foreign policy that put the country in a leading position at the continental level. Colombia comprises -- along with Venezuela and Mexico -- the active Group of Three. Gaviria's role undoubtedly resulted in his appointment as OAS secretary general, replacing Joao Baena Soares at the end of his term. Colombian citizens breathed easier with Gaviria because he virtually dismantled the dangerous Medellin Cartel and carried out other actions to improve public safety. His government also adopted important decisions in the foreign policy sector, including the decision to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba in October 1993. Bilateral relations have increased since then. Four Colombian ministers have travelled to the island and a similar number of Cuban officials have visited Santa Fe de Bogota in less than eight months. The exchange in the trade and technical sectors and the search for investments in Havana have played a prominent role. Innumerable Colombian foreign trade delegations and businessmen have visited socialist Cuba. The two countries have participated in scientific and technological projects and carried out important negotiations in the pharmaceutical and metalworks industries and in the agricultural and perishable consumer goods sectors. Colombia received Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on 12 December, meeting President Gaviria, Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, and numerous businessmen during his three-day official visit. He also established the groundwork for creating a binational commission. Carlos Lage, Council of Ministers vice president, and Education Minister Luis Ignacio Gomez arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota after that first official Cuban visit to Colombia. Colombian Health Minister Juan Carlos Londono and Energy and Mines Minister Guido Nule also visited Havana. An unpleasant incident occurred in the interim: A newspaper in Santa Fe de Bogota tried to present Cuba as a sponsor of a guerrilla summit in Havana. The anti-Cuban campaign coincided with the announcement that Colombia would sell Cuba 15,000-20,000 barrels of oil. The incident was finally cleared up, the newspaper apologized to Cuba, the case was closed, and the rhythm of relations resumed. Ernesto Melendez, minister for foreign relations and economic cooperation, arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota, while the Colombian agriculture minister arrived in Havana. Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin also visited the Cuban capital, meeting President Fidel Castro and other high-ranking leaders. Incidentally, Fidel Castro's upcoming visit to Cartagena de Indias to attend the fourth Ibero-American summit will be the second time that Castro has visited Colombia as head of state, the first being in August 1993 after he attended President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's inauguration in Bolivia.
