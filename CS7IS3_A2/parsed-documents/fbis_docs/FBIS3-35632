The Bad News: Missing Rukh Secretariat Head Has Not Yet Been Found"] [Text] The registration of candidates running for Ukraine's Supreme Soviet, new convocation, has been completed in district electoral commissions. A considerable part of the current deputies are running again for the Supreme Soviet. Political parties' preparations for the elections have barely started. To take place on 29 January is a congress of the "party of power" -- the Labor Congress of Ukraine -- and on 5 February there will be a congress of one of the most influential parties -- the Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine, to discuss questions connected with the upcoming 27 March elections. In the eastern part of Ukraine, parties of democratic centrist tendency have nominated few delegates, not enough to go around all the election districts. Even so they could not split up the zones of influence between themselves. For example, the rivals in Kharkov will be Volodymyr Grinev, former deputy chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Soviet and chairman of the "New Ukraine" association, and Genrikh Altunyan, head of the Kharkov Kray organization of the People's Rukh of Ukraine. In Odessa, Eduard Gurvits, rather influential there, will contend against current Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk. In Crimea, currently carried away with presidential elections, not all election districts have nominated candidates. The deadline for their nomination will apparently be moved forward because there will be simultaneous elections for Crimea's Supreme Soviet. It did not go without scandals. For example, People's Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil accused Valentin Nedrigaylo, first deputy internal affairs minister, who was supposed to report to the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine the results of the search for Mikhail Boychishin, head of the Rukh secretariat who has been missing since 15 January, of trying to shift the case from the political into the purely criminal sphere. This is naturally disadvantageous to Rukh. As for the lost chief of the Rukh secretariat, no traces of him have been found to date, nor is there even a plausible explanation for his disappearance.
