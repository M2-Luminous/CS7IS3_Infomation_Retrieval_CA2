FR940224-1-00010 FR940224-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;139&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. This proposal would also require modification of certain lap joints and inspections of modified lap joints. This proposal is prompted by a structural review of Model 747 series airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent rapid decompression of the airplane and the inability to carry fail-safe loads. DATES: Comments must be received by April 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;139&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven Fox, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;120S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2777; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181.

The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;139&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion In April 1988, a transport category airplane managed to land after tiny cracks in rivet holes in the upper fuselage linked together, causing structural failure and explosive decompression. An 18-foot section ripped from the fuselage. This accident focused greater attention on the problem of aging aircraft. In June 1988, the FAA sponsored a conference on aging airplane issues, which was attended by representatives of the aviation industry from around the world. It became obvious that, because of the tremendous increase in air travel, the relatively slow pace of new airplane production, and the apparent economic feasibility of operating older technology airplanes rather than retiring them, increased attention needed to be focused on this aging fleet and maintaining its continued operational safety. The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America and the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) of America committed to identifying and implementing procedures to ensure continuing structural airworthiness of aging transport category airplanes. An Airworthiness Assurance Task Force, with representatives from the aircraft operators, manufacturers, regulatory authorities, and other aviation representatives, was established in August 1988. The objective of the Task Force was to sponsor ``Working Groups'' to (1) select service bulletins, applicable to each airplane model in the transport fleet, to be recommended for mandatory modification of aging airplanes, (2) develop corrosion directed inspections and prevention programs, and (3) review the adequacy of each operator's structural maintenance program, (4) review and update the Supplemental Structural Inspection Documents (SSID), and (5) assess repair quality. The Working Group assigned to review the Boeing Model 747 series airplanes completed its work on Item (2) in July 1989 and developed a baseline program for controlling corrosion problems that may jeopardize the continued airworthiness of the Boeing Model 747 fleet. This program is contained in Boeing Document Number D6&hyph;36022, ``Aging Airplane Corrosion Prevention and Control Program_Model 747,'' dated July 1989. The FAA issued AD 90&hyph;25&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;6790 (55 FR 49268, November 27, 1990), which requires implementation of a corrosion prevention and control program. The Working Group completed a portion of its work on Item (1), above. The Working Group's proposal is contained in Boeing Document Number D6&hyph;35999, ``Aging Airplane Service Bulletin Structural Modification Program_Model 747.'' The FAA issued AD 90&hyph;06&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;6490 (55 FR 8374, March 7, 1990), which requires the installation of the structural modifications identified in the document, and AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;04, Amendment 39&hyph;8437 (58 FR 8695, February 17, 1993), which requires structural inspections of older airplanes. Additional structural inspections are required by AD 90&hyph;15&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;6653 (55 FR 28600, July 12, 1990), which references Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2307, dated December 21, 1989. (A correction of the rule was published in the Federal Register on July 30, 1990 (55 FR 31027).) The action being proposed herein follows from the ongoing activities of the Working Group relative to Item (1). The Working Group has identified certain service difficulties that warrant mandatory inspections following mandatory modification of these airplanes. The Working Group considers that these service difficulties can be controlled safely by repetitively inspecting following modification of these airplanes, and that, because of the safety implications, the inspections should be mandatory to assure that all operators perform them. Typically, the addressed unsafe conditions have occurred infrequently on older airplanes, and the Working Group has a very high degree of confidence in the ability of an inspection program to detect the damage before it impairs safety.
