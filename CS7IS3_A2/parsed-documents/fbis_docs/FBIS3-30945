The report's significance lies in the fact that it was accompanied by a picture of the participants of the session, which is supposed to do most to deny "malicious misinformation about the alleged rift in the HDZ and replacement of its officials." In that picture, Stipe Mesic and Gojko Susak were seated next to Franjo Tudjman, and the seating arrangements -- to the president's left and to his right -- "ideologically" mirrors the division within the party, and so does the position of other "polemists." However, the problem lies in the fact that the latest attempt to homogenize the ruling party should be secured primarily by means of a fierce attack on the opposition, which was this time accused of "destabilizing the democratic system." The report says that "the moves and demands of some opposition parties lead to a constitutional crisis and early elections, and thus obviously jeopardize the internal stability and the international position of the Republic of Croatia," and that their goal is "to cause dissatisfaction among the people and even stimulate strikes" in order to "provoke a constitutional crisis and overthrow the authorities." "Scenario From Abroad" Jure Radic, HDZ secretary general, was even more direct during his visit last week to the county of Dubrovnik and Neretva, accusing unmentioned parties of betraying national interests. He spoke of "unwritten scenarios from abroad on how to destroy Croatian authorities that were elected in a democratic manner," and added that "some opposition parties have been receiving such scenarios for six months." The sharpness of Radic's statement may stem from the fact that he made it in Cavtat, i.e., exactly where the present authorities are being severely criticized for negotiating the possible "trading of the territory of southern Dalmatia," so it would be wise to redirect the wrath of the inhabitants of Konavli to something else. It is, however, more probable that the statement was a part of a more general pressure on the opposition, so that the ruling party could take the political initiative to the full. Anyway, if we analyze the opening statement of President Tudjman at the said session of the HDZ Presidency, the inevitable conclusion is that black days are ahead for opposition parties, especially for those with large memberships. Referring to the necessity for "unified national politics," the Croatian president elaborated on the "scenario" for "causing a constitutional crisis," and the only argument he presented were "written guidelines" from abroad sent to "a party." He did not say whether the unmentioned party required those "guidelines" itself and implemented them in its political practice, as if those "details are not important at all." The fact that Radic, on the other hand, came up with several instead of just one party is just a consequence of an intellectually well-organized political campaign directed against Tudjman's non-party opponents, for example against "the six" who demanded his resignation last fall, but also against the press and trade unions. Tudjman's speech to the 15 "apostles," obviously also designed to make them see which of them is the HDZ "Judas," shows that the ruling party cannot break free from the "conspiracy" syndrome typical of one-party systems. Commonplace political fighting, which also consists of contacts with similar parties abroad, is thus consciously turned into "undermining the foundations of the state," which, as a logical countermeasure, could result in introducing some elements of open police and court repression. Another proof that this method is worthwhile is what happened with Paraga's Croatian Rights Party [HSP]. The party's political extremism did not encounter resistance when it was beneficial for the authorities, when it made it easier for them to gather volunteers for the war. But after the political situation had settled, the HSP was accused of something that could not actually even be proven. HSP leaders were eventually acquitted of charges that they attempted to "undermine the constitutional system," but the goal of that show has nevertheless been realized: Paraga has been totally discredited and the HSP marginalized. Moreover, the late Ivan Cesar, who was separately working on gathering Croatian Christian Democrats, was ridiculed in the famous documentary about Bruno Busic. Something like that now also threatens the Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS], the only party that can now undermine the present political monopoly of the HDZ. Regarding the liberals, the problem does not lie in "instructions from abroad" or if the president and the secretary general of the ruling party consider them "conspirators" at all. Budisa's followers, according to Tudjman, jeopardize Croatian interests for more global strategic reasons. The key problem, therefore, is the fact that the HSLS has assimilated into the typical framework of "liberal-democratic" understanding of national question in post-communist Europe. According to Tudjman, it was that option that was "directed toward preserving Yugoslavia and secretly hoped for the defeat of Croatia in 1991, especially this Croatia, sovereign and on its own." Launching Against the HSLS Consequently, the conclusion of the Croatian president is even more explicit and unrelenting: "The liberal-civic concept is looking for support in the strata of the Croatian psyche, and it gets it, not only from those who feel nostalgia for Yugoslavia, but also from those preoccupied by those wide universalist, cosmopolitan ideas.... It has been trying to prevent the HDZ from winning the elections, since it could not prevent Tudjman from being elected (at the latest elections), in order to be able, through weakening the coalition or by means of concessions to each other, to redirect Croatian politics." What is even more interesting, at the session of the HDZ Presidency, Tudjman also pointed his political cutting edge toward the "Catholic-universalist" concept from which European Christian Democracy stems. The Croatian president is convinced that international diplomacy today also uses Catholicism to thwart authentic Croatian interests. To be more precise, the matter at issue is a statement by Pope John Paul II, of 4 January this year, in which he made a hypothetical reference to "the community of southern Slavs." For Tudjman, that was a clear sign of a turning point in the official politics of the Vatican, especially as some 10 days later, the Pope condemned "extreme nationalism": "Therefore, from the viewpoint of world Christianity and from the viewpoint of Catholicism, the Croats are entrusted with again being a bridge toward the Orthodox creed for uniting Christianity. To that effect it was announced that, if there is peace and should the Holy Father accept the invitation and visit Croatia, in addition to Zagreb, he would visit both Sarajevo and Belgrade." Finding a global "conspiracy" in intertwining liberal-civic and Catholic-universalist options, and considering the past repugnance to social-democratic views on the Croatian reality on the international scene, Tudjman is becoming more and more lonely, which may have negative repercussions for settling conflicts on the territory of former Yugoslavia. In public, the responsibility for that will, of course, be redirected to the "subversive" activities of some opposition parties, primarily those that openly oppose Croatian politics in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If that should not prove successful enough, then the possibility that "some party members who are not willing to enforce the state politics may leave," as Jure Radic announced directly in Cavtat. Tudjman, as we know, does not advocate "disturbing the balance" in the party. It is still safer to shift the burden of blame for present and future failures of Croatian politics onto his opponents. The opposition, on the other hand, is still not capable of using the weaknesses of the ruling party to its advantage, although Tudjman's followers have probably reached their all-time low in their five-year history. Before the press, Drazen Budisa openly admits that the popularity of his party "has fallen in relation to the post-election period," and he is also aware of the negative effects "of a fierce media campaign" that is systematically directed against the liberals. Stipac's Croatian Peasant's Party, as the only party that is gradually ramifying the network of its branches, has actually never dealt with "high politics," except for the personal frustrations of its president regarding the events in central Bosnia. Savka's Croatian National Party, which the ruling party ironically refers to as "nationalists without people," cannot get over the debacle that happened a year and a half ago. The Left keep talking about their unification and it will never come, so that only Racan's social democrats are present in the public, mostly regarding social questions. The Right is even more disoriented, so that a possible unification would not make them a major political party. Dalmatian regionalists contracted Paraga's "disease," and they have to prove their innocence in court, while the Istrian Democratic Congress is becoming more and more like an "Istrian HDZ," regarding the fact that there is a strong conflict of political factions in the party. And finally, Serbian parties and forums are not a real opposition either, but only serve as "test balloons" of official Croatian politics. Why Is Tudjman Concerned? Bearing in mind those realities regarding the opposition, it becomes even more vague why Tudjman is so concerned about rumors about "overthrowing the legal Croatian authorities." If that is just political "scenography" for unpopular moves on the domestic and international scene, especially regarding the peace accord between Zagreb and Belgrade, then this game makes some sense. If, on the other hand, the political public is being forcefully "disciplined," Croatia will soon have to deal with more trouble.
