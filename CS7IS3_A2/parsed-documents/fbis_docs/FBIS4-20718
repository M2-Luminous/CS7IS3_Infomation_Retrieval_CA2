Engineer Mojtaba Shari'ati added: Since the year 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] 33 mines have been readied for operation in this province, and 25 exploration projects have also been carried out. According to him, in the current year mine exploration operations in Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad Province were done through the use of satellite photographs and information for the first time in the nation's history, with credits of 835 million rials. He said that this province's important mines include those for silicone, dolomite, copper, phosphate, oxide, decorative and facade stone, salt, fire clay, and celestine. The general manager of mines and metals for Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad noted: The assays for the ores in this province's mines are generally above standard. He added: The celestine mines in Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad are considered to be among the world's richest, with proven capacities of 2 million tons and assayed at 92 percent by foreign and domestic experts. Engineer Shari'ati added: The province's phosphate mines, with reserves of 400 million tons and assayed at 12 percent, have been recognized as being among the nation's best phosphate mines. Likewise, the presence of 200 million tons of dolomite reserves assayed at 23 percent presents favorable conditions for the construction of factories to produce dolomite fire clay. He said: The task of completing the exploration for copper mines, along with the accompanying elements such as silver with 192 "PPM" is being carried out in the province, and with the identification of mines for facade and decorative stone with high reserves and quality, it is necessary to invest to activate these mines. He added: Utilization of the province's bauxite mines, with reserves of 10 million tons assayed at 54 percent, could play an effective role in creating prosperous economic and social conditions in the Province of Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad. Engineer Shari'ati said the province has significant reserves of marl and limestone. He said: The mines in Dasht-e Rum of Boyer Ahmad, with the capacity to produce 2,000 tons per day, can meet the needs of a cement factory for 150 years. He noted the abundance of gypsum mines in the Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad Province. He said the Karik gypsum in Boyer Ahmad, with its 100-percent purity, could be used for medicinal and export purposes.
