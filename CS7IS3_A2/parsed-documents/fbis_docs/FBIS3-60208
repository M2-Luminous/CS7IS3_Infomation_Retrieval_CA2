The cocaine was hidden in two containers' false walls on the Polish vessel "Lublin II," which according to the documentation contained a consignment of bananas and coffee from Ecuador. Pogorzelski said the haul could be even larger because the search inside the third container on vessel was continuing. The containers were shipped by an Ecuador-based fruit company to a firm based in the tri-city of Gdansk, Sopot, Gdynia. The State Protection Bureau (UOP), the customs office are investigating the case under the supervision of the Gdynia prosecutor's office.
