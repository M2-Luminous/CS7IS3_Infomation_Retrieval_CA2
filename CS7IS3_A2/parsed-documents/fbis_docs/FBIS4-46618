Zemskov, candidate of military sciences: "Combined Arms Battle: Security and Defense of Military Posts and Installations"] [Text] Many regions of the country today are characterized by an unstable, criminogenic situation. The number of grave crimes, including piratical attacks using all kinds of firearms and silent weapons, has risen sharply. Experience of recent years shows that criminal elements are choosing military installations as "promising" targets more and more often: housing areas, storage areas with stockpiles of supplies and military property, and weapon and ammunition arsenals. Attacks on guardhouses, unit checkpoints, small posts, assigned personnel of on-duty services and the daily detail, and on individual servicemen have stepped up considerably. Investigations of the enumerated incidents permit concluding that a rehearsed system of forcible seizure of weapons and combat equipment has taken shape in a number of areas where troops are stationed. A planned attack usually is preceded by a thorough study of the installation and its security system and a detailed coordination of the criminals' actions. In essence, organized groups and entire units are active, especially in "hot spots." Unit details and subunits supporting a state-of-emergency regime are subjected to simultaneous attack. There have been cases of seizure of weapons and military property by individual citizens. To achieve their criminal schemes, the bandits study the security system: procedure and time of sentry relief, terrain in the vicinity of installations, nature of their outfitting with technical and engineer equipment, and organization of communications. For example, an attack was made twice in the course of a month on one of the Moscow garrison units to seize weapons. An investigation showed that the criminals were well informed concerning the security system and the procedure for sentries' performance of duties and their relief. Other techniques also are used, such as provocations with hostages (wives and children of servicemen) used for an unhindered approach to bases, arsenals and other installations, and bribery of soldiers and of servicing and maintenance personnel. All this has been done in Georgia and in other republics and areas. A brief survey of attempts and an analysis of methods used confirm the urgent need for improving all work connected with organizing troop duties in units and subunits. Reliable security and defense of installations and military posts should be ensured above all through proper, regulation assignment of routine garrison duty and guard duty. The latter holds a special place in troop life and activity. It must be regarded as performance of a combat mission in peacetime and it must become an important condition for maintaining high combat readiness and a subject of constant concern of the commander and staff. The problem of which we are speaking is rather vast and impossible to cover in one article. Therefore I will dwell in more detail only on the substance of the concept and certain recommendations of a practical nature. Security and defense of installations represent a complex of troop actions coordinated by goal, place and time in combination with technical, engineer and other measures. They are conducted to ensure safety of installations, keep outsiders from penetrating to them, and prevent seizure and loss of military property. Technical and engineer measures consist of the arrangement, installation, proper operation and further upgrading of various technical and engineer security equipment. This equipment includes structures, obstacles and the following systems: signalling, communications, automatic equipment, telemechanics, mechanization, lighting and surveillance. In organizing troop duties, the commander must see to it that installation security meets modern requirements--reliability, continuity of effect, activeness and flexibility--and has necessary depth. Reliability is that state of security which precludes the possibility of intruders penetrating into installations or the illegal transporting (carrying) of arms and other military property from them. It is achieved by skilled construction of the security system, use of its most advisable methods, proper organization and precise performance of duty, maintaining high combat readiness of subunits and guard details, appropriate training of personnel, and constantly keeping technical and engineer security equipment in operating condition. Continuity of security is where each installation checkpoint and perimeter sector is under surveillance and covered by particular forces and assets at any time. Activeness of security presumes a wide maneuver of forces, assets and fire, and also decisive actions of subunits, guard details and sentries for ensuring reliability of installation defense. Flexibility of security consists of reacting promptly to a change in the situation and concentrating efforts on avenues of the most likely intruder actions. Depth of security is that disposition of forces and assets which provides for detaining intruders in or near the restricted area. This is achieved by an optimum distribution of forces and assets to lines of the zone and by assigning areas of responsibility to guards outside the installation when the situation becomes complicated. With respect to practical recommendations, in my view it is apropos to look at the procedure for organizing the security system and one of its most important components, use of technical and engineer equipment. The following are determined in organizing an installation security system: security methods; number and makeup of guards, security and defense sectors, guardhouse locations and procedure for personnel actions; number and kinds of checkpoints; number, kinds, purpose and locations of posts and the length of routes; nature of preparation of the restricted zone with technical and engineer security equipment, its density and the procedure for installing it; makeup of unit (subunit) reserves and procedure for their employment. Special attention is given to outfitting the restricted zone with technical and engineer security equipment (one variant is shown in the diagram). Commanders proceed from the importance of the secured area in installing technical and engineer security equipment. Thus, a category one installation is outfitted with two or more lines of perimeter detection equipment and with installation security signalling and a category two installation with one line. Only installation security signalling may be installed at a category three installation. Variant of Preparing a Restricted Zone with Technical and Engineer Security Based on troop experience, systems based on television, radar, vibration, electromagnetic and combination principles of action such as Luch, Klen, Shchit, Setka, Kvarts, Radian and others may find wide use. In sectors that cannot be viewed it is advisable to use remotely controlled television cameras operating with low illumination. The use of troop details equipped with radar detection equipment is becoming a promising direction for improving the effectiveness of security and defense duty for military posts (installations). It is recommended setting up technical observation posts, which permit reliably covering an installation sector (perimeter) by creating a continuous radar surveillance zone. Each post can consist of one or two radar teams with the PSNR-2 [type of ground reconnaissance search radar] (or PSNR-5 or SBR-3 [type of short-range reconnaissance radar]). The posts are put out individually or included in the guard detail. AMP-90, Luch-1 and Luch-2 searchlight stations and PZS [mobile battery charging station] searchlights powered from special mobile generators may find wide use at night. Use of various laser devices with a night and day branch, night vision devices of all types, and night sights is possible. To strengthen reliability of security it is advisable to set up obstacles difficult to negotiate, such as two rows of 12-strand barbed wire reinforced by a metal net and deflectors [kozyrki]. It is recommended setting up low wire entanglements between outer and inner perimeters of an obstacle, outfitting observation towers with bulletproof walls, and equipping personnel of the guard detail duty shift with Sirena, Palma or Romashka portable radios. As spelled out in the Russian Federation Armed Forces Provisional Garrison and Guard Service Regulations, security and defense of installations equipped with technical and engineer security equipment can be accomplished with the posting of sentries or by the method of control and security team alert duty. Control and security team alert duty is the most effective. Here the technical and engineer equipment is consolidated in a unified system, which permits promptly sending intrusion signals to the guardhouse. Transportation is assigned to deliver such teams to the prescribed place, or armored equipment is assigned when there is an attack by armed criminals (units). It is understandable that other measures also contribute to preventing weapon, ammunition and combat equipment thefts. In certain cases it is advisable to transfer weapons from scattered small depots for storage at one well equipped installation. A technique such as sealing off weapon storage rooms, rifle racks, and safes under control of the unit duty officer or officer of the guard has proven itself in the troops. This method also is used in storing combat equipment in closed bays of motor pools. Entrance gates in a number of units are equipped with a call button or code pad, and a two-way communications device is mounted on the gate for conversations with arriving persons. Gates are opened and closed automatically and the control panel is in the checkpoint building to preclude an attack on a sentry or a person on duty. From the editors. We request unit commanders, chiefs of staff, officers of combat arms and services, and all readers to share experience in organizing security and defense of military posts and installations and to express their views and recommendations on actions of commanders and staffs under emergency conditions. Your opinion will help gain a deeper understanding of the subject touched on and thereby will facilitate accomplishment of the troops' primary mission--maintaining their constant combat readiness.
