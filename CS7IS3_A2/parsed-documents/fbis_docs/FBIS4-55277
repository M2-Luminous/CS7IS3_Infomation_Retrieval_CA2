At a meeting with the regional press in Warsaw today, the prime minister stated that the government is anxious to preserve the basic principle of democracy so that all of the major partners-signatories to the enterprise pact would participate in talks. That is why the government is attaching importance to negotiations within the Tripartite Commission, Pawlak added. Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and minister of finance, said that the government will not pay for the strikes. Asked about their costs, he said they are "too great, inadmissible, and unacceptable from a social viewpoint" and that, if they were to continue, all of society would shoulder the burden. Then it would be difficult to return to the previous income tax rates, he added. In Prime Minister Pawlak's view, in accordance with the law, compensatory pay for the strikes should be paid by trade unions. This has been the case in one of the collieries. "When decisions are made, responsibility for their consequences is needed," he said.
