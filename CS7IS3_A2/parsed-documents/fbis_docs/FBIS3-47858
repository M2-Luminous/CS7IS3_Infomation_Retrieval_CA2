This has been analyzed as a move to accelerate opening up and actively improve relations with these countries after the nuclear issue is resolved. According to a Beijing source, North Korea appointed Vice Premier Kim Tal-hyon as chief of the South operation team, party secretary Kim Yong-sun as chief of the U.S. operation team, and Hwang Chang-yop, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, to be chief of the Japanese operation team. Before the three new operation teams were formed, the central guidance office of the three revolutions teams, which is totally controlled by Kim Chong-il, was the only team that existed in North Korea to carry out special missions. Thus, the organization of the three new teams shows North Korea's great interest in its relations with the ROK, the United States, and Japan and is regarded as a step to prepare for improving its relations with these countries after the nuclear issue is resolved. The organization of the new teams and appointments of their chiefs were originally reported by sources in Beijing early this year. A government official also recently said: "Special operation teams in charge of relations with the South and the United States have been formed in the WPK. According to information obtained up to the present, Vice President Kim Yong-chu and Kim Tal-hyon, who was recently discharged from the posts of vice premier and chairman of the State Planning Committee, take charge of the South operation team, and WPK Secretaries Hwang Chang-yop and Kim Yong-sun take charge of the U.S. operation team." The information on Kim Yong-chu's appointment as leader of the South operation team, however, seems groundless because he is too old to cope with the changing situation and because a vice president of a state would not be appointed to lead a team with special duties. The information on Kim Tal-hyon's appointment as leader of the South operation team is well-grounded. There was a rumor that Kim Tal-hyon was demoted to manager of the 8 February Vinalon Plant after being dismissed from the office of vice premier of the State Administration Council at the end of 1993. The fact is, however, that Kim is an authority on economic affairs who is close to Kim Chong-il and that the document on his dismissal dated 7 December 1993 reads, "..in relation to his appointment to another position." If he had lost power, it would have been reported that he had been "dismissed," rather than "transferred to another post." After being in charge of external economic affairs, he was temporarily appointed chairman of the State Planning Committee to deal with the Third Seven-Year Plan, which North Korea had been expected to fail to fulfill, established a period of adjustment, and carried out the task of coordinating economic affairs. As shown, he is still trusted by Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. Considering the fact that he was once in charge of North-South economic cooperation, he may have been transferred to a post in charge of North-South economic cooperation, which will be pursued when the nuclear issue is resolved, or overall North-South relations. Kim Yong-sun was reportedly relieved of his post of candidate member of the WPK Political Bureau last December, but maintains his post of party secretary. It had been speculated that he is no longer in charge of South Korean affairs and external affairs. However, on 23 November 1993, he attended a Pyongyang report meeting on the third anniversary of the founding of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification as an official in charge of South Korean affairs, and last December's North Korean Supreme People's Assembly [SPA] session confirmed that he is still chairman of the SPA Reunification Policy Committee. Considering North Korea's plan to promote its relations with South Korea and Japan only after an atmosphere prevails for improved ties with the United States, Kim Yong-sun may be exclusively in charge of U.S. affairs. Hwang Chang-yop, an official well versed with Japanese affairs, who was appointed chairman of the SPA Foreign Affairs Committee, is very likely in charge of the Japan team. Japan has proposed resuming talks with North Korea to discuss normalization of ties between the two countries. At such a time, he is now visiting Beijing. This is very significant. Still, it is very likely that the U.S., South Korea, and Japan teams do not handle completely different jobs, that the jobs of Kim Yong-sun, Kim Tal-hyon, and Hwang Chang-yop overlap, and that Kim Chong-il personally plays a supervisory role.
