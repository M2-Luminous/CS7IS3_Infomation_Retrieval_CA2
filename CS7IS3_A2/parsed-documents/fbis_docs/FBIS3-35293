Citing a Syrian official, REUTER reported that Israel is responsible for the failure to achieve any progress in the peace negotiations. Israel still refuses to abide by the peace process and implement the UN resolutions, according to REUTER. The Syrian official emphasized that Israel's failure to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories means that the negotiations have not achieved the desired objective.
