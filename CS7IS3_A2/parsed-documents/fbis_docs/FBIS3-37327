The Cessna's passengers -- Josef Rimmele and Klaus Eichler -- were in cahoots with the "Russian nuclear mafia." But the Cessna could not have been carrying 70 kilograms of cesium-137, since it would have required a four-tonne lead container in order to prevent radioactive emissions. A Cessna-425 cannot lift that kind of load. The federal police and intelligence service are warning of a new threat from the east. The intelligence service submitted a report to the FRG chancellor entitled "Nuclear Black Market -- Nuclear Terror." German specialists are particularly concerned about the increasing flow of radioactive materials from the CIS countries. Germany is acting as a staging post in the nuclear trade. In 1990 the police recorded four instances of "nuclear trade." In 1992 the figure was 158, while in 1993 there were exactly 200 attempts to sell radioactive materials. What kind of wares are the businessmen from the CIS offering? From plutonium and uranium-235 to cesium-137, cobalt-60, and strontium-90. One-half of the 300 people suspected of trading in radioactive materials are from East Europe. The vast majority are citizens of Poland and Russia. According to German intelligence data, Kaunas and Vilnius are centers of "illegal nuclear activity." German citizens, mainly from the former GDR, are also involved in all these attempts to organize the trade in radioactive materials. For example, the Cessna's missing passenger, Josef Rimmele, had connections with Klaus-Peter Nedvig [name as transliterated], son of the former chief of the GDR police. His successor, Klaus Eichler, caught Interpol's eye after he had attempted to buy a consignment of osmium from a Hungarian. The Russian mafia has spread throughout Germany, the German papers write. The German police frankly admit that, unbeknownst to state institutions, Russian emigres have been able to establish an entire network of firms as a front for illegal business. These firms are in close touch with criminal groups inside the CIS.
