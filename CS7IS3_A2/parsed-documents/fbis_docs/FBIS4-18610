FBIS4-18610 "drweu067_e_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 UNITED KINGDOM Adams Sends Letter to Clinton, Major Adams Sends Letter to Clinton, Major LD0704095594 London PRESS ASSOCIATION in English 0837 GMT 7 Apr 94 LD0704095594 London PRESS ASSOCIATION English BFN [Text] Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has written to President Clinton explaining the background to the IRA's 72 hour ceasefire, according to a report today. The report in today's Irish Times newspaper says the letter is known to have been delivered in the past few days to a senior member of the White House staff. Mr Adams is said to have outlined to the president the circumstances behind the IRA's suspension of violence -- still holding on its second day -- and set out in detail the position of Sinn Fein. He is also reported to have emphasised that the IRA was showing a willingness and flexibility despite criticism of the brevity of the ceasefire. Mr Adams sent a letter to Prime Minister John Major yesterday urging him to authorise direct talks with Sinn Fein, but Downing Street again said there could be no such discussions unless violence was halted permanently. In today's report, the Irish Times said it was not known if Mr Adams's letter had been read personally by the President. But the U.S. Administration was not expected to respond, it added. It said leading Irish-American figures had been noticeably silent on Sinn Fein's call for clarification of the Downing Street Declaration. Influential Senator Edward Kennedy is also reported to have had a letter from Mr Adams and told the newspaper he hoped all sides would redouble their efforts. But he stopped short of calling on Britain to provide clarification. Dublin premier Albert Reynolds, on holiday in Cyprus, has repeated through a government spokesman his appeal to the IRA for a longer ceasefire.
