South-North trade fell by 34.1 percent to 12,578,000 U.S. dollars last month from a year earlier. The drop was attributed to a 49.8-percent decrease in South Korean purchases of metals, including gold and zinc ingots, from the North compared to a year ago. However, South Korea's sale to the North soared, although the figure was still low compared to purchase. The South sold about 699,000 dollars worth of goods to the North last month, compared to 43,000 dollars the year before, thanks to increased shipments of textiles and raw and subsidiary materials for "processing on commission trade."
