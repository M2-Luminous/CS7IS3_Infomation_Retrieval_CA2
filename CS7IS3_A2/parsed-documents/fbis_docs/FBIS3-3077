Koo said that he personally would not oppose Mainland China's participation in the civilian organization, which comprises chambers of commerce in 18 Asian countries. Mainland China's bid to participate in the regional body will be voted on by all other CAPCCI members. Additionally, regardless of whether Beijing fails in its bid to join the group or not, the CAPCCI should not ignore the ROC's contribution to the organization, whose permanent secretariat is still based in Taipei, Koo added. The 49th CAPCCI board meeting is scheduled to be held in Papua New Guinea on April 28. The CAPCCI is the only international organization in which the ROC takes part with its official name intact.
