At the same time, leading CDU politicians have been trying to put the statement by Chancellor Helmut Kohl that German ground troops must not be deployed in the Balkans because of the historical burden in proper perspective. One day before the arrival of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in Bonn, the CDU presidium discussed the war in Bosnia. Considerations apparently also played a role that the debate on the participation in UN operations might lead to a clear delimitation vis-a-vis the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] during the election campaign. After CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag group leader and deputy chairman Karl-Heinz Hornhues, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, too, seems to have adopted a different attitude on this issue. In an interview that was distributed at the Defense Ministry, Ruehe stated: "If a peace plan were to be implemented, we should be able to go to the limits of our capacities." In the past, Ruehe spoke only vaguely about a commitment on the fringes of the conflict zone -- at NATO airports in Italy, for example, and by establishing a field hospital in Croatia. He now only excluded participation in operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the interview, he stated: "German soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina would rather be part of the problem and not of a solution because their commitment and their work would not be supported by all parties to the conflict. Thus, the deployment of German soldiers there is not realistic." Defense Ministry officials have pointed out that, with his statements, Ruehe has increased the range of possibilities. It would be conceivable for pioneers to participate in the reconstruction of the country and for transport troops to resupply the UN troop. However, German soldiers will not monitor peace with weapons in their hands as long as the Constitutional Court does not pass a ruling on the deployment of Bundeswehr soldiers outside the NATO area. Bundestag group chairman Schaeuble stressed two weeks ago during a visit to Washington that, "basically," the government will participate in a UN mission to safeguard peace in the Balkans. NATO cannot sustain a peacekeeping mission if Germany refuses to participate, he added.
