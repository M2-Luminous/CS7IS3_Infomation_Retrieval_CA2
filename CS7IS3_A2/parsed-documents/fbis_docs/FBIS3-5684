With regard to the base issue, Tomoyose said he had obtained a report on the environmental impact assessment at U.S. Forces facilities on Okinawa, which was prepared by the U.S. Marine Corps [USMC] in accordance with a U.S. law. He proposed that "the prefectural government should demand disclosure of the results of such an assessment at U.S. Forces facilities on Okinawa." As an example of the destruction of nature by U.S. Forces, he cited U.S. live-shelling exercises across a prefectural highway, saying: "It is necessary to take up such matters as environmental problems." He pointed out that the USMC conducts environmental impact assessments at U.S. Forces facilities in accordance with a U.S. "national environmental policy law." He stressed that the prefectural government should demand that the U.S. Forces conduct an environmental impact assessment at major U.S. Forces facilities -- such as Kadena Air Base, Futenma Air Station, the live-shelling training area in Camp Hansen, and the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, where parachute training is conducted -- and disclose the results of the assessment. The report obtained by Tomoyose contains the results of the environmental impact assessment made by the USMC in 1987 on a project to construct a landing pad for Harrier jump jets in the northern training area. It notes that the assessment was made by the USMC Headquarters on Okinawa in accordance with the "national environmental policy law." Also, in connection with efforts to enact a law on special measures to promote diversion of military-occupied land, Tomoyose said: "It should be stipulated in the law that the U.S. forces and the Japanese Government are responsible for environmental protective measures, including antipollution measures on U.S. bases."
