However, Lome Inhabitants are still reluctant to go out. They can be found in small groups in front of their houses listening to transistor radios. [passage omitted] Concerning the attack, armed elements from Ghana last night around 2250 GMT shot at Togolese security forces on duty at the main border crossing at Aflao. The charge d'affaires of Ghana in Togo, contacted by the minister of foreign affairs, promised to contact the Ghanaian authorities in order to end this flagrant act of aggression against our country. With the persistence of shooting, the Togolese Government, calling on the international community to bear witness, called on Ghana to stop such acts. Since then shooting has actually stopped at the Aflao border point. [passage omitted]
