He was received by Indian Minister of State for Defence M. Mallikarjun, had meetings with commanders of land, air and naval forces and visited shipyards in Bombay and Goa. "The visit confirmed that Russian-Indian cooperation in the military and military-technical spheres has a long-term prospect," Samoilov said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. "We mapped out cooperation programmes for land, air and naval forces. "A long-term plan has been drafted to build warships at Indian shipyards with Russian participation: over ten missile boats and some ten frigates and escort ships. One of them will be launched for running tests late this year." Russia will supply all the main units, component parts and arms for these ships, he stressed. This means that new jobs will be created at Russian munitions factories. Speaking about a Russian visit by Indian Premier P.V. Narasimha Rao and his talks with the Russian leaders, Samoilov said that the sides would discuss, among other things, military cooperation.
