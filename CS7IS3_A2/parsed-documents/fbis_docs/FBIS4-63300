They explain why they signed the social accord treaty. Here is what actor Mikhail Ulyanov, chairman of the Theatrical Artists' Union, says in this connection: "Men of culture and arts are sons and daughers of their people, who sing their songs, guess their thoughts, protect their interests and laud the homeland. "But they need peace to do all this. If it brings our society even by a jot to wisdom, calm and accord, we must sign this document." Noting that ceremonies of signing the above treaty continue in the Kremlin, the TRUD newspaper deplors that events which took place in the country last week, "happened not in line" with this agreement. Writing about the declared all-Russian strike of civil aviators (although most flights were made according to schedule), the newspaper notes that even if politicians agree on a temporary moratorium in the struggle for power, "it is highly improbable that armistice will come into effect in the social sphere in the near future, since the social and economic situation is not improving." The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper singles out the events in and outside the Crimea. "If a conflict flares up, it will eclipse in its scale everything we encountered before," the newspaper claims in its commentary. "Because it will inevitably involve the Black Sea Fleet which has not been divided up to this time." The newspaper expresses hope that the worst forecasts "will not come true and that the recent contacts between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents will calm down the situation". At the same time, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA draws a parallel between the situation in the Crimea and the one which preceded "the bloody and protracted wars in Karabakh, Abkhazia and the Dniester area". The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA calls attention to a decision taken on Friday by the Crimean parliament to reinstate the constitution of 1992, pointing that its many provisions are at variance with the Ukrainian Constitution and the hitherto operating fundamental law of the Crimea Republic. The newspaper carries an interview with Lilya Budzhurova, a Crimean parliament member from the Council of Crimean Tatars, claiming that Crimean parliamentarians "made the first step to destabilise the political situation not only in the Crimea but in Ukraine as whole". According to Budzhurova, this "will be a conflict not only between the Crimea and Ukraine: Russia will be also drawn into it". The same newspaper concentrates on preliminary results of a successful operation carried out by law enforcement officers on may 19 to free hostages from a currency exchange point captured by criminals on the Frunzenskaya Embankment in Moscow. The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper notes in an article about privileges that the government appropriated over nine times more funds than last year "for the medical centre at the Russian Government", despite a very modest increase in outlays for the country's public health. Nearly 24 billion roubles or 6.7 per cent of all appropriations for public health, the newspaper continues, "will be used to treat the bureaucratic elite of the poor state". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA sums up by saying that "the struggle started against privileges can be regarded as completed ... with a victory of the privileged". The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA prints a full text of explanations given by former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy at the Moscow prosecutor's office in connection with directions given by acting Prosecutor-General of Russia Ilyushenko to examine legality of public statements by opposition leaders on May 9 and 14, current. The newspaper singles out Rutskoy's words that to change radically the present situation in the country, "we now need a new idea, a spiritual and moral idea meeting the interests of people and homeland". In turn, the PRAVDA newspaper summarises the above explanations by Rutskoy where he claims that "President Yeltsin's autocratic regime is now reigning the country". The newspaper features an article on unemployment in Russia. "Although 1,400,000 people receive officially unemployment benefits in Russia, according to various but concurring estimates, between 15 and 20 million people (20-25 per cent of all labour force) work part-time or do not receive wages at all," PRAVDA writes.
