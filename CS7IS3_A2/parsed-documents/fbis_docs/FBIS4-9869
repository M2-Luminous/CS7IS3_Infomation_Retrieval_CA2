Rodolfo Gonzalez Gonzalez violated provisions of the Cuban penal code by using the telephone to relay, in a calculated and consistent manner, distorted information with respect to the Cuban situation and by encouraging, according to the charges filed, public unrest with the intention of causing apprehension and dissatisfaction among the population. Gonzalez's appearance before a provincial people's court was carried out in an unobstructed manner, with the presence not only of the accused's relatives and friends, but also of national and foreign journalists, as well as diplomats representing the U.S. Interests Section and the Canadian, Swedish, and Czechoslovakian [as received] Embassies. Gonzalez, according to his own admission, relayed reports related to alleged unrest in Havana bakeries and supermarkets to the so-called Radio Marti radio station. He also provided reports on alleged abuses and inadequate medical attention for various inmates including Sebastian Arcos Bergnes and Maria Elena Cruz Varela. Likewise, he insisted that a Cuban television station employee on Isla de la Juventud had been fired because of his religious convictions and political opinions. Statements by numerous witnesses, including employees and neighbors of the area where the alleged protests took place, as well as police agents, attested to the inaccuracy of the reports. In addition, the television station employee himself denied having been fired. On the other hand, reports filed on medical assistance provided to Arcos Bergnes and Cruz Varela, who has already been released, including a video showing Arcos in good health, were used to prove that Gonzalez and Radio Marti had lied with respect to the incidents. An interesting development occurred during the trial when the accused was allowed to read a 30-minute statement [words indistinct] bordering on the offensive, criticizing the revolutionary leaders' conduct, without the court doing anything to prevent it despite protests by prosecutor Edelmira Pedriz. Gonzalez had already once been sentenced to 16 months in prison because of his attempts to depart Cuba illegally.
