FR940505-1-00344 FR940505-1-00012 (i) This article shall not apply to any person who manufactures antiperspirants or deodorants in California for shipment and use outside of California. (ii) The requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall not apply to fragrances and colorants up to a combined level of 2 percent by weight contained in any antiperspirant or deodorant. (iii) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section shall not apply to those volatile organic compounds that contain more than 10 carbon atoms per molecule and for which the vapor pressure is unknown, or that have a vapor pressure of 2 mm Hg or less at 20 C. (iv) The medium volatility organic compound (MVOC) content standards specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, shall not apply to ethanol contained in existing products. (5) Innovative Products. (i) The Administrator shall exempt a consumer product from the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (b)(3)(ii) of this section if a manufacturer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that, due to some characteristic of the product formulation, design, delivery systems or other factors, the use of the product will result in less VOC emissions as compared to: (A) the VOC emissions from a representative consumer product which complies with the VOC Standards specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section, or (B) the calculated VOC emissions from a noncomplying representative product, if the product had been reformulated to comply with the VOC standards specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section. VOC emissions shall be calculated using the following equation: E R =E NC Ã—VOC STD VOC NC Where: E R =The VOC emissions from the noncomplying representative product, had it been reformulated. E NC =The VOC emissions from the noncomplying representative product in its current formulation. VOC STD =The VOC standard specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. VOC NC =The VOC content of the noncomplying product in its current formulation. If a manufacturer demonstrates that this equation yields inaccurate results due to some characteristic of the product formulation or other factors, an alternative method which accurately calculates emissions may be used upon approval of the Administrator. (ii) For the purposes of this section, representative consumer product means a consumer product which meets all of the following criteria: (A) The representative product shall be subject to the same VOC limit in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section as the innovative product, (B) The representative product shall be of the same product form as the innovative product, unless the innovative product uses a new form which does not exist in the product category at the time the application is made. (C) The representative product shall have at least similar efficacy as other consumer products in the same product category based on tests generally accepted for that product category by the consumer products industry. (iii) A manufacturer shall apply in writing to the Administrator for any exemption claimed under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section. The application shall include the supporting documentation that demonstrates the emissions from the innovative product, including the actual physical test methods used to generate the data and, if necessary, the consumer testing undertaken to document product usage. In addition, the applicant must provide any information necessary to enable the Administrator to establish enforceable conditions for granting the exemption including the VOC content for the innovative product and test methods for determining the VOC content. (iv) Within 30 days of receipt of the exemption application the Administrator shall determine whether an application is complete. (v) Within 90 days after an application has been deemed complete, the Administrator shall determine whether, under what conditions, and to what extent, an exemption from the requirements of paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section will be permitted. The applicant and the Administrator may mutually agree to a longer time period for reaching a decision, and additional supporting documentation may be submitted by the applicant before a decision has been reached. The Administrator shall notify the applicant of the decision in writing and specify such terms and conditions that are necessary to insure that emissions from the product will meet the emissions reductions specified in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, and that such emissions reductions can be enforced. (vi) In granting an exemption for a product the Administrator shall establish conditions that are enforceable. These conditions shall include the VOC content of the innovative product, dispensing rates, application rates and any other parameters determined by the Administrator to be necessary. The Administrator shall also specify the test methods for determining conformance to the conditions established. The test methods shall include criteria for reproducibility, accuracy, and sampling and laboratory procedures. (vii) For any product for which an exemption has been granted pursuant to this section, the manufacturer shall notify the Administrator in writing within 30 days of any change in the product formulation or recommended product usage directions, and shall also notify the Administrator within 30 days if the manufacturer learns of any information which would alter the emissions estimates submitted to the Administrator in support of the exemption application.
