Following the rapid economic growth and promotion of an open-door policy, the number of travelers and amount of cargo arriving in Hanoi suddenly increased. The situation is such that the current international airport cannot cope with this rapid growth in the long-run. As a top priority, the Vietnamese Government had asked Japan for aid. The Japanese Government, which started to grant project loans to Vietnam in fiscal 1993, decided to promote airport construction as a sales point for its yen-based loans. The total construction cost of the airport is several hundred million dollars and it is expected to be completed around 2000. The new international airport will be constructed in an area south of and adjacent to Noibai Airport [name as published], which is about 20 km south of Hanoi. Currently, the Noibai Airport is used as both an international and a domestic airport. However, there is only one runway and the airport facilities are old. On the other hand, the number of passengers of international airlines which fly to Hanoi will be three times as many as that of 1993 and the quantity of cargo will be quadrupled by 2000. The Vietnamese Government, which strongly hopes for realization of the new airport project, asked a Japanese Government delegation which visited Vietnam late this month for aid. The Japanese delegation promised its cooperation and told the Vietnamese Government that it would carry out a feasibility study, which is a precondition for yen-based loans, from this year to next year. On the basis of this outcome, the new airport construction will be included in a list of next year's yen-based loans as a new project. According to a plan of the Vietnamese Government, the new international airport will be constructed in a 490-hector area of land and a 3,200-meter runway, terminal buildings, aprons, and other facilities will be constructed there. The Noibai Airport will be used as a domestic airport when the new airport is constructed. It is expected that construction of the new airport will be completed around 2000. International financial organizations from countries around the world started last year to provide full-fledged aid to Vietnam. The amount of aid from Japan, which resumed full-fledged aid to Vietnam in 1992, is far larger than that of other countries. However, the yen-based loans have been used for certain projects, such as the construction of power-generating stations, which are not well-known to the general public. Therefore, it is true that not many people in Vietnam know about aid from Japan. The construction of the new international airport in the capital city is a well-known project. It will have an effect of publicizing Japan's contributions.
