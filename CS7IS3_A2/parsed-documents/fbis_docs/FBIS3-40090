Although economic statistics for the entire year are not yet available, the major outlines of the economic growth rate and economic operation are already very apparent. China's economy during 1993 will be characterized by two main components: Overheating and control of overheating. We can gain numerous insights from a review of the operation of the economy in 1993. Beginning Phase: High Speed Operation in the Midst of a "Heat Wave" In forecasting China's economy during 1993, at the end of 1992 most economists believed that economic growth momentum would weaken in early 1993 and that economic growth for the year would be about 10 percent, an amount somewhat less than the 12.98 percent of 1992. However, not long after the beginning of 1993, some surprises occurred in the economic growth rate. During the first quarter, GDP increased 14.1 percent over the same period in 1992; gross industrial output value increased 22.4 percent; state-owned unit investment in fixed assets increased 70 percent; and total retail sales of social commodities increased 16.2 percent. During the second quarter, the economy continued ultra high-speed growth, gross industrial output value increasing 25.1 percent for the first half of the year, including a record-breaking 30.2 percent increase for June. Investment in social fixed assets increased 61 percent, including a 70.7 percent increase for state-owned units. Total social commodity retail sales increased 21.6 percent, and GDP increased 13.9 percent. Clearly, economic growth for the year certainly could not be pegged at 10 percent. Inflation and "Bottlenecks": Two Manifestations of Overheating With the quickening of economic growth, quite a few people in China and abroad noted evidence of another overheating of China's economy. However, one cannot determine whether an economy is overheating simply by looking at the size of the economy's absolute speed of growth. One has to look at whether the supply of resources meets economic growth needs, and whether marked inflation occurs. Throughout 1993, China's economic growth was accompanied by marked inflation. In addition, the energy and raw and processed materials "bottlenecks" -- particularly transportation -- also became worse and worse. Let us look at prices first. During the first half of the year, retail prices nationwide increased 10.5 percent over the same period in 1992. The cost of living price index for city and countryside residents increased 13 percent, the cost of living index for staff members and workers in 35 large- and medium- sized cities rose 17.4 percent. Let us look next at the "bottlenecks." The worst "bottleneck" was railroad transportation. During 1992, the railroads were able to satisfy only about 50 percent of freight transportation demand, and during 1993 the railroad transportation shortage increased without letup. The various actions of the Ministry of Railways proved utterly inadequate. Raw and processed materials also became more and more difficult to obtain. In 1992, prices of the means of production increased approximately 25 percent, and during the first quarter of 1993, the overall means of production price level nationwide increased 38 percent over the same period in 1992. In mid-January, the price of wire rods in Kunming reached 3,800 yuan per ton, and prices of cement (#425 common sulfate cement) and gasoline (90 octane) in Chengdu reached 650 and 4,900 yuan per ton respectively. As of the end of February, the price per ton of various kinds of steel used in urban construction stood at between 3,300 and 3,700 yuan per ton. The energy "bottleneck" eased somewhat, relatively speaking. Nevertheless, the energy production and investment situation was very gloomy. During the first half of the year, electricity shortages occurred in varying degrees in many places. Blow Away the Bubbles To See the Growth Despite the ensuing marked inflation and "bottlenecks," and despite the appearance of a bubble economy in many places, such as too many and too indiscriminate development zones, and overheating of real estate, the high economic growth for 1992 and the first half of 1993 made an enormous contribution to China's economic development, and effective growth was still paramount. Clear evidence of this was that the economy's high speed growth kept within bounds the trend toward a continued slide in enterprises' economic returns of the previous several years. This enabled a month-by-month turn for the better. During the first half of the year, the composite index of industrial economy performance for the whole country (statistics not yet available for Shanghai and Tibet) was 99.31, up 15.67 points from the same period in 1992. Of the six leading indicators, except for net output value, those for product sales rate, profit and tax rate on capital, profit rate on costs, capital turnover times, and net output value labor productivity rate were tremendously higher than for the same period in 1992. Production and sales paced each other fairly well, and funds turned over rapidly. The industrial product sales rate figured at prevailing prices increased with each passing month. Thanks to the good dovetailing of production with sales and the speed up in the number of times that industrial working capital turned over, the amount of finished goods in inventory decreased. The fairly rapid increase in profits and tax payments meant a reduction in the number of money-losing firms. As of the end of June, 17.6 percent of all industrial enterprises showed a loss. This was a 1.7 percentage point decline from the same period in 1992. Overall, with the high speed operation of the economy, total industrial economic returns approached the average level of the Seventh Five-Year Plan. If the returns of Shanghai's industrial economy are figured in, the total exceeded that of the Seventh Five-Year Plan. By comparison, with the sustained decline in economic returns during the period of improving the economic environment and rectifying the economic order, it is easy to see that the economy's high growth undeniably increased national economic strength. Middle Phase: Soft Landing, Major Readjustment of Macroeconomic Policy Just when the whole country, and even the whole world, was regarding China's economy with alarm and wondering where this "express train" was headed, China's macroeconomic policy underwent a major change: On 15 May, the Chinese People's Bank announced a raise in the interest rate on bank savings deposits, the interest rate on savings rising an average 1.19 percentage points, and the interest rate on loans rising an average 0.82 percentage points. This was the first change in bank interest rates in two years. Next, the State Council inaugurated a series of emergency measures such as raising the interest rate on savings and loans, tightening the money supply, rectifying the financial order, putting development zones on a tight leash, taking drastic action to control real estate overheating, and reducing fiscal expenditures. The inauguration of this series of macroeconomic regulation and control measures was an inevitable reaction of the central policy makers to the marked overheating of the economy. However, this macroeconomic regulation and control differed from the improvement of the economic environment and rectification of the economic order in 1989. Central Committee leaders reiterated under numerous important circumstances that the increase in macroeconomic regulation and control was not an across-the-board tightening. Its purpose was to control economic overheating and to protect both economic growth and the impetus of reform. In economic parlance, this regulation and control approach was a "soft landing." General Slowing of the Economy During July Inauguration of the Central Committee's macroeconomic regulation and control policies in May had a marked effect very rapidly on real estate, stocks, and development zones. Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi conducted a one-time check of development zones at the county level and above. As a result, the number of development zones in these six provinces and one autonomous region decreased from more than 1,200 to more than 200, the plan area contracting from more than 7,500 to 1,600 square kilometers. Real estate in all the jurisdictions slumped and land prices plummeted. However, the macroeconomic regulation and control had no immediate effect on industrial production. In June, industrial growth nationwide reached a record breaking 30 percent. A questionnaire survey of the prosperity of 5,000 industrial concerns in 12 provinces that the departments concerned conducted showed that these 5,000 concerns maintained the rising momentum of the second quarter after entering the third quarter. However, 75 percent of the concerns did feel a shortage of working capital, the working capital situation reaching the lowest point in recent years. The effect of macroeconomic regulation and control on industrial production began in mid-July. The 19 August State Statistical Bureau report on the economy during July said that industrial concerns at the township level and above throughout the country showed an output value of 286.3 billion yuan for July, up 25.1 percent over the same period in 1992. This was a 5.1 percentage point downturn from June, and marked the first time in more than 30 months that the State Statistical Bureau reported a substantial downturn in industrial growth. In addition, investment in fixed assets for newly opened projects declined; buying and selling of means of production slowed; and trading volume dropped. It was inland and state-owned enterprises that were most quickly and hardest hit by this macroeconomic readjustment and control. In terms of ownership, the July output value of state-owned, collective, and township-operated and other kinds of industries was 8.7, 43.4, and 70.3 percent of the total, the township-operated and other kinds of industries still maintaining high speed growth. By comparison with June, state-owned, collective, township-operated, and other kinds of industries showed a downturn in industrial growth of 4, 7.2, 7, and 1.2 percentage points respectively. The downturn in industries under other forms of ownership was least, showing the aptness of the macroeconomic regulation and control policy to be very great. In terms of region, southeast coastal area maintain growth leadership. Except for Shanghai, Hainan, and Xinjiang, growth decline in varying degrees in every region. Places having a growth higher than the national average in July were Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, and Hainan provinces. In the eastern, central and western parts of the country, gross industrial output value increased in July by 30.1, 17.3, and 13.7 percent. During July, growth of industrial production took a downturn in 26 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the area of greatest downturn being concentrated mostly in the central and western regions. The downturn was fairly slight in coastal areas such as Guangdong, Hainan, and Shanghai Regulation and Control Measures Largely in Place by September If one says that people saw only a little evidence of macroeconomic regulation and control in September, by October, following the central government's inauguration of macroeconomic regulation and control measures, the general effect of the soft landing of China's economy had become apparent. From the beginning of the third quarter, growth of industrial production took a downturn, but still maintained a pattern of fairly rapid growth. After reaching a peak of 30.2 percent in June, growth of industrial production at the township level and above began a month-by-month downturn. During the third quarter, growth was 22.6 percent, including 19.1 percent for September. During October, growth of industrial production continue a descent. In November, it was 18.9 percent. The total figure for January through November was 22.7 percent. The overly rapid increase in investment in fixed assets was brought under control. State-owned units investment growth declined from 70.7 percent for the first half of the year to 61.7 percent during the third quarter. This included a 56.5 percent rate for September. During October, investment continued to cool, investment by state-owned units in fixed assets for that month increasing 58.4 percent. Total growth for the period January through October was 65.2 percent. Markets stable while prospering. With the entry into the third quarter, the buying up of consumer goods as a hedge against currency value loss abated, and group consumption inflation was brought under control. Social commodity retail sales totaled 968.7 billion yuan for the first through the third quarters, up 22.4 percent from the same period in 1992. After deducting for price rises, the actual increase was 9.3 percent. In November, social commodity retail sales increased 19.8 percent. Means of production markets cooled greatly, the increase in sales declining from the 49.5 percent of the first half of the year to 27.3 percent in the third quarter. Speculative buying and selling weakened markedly, and the shortage of means of production eased. Prices fell. Prices of finished steel used in construction fell from 4,100 yuan per ton in June to 3,050 yuan per ton in September. The finance and banking, and the fiscal and tax sectors turned for the better. Uncontrolled lending, uncontrolled fund raising, uncontrolled establishment of financial institutions were brought under control. Individual savings mounted month by month. As of the end of September, savings accounts contained a balance of 1.3867 trilling yuan, 232.2 billion yuan more than at the end of 1992. Stock markets, futures markets, foreign exchange markets, the real estate market, and development zones all turned for the better. Investment in commercial housing turned downward. Real estate prices in coastal areas declined about 20 percent. Development of futures markets and stock markets gradually stabilized. The foreign exchange swap market rate for the renminbi stabilized at 8 yuan to $1.00. About 8 yuan is a rather reasonable price. All in all, thanks to the strong macroeconomic regulation and control from May through August, positive changes appeared in the operation of the economy. The macroeconomic environment was relatively stable, and "bottlenecks," which are one of two signs of economic overheating, eased markedly. The rise in prices also receded slightly. September macroeconomic monitoring and early warning indicators showed that the economic situation had receded from the middle of the "red light zone" (i.e., overheating) of the first half of the year to the lower end of the "red light zone." Intensity: From Strengthening to Fine Tuning Because of the difficulty in getting the intensity of retrenchment just right, some negative results accompanied the macroeconomic regulation and control process, principal of which was a general shortage of funds in enterprises because of the tightening of the money supply. Although the shortage of funds in enterprises only began to appear in April 1993, by the middle of July, it suddenly intensified. Triangular debt reappeared, and with much greater force than previously. In some enterprises, sales slackened, inventories rose, and enterprises delayed paying each other. As of the end of July, net accounts receivable of industries within budget nationwide totaled 173.4 billion yuan, up 24.8 billion from the same period in 1992. Some concerns that showed good returns amd that were developing at moderate speed during the first half of the year saw a sudden slide in production and returns during the second half of the year because of the funds shortage. Some experts said that without some moderation of the intensity of regulation and control, the landing would be hard rather than soft. The negative effects that grew out of this macroeconomic regulation and control were attributable, to a very large extent, to China's finance and banking system. China's banks are neither like banks that operate for policy reasons nor like commercial banks. They have the authority of banks that operate for policy reasons, and they are strongly mindful of their own economic interests. Under these circumstances, it is very difficult to regulate and control the economy effectively in an appropriate way. During the financial consolidation, the central government asked the banks to straighten out their loans, and they asked the banks to recall the 90 billion yuan they had invested in real estate. In fact, however, this 90 billion yuan had been buried in the ground and could not be easily taken back. What was to be done? Restricting normal credit was all that could be done. Enterprises everywhere had a strong reaction to this action by the banks. After discovering this problem, the central government immediately reduced the intensity of regulation and control, and infused some money with the result that enterprises' money supply began to improve during October. In October, banks and credit cooperatives issued 71.2 billion yuan in new credit, 27.4 billion yuan more than during the same month in 1992. Seventy percent of it was credit to be used as working capital. With the moderate easing of the money supply, enterprises' savings reversed the several month sustained decline. Enterprises made new deposits of 24.7 billion yuan during the month, 2.4 billion more than during the same month in 1992, thereby showing an increase in enterprises ability to pay. Currency issuance continued to be effectively controlled, 8.8 billion yuan less put into circulation during October than during the same month in 1992. The specialized banks' payment reserves rate climbed to around 10 percent thereby changing the payment difficulty situation. Final Phase: High Growth a Foregone Conclusion, Three Problems Require Solution Despite the easing of the speed of economic growth during the last half of the year, because of the ultrahigh speed growth of the first half of the year, speed of economic growth for the year as a whole will still be high in 1993. According to State Statistical Bureau statistics, GNP for the year will break the 3 trillion yuan mark. Figured at comparable prices, this is an approximately 13 percent increase over 1992. Other major economic indicators are as follows: Industry Gross output value of industry at the township level and above will be about 21 percent greater than in 1992. If village level and above industry is included, the increase will be about 23 percent. Agriculture Forecasts call for the gross output of grain to maintain the 885 billion jin level of 1992., the gross output value of agriculture for the year increasing 4 percent over 1992. Investment Investment in social fixed assets for the year will total 1.15 trillion yuan in an approximately 46 percent increase over 1992, making this the highest investment growth year since the 1980s. Markets Social commodity retail sales for the year will total 1.35 trillion yuan in an approximately 23 percent increase over 1992. After deducting for price rises, the actual increase will be about 9 percent. Foreign Trade Exports for the year will total between $90 billion and $93 billion, up 6 to 8 percent over 1992. Total imports will break the $100 billion mark, up more than 24 percent. However, simultaneous with the sustained high growth of the economy as a whole and the achievements made in macroeconomic regulation and control, several glaring problems appeared in the operation of the economy during 1993 that will require solution during practice in the future. Speed and Health: How To Combine the Two The high economic growth of the first half of 1993, and the macroeconomic regulation and control process during the last half of the year confronted us with an extremely acute problem: how to make economic development both speedy and healthy. During the past several years, the economic development policy of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council has been "sustained, steady, and coordinated." The Third Plenary Session of the 13th Party Central Committee changed this, proposing a "sustained, speedy, and healthy" policy. This policy adjustment was necessary because China's economy needs high speed. China's economy is facing enormous international challenges. If China is to become a world economic power in the twenty-first century, slow speed economic development will not do, and medium speed development will not do either. Only sustained high speed development can make up for China's being a late comer, and establish an invincible position for China in international competition. However, attaining sustained, rapid, and healthy development is by no means easy. Since 1978, China's economy has gone through three major fluctuations, namely between 1978 and 1982, between 1983 and 1986, and between 1987 and 1991. The process in each fluctuation was rapid economic development leading to economic overheating, and culminating in urgent retrenchment. This means that for the past more than a decade, China's economy has been unable to escape from a cycle of overheating once restraints are removed and ruin when restraints are reimposed. This includes the economic heating of 1988 and the economic slide of 1989, which are still fresh in people's memories. The high economic growth of 1992 and 1993 are likewise confronting an overheating threat. The macroeconomic regulation and control of the last half of the year was also undertaken because no alternative existed. Mindful of the lessons of past economic retrenchments, the approach that the Central Committee took this time in increasing macroeconomic regulation and control was a soft landing. Nevertheless, in the regulation and control process, a severe shortage of enterprise funds appeared, and production faced a difficult period of slippage; thus, large amounts of money had to be provided. Seemingly, the attainment of both rapid and healthy development is a major problem that China will have to solve in the future. Prices: A Wild Horse That Has Not Yet Been Broken While the overheated economy was beginning to cool during the last half of the year, skyrocketing prices had yet to be brought under effective control. The price index remained high with no sign of coming down. State Statistical Bureau statistics showed an average 12 percent rise in retail prices for the first three quarters, and a 14 percent rise in the cost of living. This included an 18.9 percent rise in 35 large- and medium-sized cities. In October, the rise in prices still showed some resilience, the cost of living index in 35 large- and medium-sized cities increasing to 21.1 percent. The continuation of prices at a fairly high level was attributable to the following several factors: First, the cost of living index is a lagging indicator. Even though the economy is cooling now, the lag effect of the previous phase of economic overheating still plays a role on consumer prices. This is to say that during the ultrahigh speed economic development period of 1992 and the first half of 1993, prices of the means of production rose rapidly because of the effect of too vigorous demand. This caused a rise in consumer goods production costs. There is a lag period between the rise in prices of means of production and the rise in prices of consumer goods. Second, during 1993, the state substantially readjusted or decontrolled prices of numerous daily necessities and services, such as the prices paid for grain, nonstaple foods, fuel, house rent and electricity, transportation, and school expenses. Prices of these essentials rose considerably. Since no substitutes could be found following the rise in prices of these essentials, the cost of living rose without let up. Third, as income levels rose, consumer goods of different qualities gradually appeared. The high consumption of people having high incomes propelled a rise in prices of consumer goods. Fourth, changes in the renminbi-U.S. dollar exchange rate caused prices of imported consumer goods to shoot up. This also abetted the rise in prices of consumer goods. Given China's present economic system, complete elimination of inflation during the near term is impossible. Nor is it necessary. The key lies in getting the citizenry and other quarters to accept it. The emphasis of macroeconomic regulation and control has to be on holding the rise in prices below 10 percent. The current extent of price rises is clearly too high. By increasing the intensity of macroeconomic regulation and control, and halting the inauguration of new price reform measures, skyrocketing prices may be brought under control. However, speed of economic growth may be too low, and plans for further deregulation of the prices of products of some basic industries in 1994 will come to naught. If prices continue to rise beyond controllable limits, the direction of macroeconomic regulation and control can be changed, financial controls relaxed, but this would mean that the as yet not fully cooled economy would face more overheating. Clearly, unless there is a marked price recession in early 1994, a timely change in policies to influence subsequent macroeconomic regulation and control will be necessary. Quick Returns: When Will a Change Occur? Yet another problem is the conflict between speed and returns. Returns from China's industrial economy are characterized by quick returns. This was particularly so during 1993. As the speed of economic growth changed, economic returns from industry nationwide were strikingly different during the first half and the second half of the year. The composite index for returns from the industrial economy nationwide (no statistics available from Shanghai) for the first six months of the year was 99.31. This was 15.67 points higher than for the same period in 1992. If the statistics for Shanghai are included, the national economic returns composite index is more than 100. As the speed of economic growth began a downturn in June, the economic returns of industrial firms also began a gradual descent. Statistics from 360,000 independently accounting industrial concerns at the township level and above throughout the country showed a composite index for industrial economy returns of 98.67 for the period January through July, 96.63 for the period January through August, 96.34 for the period January through September, and 95.21 for the period January through October. This represented a respective 0.64, 2.68, 2.97, and 4.10 percentage point decline from the January through June 99.31 economic return composite index. It included a marked decline for light and heavy industry. Twenty-five of the country's 29 regions (not including Tibet) were affected. The direct reasons for the decline in returns of the industrial economy over such a wide area were, first, the accumulation of goods in inventory and payment defaults, which caused a decline in the money utilization rate. Second was a rise in enterprise losses. A more deep-seated reason was that once quick return industries encountered a cooling of the economy, their production cycles did not work well, leading to a decline in economic returns. So-called quick returns means nonintensive economic returns. Specifically, quick return industries may be generally characterized as follows: First, their product make-up is ill-conceived; second, product quality is rather poor; and third, their management and technology is antiquated, their labor productivity rate is low, their energy and materials utilization rate is low, and waste is great. Since they are innately inferior, the ratio between input and effective output of such industries is low, and consumption per unit of product produced is high. When the economy is developing rapidly, large social demand makes the sale of their products easy. Even though consumption per unit of product produced is high, such concerns can manage because of their quick economic returns. However, once social demand shrinks absolutely, or growth declines, sales become difficult because of the high cost of producing products, and the level of economic returns decline as well. During the period of a country's economic takeoff, quick return industries are an inevitable phase. They also make a contribution to high speed development of the economy. However, if no change is made in quick returns, macroeconomic policy is likely to end up in two predicaments: Too high a speed means proneness to overheating; too low a speed means a great decline in economic returns may occur. Such a situation occurred once during 1989, and it has appeared again in 1993. Therefore, both macroeconomic policymakers and the operators of concerns should see quick returns for what they are. They should not be overly optimistic about the temporary great increase in quick returns. They must take actions to reduce, insofar as possible, the period of quick returns.
