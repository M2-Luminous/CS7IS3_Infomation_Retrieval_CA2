Let those who do not rely on law blush for their conduct," said Alexey Kazannik, former Russian prosecutor general, as he parted with his colleagues on Monday. Kazannik's resignation was accepted by Russian president on February 26. Addressing his colleagues, Kazannik explained his resignation, saying that he had been put under pressure from high-ranking officials from the president's administration who demanded that the resolution on amnesty adopted by the State Duma be suspended. "As a supporter and authorised official of President Yeltsin, I had to carry out any presidential orders, even of they were illegal," Kazannik said. On the other hand, Kazannik referred to officials of the prosecutor's office who believe that "there are no legal grounds to do anything against this amnesty." Facing a complex dilemma, Kazannik tried to "personally get in touch with the Russian president and explain the situation to him." However, he failed to do this and decided to resign from his post. Kazannik declared that Aleksey Ilushenko, temporarily appointed to the post of the prosecutor general by the Russian president, as a chairman of the control department of the president's administration, had called on him to prevent putting the resolution an amnesty into effect. This "illegal" demand, as Kazannik put it, was made by participants in an emergency meeting held to discuss the only one problem -- how to prevent the amnesty and who adopted a decision not to let prisoners out of Lefortovo whatever the cost might be.
