The spokesman did not suggest any reason for the postponement. However, Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs made it clear addressing a briefing in Riga Tuesday, the reason is the dissatisfaction of the Latvian side by the explanations suggested by Russian officials for the Russian president's decision on the creation of military bases. (INTERFAX Note: The decision of April 5 spread by the media said about Russia's intention to create military bases in the CIS countries and Latvia. Later the document was disavowed by representatives of the foreign and defense ministries and the Russian presidential structures as a consequences of a "technical mistake" or even "provocation") The Latvian leadership insists that Boris Yeltsin personally disavow the decision which, by Riga's estimates, comes into force on April 13. Birkavs said that so far the Latvian government announces a "moratorium" for the negotiations with Russia on the conditions of the Russian troops pull-out and preparations for the signing of relevant treaties. The prime minister also said there is no need in the current situation to hold on April 15 a special session of the Latvian parliament which is to debate the package of Latvian-Russian agreements. He also said that unless the Russian president withdraw the above document, Latvia will continue negotiations in no way. If so, Birkavs said, "Latvia will channel its entire activities towards the West" to obtain Latvia's stance on the swift and complete withdrawal of the Russian troops and the repatriation of the retired officers. Birkavs said that the first step in this direction had been made by President Ulmanis who left Sunday for a tour of Denmark, France and Britain. Birkavs said that Latvia should make the maximal use of the situation that shaped up after Yeltsin's decision was made public, and through further talks to achieve that Russia meet some additional demands, for example, on repatriation of the retired officers. Prime Minister Birkavs will meet April 15 his Estonian counterpart Mart Laar to, what he described as "work out a common position at the talks with Russia on the troops pull-out."
