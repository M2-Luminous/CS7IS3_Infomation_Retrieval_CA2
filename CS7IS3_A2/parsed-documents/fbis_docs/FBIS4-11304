The conference will begin tomorrow and last until Sunday in the Convention Palace in Havana. The group traveled by charter flight directly from Miami and immediately went to the Comodoro Hotel, on Havana's west coast, where they will be lodged and where the accreditation offices are. Organizing commission sources told PRENSA LATINA that the recent arrivals will join the approximately 100 people already registered to take part in the meeting. Even though the official list of participants has not yet been published, the sources said it includes former politicians, businessmen, journalists, intellectuals, and leaders of Cuban organizations who live in more than 40 countries. The invitations were individually addressed and were distributed by local authorities, who took into account the views of the country's social and mass organizations, according to official reports. The conference was summoned by Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina on 14 February. One of its purposes is to "examine measures for normalization of emigrant links with the Cuban nation, Cuban institutions, and Cuban families." The conference is an opportunity for Cubans living abroad to present, in good faith, their legitimate wishes and concerns, Robaina said. Nevertheless, he said there would be no "possibility for political manipulations or opportunities for those who wish to intervene in affairs that are the sole concern of those who live, work, and struggle in the fatherland." Unofficial reports state the meeting will be inaugurated tomorrow with a special intervention by Robaina himself. Other important officials, including Ricardo Alarcon, parliament president; Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of State; and Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and Artists, will brief participants on topics crucial to life in Cuba. The closing ceremony is expected on Sunday afternoon, when the conference results will be made public.
