Beijing must take controlling inflation as a top economic task for the next few months. The State Council recently adopted a series of measures for stabilizing prices. Chen Jinhua pointed out at a recent national meeting of commodity price bureau chiefs in Wuhan that controlling the increase in retail prices in the cities is "a key factor which has a bearing on reform, development, and stability." Urban retail prices in China increased by 25.9 percent in February. The national meeting of commodity price bureau chiefs was held from Tuesday to Friday in Wuhan. The meeting primarily considered the further implementation of various measures laid down by the State Council for adjusting and controlling prices and curbing the excessive price hikes in order to ensure the stability of the overall situation. At the meeting, Chen Jinhua said: A prominent problem in current economic life is the further aggravation of inflation and the too rapid increase in commodity prices on the market. In January and February of this year, the monthly retail price index throughout the country increased by three percentage points, and this was rarely seen after the beginning of reform. In particular, the prices of the basic daily necessities, basic services, and basic production materials that had a close relationship with the people's livelihood and the national economy increased too much, and the price increase exceeded the degree that the people could endure. Chen Jinhua demanded that commodity price organs at all levels resolutely implement the State Council's measures -- principally, to control the prices of grain, cooking oil, nonstaple foodstuffs, basic services, and major production materials, especially agricultural production materials and to persistently give publicity to the relevant policies, inspect the situation, handle and solve problems, and carry out rectification and correction. He also stressed that the State Council had adopted a series of measures for stabilizing prices, including: First, to strictly exercise "double control," that is, controlling the size of investment in fixed assets, which was increasing too quickly, and controlling the excessive expansion of consumption funds. Second, to seriously guarantee agricultural production and increase effective supply. Third, to strengthen the government's management and control over market prices. This includes the establishment of a risk fund for the prices of grain and nonstaple foodstuffs, and intensified supervision over the prices of 20 kinds of daily necessities and basic services that the people need in their daily lives. Prices of commodities and services should all be clearly marked, and nationwide price inspections should be carried out. Fourth, to resolutely enact economic measures for restraining price increases and guaranteeing commodity supply on the market.
