Explosions could be heard from the centre of Aden marking an end to a lull in fighting after the ceasefire called by the north came into force at midnight (2100 GMT) Friday. A southern spokesman also accused the north of launching an air raid Saturday on the Aden oil refinery but said the warplanes missed their target. The refinery, some 15 kilometres (nine miles) west of Aden, was hit earlier in the week in northern air raids, and six oil storage tanks were set ablaze. Earlier, northern army units loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih halted their bombardment of Aden and nearby villages, an AFP correspondent in the city said. Jumhuriyah hospital in Aden, where the fighting has cut off drinking water supplies to the 500,000 residents, reported no new casualties since the ceasefire. The government in Sanaa proposed a joint military commission to supervise the ceasefire but southern leaders insisted on international observers. "The joint military commission formed at the time of unity no longer exists," said the southern leadership, which declared a breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic on May 21.
