The two men signed a trade and economic agreement on the aid Uzbekistan will provide its neighbor. According to Karimov, the document "will jettison the short-term aid satisfying only immediate needs and will tap the economic reserves available in Tajikistan." To help Tajikistan with the spring sowing Uzbekistan will send fuel, agricultural machinery, fertilizers and seeds. The trade between the two countries will be worth $140 Mn [million] in 1994. Rakhmonov said that Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan had been violated over 25 times since January 1. He recalled that the Tajik-Afghan border was part of the CIS common border that had to be jointly protected. Karimov said that Tajikistan could not join the agreement between Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan on the setting up of a common economic space before the Afghan-Tajik border was calm. He denied that his country was aiding Abdurashit Dustum, an Afghan general. In his words, regional UN officials who checked the rumors to this effect did not find any evidence of Uzbekistan's aid to Dustum. In Karimov's view, Afghanistan's President Rabbani was behind these rumors which were spread to make an impression that he had to fight a strong opposition. "Dustum is an ethnic Uzbek. There are 2.5 Mn Uzbeks living in North Afghanistan. This is the reason why such questions are asked that cast a shadow on Uzbekistan," the Uzbek president said. Uzbekistan aided Afghanistan only with "energy which is supplied to Mazar-e Sharif through existing networks." Switching the supply off would harm Afghanistan's civilian population, something that Uzbekistan cannot afford.
