After a short period of general openness of the political life, which was, perhaps, only during the term of office of the "contract" Sejm, we saw a comeback to a secret life. There is usually one rule: The opposition meets and discusses matters openly, whereas the governing parties hold meetings behind closed doors. The opposition which invites mass media to all its meetings, organizes press conferences, and shares information whenever journalists want it, stresses in this way that it has nothing to hide from the people. This attitude changes radically the moment the opposition becomes a governing party. Through a Ladder to Lansk It should be admitted that as far as avoiding journalists or giving evasive answers is concerned, the consecutive governing parties display inexhaustible invention. After one of the meetings of the directorate (that is, the leadership of the present governing coalition) last autumn, journalists learned that the politicians discussed... potato harvesting. After submitting his resignation from the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister, Marek Borowski entrenched himself in his office and it was difficult to "squeeze" a word of comment out of him. The ladder that Democratic Left Alliance leader Aleksander Kwasniewski used to leave the Sejm premises will probably go down in the history of the Polish parliamentary system. Recently sessions of politicians held outside Warsaw have been very popular. In a forest it is much easier to hide from journalists and all information reach the media with considerable delay. It is difficult to say what purpose this is supposed to serve -- the information reaches the media sooner or later anyway. Perhaps it is the spring that makes the politicians seek refuge from the media outside Warsaw. Last Friday in Jablonna there was a meeting of the National Council of Radio and Television and the leadership of the Polish Television (participating in the meeting was, among other persons, Wieslaw Walendziak, the Supervisory Board of the Polish Television and the Board of Directors, the directors of the First and the Second Program, as well as the heads of the regional sections). Invited to the meeting was also Government Press Office Head Dariusz Jadowski and President's Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski (the latter did not arrive). The meeting was, needless to say, closed to the press, even though it was devoted to the activities of a component of the mass media -- the television. The government decided to hold a session of the Council of Ministers in Lansk. The government building is hidden in a forest near a beautiful lake. It is separated from the nearest village by kilometers of forests. Behind the doors there are no crowds of journalists demanding immediate answers to thousands of inquisitive questions. The Government Point of View Freedom of speech and openness of the political life are undoubtedly cumbersome to the participants of this life. The openness of the political life is desirable for those who do not participate in it, and it serves the purpose of calling those who are governing the country at the moment to account. Those who are in power do not like to be called to account. They are not very favorably disposed toward independent press, because it discusses issues that they would willingly conceal. The existence of the free press forces the subordinated press to be objective -- it cannot omit important information because it would lose its readers. Therefore, subordination of the entire press is a desired state of affairs for all those who are in power. Since this state of affairs is not easy to accomplish, politicians are hiding. They say that playing politics far from people's eyes is quite common also in countries with rooted democracies. No one is surprised by the fact that government spokesmen refuse to make any comments. Western parliaments are not visited by large groups of journalists, as is the case in our Sejm. On the other hand, however, in deeply rooted democracies no one accuses the press of speculating, being aggressive and nonobjective, and of pursuing sensational news only, instead of showing positive models and printing official communiques when they are issued.
