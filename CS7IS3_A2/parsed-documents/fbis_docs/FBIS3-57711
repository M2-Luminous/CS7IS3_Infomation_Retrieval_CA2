According to the BELINFORM information, the results of the voting may be announced at 03.30, local time. Three candidates are on the list: Myachyslaw Hryb, Mikhail Marynych and Viktar Hanchar. Myachyslaw Hryb, 57, a professional lawyer, from a peasant family. His father was killed during the war. Hryb finished the Interior Ministry school and later reached the rank of general and the post of head of the Interior Ministry department at the executive committee of the regional council (soviet) of the Vitebsk region. He has been a deputy of the Belarusian parliament since 1990. Hryb is heading the Permanent Commission for National Security, Defence and Anti-Crime Struggle. He is the supporter of strong power, of the introduction of executive Presidency in Belarus and of the ratification of the collective security treaty. He maintains that, when discharging his duties in parliament, he tries not to be guided by political likes and dislikes, but to be businesslike and objective. "We have all come from the past, but we should look forward," he said. Mikhail Marynych, 53, was born in the Gomel region, graduated from the Belarusian Polytechnical Institute. He worked his way up from the job of a plumber to the post of Minsk mayor. At present he is deputy chairman of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations. He is a centrist by his political views. Marynych favours the consolidation of forces for getting the national economy out of the crisis and for reforming it. Viktor Hanchar, 36, is the youngest of the candidates. He is a professional lawyer and an assistant professor. He worked for a long time at the Institute of National Economy (now it is the Belarusian Economic Academy) and became popular thanks to his active stand in parliament, brief and clear statements. He is often called Belarusian Sobchak. Hanchar is an active supporter of a market-based economy, of attracting a new generation of leaders for managing the state and the national economy, who are not burdened with the stereotyped notions typical of the past. During the past several years he has been a deputy mayor of the city of Molodechno. Many specialists, including foreign ones, believe that Molodechno has made an impressive headway in the creation of a market-based economy.
