Valentin Moiseyev, chief of the Korean division of the Foreign Ministry's First Asian Department, interviewed by ITAR-TASS today, said this adding that Russia has already modified the interpretation of the clause on automatic military intervention, which is the key clause of the DPRK-Soviet Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance signed in 1961. He explained that Russia conveyed its position on the modification of the automatic military intervention clause to Pyongyang about a year ago through a diplomatic channel. Moiseyev noted that although Russia, which succeeded the Soviet Union, admits that the treaty is still valid, a different interpretation has to be made as to the automatic military intervention clause under the present circumstances.
