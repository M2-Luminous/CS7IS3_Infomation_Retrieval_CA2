The total amount of all types of taxes that were paid last year both by enterprises, organizations, and institutions in the kray and by the residents of Maritime Kray came to 701,816,000,000 rubles. That is almost ten times more than in 1992. Thirty-five percent of the collected taxes were sent to the federal budget. The rest (456,511,000,000) remained in the local budget. In the structure of all taxes, the taxes with the largest weight are: profit tax (44 percent); added value tax (29 percent); and income tax from individuals (14 percent). Income from privatization in the kray came to 18,366,000,000 rubles. A large part of that amount remained in the local budget. An additional sum of 83,357,000,000 rubles was paid into the budget as a result of checking that was done by the kray's tax inspectorates. Also, the economic situation in the kray and in the country could not fail to have an effect on the quality and the deadlines for paying the taxes, as well as the penalties in the event of late payment or nonpayment. Thus, the increase in the number of taxpayers, the increase in prices, and the increase in the payment of labor led to a considerable increase in the volume of payments. On the other hand, the unstable financial situation of enterprises, the delay in the reciprocal settlements among them, and the rise in the inflationary processes and the indebtedness of enterprises inevitably led to late payments and to the reduction or even cessation of tax payments on the part of many taxpayers. The increase in arrears is also linked with the taxpayers' low discipline. More than 70 percent of state enterprise, more than 50 percent of municipal ones, and one-third of nonstate enterprises were found by the tax agencies to have committed various violations in computing and paying the profit taxes. Frequently debtor enterprises, because of their complicated financial situation, are given payment extensions. In the remaining instances the tax inspectorates take steps of financial or administrative punishment. More than 6000 officials in 1993 were brought to administrative responsibility; almost 8000 times it was necessary to suspend the violators' financial activity. The following are a few examples. In Nakhodka the tax inspectorate required the Korkhis TOO [Limited Liability Partnership] to pay 45 million rubles as a fine for having violated tax legislation. An audit conducted jointly with the tax police revealed the concealment of income from the sale of vodka behind the cash account at the Masmetna TOO; the violators paid 32 million rubles. The Lakkhor TOO failed to enter as receipts the proceeds from the sale of motor vehicles; the fines came to 15 million rubles. The Vladivostok tax inspectorates, in the course of audits, revealed violation of tax legislation at the Rybvost, Mortransservis, Vostokvneshservis, and Avtoimport joint-stock companies, the Rosich foreign-trade company, etc. In dealing with the most serious violations, the materials pertaining to the audits by the tax inspectorates were sent to law-enforcement agencies. In 1993 there were 192 files of such materials, with the overwhelming number of them (122) pertaining to joint-stock companies, limited companies, and other nonstate organizations. The Pervomayskiy Rayon tax inspectorate audited the activities of the Shelf joint-stock company. As long ago as 1992 the Vladivostok Base of the Trawler and Refrigerator-Ship Fleet (VBTRF) concluded with Shelf a lease contract in conformity with which the latter had four fishing ships transferred to it, with VBTRF bearing all the expenses for maintaining, operating, repairing, and supplying those ships. Since it did not have quotas or licenses for exporting fish products, Shelf received at the expense of VBTRF 337.1 million rubles simply in exchange for selling the fish abroad. The founders of Shelf were VBTRF officials headed by N. Nikitenko. It was they would received income from the activities of those ships, but VBTRF bore the expenses. The tax services considered these actions to be a violation of the law, and they lodged an official request to the kray procurator's office to initiate a criminal case charging the violators with malfeasance. Subsequently an audit of the financial activities of VBTRF was scheduled, and that audit has been completed at the present time. The results will be reported separately. The kray's tax agencies discovered instances in which the enterprises violated the regulations for withholding income tax from individuals. The largest amounts of funds that were additionally computed by the inspectors were for such violators as TURNIF, DVMP, Dalpushnina, Roliz, and the Russo-Japanese Rikar [Riccar] enterprise. Over a period of several months the Ussuriysk railroad-car and refrigerator-car roundhouse failed to record the income taxes that had been withheld from citizens. The violation was estimated to be a half billion rubles. Approximately 5000 citizens were brought to administrative responsibility for having committed violations in the payment of taxes from individuals. For example, in Vladivostok, during the documentary checking of declarations of income, tax inspectors established instances of underreporting of income received by two entrepreneurs in 1992, with a total amount of 400,000 rubles. A total of 153 files of material dealing with the results of audits of tax payment by individuals were sent by the Vladivostok tax inspectorate to law-enforcement agencies. A criminal case involving an instance of concealing income was initiated with respect to the director of a branch of the Interfeys [Interface] SP [joint venture]. However, that case has been currently suspended, inasmuch as the violator is hiding from the law-enforcement agencies. The kray's legal inspectorate considers that an important aspect of its work is close cooperation with the customs services and with the tax police. And a decisive factor in the further improvement of the work performed by the tax inspectors, in the opinion of its employees, is the serious reforming of the tax system in the country.
