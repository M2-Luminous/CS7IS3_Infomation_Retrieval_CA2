After the 20-minute meeting with the Serbian president, Agoston said he would be "pleased if someone from the oppostion became president of the Serbian Assembly." The DZVM cannot be the weight to "tip the scales," Agoston said, repeating his party's earler stand. "Given our demands for a three-degree autonomy [local, cultural, and personal autonomy], even the opposition is, to us, like a ruling party," stressed Agoston. None of the opposition parties support our idea of a three-degree autonomy."
