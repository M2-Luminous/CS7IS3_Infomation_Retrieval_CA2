FR941230-0-00094 FR941230-0-00018 PART 663_PACIFIC COAST GROUNDFISH FISHERY 1. The authority citation for part 663 continues to read as follows: Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. 2. A new §663.45 is added to read as follows: §663.45 ``A'' permits for replacement vessels. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the owner of a replacement vessel who meets the criteria of §663.35(a)(4) may be issued a permit with an ``A'' endorsement for the size of the replacement vessel. This permit will replace any permit previously issued for the size of the replaced vessel. (b) The ``A'' endorsement will be issued only for the gear(s) for which the replaced vessel would have qualified for an ``A'' endorsement. (c) A request for the ``A'' permit authorized by this section must be submitted to FMD by February 13, 1995. The request must include the name and official number of the replaced vessel and the replacement vessel, and the NMFS groundfish limited entry application file number for either the replaced vessel or the replacement vessel. In the case of a vessel that would qualify under this section, for which no application has been submitted previously, a new application must be submitted. Application forms may be obtained from the FMD. (d) In the case of a vessel owner that qualifies for a new ``A'' permit under this section, who has already transferred his or her smaller permit, or purchased additional permits to combine with the original permit, the FMD has authority to grant a permit endorsed for a length overall which, if combined with a permit endorsed for the length overall of the replaced vessel, would result in a permit endorsed for the length overall of the replacement vessel. This will be determined based on the harvesting capacity ratings listed in §663.33(g). (e) The denial of an ``A'' permit under this section may be appealed to the Regional Director under §663.42, except that §663.42(e) does not apply to decisions on permits under this section.
