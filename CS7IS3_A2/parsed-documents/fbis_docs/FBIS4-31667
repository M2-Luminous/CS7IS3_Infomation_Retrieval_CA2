Croatian forces opened strong infantry fire on Covic Polje 8 km southwest of Orasje from the direction of Matici at around 0900 this morning. The republic of Srpska army units did not respond because the attacks had no serious consequences. Muslim forces also launched attacks on the southwestern part of the Brcko front, targeting Serbian positions but also without consequences for the Serbian side which did not respond. According to Serbian military sources, the attacks indicate that the Croatian and Muslim forces have no intention of halting their operations against the Serbian defense lines in Posavina, and that in this way they will try to create conditions to realize the goal for which they have been massing troops in the area over the last few months -- to capture Posavina and link Croatian and Muslim territories through this area.
