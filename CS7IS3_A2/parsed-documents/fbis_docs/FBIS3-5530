With Wall Street stocks posting strings of record highs while Japanese shares lagged, net Japanese buying of U.S. securities jumped to 21.93 billion dollars in 1993 from 8.75 billion dollars, the ministry said in an annual report. Surging share purchases from October in the roaring Hong Kong and Southeast Asian bourses pushed net Japanese securities buying in the ministry's "other" category 3.63 billion dollars from net sales of 1.85 billion dollars in 1992, a ministry official told reporters. Steady bond markets helped boost net purchases in Germany to 17.38 billion dollars from 8.13 billion dollars and in France to 10.03 billion dollars from 2.53 billion dollars, he said. But Japanese sold a net 17.96 billion dollars' worth of Luxembourg securities, compared with earlier net sales of 2.81 billion dollars, on redemptions of dollar-denominated Japanese warrant bonds there, the official said. As foreign exchange losses forced them to bail out, Japanese investors sold a net 4.38 billion dollars of securities in Australia, against previous net sales of 1.73 billion dollars, and sold 5.76 billion dollars' worth in Canada, a turnaround from 1992 net purchases of 1.58 billion dollars. Net purchases of British securities dipped to 16.76 billion dollars from 17.06 billion dollars, while those in Switzerland climbed to 2.05 billion dollars from 708 million dollars. As previously reported, net foreign securities purchases totaled 43.51 billion dollars, up from 32.47 billion dollars.
