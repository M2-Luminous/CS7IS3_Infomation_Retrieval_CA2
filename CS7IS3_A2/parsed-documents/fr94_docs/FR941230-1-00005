FR941230-1-00005 FR941230-1-00002 NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION 12 CFR PART 747 Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure AGENCY: The National Credit Union Administration. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) proposes to amend a provision of the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure pertaining to ex parte contacts. The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board of Governors), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) have all proposed to make this same change to the Uniform Rules, and are publishing separate notices of proposed rulemaking. This proposal is intended to clarify that the Uniform Rules' provisions relating to ex parte communications conform to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). In particular, this proposal would clarify that the ex parte provisions do not apply to intra-agency communications, which are governed by a separate provision of the APA. DATES: Comments must be postmarked or received by January 30, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments should be directed to Becky Baker, Secretary of the Board, National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314&hyph;3428, or via the electronic bulletin board at 703/518&hyph;6480. Comments will be available for inspection at the same location. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven W. Widerman, Trial Attorney, Office of General Counsel (703/518&hyph;6557). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Section 916 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Public Law 73, 103 Stat. 183 (1989) required the NCUA, OCC, Board of Governors, FDIC and OTS (collectively ``the agencies'') to develop uniform rules and procedures for administrative hearings. The agencies issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking on June 17, 1991 (56 FR 27790) and promulgated their final Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure in August 1991 (NCUA, 56 FR 37767, August 8, 1991; OCC, 56 FR 38024, August 9, 1991; Board of Governors, 56 FR 38052, August 9, 1991; FDIC, 56 FR 37975, August 9, 1991; and OTS, 56 FR 38317, August 12, 1991). The NCUA and other agencies now independently propose to amend one aspect of the Uniform Rules relating to ex parte communications to clarify that those rules parallel the requirements of the APA. Currently, section 747.9 of the Uniform Rules prohibits a party, the party's counsel, or another interested person from making an ex parte communication to the NCUA Board or other decisional official concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding. When the Uniform Rules were proposed, the joint proposed rule (56 FR 27790, 27793) explained that the proposed rule regarding ex parte communications ``adopts the rules and procedures set forth in the APA regarding ex parte communications.'' There was no intention at that time to impose a rule more restrictive than that imposed by the APA.
