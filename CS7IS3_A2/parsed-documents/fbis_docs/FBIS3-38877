West and east German companies are currently making intensive efforts for the Vietnamese market. They are pursuing "remarkable projects" there, a letter by BDI Main Manager Ludolf von Wartenberg to FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union) of 3 February says. However, the decisive handicap is the lack of Hermes guarantees. "A loss of the deals would be a considerable problem for German companies, because in particular decisions about a specific system are made in infrastructure projects with the first deal," the letter adds. At the end of 1990 Hermes guarantees for Vietnam were resumed. However, guarantees are possible only for short-term individual coverage with loan terms of not more than 360 days. The BDI sees the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam as a signal that should make Bonn guarantee medium- and long-term deals. However, neither in the Finance Ministry nor in the Economics Ministry are there signs that the government might make concessions to industry. As long as the bilateral rescheduling agreement with Vietnam is being worked out, a decision is not to be expected, it was said. The multilateral agreement of the "Paris Club," which ensures favorable conditions for Vietnam (a remission of 50 percent of its debts), must still be implemented by the German Government. There are no reasons to be seen why in the case of Vietnam one should deviate from the tested rule of granting new guarantees only after old debts have been settled. Furthermore, Vietnam is able to pay its debts, it is noted, referring to the country's high trade surpluses in the past years. German imports of 364 million German marks [DM] were set off by exports to Vietnam of DM78.4 billion in 1992. During the first three quarters of 1993 German exports amounted to DM145 million, but Vietnam's export surplus still came up to DM215 million. With a view to these figures, government officials come to the conclusion: "They do not want to pay."
