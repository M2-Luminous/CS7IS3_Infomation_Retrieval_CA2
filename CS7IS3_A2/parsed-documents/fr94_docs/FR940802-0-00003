Comments received during the comment period are summarized as follows: A total of 45 respondents commented on the ARP level. Table 1 shows a breakdown of the comments received by type of respondent.

For example, 0% to 5% is counted as 0.5 for 0% and 0.5%. Respondents favored lower ARP percentages for the following reasons: (1) Wheat-sector net income is higher with lower ARP levels; (2) the need to send a message to our competitors that the U.S. will not unilaterally reduce production and abandon world markets; (3) higher payment acres after flexibility; and (4) idling acres under the conservation reserve program and annual programs hurt rural economic activity. Advocates for higher ARP percentages noted that higher ARP levels: (1) result in higher wheat prices; (2) result in lower Government costs; and (3) reduce concerns over stock-building. After considering these comments, the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) announced, on May 28, 1993, an ARP of zero percent. The Secretary was authorized to make adjustments in the 1994 ARP percentage no later than July 31, 1993. No change was made because estimated 1994 wheat supplies did not change significantly (up 4 percent) from the May 1993 supply estimates. The Secretary determined that a zero percent ARP for wheat would maintain U.S. competitiveness in world markets while balancing the risks of excessive supplies and possible shortages, signal U.S. competitors that the U.S. will not idle acreage to support the world price of wheat, and signal to domestic and foreign customers that the U.S. will be a reliable supplier. The zero-percent ARP option is the only option under which U.S. wheat supplies are estimated to increase over 1993 levels. Table 2 compares supply and demand estimates under four different ARP options based on May 1993 estimates (the month in which the ARP decision was made).

The 1949 Act provides that an ARP of not more than 15 percent may be implemented if the ending stocks-to-use (S/U) ratio for the previous marketing year is equal to or less than 40 percent. When the 1994 ARP was announced, the S/U for the 1993 marketing year was estimated to be 27.0 percent. Because the 1993 S/U level is below 34 percent, the minimum 7-percent ARP imposed by section 1104 of the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1990 does not apply. A PLD will not be implemented for 1994 wheat because it is unnecessary given the supply and use conditions which led to an ARP of 0 percent. 1994 Feed Grain Program The public was asked to comment on the appropriate 1994 ARP percentage for corn, grain sorghum, and barley and on whether or not malting barley producers, as a condition of eligibility for feed grain loans, purchases, and payments, should be exempt from complying with requirements of the feed grain ARP. The statutory range for establishing the 1994 ARP percentages, based on the supply and demand estimates published in the proposed rule, was 0 to 12.5 percent for corn and 0 to 20 percent for grain sorghum and barley. The oats ARP percentage is statutorily mandated at zero percent. Comments received during the specified comment period are summarized as follows: A total of 34 respondents commented on the ARP percentage. Twenty-nine of the respondents commented on the corn ARP percentage, 14 of the respondents commented on the grain sorghum ARP percentage, and 17 of the respondents commented on the barley ARP percentage. Table 3 shows a breakdown of the comments received on the corn, grain sorghum, and barley ARP percentage by type of respondent.
