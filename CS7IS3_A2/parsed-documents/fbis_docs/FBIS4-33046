He pledged to wage an all-out struggle against administrative corruption at the Transport and Communications Ministry, adding that will be one of the first tasks he will undertake as minister. [Zaa] "I also want to announce that I will invite the deans of the engineering schools to work together to vindicate national engineering by solving the problem of the black stain [mancha negra]." Carlos Bernandez, the new state minister and president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, has affirmed the government's commitment to devise a clear and extensive process of privatization with the participation of national and international investors. He has rejected the prevailing arguments to avoid privatization of the airline Aeropostal Venezolana, because, according to him, all airlines can be privatized. [Bernandez] "I don't believe there may be reasons not to privatize anything. I think we must analyze the possibility of privatizing all enterprises in the state's hands; moreover, when there is talk of privatization, sometimes the very term is not necessarily clear. What we must do is debureaucratize the state." Meanwhile, Development Minister Alberto Poletto has announced he will officialize on 1 June a new 90-day extension of the freeze of medicine prices but, rather, with a moderate adjustment taking into consideration social circumstances and the rate of inflation. Poletto has said he will strongly fight speculation, adding he will use all legal means to apply severe measures; nevertheless, he made it clear there will be no price controls. [Poletto] "We must differentiate between price increases stemming from economic adjustments, such as the process of devaluation, and those derived from speculation by the private sector. I will strongly act against the latter and will try to do all I can to prevent this from happening." We have also received reports from the Presidential Palace stressing the restructuring of Inavi [National Housing Institute]. Francisco Gonzalez, acting urban development minister, has announced Inavi will be reorganized to make it play an important role in consolidating and equipping neighborhoods throughout the country. [Gonzalez] "I believe Inavi has a fundamental role to play in supporting the establishment of new regional housing institutes in all states and regions; this will permit new housing institutes to organize themselves under standardized criteria, thus avoiding the creation of ill-conceived institutes and additional disorder in this process." Alfredo Gruber, the new president of the Venezuelan Guayana Corporation, has made statements favoring [words indistinct] strategic, similar to those signed in the oil industry. The high-ranking official has explained he will analyze each case that requires the participation of the private sector in order to stimulate and promote the various industrial sectors of the Venezuelan Guayana Corporation affiliates. [Gruber] "After conducting an analysis upon the president's request, we must implement the recommendations that are in the country's best interests." Finally, Luis Carlos Palacios, incoming Cordiplan [Central Office of Coordination and Planning] minister, has said the adjustment in exchange recently implemented by the Central Bank of Venezuela will reduce the fiscal deficit to zero. [Palacios] "The government's initial fiscal deficit for this year was set at 2 percent of the gross domestic product. Now, with the exchange rate, I am under the impression the government's fiscal deficit will disappear, and a quasifiscal deficit in the monetary area will appear. I will work to evaluate the annual operating program."
