He told reporters on Wednesday that "Russia was lucky that Chernomyrdin became the head of government". On Tuesday leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord Sergey Shakhray predicted that Chernomyrdin may resign in August if urgent measures are not taken to improve the economic situation. But Shumeyko doubts that Chernomyrdin would resign. He characterised him as "a fighter". Despite his serious contradictions with Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, Shumeyko believes that the latter should remain in the government. "Such a highly-skilled professional as Aleksandr Shokhin should work in the government", he said. The speaker also welcomed the appointment to the government of Nikolay Travkin who used to work as a head of a district in the Moscow region. "It is necessary to gather the experience of every Russian region", he commented. Shumeyko believes that the dismissal of Shakhray as the nationalities minister would hardly trigger new conflicts in Russia. "The number of interethnic conflicts will not change after Sergey Shakhray left the government", he said. The speaker also played down fears caused by Shakhray's predictions that a new stand-off of authorities, worse than the one which took place last October, is in store for Russia in August. He said such forecasts have been made each spring and autumn. "A normal way out can be found from even the most difficult situation", he stressed. Shumeyko does not believe it necessary to introduce a state of economoic emergency in the country, but called to pay more attention to the military-industrial and the agricultural complexes which suffer a lot in the course of reforms. Speaking on his relations with the president, Shumeyko stressed that he "supported and would support Boris Yeltsin as a reformer".
