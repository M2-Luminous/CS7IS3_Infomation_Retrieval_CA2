He replied to questions by almost 100 journalists from Slovak Radio and other domestic and foreign media. [passage omitted] Kovac briefed them about the international position of Slovakia and steps being taken to strengthen it. [passage omitted] During his visit, the president gave a more extensive interview to the program "Afternoon on the Radio." We have excerpted the following passages: [Begin Kovac recording] In the last period, I would say within the past four to five weeks, I have really had many meetings. I received positive news during almost all of them, at last some positive news about Slovakia, positive news about the fact that the government is succeeding on the home front in consolidating the political situation, in stabilizing it--but most of all, that the government has succeeded in awakening the necessary trust abroad. Of course, I was interested in finding out why this did not happen earlier--what the reasons were for our image not developing positively and why representatives of individual states were ignoring Slovakia when talking on various occasion about possible incorporation into the West European structures. Regrettably--and this was for me a very unpleasant discovery that I have to bring into the open--this was mostly connected with the persona of the [former] prime minister rather than with the overall activity of the [former] government. At this point, it is not up to me to analyze the reasons for this state of affairs. I am only stating the fact, and I consider it necessary for the former prime minister himself to analyze, possibly together with others, the reasons for that situation. I think Slovakia cannot solve its problems without gaining the necessary trust in the East as well as in the West, in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere. Furthermore, I wish to say that the present government, which has succeeded in gaining a good reputation, should be aware that it has to go on fighting to keep it. It is not sufficient to gain trust for the time being. It is a matter that should continue because it may also easily disappear. I firmly believe that the individual ministers are aware of this and also that their activities abroad have contributed to the more positive image Slovakia has finally achieved. [end recording]
