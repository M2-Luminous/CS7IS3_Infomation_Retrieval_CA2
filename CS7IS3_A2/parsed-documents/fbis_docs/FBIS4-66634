While the reports on the U.S. government's thinking on providing a "one-time" waiver to the Pressler amendment, which bars military sales to Islamabad, have focussed on the nuclear-capable F-16 aircraft, the effect of the exemption will have a wider and more drastic impact. This is because, in addition to the 71 F-16s already paid for, there are three Harpoon-armed P3C Orion maritime surveillance aircraft, along with a variety of electronic warfare equipment, that could also become eligible for shipment. Adding 71 fourth-generation fighters like the F-16s to the 37 that Islamabad already has will tilt the balance of air power against India since it has at present only some 45 aircraft of equivalent capability in the form of Mirage 2000s. Perhaps the most questionable aspect of the Clinton administration's proposal is that, notwithstanding the failure that necessitated the 1990 application of the Pressler amendment in the first place, it is once again being projected as a means of curbing Pakistan's nuclear ambitions. The F-16s are capable of delivering nuclear weapons; in effect what the U.S. is proposing to do is to provide Islamabad with 71 aircraft equipped with a variety of electronic means to penetrate the adversaries' air space and deliver nuclear weapons on target with great accuracy. This makes a mockery of Washington's claim that it is seeking to freeze and "roll back" nuclear weapons' programmes in the region, and indeed the world. It also scoffs at the U.S. law which in 1990 barred arms sales to Pakistan when the White House found itself unable to certify that Islamabad did not possess a nuclear explosive device. Another factor which merits consideration is that the American move will seriously jeopardise the economic reform process in India. In the early 1980s when it had to counterbalance the U.S. arms package to Pakistan, India exercised the option of acquiring high-quality equipment at threshold prices from the erstwhile Soviet Union. Though the purchase was made in favourable deferred rupee terms, it took India's defence expenditures to new highs, peaking at some four per cent of the GDP in 1986-87. Following the dissolution of its ally, India has faced great difficulty in maintaining the equipment, but it could take a relatively relaxed stance knowing that, with the Pressler amendment in force, Pakistan, too, was similarly handicapped. As a result, defence expenditures declined, and from 1990 onwards have been dipping below the figure of three per cent of the GDP. This helped India to implement its programme of economic restructuring and liberalisation, which is beginning to show results. Earlier this year, the finance minister was able to announce that the country would repay its IMF loan ahead of schedule. Recently the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, noted that the new American arms package to Pakistan could cause India to re-think its defence policy. If India is forced on this path, not only will it not be able to repay the IMF loan, but perhaps be compelled to incur more debts.
