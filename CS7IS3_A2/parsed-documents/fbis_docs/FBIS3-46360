The meeting analyzed commodity prices in the province and discussed a detailed program on further carrying out price reform, strengthening macrocontrol and regulation, and controlling price hikes. Vice Governor Liu Guanghe addressed the meeting. He said: Last year the province implemented some price reform measures, as a result the price structure was further adjusted. This played a positive role in stimulating production, invigorating the circulation field, making the market prosperous, and propelling economic development. But there were also price increases in the province's economic operations. This mainly found expression in excessive price hikes after July, which caused an annual increase of 12.3 percent in commodity prices. [passage omitted] Liu Guanghe continued: This year is a year of making overall progress and breaking through focal points in economic structural reform and is also a crucial year to fulfill the Eighth Five-Year Plan. To maintain social stability and ensure the healthy development of reform, opening up, and economic construction, the provincial party committee and government demand that price increases in retail sales of commodities in society be controlled at approximately 10 percent. To achieve this end, the following points should be given attention. First, proper management should be exercised over the momentum of reform. In accordance with central uniform arrangements, the province's main task in deepening price reform is to relax control over the prices of competitive commodities under the precondition of maintaining a relatively stable total price level, to rationalize the small number of commodity prices and service charges fixed by the government, to gradually abolish the two-track system for prices of production materials, to speed up the marketization of production factors, to establish and improve the reserve system for important commodities, and to control their market prices. [passage omitted] In principle, no locality or department should introduce new price increases; if any price increases are to be introduced, these should be submitted to the provincial price bureau for approval. Second, macrocontrol and regulation should be strengthened and excessive price hikes should be controlled. A reserve system should be established for major commodities. [passage omitted]
