FR940405-0-00062 FR940405-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 625 Docket No. [940262&hyph;4062; I.D. 032894D] Summer Flounder Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notification of commercial quota harvest. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this notification to announce that the summer flounder commercial quota available to the State of Delaware has been harvested. Vessels issued a Federal fisheries permit for the summer flounder fishery may no longer land summer flounder in the State of Delaware for the remainder of calendar year 1994, unless additional quota becomes available through a transfer. Regulations governing the summer flounder fishery require publication of this notification to advise the State of Delaware that its quota has been harvested and to advise vessel and dealer Federal permit holders that no commercial quota is available for landing summer flounder in the State. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Hannah Goodale, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9101. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations governing the summer flounder fishery are found at 50 CFR part 625. The regulations require annual specification of a commercial quota that is apportioned among the states from North Carolina through Maine. The process to set the annual commercial quota and the percent allocated to each state is described in ยง625.20. The total commercial quota for summer flounder for the 1994 calendar year is set equal to 16,005,560 pounds (7,257,441 kg) (March 7, 1994, 59 FR 10586). The percent allocated to vessels landing summer flounder in Delaware is 0.01779 percent or 2,847 pounds (1,290.9 kg). Section 625.20(d) provides that any overages of the commercial quota landed in any state will be deducted from that state's annual quota for the following year. In calendar year 1993, a total of 6,403 pounds (2,903 kg) was landed in Delaware. The amount allocated for Delaware landings in 1993 was 2,197 pounds (996 kg), creating an overage of 4,206 pounds (1,907 kg) that must be deducted from the amount allocated for landings in Delaware during 1994. Section 625.21(c) requires the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) to monitor state commercial quotas and to determine when a state commercial quota is harvested. The Regional Director is further required to publish a notice in the Federal Register advising a state and notifying Federal vessel and dealer permit holders that, effective upon a specific date, the state's commercial quota has been harvested and no commercial quota is available for landing summer flounder in that state. Because the amount that must be deducted from the Delaware allocation exceeds the amount allocated in 1994, the Regional Director has determined that the 1994 summer flounder quota allocation for vessels landing in Delaware has been harvested. The regulations at ยง625.4(a)(3) provide that Federal permit holders agree as a condition of the permit not to land summer flounder in any state that the Regional Director has determined no longer has commercial quota available. Therefore, effective 0001 hours March 30, 1994, further landings in Delaware by Federally permitted vessels are prohibited for the remainder of the 1994 calendar year, unless additional quota becomes available through a transfer and is announced in the Federal Register . Federally permitted dealers are also advised that, effective the date above, they may not purchase summer flounder from Federally permitted vessels that land in Delaware for the remainder of the calendar year, or until additional quota becomes available. Classification This action is required by 50 CFR part 625 and complies with E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.
