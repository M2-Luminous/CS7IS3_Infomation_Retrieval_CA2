After being sworn in as governor, Lopez Moreno announced that the state's three branches will be installed as soon as possible in Ocosingo in an effort to deal with the institutional crisis in the state. The new governor promised to be frank and to deal directly with the Chiapas Indians and peasants, and he invited the people to confront the crisis with unity, genius, and hard work. He said he will hold the post of governor loyally and patriotically. [Begin Lopez Moreno recording] I will take office with the state's legislative and judicial branches in Ocosingo as soon as possible. The new government will begin working in the middle of the conflict zone with all of the forces of Chiapas. [end recording] The appointment was made by a congressional majority.

The new governor is of Indian heritage, and he was born in Tenejapa on 19 November 1946. He holds a law degree from the Mexican Autonomous University. He served as education and culture secretary during the government of retired General Absalon Castellanos Dominguez. For several years he was member of the PRI's [Institutional Revolutionary Party] National Executive Committee, where he held the posts of social action secretary, delegate to the Federal Electoral Commission, and head of the PRI's National Executive Committee advisers. In addition, he served as federal deputy for Chiapas during the 54th legislature of the Chiapas Congress.
