Public comment is invited. Such comments or views will be considered by the Commission and will be available for inspection and copying at its principal office in accordance with Section 4.9(b)(6)(ii) of the Commission's Rules of Practice (16 CFR 4.9(b)(6)(ii)). Agreement Containing Consent Order The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') having initiated an investigation of the proposed acquisition by Sulzer Limited (``Sulzer'') of all of the assets of the Metco Division of The Perkin-Elmer Corporation (``Metco''), and it now appearing that Sulzer, hereinafter sometimes referred to as ``proposed respondent'', is willing to enter into an Agreement Containing Consent Order (``Agreement'') to divest certain assets, cease and desist from certain acts, and to provide for certain other relief, It is hereby agreed by and between Sulzer, by its duly authorized officers and its attorneys, and counsel for the Commission that: 1. Proposed respondent is a corporation organized, existing, and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of Switzerland, with its principal offices located at CH&hyph;8401, Winterthur, Switzerland. 2. Proposed respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of complaint here attached. 3. Proposed respondent waives: a. Any further procedural steps; b. The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law; c. All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant to this agreement; and d. Any claim under the Equal Access to Justice Act. 4. This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceedings unless and until it is accepted by the Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify the proposed respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint (in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding. 5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the proposed respondent that the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached, or that the facts as alleged in the draft complaint, other than jurisdictional facts, are true. 6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission may, without further notice to the proposed respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with the draft of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following Order to divest and to cease and desist in disposition of the proceeding, and (2) make information public with respect thereto. When so entered, the Order shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the same manner and within the same time provided by statute for other orders. The Order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the United States Postal Service of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to Order to proposed respondent's U.S. counsel as stated in this agreement shall constitute service. Proposed respondent waives any right it may have to any other manner of service. The complaint may be used in construing the terms of the Order, and no agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation not contained in the Order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the Order. 7. Proposed respondent has read the draft of complaint and Order contemplated hereby. Proposed respondent understands that once the Order has been issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully complied with the Order. Proposed respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the amount provided by law for each violation of the Order after it becomes final.
