Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the CCDI, presided over the meeting. Jiang Zemin said: This CCDI plenary session is very necessary to sum up the anticorruption drive in the previous period and make plans for the next stage in accordance with the Central Committee's suggestions. Comrade Wei Jianxing delivered a very good report to the session. I'm in full agreement. We should redouble our efforts and make new progress on top of the achievements already made. Assessing the anticorruption efforts in the previous stage, Jiang Zemin said: There are four points that should be stressed: First, we have been fairly successful and achieved, by and large, the expected results. Thanks to the common efforts of all quarters, we have achieved varying degrees of success in the three tasks set by the Central Committee for the near future. The results are even more pronounced in localities and departments that have done a better job in implementing this work. Facts have shown that although the anticorruption drive involves considerable difficulties, we are able to cut, step by step, corrupt phenomena to a minimum so long as the leadership takes it seriously, enlists the participation of the masses, and works together with them with one heart and one mind. Second, the work has proceeded in a healthy manner. In setting the short-term plan for fighting corruption, the Central Committee pronounced a number of specific principles and policies which have fundamentally guaranteed that this work will be closely integrated with reform and construction. Practice has shown that this work has -- rather than standing in the way of reform and construction -- served as an important guarantee for reform, opening up, and economic construction. Third, judging from the problems that have been exposed, corrupt phenomena are serious. We must continue our efforts with determination. Fourth, the tasks are tremendous and we must not slacken our efforts. In view of the actual problems that are out there and the people's demands of us, the work we have done so far falls considerably short. Many problems have not been solved well and the masses remain dissatisfied. We must continue to pay close attention to the anticorruption drive. In short, we must affirm the achievements, take note of the problems, sum up experience, keep a clear head, and redouble our efforts to implement the anticorruption drive well. Speaking of the next stage of the anticorruption drive, Jiang Zemin pointed out: The Central Committee has set the basic policy and overall requirements for the work of the whole party in 1994. The anticorruption drive must subordinate and serve these basic principles and overall requirements and it must be implemented in a deepgoing, sustained, and more effective manner. This is the general requirement. It can't be expected that the anticorruption drive will be completed in a single battle. Rather, we should solve the problems one by one, investigate the cases one by one, deepen the drive step by step, and push it forward phase by phase. We should be prepared to fight a prolonged war. We must not slacken our efforts to the slightest degree; we must never provide a "pliable environment" for corrupt behavior; and we must never allow the corrupt elements to act willfully and get off scot-free. In addition to the three main tasks set by the Central Committee last August, the current session has put forward some new requirements. All localities and departments must earnestly carry them out. Those departments or localities that did pay adequate attention to this work in the previous stage must bestir themselves and catch up. Jiang Zemin said: We gained an important experience from the anticorruption drive in the early period; namely, we must firmly believe and rely on the masses and must combine the arousing of the masses to report corruption cases to the authorities with the special organs' investigating them according to law. We must continue to adhere to this experience. We must resolutely conduct a thorough investigation of the corruption problems exposed, especially the big and important cases, and sternly deal with them. We must pay attention to policies and stress focal points when rectifying unhealthy practices and fighting corruption. While launching the anticorruption drive, we must make improvement and build the party as well as a clean and honest government; we must address the issue by looking into both its root cause and symptoms. We must conscientiously sum up experiences and lessons by directing our efforts in this connection against the problems exposed and the loopholes existing in control, rules, and regulations; we must improve our rules and regulations, strengthen control, and resolutely get rid of bureaucracy. Jiang Zemin stressed: The key to launching an in-depth and sustained drive against corruption more effectively lies in strengthening leadership. The party committees and governments at all levels must properly handle the relationship between reform and development and between development and stability; they must firmly grasp the central task of economic construction; they must persist in attaching equal importance to two types of work [promote reform and opening up and, at the same time, crack down on all kinds of criminal activities]; they must make overall plans and take all factors into consideration; and they must successfully integrate the anticorruption drive with deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability. Principal party and government leaders must personally handle the task and solve important problems. They must support the work of discipline inspection, supervisory, and judicial organs and coordinate the relationships between all departments concerned so as to join forces and promote in-depth development of the anticorruption drive. In his speech, Jiang Zemin called on the whole party to further consolidate and strengthen the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the masses of the people. He said: The ties between the party and the masses of the people is a fundamental political issue that has a bearing on the success of the party's cause and on the matter of its life and death. This principle must be stressed repeatedly; the alarm must be sounded for a long time to make sure that all comrades of the party attach a high degree of importance to it. Our party represents the people to take control of political power; all its activities are conducted for the sake of protecting and fulfilling the interests of the broad masses of the people. If we fail to strengthen the ties between the party and the masses of the people, do not pay attention to eliminating the phenomena of divorcing ourselves from the masses, and let corruption spread unchecked, we would lose popular sympathy. We must resolutely criticize and correct various mistakes of divorcing ourselves from the masses. The masses are the source of our strength; the mass line and mass viewpoint are our cherished heritage. The vast numbers of cadres and, in particular, leading cadres must study hard the Marxist mass viewpoint, adhere to the party's mass line, constantly immerse themselves among the masses, and improve their ideological and work style in a down-to-earth manner. They are a necessity not only for implementing the party's line, principles, and policies, but also for successfully fulfilling various tasks, for continuously remolding world outlook, and for resisting corruption and preventing [peaceful] evolution. So far as Communists are concerned, the issues of stand, ideology, and feelings are fundamental ones. When communists divorce themselves from the masses, are indifferent to the masses' weal and woe, and become apathetic, their thinking will inevitably degenerate and it becomes hard for them to avoid corruption in action. At last, Jiang Zemin said: The current situation in the whole country is very good. However, we must be aware that some contradictions and problems still confront us in our march forward and that some destabilizing factors still exist in society. We must attach a high degree of importance to these issues and must not lower our guard. Leading cadres at all levels and, in particular, principal leading cadres must personally take a hand in successfully solving the conspicuous problems in their own local areas. The tasks undertaken by the party committees and governments at all levels are very heavy. They must steadfastly rely on party organizations at all levels and on the masses. The party and its cadres must work together with the masses with one mind to maintain political stability; to create a favorable social environment; to accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economy; to maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development [bao chi guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 0202 2170 0948 3046 4842 3444 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455]; and to promote smooth progress of the undertaking to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. Today's meeting was held at the Great Hall of the People. Comrades in charge of all departments of the organs directly under the CPC Central Committee, comrades in charge of all CPC Central Committee organs and state organs, and comrades attending the All- Army Discipline Inspection Work Conference also participated in the meeting.
