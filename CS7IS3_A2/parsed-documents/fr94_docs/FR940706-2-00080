FR940706-2-00080 FR940706-2-00045 Control of Occupational Exposures During Construction: Meeting The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the following meeting. Name : Control of Occupational Exposures during Construction. Time and date : 1 p.m.&hyph;4 p.m., July 14, 1994. Place : Alice Hamilton Laboratory, Conference Room A. NIOSH, CDC, 5555 Ridge Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio 45213. Status: Open to the public, limited only by the space available. Purpose : The purpose of this open meeting is to review and discuss a NIOSH project entitled, ``Control of Occupational Exposures during Construction.'' Peer reviewers will give their individual review comments and suggestions regarding the scope of the study. Historically, many exposures related to construction have gone unquantified and uncontrolled. The objective of this project is to provide the construction industry with information concerning practical, effective engineering controls and work methods which minimize worker exposures to process-generated air contaminants. The initial phases of this project will focus on drywall sanding and roofing kettles. Viewpoints and suggestions from industry, labor, academia, other government agencies, and the public are invited.
