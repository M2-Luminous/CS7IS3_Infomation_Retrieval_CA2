She stated the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], National Action Party [PAN], and the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] "share the obsolescence and fatigue of the Mexican political system." Commenting on PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo's invitation to his PRD and PAN rivals to hold a debate, she regrets her exclusion and adds that it breaks slain PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio's promise that the debate would include all candidates. When describing what her cabinet would look like if she were elected, Soto says the country must have "true" experts in their fields. She adds that her cabinet would include members of other parties and several women. On the topic of the Federal Judicial Police, Soto advocates abolishing this corps as it has turned into "a Frankenstein monster that is difficult to control."
