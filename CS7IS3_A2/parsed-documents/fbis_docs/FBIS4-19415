Among those besieged, are some 30 French blue helmets. [passage omitted] In Paris, Defense Minister Francois Leotard repeated his firm line. He spoke to Frederic Carbonne: [Begin Leotard recording] We cannot accept this totally shocking attitude, which consists in attacking the United Nations through its UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] representatives. It is not France that is being attacked in these actions, it is UNPROFOR. In other words, it is the UN Security Council resolutions, and we cannot accept that. We are soldiers of peace, and our first concern is to be impartial in this conflict. We cannot accept this, and we have said so. This is the reason for our presence on the ground, and this is the reason behind the recent allied strikes against Serb targets. There will be others if such practices continue. We cannot, alas, rule anything out. We are very careful to keep up our role as a buffer force but, of course, there is a new tension. It is up to the diplomats and the soldiers on the ground to try to defuse that tension. We are not there to wage war on one of the parties, even though we see that one of them is today behaving in quite a shocking manner. [end recording]
