"Our statistics on drug seizures over the last five or six years reflect attitudes and trends. Hashish is no longer the right stuff; people want to be pepped up in order to perform their jobs, go to a disco, or do bodybuilding," said Thord Ohrstrom, chief of the division for criminal investigations at Sweden's national police headquarters. Sociologists and criminologists often feel that police and customs drug seizures, expressed in terms of kilos and the number of hits, do not adequately indicate the extent of abuse. Rather, they measure the effectiveness of the smugglers with respect to the authorities in a given year. According to Statistics "It is, if nothing else, the only statistic with a basis in reality that is available to us. If the rate of seizures for a particular drug is obviously increasing from year to year despite the fact no additional measures have been taken from our side, as is the case for amphetamines and heroin in the last five years, it means that there is a lot of that drug on the market. Clearly it would not be found if there were no customers for it," said Orhstrom. The percentage of drugs that is actually seized by customs and the police is another point of contention between the police and researchers. Ohrstrom believes that he can make a qualified guess by comparing the statistics from the UNO [Report on the Demographics of Drug Abuse] in the 1980's with statistics on drug seizures. Careful Investigation "The UNO investigation was a thorough and careful investigation of the number of drug abusers in Sweden and the amount of drugs they consumed. Our statistics on seizures add up to approximately 8 percent of the yearly total calculated by UNO. It varies a little from drug to drug, of course. It is easier to intercept marijuana than cocaine." The 8 percent estimated for 1993 suggests a very sizable mountain of drugs in Sweden--5 tons of marijuana, 200 kilos of heroin, a ton or more of amphetamines, 100 kilos of cocaine, and lesser amounts of LSD, opium, and morphine. Sold on the streets by the gram, this would have a total value of 1.5 billion kronor. Black Market Infrastructure The total annual European consumption, piled up in one place, is almost impossible to imagine. To smuggle this amount back and forth across Europe, while many billions of dollars change hands in 100,000 individual transactions, presupposes a very smooth-functioning infrastructure. "It is very striking how stable drug prices are. A 0.2 gram capsule of heroin, which has long been the standard packaging, costs exactly the same now--500 kronor--as it did in 1975. Other drugs have not increased in price or have increased very little in several decades. It is as though the market did not permit prices to rise." Strong Competition Presumably this has something to do with the strong competition in Sweden. "If someone attempts to raise the price, the customer goes to the next seller. A Mr. X, who can control these transactions, cannot be found and has never been found, not even in the heroin trade. The Swedish drug trade consists of many small chains and none of them predominate," said Ohrstrom. The four drugs: cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and amphetamines have for many years been the major ones in Sweden.
