FBIS4-61420 "drsov088_d_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 Regional Affairs Stepashin Proposes Tough Talks With Chechnya Stepashin Proposes Tough Talks With Chechnya LD0605121694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1049 GMT 6 May 94 LD0605121694 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] President Boris Yeltsin could meet with his Chechen counterpart Dzhokhar Dudayev only if the Chechen president recognized that his republic is part of the Russian Federation. However, it is more likely that a dialogue with Dudayev will be conducted by Russia's Premier Victor Chernomyrdin since economic talks are seen as the chief means for Moscow and Groznyy to smooth their relations. The Russian Counterintelligence Service Director Sergey Stepashin made these statements at a meeting with lawmakers and cabinet officials from Kabardino-Balkaria in Nalchik Thursday [5 May] night. On the situation in North Caucasus, Stepashin noted that regional stability was wishful thinking without a settlement with Chechnya. The way it is, as Stepashin put it, the republic poses a threat for Russia's stability. For one thing, he stressed, Grozny financially supports opposition movements across the North Caucasus. A dialogue with Dudayev, in Stepashin's opinion, should be pursued in "a tough key," and the prime task is to safeguard the railways crossing Chechnya. According to Stepashin, there is an entirely different situation in Kabardino-Balkaria, where the president, parliament, and government are explicitly in favor of keeping Russia's integrity as a state. He called for using Kabardino-Balkaria's potential to guarantee peace in the North Caucasus, normalize the situation in the region, advance the negotiating processes, and draw up recommendations on how to settle conflicts, above all between Osetians and Ingushes. In regard to rampant crime in Russia, Stepashin urged the stiffening of the federal penal code and judicial system. By federal intelligence information, there are about 150,000 guns in private possession in Russia, and some Russian gangs are even armed with heavy weapons.
