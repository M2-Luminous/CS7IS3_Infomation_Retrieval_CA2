This is the common view of Chinese legislators as they are deliberating the draft law on management of urban real estate sector during the current session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature. They pointed out that arable land of China has decreased drastically in recent years, thus, approval and renting out of the land also should be put under the legal system. Vice-Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Li Peiyao said that it is hard to draw a clear line between rural and urban areas due to economic development, especially in rural industry and service trade. The vice-chairman suggested that a unified administrative institution be set up for the real estate sector and a single law be formulated for both the urban and rural real estate sectors. Member Qin Zhongda said that large-scale development of land will likely take place as many people want to reap huge profits from it. The law should provide concrete regulations on how to save land, prevent its waste and punish those bent on trafficking in it. Otherwise, people's living environment will be greatly damaged. Member Tao Dayong, who is also an economist, pointed out that the draft law under deliberation is very important and ought to be passed as soon as possible. The economist expressed his worry that without the law, the unhealthy development of the sector will possibly affect reforms, development and social stability. Member Zou Jue maintained that lax administration of the sector has also led to corruption among some grassroots officials. The woman legislator Lin Liyun stressed the protection of private real estate of overseas Chinese and their relatives in China. She said that governments at all levels have done a lot in recent years in returning houses to Overseas Chinese and their relatives. But new violations of their rights have happened during recent urban construction and the development of the real estate sector. The law should make clear provisions on this, she said.
