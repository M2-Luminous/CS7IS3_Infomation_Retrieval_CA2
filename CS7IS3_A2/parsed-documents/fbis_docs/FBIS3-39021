With the exception of the French Communist Party (PCF) and the National Front (FN), all parties now favor a military intervention. To the question "to fire or to withdraw?" asked on 6 January 1994 by French Ambassador [to Sri Lanka] Christian Lambert, French political circles are today almost unanimous in answering: "to fire." In other words, to put an end to the Bosnian slaughter through a military intervention consisting of air raids. This change of mind took sometimes a long time to materialize both on the right and on the left. Just as was the case for the Gulf War. Today, however, a consensus is in the works between the main political forces. Laurent Fabius had been the first one to call for armed intervention against the Serbs. "Bombing Serbian military targets is perfectly feasible," the then First Secretary of the Socialist Party stated in 1992. Such a declaration, at a time when France was fully committed to a humanitarian policy, had met with outright rejection. The humanitarian option, a policy which Jacques Chirac had likened at the time to a "poor stopgap," was long the French government's alpha and omega. Former Humanitarian Action Minister Bernard Kouchner, who personified this policy, has now largely changed his stance. While he used to profess his powerlessness ("how do you prevent people from fighting when they want to fight?", he asked after a trip to former Yugoslavia), Bernard Kouchner is now asking: "What are we waiting for?" And when Foreign Minister Alain Juppe suggests that the Serbs should be issued an ultimatum, Bernard Kouchner says that he can only "approve, provided this ultimatum is more than just the latest one in a continuing series." The Socialist Party's position has been clearly defined by its leader, Michel Rocard, who said on Tuesday that the siege of Sarajevo must be "urgently" lifted and that "a real cease-fire must be imposed, by force if need be." Earlier this year, Michel Rocard and Bernard Kouchner had signed a joint appeal for an "imposed cease-fire." Today, Michel Rocard can only reiterate his support to French diplomacy's current approach, hoping that he will "be impressed by the results of Alain Juppe's determination." Jean-Pierre Chevenement has also changed his mind. While at the beginning of the year he demanded that diplomats seek a "political settlement" to the conflict, it now seems that the president of the Citizens' Movement does not oppose an intervention any more. "Today, we must intervene and say why," he said. He added that what is needed is "setting a political goal and then using all available means, not only air power." Leading majority persons have also changed tack. RPR [Rally for the Republic] President and Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac quickly let it be known that he favored a military intervention, but warned that more delays were likely to make it more and more problematic, or even "impossible." More recently, he took a tougher stand: "We must withdraw and then hit them," he said last month. At any rate, the French plan, which includes issuing an ultimatum to the belligerents, has been well received by the RPR, which views it as "the only possible solution" to the conflict. Pierre Lellouche -- Jacques Chirac's diplomatic advisor -- even advocated a broader stand from France, while acknowledging that it would be a "risky procedure." Otherwise, he said, France ought to "purely and simply get out" of Bosnia -- that is, to withdraw its blue helmets. Interior Minister Charles Pasqua concurred yesterday on France Inter [radio network]: "The time has come for everyone to face up to their responsibilities. Either NATO finally decides to intervene, or I do not see what we are staying in Bosnia for. The only thing left for us to do is to go." As for [former president of the republic] Valery Giscard d'Estaing, he called for "an immediate air strike against the batteries of artillery which fired on Sarajevo's marketplace." It was probably Cher representative Jean-Francois Deniau who best defined the potential impact of both the conflict and the French position. He had been the first to call for armed intervention to counter Serb progress at the very beginning of the war, and he was also able to explain that such an intervention would become more problematic the longer it was postponed. Indeed, in his opinion, the option between "to fire or to withdraw" is nonexistent: To withdraw would mean to evade our responsibilities, while a military option would require changing the UN mandate. In all cases, Jean-Francois Deniau implies that it is too late, unless "we go back to square one." His priority would be for Europe to focus "on a few clear objectives, even limited ones, with real means." Last, as was the case during the Gulf War, only the Communist Party and the National Front remained opposed to intervention in Bosnia. PCF National Secretary Robert Hue flatly rejected the notion of a military solution to the conflict, which, according to him, could only lead to a "military escalation." "What we need to prepare is peace, not battle plans," he stated, demanding that a real embargo on weapons be restored. The Communists have been calling for a demonstration to take place today in order to "put an end to the war." As for [NF leader] Jean-Marie Le Pen, he said he opposed any presence of French soldiers in the former Yugoslavia, where, he said, the government had got involved "out of vainglory."
