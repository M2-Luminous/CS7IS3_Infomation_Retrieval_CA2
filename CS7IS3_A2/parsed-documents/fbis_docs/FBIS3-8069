Momir Zec of the Bosnian Serb Army assessed that the decision to allow opening of the Tuzla Airfield "was a good move by the military and political leadership" of the Bosnian Serb state, the Republic of Serbia (R.S.) [in Bosnia-Herzegovina], as "the announced NATO threats were being removed" in this way. The Russian forces, which will control the airfield at this northeastern Bosnian town under Moslem control, will prevent its possible abuse, said Col. Zec to the R.S. news agency SRNA Thursday. The accord on opening the airfield at Tuzla was [word indistinct] Tuesday during the talks of R.S. President Radovan Karadzic with Russian ranking officials in Moscow. The Bosnian Serbs accepted for the Tuzla airfield to be opened for humanitarian aid on condition Russian monitors carry out control as the Serb side feared the airfield could be used for bringing in arms and military equipment to the Bosnian Moslems. U.N. Undersecretary for Peace Operations Kofi Annan said recently that the U.N. planned the opening of the Tuzla airfield for March 7 in an operation which could involve also NATO air support, while French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe recently threatned the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes if they prevented the opening of the airfield.
