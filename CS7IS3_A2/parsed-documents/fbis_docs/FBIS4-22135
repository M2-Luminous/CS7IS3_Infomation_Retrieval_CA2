The Yugoslav Government on Tuesday lodged u strong protest note to Turkey over the terrorist attack and pointed out that the perpetrators of the criminal act had been encouraged by the continuing and organized anti-Yugoslav and anti-Serbian campaign of the Turkish media and unacceptible statements by Turkish officials aimed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Serbian people.
