ACTION: Proposed rule; reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: On February 14, 1994, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) published a proposed rule to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to require appeals above the circuit supervisor level that are related to disposition of retained meat and poultry product to be made in writing; provide that an establishment has 20 calendar days to appeal a retention, recondition or rework product, or properly dispose of the product; and establish procedures to ensure appropriate disposition of product immediately after a decision has been reached on an appeal. The proposal also would allow establishments to accumulate retained product for the purpose of reexamination with specialized detecting equipment provided written procedures for such activity are approved by the Regional Director. The comment period closed on March 16, 1994. FSIS has received requests to reopen the comment period so that additional information may be provided to FSIS. FSIS is granting these requests and reopening the comment period for an additional 30 days. DATES: Comments must be received on or before: May 31, 1994.
