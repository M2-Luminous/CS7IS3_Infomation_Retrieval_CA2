The satellite carries Russian-made equipment to obtain meteorological and gelio-geophysical information, as well as a French-made Scarab device to measure radiation balance of the earth and a German-made Prare navigation system to measure parameters of the spacecraft motion. The satellite was put into the orbit with the following parameters: -- the initial period of rotation -- 109.4 minutes; -- the maximum distance from the earth surface (in the apogee) -- 1,221 kilometers; -- the minimum distance from the earth surface (in the perigee) -- 1,198 kilometers; -- the inclination of the orbit -- 82.6 degrees. The on-board equipment is functioning normally. The control-measurement complex controls the satellite's flight. Information from the Meteor-3 satellite is received by the Russian Federal Service for Hydro-Meteorology and Environmental Monitoring for processing and use. Alongside with the satellite, they launched a German tubsat small detached satellite to test the system of precise orientation with the help of star and solar sensors. Parameters of its orbit are close to the parameters of the Meteor-3. The Meteor-3 launch commemorated chief designer V. Adasko.
