In June 1992 it was found that 328 inhabitants out of 717 in three villages in the municipal district of Tak suffered from this disease. It had been contracted by eating food prepared with raw or half-cooked fish. It was found a great deal among laborers. It caused chronic inflammation of the bile ducts, and, long-term, it could cause cancer of the bile ducts and liver. Therefore the Tak Province public health office advised the people of Tak how to prevent contracting liver flukes by not eating raw fish and half-cooked fish, by defecating in hygienic toilets, and by washing their hands every time before eating. The office also devised a plan to prevent and control liver flukes by teaching hygiene to each target group and by setting up mobile units to examine feces for the people of every district until October. He invited everyone to ask for a fecal examination from the mobile fecal examination teams in each district or from any nearby hospital. The fee for the examination was 10 baht. The cost of the medicine to treat the disease was another 10 baht if the test indicated the disease.
