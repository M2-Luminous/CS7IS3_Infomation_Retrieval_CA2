In an interview with XINHUA, he said that to meet the demand of national economic reform and development in 1994, the reform of the farm production structure must be enhanced so as to ensure a steady increase in cotton, food and oil production. He also said that efforts should be redoubled to accelerate the development of stock breeding, aquatic and vegetable production to provide more and better non-staple food for urban people. The development of township enterprises should be focused on raising economic returns, he added. Liu said that his ministry has made a decision to put into full play the role of the ministry's macro economic control, by strengthening the building of the information system, improving the legal system, expanding capital construction and fostering a contingent of people with farming technical skills.
