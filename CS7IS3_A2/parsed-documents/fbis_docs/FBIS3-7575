According to a ROK Government source, the ROK has adopted a principle to use the resumption of the ROK-U.S. joint exercises as a bargaining chip for future negotiations with the DPRK (North Korea) over that nation's alleged nuclear weapons development program. ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is now visiting China, is expected to fly directly to the United States to finalize the policy with such U.S. leaders as Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry. On 28 March, a ROK Government source told an ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter the following: "The U.S. Forces Korea have already determined their deployment of Patriot missiles, and the decision will not be revised. As for Team Spirit, it may be resumed in April or May if North Korea decides to completely withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). At the present, however, we are undecided whether or not the exercises should be resumed. It depends on North Korea's future course of action." An early resumption of Team Spirit was advocated by the ROK Defense Ministry when North Korea refused to fully accept International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections, and the issue was brought to the UN Security Council. The ROK Presidential Office and Foreign Ministry are taking a positive stand toward the resumption but say that "the timing will be decided on in consultations with the United States after President Kim Yong-sam's trip to Japan and China." Nevertheless, North Korea reacted strongly to such moves, stressing: "If Team Spirit is held and the IAEA maintains its unfair attitudes, we will withdraw completely from the NPT." Now that the cold war has ended, Team Spirit is the United States' biggest exercise featuring emergency operations and field battles. To cope with the exercise, North Korea has always activated its armed forces and conducted large-scale exercises as counteractions. Moreover, even the general public had to put up with evacuation exercises and blackouts. Thus, Team Spirit has been a great burden for North Korea.
