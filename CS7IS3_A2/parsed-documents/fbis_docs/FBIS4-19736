Some of you, a small number, want to abstain from voting against the government, while the majority want to be in opposition. [Segni] Yes, that is the situation. A Berlusconi government is being viewed in different ways. Of course, that does not prevent us from working together in parliament or looking to the forthcoming European elections. [Vespa] But if the four MP's who want to abstain from voting against Berlusconi do abstain, will they be allowed to stay in the Pact for Italy or will they be thrown out? [Segni] We will deal with this if it occurs; I do not know what would happen. However, the important thing is to explain the reasons for our positions concerning Berlusconi. It is not a preconceived position. There are some matters which must be settled before a favorable judgment can be made.
