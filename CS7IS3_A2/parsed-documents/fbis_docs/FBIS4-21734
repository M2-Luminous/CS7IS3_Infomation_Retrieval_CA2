Sources at the hospital where the victims were treated said the bomb injured two peddlers -- one of whom lost an arm -- who were sleeping on the street near the targeted office. The other two victims were an Entelperu guard and a pedestrian who lost an eye. The bomb was in a black bag that had been planted by two women. On the night of 28 March, Shining Path members planted explosives at four banks, three offices of the Telefonica company, and two Entelperu offices -- the latter two companies that were recently purchased by the Spanish Telefonica Internacional company for $2.002 billion. Shining Path terrorists also attacked a Navy facility and knocked down three power pylons in a Lima district causing some short, sporadic blackouts in the city.
