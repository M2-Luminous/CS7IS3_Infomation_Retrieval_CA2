In his speech during the opening ceremony, he summarized China's future space development plans and policies, and pointed out the changes in China's space management system as a result of organizational reforms initiated by the Chinese Government. He also revealed China's near-term goals in its space program and stressed China's interest in cooperation with other members of the international space community. [Excerpts from his speech are presented below.] [Passage omitted] It is well known that since the launch of the first artificial earth satellite, the accumulation of space activities and the development of space technologies over the past several decades have played a special and unprecedented role in the advancement of society and civilization and in raising the standard of living for mankind. For a developing country like China with a large population and extended geographic area and complex terrain, our dedicated mission and responsibility have always been to lift China from poverty and backwardness, to develop our economy and protect our environment, and to accelerate the advancement of our society. In accordance with the policy of accelerating China's economic modernization without going through the traditional development cycles of developed nations, we believe it is necessary to develop space technologies which may pay huge dividends in the form of social and economic benefits. For this reason, a space development program was initiated in this country back in the mid-1950s. After 30 years of hard work, significant progress has been made in both capability and the standard of China's space technology and a comprehensive and coordinated research and production system has been established. Today China is in a position to accept jobs in research, design, manufacturing, testing and production of artificial satellites, launch vehicles and other high-tech products; it has also built up a dedicated, experienced and technically competent research and development team in aerospace engineering. The development of space technologies has a visible effect on solving some of the major social problems facing China: over-population and shortage of resources, environment pollution and natural disasters, communication and transportation, education and cultural activities. It has also played an active role in promoting the development of high-tech industries and new technologies. The next few years until the end of the century will be a critical period in the history of China's modernization and economic development. As China implements its reform and open-door policy as part of the overall national strategy, the effort to develop our space industry will undoubtedly continue to grow and our efforts toward international cooperation will be changed. In this regard, we will continue to follow a path of development that is consistent with China's tradition and its economic conditions and available resources; we will optimize our development program by concentrating our efforts on a selected number of advanced technologies. The near-term objective of China's space program is to develop application satellites and satellite application technologies. We will focus on an integrated plan to develop both space systems and ground systems in parallel. The development of applications satellites is primarily motivated by the requirements of China's economic and social development; it is also our goal to develop an autonomous capability to build satellites that are operationally reliable and will eventually provide coverage for the entire country. At the same time, continuing efforts are being made to improve the Long March family of launch vehicles to meet the launch requirements for different payloads and different orbits. We are currently developing a new generation of applications satellites which include high-capacity communications satellites, multi-purpose earth resource satellites, and various types of weather satellites. These satellites are expected to become operational in the next two years. By that time, the capacity provided by China's applications satellites will have increased by an order of magnitude compared to the 1980 era. We are also actively supporting the study of multi-spectrum, high-accuracy, uninterrupted, all-weather satellite remote sensing technologies as well as communications, navigation and microgravity technologies. Our objective is to build up a sizable space high-tech industry and to speed up the process of commercialization of space technologies. A year ago, the government issued its ``National Guideline for Long-Range Science and Technology Development'' which covers the period from 2000 to 2020; it clearly stresses the importance of research and development of space propulsion technology, telemetry and control technology, and manned space technology. Once these objectives are achieved, China will be in a position to make greater contributions toward peaceful development of space resources and raising the standard of living for all mankind. Space exploration and development of space resources are immense tasks that cannot be accomplished by one people or one nation, nor can they be completed within a period of a few decades or even a century. To accomplish these tasks requires the joint efforts of all nations over many generations. Recognizing this, China will continue to play an active role in promoting international cooperation in space activities. In the past year, China, Thailand, and Pakistan jointly organized a ``Multi-Lateral Joint Symposium on Space Technologies and Applications for the Asian Pacific Region''; the purpose of this symposium was to establish the basic guidelines and to seek the proper format and approach for strengthening regional cooperation. Through multi-lateral efforts, substantial progress has been made in this regional cooperative venture. We believe that such cooperation will undoubtedly have a positive effect on the rapid economic growth in the Asian-Pacific region. China's current economy, its basic industries and its science and technology are in need of further improvement and development. We are very interested in continuing our technical exchanges and maintaining contacts with advanced nations in space technologies with the hope of deriving mutual benefits from such exchanges. In addition to maintaining and expanding cooperative efforts between governments, China also encourages academic exchanges and cooperation on a private level. We extend our warm welcome to the space scientists and experts of other countries to visit China and to give lectures. Members of Chinese academic institutions are also interested in participating in technical conferences on space technology and will continue to be a part of the ``Mission to Planet Earth'' joint effort. In recent years, the five launch vehicles of the Long March family have provided launch services on the international market. They have been used either to carry individual payloads or to launch complete satellite systems. The entry of the Long March launch vehicles into the international market provides the user a new option for delivering his payload into space. In the future, we will offer more robust forms of services such as satellite orbit transfers; leasing of transponders or providing remote sensing data; providing ground systems equipment for different satellites applications; joint development of communications and broadcasting satellites, weather satellites, resource satellites and navigation satellites. In order to carry out China's responsibility as a member of the international space community and to promote international cooperation, we joined the ``Outer Space Treaty Organization'' in 1983; in December 1988, we signed the ``Agreement on the Rescue and Return of Astronauts and the Return of Space Objects,'' the ``Treaty on International Responsibility for Damages Caused by Fallen Space Objects'' and the ``Treaty on Registration of Objects Launched Into Outer Space.'' In addition, in late 1988 and early 1989, the governments of China and the United States signed the following bilateral documents: ``Memorandum of Mutual Agreement on the Safety of Satellite Technology,'' ``Memorandum of Mutual Agreement on the Responsibility of Satellite Launch Activities'' and ``Memorandum of Mutual Agreement on International Trade Issues of Commercial Launch Service.'' In other words, a mutual understanding was reached between China and the United States concerning the ``permit'' issue of providing satellite launch service. It has been shown from the experience of launching ASIASAT, AUSSAT and the Swedish satellite that China has closely adhered to these agreements; I am confident that China will continue to do so in its future space activities and in cooperative ventures with other countries. In recent years, China has also made clear its position on the problem of space debris, and has made a concerted effort to protect the space environment. [passage omitted]
