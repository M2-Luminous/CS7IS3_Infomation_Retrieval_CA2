Engelgardt of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 577.323] [Abstract] Specially synthesized oligonucleotides were used to detect and study SLS polynucleotide chain folding, the theoretical model of which was constructed to explain the unusual sensitivity of short tandem base repetition under superhelical stress to single-strand specific nuclease. A 19-unit oligonucleotide capable of forming a pseudogene was chemically modified under conditions that preserved the secondary structure in order to clarify the state of the timines and adenines. The modification sites were then split in hot piperidine. To confirm the physical existence of SLS, a special 55-unit oligonucleotide was designed and synthesized. The results of chemical modification at the single nucleotide resolution level together with localization of the cleavage sites with S1 nuclease revealed that one and the same base pairs exhibited markedly different levels of sensitivity to the modifier depending on their sequence location, and that those base pairs that were strongly modified were already known to be in a single-strand state or at the end of the helix. Those found in the helical backbone or in the hypothesized interloop mini-helix, were weakly modified, if at all. These data strongly support the model of a highly symmetrical slipped-loop structure with a stabilized interloop helix. To be even more sure, the cleavage representation of the same oligonucleotide with the S1 nuclease was studied. Three compact regions of intensive cleavage were clearly visible: the nucleotides of the end loop and the unpaired nucleotides of both of the loops forming the mini-helix. A GenBank search of nucleotide sequences turned up a low estimate of 518 sites capable of SLS generation. Figures 10; references 15: 2 Russian, 13 Western.
