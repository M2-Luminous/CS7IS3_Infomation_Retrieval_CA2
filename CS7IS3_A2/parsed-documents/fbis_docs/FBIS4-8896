It is precisely for this reason that the postcommunist states expect the U.S. struggle for democracy to lead them among the countries of the Western world and why it is naive to expect Moscow to renounce its interests in its erstwhile empire. After all, even the colonizers of America, Africa, and Asia have retained to this day indirect influence in their lost dominions. Slovakia's and its neighbors' heading toward NATO will therefore be more than arduous. If the Americans sincerely strive for "Slovakia to be a democratic, stable, and prosperous state on the map of Europe" (statement made by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott in Bratislava the day before yesterday), they will have to offer us "something extra" besides Partnership for Peace--that is, they should not confine their assistance to cooperation in science and education but must raise the level of investment and make accessible to us the U.S. and West European markets. It is an unalterable fact that, the more the West is involved in Slovakia economically, the more it will care about our security. Moreover, the West European orientation of Slovak diplomacy has been complicated by the division of the CSFR. A gigantic amount of German capital is flowing into the Czech Republic, and Bonn will therefore undoubtedly give priority to Prague's admission into the European Union [EU] over the Polish, Hungarian, or Slovak applications (although no one speaks about it in public, this is absolutely logical from the geopolitical viewpoint). Brussels will certainly not support the EU's expansion up to the borders of Ukraine, where nuclear weapons are still located. Is the anxiety that the Warsaw-Bratislava-Budapest axis might become a security vacuum not justified? Eduard Kukan, the chief of Slovak diplomacy, said in an interview for yesterday's RUDE PRAVO that "the best foreign policy is good and well-considered domestic policy." An occasional "state show" is an integral part of it. While receiving Talbott, President Michal Kovac reissued his invitation to Bill Clinton to attend the 50th anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising. We may not appreciate this sufficiently at home, but the August uprising went down in history as a nationwide and grandiose expression of antifascist resistance, in which few other nations can take pride. Will our politicians be able to make use of their foreign contacts so that prominent Western leaders come to Banska Bystrica this summer? A month later, the burden will lie on voters, lest we turn our existing policy line toward Vladimir Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy] and send a Pan-Slavic greeting to him....
