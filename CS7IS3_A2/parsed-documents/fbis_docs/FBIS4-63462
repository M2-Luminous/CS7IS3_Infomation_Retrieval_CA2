The Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation believes that our state presently has 42 heavy bombers at its disposal, while the Russian Air Force has 77 such machines. The Russian Army finds it difficult to deploy new aircraft because the financing of their serial production has been halted. As a result, in accordance with the plans by the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense, the Air Force will remain without changes until the year 2000. "If Ukraine does not agree to our terms, the aircraft will remain on its territory," stated a representative of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense. This was reported by the information agency ITAR-TASS.
