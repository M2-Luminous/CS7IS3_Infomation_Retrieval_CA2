FBIS4-33800 "drlat113_b_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-113 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 Barbados Haiti Jonassaint's Address on State of Emergency Jonassaint's Address on State of Emergency FL1306014094 FL1306014094 BFN [Editorial report] Port-au-Prince Television Nationale d'Haiti in French at 1635 GMT on 12 June carries a 20-minute recorded address to the nation by provisional President Emile Jonassaint. Jonassaint speaks in both French and Creole during the address. Jonassaint begins, in French: "Men and women of my country: I have decided to address the nation tonight. It is a serious moment. Haiti, our country, is in great danger. Reviled, ridiculed, humiliated, and strangled, Haiti risks invasion and occupation." Jonassaint says that history, the Constitution, and deep Haitian values prevent him from giving in to threats and that he is pushed to defend the imperiled fatherland and that it will be defended. He calls on the people to mobilize to defend the country: "I solemnly declare that Haiti will not give in. Haiti will not submit to orders from foreigners. Haiti will face them. I have demanded and have obtained the provisional government's word that it will take all measures to ensure our survival as an independent and fully sovereign nation. Thus, a state of emergency [etat d'urgence] is declared. A series of government measures will go into effect immediately. I order the Haitian Armed Forces commander in chief to guard against all possibilities." Jonassaint then deplores the fact that some Haitians have demanded that foreigners invade Haiti and calls on the people to remain calm and attend to their daily affairs. He urges the people to remain mobilized and alert so that they are united and determined, "like the ancestors," to struggle to the death in ensuring the country's defense before the enemies. He says: "On behalf of the Haitian nation, I thank all those nations that have refused to give in to the immorality, the arrogance, and the perfidy of a certain international community, to those that have relieved us of our misfortunes." Jonassaint then switches to Creole to deliver the rest of his address, saying: "Haitian men and women, I am obliged to appear before you today to say a few words as the country is in danger." Jonassaint warns that a giant that can destroy Haiti in five minutes has declared war on Haiti, while Haiti has done nothing to provoke it. He suggests this is in response to democracy coming to Haiti, noting that there has never been democracy in Haiti. Referring to President-in-Exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide -- without actually mentioning Aristide by name -- Jonassaint explains he was a State Council member during the 1990 election, that he voted for the candidate whom everybody was voting for, and that he is now ashamed of having voted for that candidate because that candidate is now asking those he was always criticizing to invade Haiti to reduce the country to slavery. Jonassaint then makes some historical references and criticizes Aristide -- again, without mentioning Aristide by name -- for wasting Haiti's money and allowing the United States to use Haiti while Haitians starve to death. Jonassaint says that all those who harmed Haiti have succumbed and speaks of a president who has asked that Haiti be destroyed. He says that president is now in jail for theft, adding that others have fallen and that others will fall, that they have their own problems in their countries, and that they are no more serious than the Haitians. Jonassaint concludes by calling on the people to unite and to remain mobilized for the defense of the country: "If they destroy us, we will all die together. Haitians never fear death. I (?remember) when I went to take the oath at parliament. I saw the Independence Act. It began: Freedom or death. Haitians can no longer live in slavery. Either we die, or we remain free." At 1655 GMT, Jonassaint ends his address.
