At the center of the controversy is an ANC-alliance document on the future of minerals. The document, which describes mineral wealth as a national asset could become ANC policy if it is adopted at a special two-day conference at the end of January.

The National Party said the ANC was still clinging to its socialistic policies. The DP said the plan would undermine investor confidence and the economy and the IFP said the proposal was nothing less than nationalization by stealth. [end recording]
