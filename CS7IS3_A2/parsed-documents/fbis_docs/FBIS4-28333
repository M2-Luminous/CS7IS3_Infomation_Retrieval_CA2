When we read the 1994 report on unfair trading practices, we feel this sharply. The report was compiled by a subcommittee of the Industrial Structure Council (an advisory body to the minister of international trade and industry). The Industrial Structure Council [ISC] surveyed 10 nations and region, including the United States and the European Union (EU), that are Japan's major trading partners to determine whether those nations and regions adopt unfair trading policies and how unfair those trading policies are. This year, the ISC surveyed China and Taiwan, too. As its highlight, the report calls on Japan's major trading partners to address their unfair trading practices. The report's analysis is clear-cut. The report uses accords of the GATT and the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is to be founded under a new multilateral agreement, and international trade rules as criteria for determining whether trade policies adopted by those nations and regions are fair or not. The report points out to Japan's major trading partners rather than accusing them one-sidedly. Noting that there are trade barriers in many nations including Japan, the report urges those nations to work cooperatively together to remove them. The basis for the report's analysis is undisputable and we agree with many points the report advocates. The report proposes that trade frictions be settled by multilateral arbitrations in accordance with international trade accords. We agree with the report's proposal. The question is whether the report is persuasive or not. This spring, the EU abolished its long-standing discriminatory measures against and quantitative restrictions on Japan. South Korea also has abolished discriminatory measures against Japanese material patents, including medicine, and the country is now moving toward halving its quantitative restrictions on Japan. How about the United States? Of 13 sectors surveyed, the report identifies that the United States still keeps trade barriers in place in 10 sectors, an increase of one sector over a year earlier, through quantitative restrictions, subsidies and antidumping measures. There was some improvement last year. To site an example, Japan ended its voluntary restraint on the export of automobiles and machine tools to the American market at the request of the United States. Meanwhile, the United States unilaterally imposed countervailing tariffs on steel products exported by the EU and enacted a protectionist law governing the standard and certification system for imported automobiles. Last year, the United States revived the Super 301 Provision which allows the administration to unilaterally slap sanctions against U.S. trading partners. This is a matter of the greatest concern. The U.S. market still has plenty of affluence and potentiality although the U.S. economic power is said to have been waned. The U.S. market is widely open and highly transparent. It is easy to gain access to it. Both industrial nations and developing countries therefore are aiming to gain access to it. Japan has a huge amount of trade surplus with the United States. How much did the package of measures serve to address the trade imbalance between the two countries? Although it is said that both Japan and the United States need to make concerted efforts to address their trade imbalance, we cannot help but say that Japan's speedy measurers are crucial in balancing the bilateral trade. If Japan, whose economic power ranks second in the world following the United States, opens its market and expands its domestic demand, this would reinforce the credibility of the report's objective and detailed verifications. The report stresses the need to fully use the accord on the WTO, which is to be founded in January 1995, in accordance with a multilateral agreement hammered out at the multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round), but prospects for this are not necessarily optimistic. The Diet in Japan and the Congress in the United States have yet to deliberate the accord for ratification. Japan needs to speedily defuse the trade friction with the United States and to work vigorously to get the WTO inaugurated. Japan should not let the United States rush to protectionism.
