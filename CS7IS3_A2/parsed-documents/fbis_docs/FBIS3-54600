Speaking to theologians in a mosque here Wednesday night, he said "despite all efforts launched by the U.S. to conspire against the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iran's policies formulated by the late Imam Khomeyni are successfully going ahead." Rowhani who is the chief of Majles Foreign Policy Committee and the leader's representative at SNSC, said the United States has suffered defeat in post-Soviet era in international and regional arena and after the admission by Russia that they have failed in their plans. He said the hard efforts of the U.S. to persuade Europe and Japan not to cooperate with Iran in economic and commercial areas have failed. He deplored the U.S. for raising a ballyhoo on Iran's foreign debts by giving unrealistic figures which he said had failed to reach anywhere. Answering a question on Iran's relations with the neighbouring countries, Rowhani said ties with Turkey are satisfactory. In light of national and security issues, Turkey has no other way but to maintain growing relations with Iran and "we welcome friendly relations with Ankara." On relations with Iraq, he said if grounds are provided for Iraq in the international arena, Baghdad would be willing to consolidate ties with Tehran. However, he added, it was Iran's natural right to respond severely to the armed attempts by counterrevolutionary groups outside the borders. On ties with the Persian Gulf littoral states, he said Iran employed logical ways is to settle its problems with these states in order to foil U.S. attempts to bring discord into the Persian Gulf. He described Iran's relations with Pakistan as excellent and on Afghanistan, he said Iran was the only mediator in the conflict. He said the prospect of relations with Afghanistan was promising. On the fall in oil prices, he said lower oil prices can prompt a new mechanism to cut off dependence on oil and pave the way for economic growth through non-oil exports. Rowhani said Iran's non-oil exports reached dlrs. 5,000 million [figure as received] this year. The figure is expected to reach dlrs. [dollars] 6,000 million next year, he said. He put emphasis on Iran's relations with Saudi Arabia and said issues including oil, presence of foreign forces in the Persian Gulf, and Hajj pilgrimage entitled Tehran to strengthen mutual relations with Riyadh.
