It is believed that he will try to convince the government to accept the tax reforms proposed by the World Bank. The mention of a package from the World Bank just when the budget is being prepared and the return of former caretaker prime minister to Pakistan make the people distrustful. Those who know the present situation are not ignorant of the fact that the IMF, the World Bank, and other financial organizations have always worried about Pakistani people not having enough taxes. They also believe that the people here do not have the heavy burden of energy costs as they should have according to international standards. These financial organizations do not like the prevalent rates of electricity, natural gas, and petrol. In each budget, increase in the prices of energy items and taxes is done because of the pressure from these financial organizations. All these organizations including the World Bank are unaware of the fact that the wages earned by the employees in Pakistan are much lower than international rates. They are also unaware about the lack of such amenities as social security that are given to people in exchange for taxes. The situation in education, health, living, and employment is not satisfactory in our country. The Pakistani people do not even know about the international standard of living. In this situation, the World Bank's assertion that Pakistan's tax rate is not equal to the international level is not correct. If these monetary institutions are interested in Pakistan then they should help bring the living standards of the people here close, if not equal, to international standards. When the people here have international-level living standards, then we can demand additional taxes from them The wave of escalating prices that has drowned the nation before the budget has ruined people's sleep. Prices of flour, pulses, sugar, ghee, milk, meat, and other staples have risen dramatically and artificially. It is a delusion to think that this pre-budget increase in prices is just so they can call this the budget of the people, and no additional burden of price increases will be put on the people. The fears felt by the people are getting stronger with the return of the former caretaker prime minister and his mission. The people are especially worried because he is bringing a package from the World Bank. It is not considered impossible that Mr. Moeen Qureshi will try to force the government to accept these proposals. It is considered possible since during his government he had resonantly announced, "If the future government disagreed with my policies, it will not last." The reliable information and the government's attitude indicate that the government has already accepted the pressure being put by the World Bank, the IMF, and other financial institutions to an extent. The affect of this agreement has been directly felt by the people also. Chowdhery Shujait Hussain, former home minister and senator, has said in this context that this year the budget will be prepared by the IMF and major smugglers in our country. The government should understand the deteriorating economic situation of the people here before it implements the reforms suggested by the World Bank. It should burden the poor with only as much taxes as they can tolerate. The misfortune of the poor in the third world is that despite political freedom, they are wearing the chains of slavery in economic and defense areas. They can neither decide on their economic development plans nor can they fulfill their defense needs according to their wishes. Our country's tragedy is that since our independence we have been subjected to unbearable international restrictions. Pakistan has sacrificed its interests for a long time during the Cold War between the two superpowers. Now, the slavery of these financial organization is its destiny. This plan to keep the third world in shackles and ruling it is hindering the progress of all developing countries, including Pakistan. Our government's lack of strategic planning and tendency for expediency have helped the evolution of this heinous practice. Our rulers have depended more on world powers than the power of the people to save their government. The challenge to this government that claims to be democratic is whether it protects the interests of the people or those of the international financial organizations.
