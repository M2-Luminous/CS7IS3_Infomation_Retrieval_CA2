This year, President Clinton will again be faced with difficult domestic and foreign affairs issues in steering the government. We hope that in foreign affairs, he will be able to take the initiative in working for world peace and security. In his speech on national radio on New Year's Day, President Clinton pledged further efforts toward the revival of the U.S. economy. He also promised the realization of "employment, health, and personal security." This means enhancing the people's security by improving employment, implementing medical insurance reform, strengthening peace and order, and anti-crime measures. On 3 January, a meeting of cabinet members concerned with medical insurance reform was held, an indication of Clinton's stance of exerting utmost efforts to deal with domestic issues. The President might have come out with an attitude of giving priority to domestic problems at this early time of the year in anticipation of the by-election in November this year. If he succeeds in domestic reform, the Democratic Party would have an edge in the by-election, and this will also be a favorable factor for his reelection as president two years later. Certain factors may also work in President Clinton's favor. The U.S. economy is on the track of recovery. Real annual growth rate for the October-December 1993 period was 4 to 5 percent, and unemployment rate improved to 6.4 percent. Real growth rate for 1994 is forecast to be 3 percent, and unemployment estimated at 6 percent. Clinton is confident of an economic recovery. Since the Clinton administration attaches importance to the restructuring of the U.S. economy, he is also expected to pursue economic diplomacy in 1994. He will probably ask for further opening of the market in the countries of the Asia and Pacific region, which is considered the economic growth center of the world. Improvement of Japan-U.S. economic relations in this region, in particular, will be necessary. The Hosokawa administration is fighting an uphill battle to implement reforms in the Japanese political and economic structures. While the Clinton administration pins great hope on the Hosokawa administration, such reform requires considerable time. It would not be wise for the United States to undermine Japan-U.S. relations in its impatience to see results in the economic issues. The improvement of Japan-U.S. economic relations is not only important for Japan, but will also be important for the United States to enable it to play a more active role in the complex international issues in the post-cold war era. Cooperation between Japan and the United States, which account for 40 percent of world GNP, will be indispensable. The two countries also have a responsibility in revitalizing the stagnant world economy. On the other hand, there had been a number of blunders in Clinton diplomacy in 1993. The United States was not able to take the initiative in dealing with regional conflicts in Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti. Some believe this was due to the incompetence of the three major foreign policymakers, the presidential assistant for national security affairs, the secretary of state, and the secretary of defense. President Clinton replaced his deputy secretary of state, and accepted the resignation of Secretary of Defense Les Aspin in December. He has started to reorganize his foreign and security policies. Clinton diplomacy will take off during the NATO summit meeting starting from 10 January, and the visit to Russia after that. It will be impermissible for the United States to take an inward- looking attitude amid the chaotic international situation. We hope the United States will succeed in realizing change to strengthen its diplomatic position, and exercise leadership in promoting international cooperation to settle regional conflicts and resolve other issues.
