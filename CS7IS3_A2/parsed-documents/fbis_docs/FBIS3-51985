The Cuban diplomat, chosen by acclamation, was proposed by the Tunisian delegation and supported by Mali. Upon addressing this UN committee, Remirez Estenoz highlighted the efforts to be made at a moment when the committee is entering a qualitatively different phase of its work following endorsement of the declaration of principles between Israel and Palestine. Remirez highlighted the duties to be assumed in order to contribute to monitoring the agreed-upon measures and to determine what assistance the United Nations must provide so the process can continue until restitution of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people -- including that of the creation of their own state -- has been achieved.
