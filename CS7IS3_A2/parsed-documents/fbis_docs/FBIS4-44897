The development of these materials would be the ultimate challenge for researchers. In fact, an R&D project has been quietly under way to produce such materials, called "intelligent materials." In November 1989, the Council for Aeronautics, Electronics and Other Advanced Technologies of the Science and Technology Agency (STA), compiled a report titled "Promotion of General R&D Concerning Development of New Substances and Materials Capable of Manifesting Functions by Intelligently Responding to Environmental Conditions" (Advisory No. 13 to Director-General of STA). The ground work for the report was carried out by the Material Technology Committee and the Intelligent Material Subcommittee of the Council, and it took three years for them to derive a new concept. In March 1989, in the middle of the report compilation, the "International Research Forum Concerning Intelligent Materials" was held in Tsukuba Academic New City, and the concept was also recognized internationally. In May 1990, coinciding with the initiation of the STA project, the Intelligent Materials Forum (IMF, President: Professor Emeritus Toshinobu Takagi, Kyoto University) was established within the Society of Non-Traditional Technology. With an emphasis on the examination and propagation of intelligent materials, in April 1992, IMF sponsored the first international conference concerning intelligent materials, to ask worldwide researchers for cooperation. At the conference, the concept itself, the mechanism of intelligent functions, the design (and creation and application) of intelligent materials, and fundamental technologies were discussed. Three years have passed since the inauguration of the project and the establishment of IMF, and the concept concerning intelligent materials appears to have been recognized not only in Japan, but also worldwide. However, it is reasonable to expect material development to require a considerable amount of time, because it has heretofore never been tried. Discussed below are examples of design approach for the concept of intelligent materials that are actually under consideration. Diversified Design Approaches Historically, material development began with materials themselves, which were made into structural materials. Structural materials first became passive functional materials, such as wear-resistant, friction-resistant, and high-temperature-resistant materials, and then became materials with active functions. Various approaches are under consideration for designing intelligent materials from the above-described historical viewpoint, i.e, the manifestation of artificial intelligence at a material level; creation of intelligent materials from the standpoint of material design; incorporation of software functions into materials; creation of materials approaching humans; and creation of materials possessing the time base. Here, the particular key points are the "dynamic" functions, such as auto-restoration, auto-learning, life prediction, and auto-decomposition, that are automatically altered in correspondence with exterior stimuli and the time base. For example, the phenomenon of rust formation on metal can be considered to be an auto-diagnostic function, and shape-memory alloys can be defined as materials with a time-base function. However, neither metal nor shape-memory alloys have sufficient functions to be called intelligent materials. On the other hand, there are materials that hint at the steady progress of R&D toward the creation of intelligent materials: an insecticide that predicts the end of its effectiveness by changing its color, and a biodegradable plastic material that automatically breaks down when a certain period of time elapses after being buried in ground. Among R&D targets in the field of structural materials, there are materials that communicate the imminence of the end of their lives or abnormalities before a serious accident through color change or noise by diagnosing the deterioration of their internal structure and the occurrence of micro-cracks on the surface. There are also materials that automatically repair their flaws, e.g., by hardening the leading edge of a crack through phase transition induced by change in stress, or by filling a gap with a molten component. On the other hand, as we pursue development of these functions one after another for intelligent materials, the materials themselves become so complex that we have to face a new problem of how to dispose of them once they successfully accomplish their missions. Thus, there is also a trend to suggest the development of intelligently functional materials of a simple composition. At any rate, there seems to be no doubt that intelligent material development has begun with diversified end uses and shapes. A similar trend is also becoming visible in Europe and the United States. In June 1994, the U.S.-sponsored Second Intelligent International Conference is supposed to be held in Williamsburg, Virginia. Moreover, the next conference after that is scheduled to be held in France in 1996. Intelligent materials, which were first proposed by Japan and whose concept was first created by Japan, are being developed at a steady pace with the support of other nations worldwide.
