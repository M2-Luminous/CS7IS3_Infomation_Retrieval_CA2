British and other diplomats yesterday made little secret of their distaste at Greece's treatment of the Balkan country given diplomatic recognition last month by six of the 12 EC countries. "They won't give the Macedonians visas. In fact, they are being about as bloody as they could possibly be," said one Western source. Greeks suspect Germany and Britain of granting diplomatic recognition to gain influence in the Balkans. Despite taking over the presidency of the EC Council, Mr Papandreou's Government has stopped supply of vital goods, from washing machine parts to food, mainly because domestic pressure over Macedonia is so strong. Greek workers at oil terminals in Thessaloniki this week volunteered to stop shipments to Macedonia in anger at its use of a name they say can be applied only to their northern province. The Greek blockade has left the border roads deserted, and economic conditions in the former Yugoslav republic have worsened, with pay cuts and falling national output. The barter system has collapsed with the break-up of Yugoslavia, and drought has put two of the country's hydro-electric plants out of service. Many of the 600,000 inhabitants of Skopje, the capital, are dependent on the "Makedonia" oil refinery for their livelihoods, and now depend on it for fuel, giving Greece an effective stranglehold. Mr. Tony Millson, the new British ambassador to Macedonia, said: "The oil trains are still coming through from Thessaloniki, otherwise we wouldn't be sitting here with the lights on." Shops and markets are also still stocked with food, but inflation is running at 230 percent. Western officials close to the sanctions-monitoring operation said Albania tried to appease Athens, offering to avoid use of the name Macedonia on shipments to Greece, substituting "Chamber of Commerce of Skopje." Skopje is Greece's preferred name for the state. Britain and others are trying to step up pressure on Athens by touting plans for an East-West corridor, running from Albania to Bulgaria via Macedonia. They hope this would make Macedonia less dependent on Greece.
