By the end of February, the province had collected 486 million yuan in industrial and commercial taxes, representing an increase of 77.5 percent over the same period of the previous year, and completed 16.4 percent of the tasks assigned by the state, of which the central tax amounted to 119 million yuan and the local tax stood at 366 million yuan. Since the beginning of this year, in accordance with the requirements of the new taxation system and in light of the realities of the Hainan special zone's market economic structure and economic development, tax authorities at all levels in the province have done a good job of investigating tax funds and have delegated tax collection plans at all levels down to the tax collecting units. At the same time, they have persisted in managing taxation in accordance to the law and have strengthened tax collection and management, thus enabling the province to maintain a relatively good momentum of tax revenue growth. In terms of taxes, business tax, state-owned enterprises' income tax, and additional revenue from education fees saw comparatively large increases.
