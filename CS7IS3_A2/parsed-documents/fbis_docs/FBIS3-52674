Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur urged the Knesset to vote against the bill, in a debate over policy and approach which took place mainly within the ranks of the coalition. It was the first discussion in the plenum by mainstream coalition MKs [Knesset members] that touched on the final settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and the future of the territories. "The supporters of this government and those who believe in it know we are not telling the nation the truth regarding withdrawal," argued Avraham Poraz, who introduced the bill. "They know we will not be able to preserve all the settlements in the long run. They all know it, so let us not be afraid of the Likud and the right. Our supporters know the truth, so we do not have to hide it." Gur urged the Knesset to vote against the bill, warning that the controversy that it would trigger would endanger the peace process. "The government is opposed with all its might to this bill," he said. "If we have to choose between the difficulties in drafting the bill in all its details and the political-human difficulties we face at this juncture in our history, I am convinced that we must give precedence to the proper and efficient handling of the negotiations. "Even if it is true that in the final analysis -- and I hope we won't reach that point -- we will have to act under pressure and pass a law, I still say to you that in choosing between the alternatives, we must give precedence to the correct alternative in terms of achieving the sacred goal of peace and security." Poraz originally submitted his private member's bill in March 1993, almost six months before the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles was signed. He wrote at the time that "when a peace treaty is signed, there is a high probability that Israeli citizens living or working in the territories will have to leave, as happened in the evacuation of the Sinai." Poraz urged drafting compensation legislation now to avoid the "chaos" that ensued in the wake of the peace treaty with Egypt. His bill was based on the 1982 Compensation of Sinai Evacuees Law, while the evacuation of the settlers was already in progress.
