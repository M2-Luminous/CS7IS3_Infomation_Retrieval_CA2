Mediator Dr Henry Kissinger said the mediators had dropped everything to come to South Africa on the understanding that the parties had agreed to the terms of reference. "We met the parties but made no proposals because our mediation could begin only after the terms of reference had been agreed. "I wish the parties all the best," Dr Kissinger told a media briefing. The mediation collapsed in spite of intense efforts involving the ANC, Inkatha Freedom Party and government negotiators to agree on the terms of reference. The dispute arose from the IFP's insistence that the election date be part of the mediation process. Another mediator, former British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington said the mediators had not thought that they would have an easy task. "The fact that it has failed fills me with sadness," Lord Carrington said. Dr Kissinger said the mediators understood that it would be difficult for the parties to resolve historic differences in such a short period. He said the mediators had urged the parties to see whether they could bridge the gaps between themselves. Dr Kissinger said the terms of reference had been faxed to him on Sunday, which reflected agreement among the parties. "When we came here we found that the terms of reference had either been reopened or were not fully agreed as we had understood." The mediation was to have begun on Tuesday morning. The seven mediators were now making arrangements to leave the country.
