Clinton, concerned primarily about domestic problems and lacking the international vision which characterized his predecessors, has thus encouraged in his first 12 months in the White House the isolationist interpretations of those who believed that they were seeing their fears confirmed in the U.S. withdrawal in the main conflicts following the Cold War. And in this panorama, Europe has not only been no exception but seems to have been the clinching proof of U.S. diplomacy's new mood. The Administration's first steps in relations with Europe have not been easy. For instance, in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the Americans have moved from the initial interventionist declarations to passivity, but in this case the Europeans, handicapped by their own inaction, are not exactly in a position to cast the first stone. The strain in relations became clear in the interminable negotiations on the liberalization of international trade. GATT became a trial of strength between the Americans and Europeans, who in this way confirmed how trade is destined to become a weapon as essential as arms on the new international scene. An agreement has been reached on the liberalization of trade, but the European leaders now receiving Clinton still have buzzing in their ears the repeated statements made by State Department officials citing Asia -- more specifically, the Pacific Basin, with Japan and China -- as the area of greatest importance for the United States in the 21st century; that is, rather as if the center of the world, which in the 20th century has lain between the United States, as the leading superpower, and Europe -- i.e. in the Atlantic community -- could shift to the Pacific, between Asia and America. And if to this view of the world we add European fears about a continental scene in which balance has given way to instability and conflicts, it is easy to understand the interest with which the European leaders awaited Bill Clinton. The first consequence of the President's visit has served to reassure the allies. "I am here to declare and demonstrate that Europe is central to U.S. interests," asserted Clinton, who reckoned the U.S. commitment in terms of a military presence of 100,000 servicemen and supported the European integration process. On defense, the Democratic President seems more prepared than his predecessors for the Europeans to have a more prominent role. And this, although it is also to be explained in terms of the United States' interest in cutting its military expenditure, represents an opportunity to reconsider relations between the allies on both sides of the Atlantic, because they are both confronted in the post-Cold War period with the challenge of renewing their bonds without weakening their ties. Asia is emerging as a mainstay of trade in U.S. foreign policy for the future, but Europe has been this and should remain so, for the benefit of both the United States and Europe, with which it shares not only economic and security interests but also the defense of values based on respect for freedom, democracy, and human rights.
