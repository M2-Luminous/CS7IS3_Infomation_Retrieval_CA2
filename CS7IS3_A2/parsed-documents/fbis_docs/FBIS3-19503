The French of Aerospatiale, the Germans of DASA [Deutsche Aerospace], the British of British Aerospace, and the Spanish of CASA [Aeronautic Constructions Company] -- the consortium's shareholders -- would have preferred Alenia to intensify its involvement, including financially, in the Airbus programs, rather than aim at a closer partnership with the Americans. The Italian company is not part of the European consortium, but -- through a 10-year agreement, signed in 1990 -- it is involved in Airbus's most recent program for the development of the so-called A-321 -- the new 185-seat airliner which is about to join Alitalia's fleet. Alenia builds two of the fuselage component sections. This amounts to a contract worth $150 million. Now, barely three weeks later, the "Pyrenees bear" (as Jean Pierson, the sanguine French chairman of the Airbus consortium, is nicknamed by his friends) broke the silence and, in the course of a telephone interview, said that he understood the reasons which had led Finmeccanica to approach McDonnell Douglas. At the same time, however, he advised Alenia to "leave the doors open," and ensure that the handshake with the Americans does not become "binding." [Borriello] Mr. Pierson, do you have any counterproposals to make to Alenia? [Pierson] No. At present the Airbus consortium has no counterproposals to make to our Italian colleagues. We are well aware that Alenia's staff is oriented toward McDonnell Douglas for reasons of operational continuity, given that they have been working for the American group for some time now, and also for employment reasons, since Alenia needs to obtain work immediately for its plants. [Borriello] Why, then, do you have some reservations concerning the alliance with McDonnell? [Pierson] In the first place, because, in order to guarantee more work for Alenia, the American group must win a greater share of the commercial airliner world market. Will it manage to do so? Currently it is the third manufacturer, after Boeing and Airbus. Also, I ask myself: By acquiring a share in McDonnell Douglas, is Alenia strong enough today to refuse a binding agreement in terms of strategic options? In my view, both problems are closely interconnected. [Borriello] Could you expand on this, Mr. Pierson? [Pierson] If, in order to maintain certain manufacturing lines, Alenia is "forced" to sign this agreement with McDonnell, then it will have little freedom of choice within the American group's activity sector, and it may therefore find itself excluded from many European initiatives. [Borriello] Which, for instance? [Pierson] You know that Alenia is one of Aerospatiale's partners in the ATR program for developing regional transport aircraft. Should Aerospatiale decide to build a 90-seat jetliner, the project would enter into direct competition with McDonnell Douglas's similar project, called MD-95. At that point, Alenia would be forced to give up the Aerospatiale project. [Borriello] What if Alenia is not "forced" to sign the agreement with McDonnell Douglas? [Pierson] In such case, it would be well advised to leave the doors open to new agreements. However, today McDonnell Douglas is in no position to impose many limitations on its partners, and therefore whether or not any doors are left open will depend on the negotiators' ability. [Borriello] Open to a partnership with the Airbus consortium? [Pierson] Already some 10 years ago we offered Alenia the possibility of joining our consortium with full rights, and therefore taking part both in our ongoing and in our developing programs. At that time, however, Alenia preferred to work with McDonnell Douglas. Now that the need is being experienced to reorganize the consortium's production lines and shareholding structure, again the Italian company appears to be siding with the Americans. [Borriello] But you are also conducting negotiations with the Americans. What stage have the talks between Airbus and Boeing reached? [Pierson] The same stage reached by the negotiations conducted some 35 years ago between Sud Aviation Francaise, which was then manufacturing Caravelle airlines, and Douglas, in order to work out a cost-sharing agreement in relation to the development of Caravelle. Those talks never moved beyond the statement-of-intent stage, and it proved impossible to translate intentions into practice.
