Our special correspondent Viktor Levin reports: [Levin] As an official of the Russian Foreign Ministry announced, at a closed meeting of the foreign ministers of the two countries there was a discussion of problems raised at the conference in Blagoveshchensk. There, the heads of administration posed rather acutely the question that during the regulation of border crossings and the normalization and regulation of contacts between the two countries one should not forget, and one cannot forget, that these links are of vital significance to the inhabitants of these regions. The regulation and settlement should not damage the normal commercial and economic relations between the border provinces of China and Russia. There was also discussion of the situation on the Korean peninsula. We do not know what the ministers said specifically, but one can surmise since both sides are very concerned about the plans of the DPRK to manufacture nuclear arms. Russia and China's positions coincide. Such a gloomy prospect places both sides on their guard. In my view, many of the cards that the diplomats are holding close to their chest, so to speak, were displayed by Andrey Kozyrev, himself speaking at the Chinese People's Diplomacy Institute. Speaking of cooperation by Russia and China in the Security Council, he said that there are practically no problems being discussed in that body of the United Nations on which Russia and China have insurmountable differences or confrontation. On all questions, the minister stressed, there exists a very high degree of mutual understanding. In his speech at the People's Diplomacy Institute, Andrey Kozyrev also revealed the thesis of constructive partnership. He mentioned it during the talks and now from this speech one can draw definite conclusions. Above all, the Russian foreign minister said, we propose making new strides on the road to strengthening mutual trust and ensuring mutual security. It must be said that China received guardedly the new Russian military doctrine in which the provision of non-first use of nuclear weaponry is absent. But to the Chinese side's questions a precise and clear answer was given. In the declaration signed during the summit meeting in 1992, or to be more precise in December 1992, when Russian President Boris Yeltsin was in China, it was stressed that both sides renounced the first use of nuclear weaponry and the minister again stressed this principle.
