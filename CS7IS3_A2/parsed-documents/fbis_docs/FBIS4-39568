The new movement sets itself the task "to formulate conditions to guarantee society against an inflow of dishonest people into the power structures, and against the making of incompetent decisions," as well as to create a system for the selection of personnel and a mechanism of control over the formulaic passing and retraction of decisions at all levels. Only highly moral and law-abiding citizens can join the party. The PPC counts on support from broad sections of the population, from workers to peasants to entrepreneurs, who identify their future with the prosperity of Russia. According to Mr. Kazannik, he has already received requests from representatives of 47 regions in the country for the PPC's program documents so as to set up branches of the party in the regions. The founding conference of the PPC may be held as early as the fall, and the new party will be registered on the federal level.
