Mirzoyev pointed out that not only a political decision to this effect was adopted by the heads of the two countries, but a package of documents, concerning the second stage of the merger, was worked out and submitted to Russian colleagues. The minister pointed out that there are no serious opponents to the unification of the two monetary systems either in Russia, or in Tajikistan. The process of the monetary merger is very complex both technically and organizationally, he said. At the same time, Tajik manufacturers should work hard to step up the process. It is necessary to earn Russian roubles ourselves by increasing supplies of industrial products and raw materials, i.e. to give priority in exports policy to Russia, the Tajik minister said. According to Mirzoyev, Tajikistan faces severe cash shortages and the government is 170 billion roubles in debt to the population. The remaining 25 billion roubles expected to arrive from Russia as part of the 120-billion credit to Tajikistan will not be enough even to pay pensions and social allowances, he said. Asked by ITAR-TASS if Tajikistan intends to introduce temporary money for internal payments, the minister declined to answer, saying that such problems are in the competence of the Tajik parliament.
