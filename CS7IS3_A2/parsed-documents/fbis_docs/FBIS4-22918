The dietary structure of the population determined by studying the family budgets carried out by the Gomel oblast statistical administration in 1985-1987 was used in analyses. The mean [.sup]137[/] Cs concentration in the food sold to the population by retail and public food service outlets in Gomel oblast, in Ci/kg, the structure of the diet used in computing the [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr dietary intake, the average daily [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr intake with basic foodstuffs in individual rayons of Gomel oblast in 1986-1989, the likely mean levels of daily dietary [.sup]137[/] Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr intake (ignoring rejects), the actual mean levels of daily dietary [.sup]137[/] Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr intake (allowing for rejects), and the [.sup]137[/]Cs and [.sup]90[/]Sr daily dietary intake of the population living in an area with a unit contamination density are summarized. The findings show that the food contamination levels decrease gradually with time (after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident). In particular, the [.sup]137 [/] Cs intake decreased by threefold from 1986 to 1989. A rayon-by-rayon analysis reveals that Narovlyansk rayon which used to be the most contaminated with cesium is now in second place (a 206 to 60 10[.sup]-10[/] Ci/day drop) while in Vetkovsk rayon, the [.sup]137[/]Cs level dropped from 185 to 62.
