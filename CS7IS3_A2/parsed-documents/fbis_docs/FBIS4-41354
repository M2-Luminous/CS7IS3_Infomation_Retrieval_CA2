Chairman of the "Ukraine" democratic association, Dmitriy Pavlychko, said that the "Ukraine" wants Leonid Kravchuk to remain in the post of the Ukrainian president. Public opinion polls show that Kravchuk enjoys the support of 62 per cent of Ukrainian women, 42 per cent of rural residents and 90 per cent of the population of Ukraine's western regions. However, Kravchuk's rating in the east and the south is not so high. However, experts reminded of the fact that during the first presidential elections Kravchuk had won with only a 10 per cent rating in his favour reported in the Galichina region. Observers noted that Kravchuk's popularity has been growing in recent weeks. Primarily, this can be accounted for by his decision on the indexation of the population's deposits in saving banks, the allocation of 40 million karbovanets for the organisation of summer vacation of children from low-income families, taking currency back to Ukraine, signing an agreement on partnership and cooperation between Ukraine and EC. Representatives of the old generation welcomed the election of Vitaliy Masol to the post of the premier, whose candidacy had been suggested by the president. Political experts believe that Kravchuk is such a clever politician that he would manage to win over to his side 18 per cent of electors ho had not decided yet for whom they would vote in the elections.
