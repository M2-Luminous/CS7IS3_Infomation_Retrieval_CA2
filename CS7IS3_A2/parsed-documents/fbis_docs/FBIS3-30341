Sanctions committee for stepping up the procedure for issuing permits for aid deliveries to that Yugoslav Republic. In a letter to his Montenegrin counterpart Miodrag Lekic, Andreatta said Italy had upheld also Montenegro's request for permission to export aluminium and use the proceeds for humanitarian imports. Andreatta said that Italy was already investing efforts for the reopening of the ferry line between Bari, Italy, and Bar, Montenegro, being aware of its importance to Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and its communications with the rest of the world. Although humanitarian goods are supposed to be exempt from sanctions clamped on Yugoslavia by the United Nations in May of 1992 for its alleged involvement in civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, the U.N. sanctions committee has often been deliberately slow in issuing the necessary permits for the import of even the most essential articles, which are in extremely short supply because of the embargo, making life difficult both for the Yugoslavs and the 700,000 refugees accommodated in the country.
