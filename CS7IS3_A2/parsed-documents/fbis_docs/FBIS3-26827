They answered: "The national situation report `Thoroughly Eliminating Corruption Through Institutional Innovation' makes it clear that current corruption is mainly the corruption of the system. The main root causes of corrupt phenomena are the defects of the existing systems in the period of the market-oriented economic restructuring. In the process of transforming the economy into a market economy, differences exist between market prices and official prices. The larger the differences, the stronger the motivations for giving and taking bribes will become, and the more serious the corrupt phenomena will become. In the past, officials often were assumed to be "selfless." This assumption can hardly become true in economic society. As defects exist in the systems, honest people may rapidly become corrupt once they have power. The only solution is system innovation. In addition, the corruption activities also are related to the government's excessive interference in the market. If there were no market distortion and no special monopoly position caused by the government's excessive interference, there would be no foundation for the giving and taking of bribes. Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: "In our report, we also point out explicitly that the obstacles to the anticorruption drive on the Chinese mainland come primarily from with the CPC, and find their main expression in special interest groups of various types led by the Communists. The Communist Party is not a monolith, nor does everyone inside the party share the same interests and act in unison. Inside the party and within the state apparatus various special and independent economic interest groups and political interest groups have appeared. This is one of the most important characteristics of the prominent changes in the Chinese social structure since the beginning of reform. The report summarizes the main characteristics of the special interest groups into following points: -- Having the motivation of seeking and expanding their own interests to the maximum, and taking this as their purpose. They care only about increasing their own groups' gains and do not consider the losses in the aggregate social wealth. -- Having the attributes of benefit-sharing groups, as they participate in the distribution of social resources and profits. Although they account for only a very small proportion of the population, they always are able to gain a much larger proportion of economic resources. -- Having the character of being exclusive and holding a monopoly position. They exclude other groups from the benefit-sharing activities, block the free movement of economic factors, oppose the participation of other competitive rivals, and strive to increase their monopoly in society. When resisting external threats and rectification, they also may collaborate in order to protect each other, thus forming complex connection networks. -- Having strong influence and causing "government ineffectiveness." They try to influence government policies, and even the top-level policy-making body, by every possible means. They demand excessive government interference or even direct interference by top decision-makers in order to obtain certain economic prerogatives or favorable policies. They also try by every possible means to oppose and obstruct the adoption of some reform measures that favor fair competition. -- The vested interests are rather "rigid." That is, they can only increase and must not decrease the absolute interests they have gained, and the shares they gain can only increase and must not decrease. Hu and Kang said: The above-mentioned characteristics determine that any major measure for reforming the existing systems inevitably will encounter strong opposition from the special interest groups. For example, many interest groups opposed the measures to lower import tariffs, lift import controls, and remove the foreign trade monopoly system. The difficulties in market-oriented reforms lie in the handling of such special interest groups.
