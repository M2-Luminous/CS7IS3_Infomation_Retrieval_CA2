The Finnish representative in Greenpeace, who was interviewed as a result of the article, criticized our forest products industry with some very frank words. Defenders of our forest products industry were irritated. The reaction indicates that at least the level of our discussion on environmental issues has not kept pace with Central European standards. We accept Greenpeace's highly visible campaigns against Norwegian whaling and Russian dumping of nuclear wastes in the sea. But when our own methods of dealing with our forests were critically focused on, our attitude changed. The esteemed environmental organization instantly became the irresponsible destroyer of Finland's forest products. One article in a large circulation periodical and hysteria takes over in the country's industry. What's going on here? Researcher Ilmo Massa wrote in the opinion page of the HELSINGIN SANOMAT that the Central European environmental criticism has the marks of the environmental imperialism practiced by the prosperous industrial nations. It is true that Greenpeace is not always interested in conditions dictated by local economies. It would, however, be overly simplistic to equate the DER SPIEGEL article with the publicity on the Amazon rain forest. There is a difference in scale between these issues. The environmental movements of industrial countries have not systematically attacked Finland's forest products industry. Further, Finland is itself an industrialized country, and it is good that the environmental criticism hits us once in a while, instead of always the impoverished countries. The DER SPIEGEL discussion reveals the frailty of Finnish industrial and forestry strategy. The arguments of the forest products industry are characterized primarily by a self-enveloping defensiveness. The situation is not analyzed self-critically but the reaction is like that of an offended little boy. For a long time the possibility of making conservation of the environment the trump card in Finnish competition with others has been a topic of discussion. The government's Forest Service has, however, retreated only in tiny steps on northern environmental disputes. The state has not consented to significant cuts in production objectives of the Forest Service. The silvicultural practices have been modernized slowly and the forest products industry has not accelerated the process, but has retarded it. The results of the failed strategy are evident from the DER SPIEGEL publicity. The forestry doctrine serves one lord, the paper and cellulose industry. The mechanized forest industry of ours that proliferated in earlier years has faded away. This kind of condition has long been accepted as being for the common good. Now this common good and acceptance is becoming fragmented. It appears that, in the long term, the forest products industry will not be able to even maintain its image advantage. The ecology of the forest has undergone drastic changes even though the forest has long meant many things in Finnish minds. It serves more than the cellulose boilers. There is more out there than rows of seedlings of one tree species and hard-to-traverse ploughing scars. Hunting, berry picking, fishing, orienteering, capturing pictures of nature, hiking in familiar and unfamiliar forests are all important things. The forest is also utilized by tourism, sawmills, the furniture manufacturers, artistic handicrafts, food products industry etc. New forest products could be developed, but sufficient variety of tree and plant species can no longer be found. There has been much positive progress in our forest management practices. But the clamor over the DER SPIEGEL article shows that our forest management discussion is plagued by a reality-ignoring polarization. As long as the confrontational attitudes between the forest products industry and environmental movement, as well as between employment concerns and ecological priorities remain, the discussion will be stuck on a naive level. Finland needs defending of multiple use of the forest. Should yet one more group interested in the forest be organized in Finland, a group that would be based on local enterprises and know-how, as well as cultural priorities that consider the forest valuable?
