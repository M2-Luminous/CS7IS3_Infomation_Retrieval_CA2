"No agreement resulting from our talks with the government has been unknown to the house," he said, "and they have been absolutely open and public in the past and will be so in future. To say the contrary is politically legitimate from the sectarian or partisan viewpoint, but is a dangerous falsehood, because it arouses old passions and apprehensions and is dangerous for coexistence in our country." With this assertion, Roca justified his group's opposition to Gonzalez' appearing in order to explain the meeting with Pujol: "Political talks are not subject to parliamentary oversight," he said. The CiU spokesman also expressed his conviction that in the demand for Gonzalez' appearance "there was no desire for clarity, because they have it, since there is nothing opaque or confused. Whether it is so clear that it annoys them to know that we do not share their strategy is another matter." Miquel Roca also made it clear that at the meeting between Gonzalez and Pujol, "the agreement is that two people said what is well known: That we are not in favor of bringing forward the election, which would be frivolous from the viewpoint of the general interest and the Spanish economy; the agreement that the economic policy must be intensified and that progress must be made in the implementation of autonomy, which is a little-worked field. That is, it was examined how progress is to be made on the coinciding aims and how it can be guaranteed that they coincide, so that stability will be maintained." In the CiU spokesman's opinion, the only thing is that in Spain there is "apart from the government's strategy, a strategy of dissolving the Cortes, which is the People's Party strategy; another of replacing the prime minister, which is United Left's strategy; and ours, which is to cause the country to do well, and we espouse it. Nobody will be able to show us a single instance of our doing what we do in accordance with partisan or territorially limited interests." And he stressed that the agreements reached on autonomy policy "have been extended to all the autonomous communities, and the benefit reaches them all." The next aim in cooperation with the government is the budgets for 1995, "because we are not going to support just any budget." He emphasized that when the 1994 budget came about, "the economic scope for maneuver was very narrow." It is a scope that "is fortunately widening now," since the economic outlook for 1995 is different, with an increase in GDP, and a June that will be good, with an increase in Social Security contributors and reduction of unemployment, and this, in his opinion, "enables us to be bolder" and tackle "more courageously" some reforms that could not be tackled earlier, such as company tax. However, Roca left open the possibility of dialogue with the People's Party, because "we are not by definition far from reaching agreements with those who wish to agree." Roca also denied that an agreement or pact between the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] and United Left in Andalusia could have repercussions on CiU's support for the government. "We have no objection to United Left's playing a stabilizing role in Andalusia. On the contrary, we want a stable government that will ensure the greatest possible well-being for the Andalusians and the surmounting of their problems. However, if the terms set have an impact on Spain's overall economic policy aims, that would be a problem."
