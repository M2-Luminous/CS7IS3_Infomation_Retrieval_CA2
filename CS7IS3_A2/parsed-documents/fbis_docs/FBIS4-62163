The Russian and French diplomats who initiated the Geneva talks had hoped to be able to persuade the Americans to alter their approach -- which would have enabled Russia, the United States, and the EU [European Union] finally to act as a united front and put effective pressure on the opposing sides in Bosnia. To judge from recent statements by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other U.S. officials, there is little chance of this. Washington is still skeptical about the plan proposed by the EU and supported by Moscow for a repartition of Bosnia, under which the Serbs are to get 49 percent of the republic's territory and the Muslims and Croats 51 percent. It has also proved impossible to find a common language on the question of sanctions against Yugoslavia. Russia has long been demanding that they be lifted. The Europeans are prepared to agree to a gradual easing of sanctions in exchange for Serb compromises. As for the Americans, they are categorically opposed to any indulgence for Belgrade. The Russians and West Europeans in turn stubbornly reject the U.S. idea of lifting the embargo on arms deliveries to the Bosnian Government. Moscow is afraid that this step will alter the correlation of forces to the Serbs' disadvantage and will inspire the Muslims to new offensive operations. The EU countries fear for the fate of their peacemakers, who could end up hostages in the event of the conflict's escalation. In the opinion of informed Russian Foreign Ministry personnel the Geneva talks will be very complex. The sides will hardly be able to form a single approach to all key questions and thereby prepare the ground for a summit meeting on Bosnia, the need for which has been stated repeatedly by Moscow. There is a more modest but, so people on Smolensk Square believe, perfectly attainable goal: to advance a joint initiative for a cease-fire on all fronts in Bosnia. This would make it possible to remove the tension in the region of the Serb-controlled city of Brcko, around which large Muslim and Croat forces have been concentrated. If the Bosnian government troops succeed in taking the city and cutting the narrow corridor connecting Serb regions in Bosnia with Yugoslavia, the Serbs' position will deteriorate sharply, and the war will commence a new spiral. The aim of Russian diplomacy is to prevent such a development of events and to make the warring sides sign an armistice. The Serbs, who have seized practically all the territories that they wanted, are to all appearances ready to agree to a cease-fire. The hardest task is to convince the Muslims of this -- which is only possible if the Americans come out decisively in support of an armistice. How ready they are for this must come to light during the Geneva meeting.
