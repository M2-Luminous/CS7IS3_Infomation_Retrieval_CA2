FR940418-0-00006 FR940418-0-00003 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AGL&hyph;13] Alteration of Jet Route J&hyph;34 AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action changes the description of Jet Route J&hyph;34 located between the Badger, WI, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility, the Grand Rapids, MI, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) facility, and the Carleton, MI, VORTAC. This change removes the reference to the radials from the navigational aids (NAVAIDS), and designates the Grand Rapids, MI, (GRR) VOR/DME as the turning point for aircraft transiting from the Badger, WI, (BAE) VORTAC to the Carleton, MI, (CRL) VORTAC. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 U.T.C., June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia P. Crawford, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9255. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On September 15, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to alter the description of Jet Route J&hyph;34 (58 FR 48331). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Jet routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The jet route listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the description of Jet Route J&hyph;34 by removing the reference to the radials from the NAVAIDS and designates the Grand Rapids, MI, (GRR) VOR/DME as the turning point for aircraft transiting from the Badger, WI, (BAE) VORTAC to the Carleton, MI, (CRL) VORTAC. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air).
