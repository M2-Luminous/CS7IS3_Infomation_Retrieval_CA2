Prime Minister Carl Bildt advocates a careful line in Bosnia, and he still hopes that negotiations will cause the NATO threat not to be carried out; but Carl Bildt is of the opinion that the decision was necessary. [Begin recording] [Bildt] I think stronger military pressure is necessary on both sides. [Unidentified correspondent] Is it credible? [Bildt] I think it is credible. It is clear through those partial successes in the negotiations during the last 24 hours that it is perceived as credible. [Correspondent] The fact that Russia might not approve a NATO decision which has not been sanctioned beforehand in the UN Security Council -- is this something to be taken into account? [Bildt] Yes, this shows the tension regarding this question between the different countries in the Security Council, but NATO has now acted after consulting the UN secretary general, who referred to Security Council resolutions within the framework of which he considers that he is acting; and Russia was there. [sentence as heard] [Correspondent] There are many both open and veiled threats from Russia on an escalation of the conflict. Do you think it could spread outside Bosnia? [Bildt] Yes, and that is why I have been slightly skeptical regarding suggestions in the Swedish debate -- I should express myself carefully -- suggestions that have meant that we should take part in a considerable expansion of the conflict. I think it is essential to have these dangers clear in one's mind. Thus, to work for a political solution is no excuse in itself to start on further violence. [end recording] The person who wants to have harder measures, to which Carl Bildt referred, is Pierre Schori, the Social Democratic foreign policy spokesman. He is of the opinion that NATO could act now with the mandate from the United Nations, and should do so if the conditions are not met. [Begin recording] [Schori] It seems that they are serious this time, and it would be terrible if they again gave a warning that they did not back up. The reactions of the Serbian army also seem to indicate that they take it seriously. [Correspondent] The threats coming from Russia -- is it credible when Zhirinovskiy says that this could be the beginning of the third world war? Should one take this seriously? [Schori] One can of course do this; one must listen to what he says. But what is important now is to take the daily carnage in Sarajevo seriously. Politics means to want something, but politics also means to choose, and sometimes one must choose between terribly difficult and maybe painful decisions, and here we must choose between the oppressed and the oppressors, between victims and executioners, and we must stand on the side of the people in Sarajevo.
