It reads as follows: Esteemed Mr. President: I reply to your letter of 23 December 1993. I agree that the humanitarian situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is very grave and this, it seems, is the only thing we fully agree upon at the moment. We evidently perceive some facts in relation to this situation in totally different ways. First, your convoy for Nova Bila has reached its destination. Our convoy has not reached Maglaj. This convoy is waiting in hope in Zenica. You have been misinformed about this matter. It is true that the Nova Bila convoy was being considerably delayed along its way but you are certainly familiar with the reason behind this -- the military equipment hidden in it. This is why I fail to understand your criticism of what you brand as unjustifiable delays. It turned out, regrettably, that these delays were entirely justified. On its way back the convoy encountered problems because it was caught in crossfire near Gornji Vakuf, where for months battles have been raging on a daily basis. We regret the casualties but it was not us who started this war in general or the one around Gornji Vakuf in particular. The Bosnia-Herzegovina army legally defends this town from the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] paramilitary formations and their attempts to take the town. They are responsible for the destruction of this town and the deaths of hundreds of its citizens. Every single word in the message, sent allegedly by Djemo Merdan, deputy commander of the 3d Corps, is fabricated. Our army does not kill women and children. What evidence do you have to support such crude slander against the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army? I believe that it is entirely inappropriate to include an unconfirmed and, I believe fabricated statement in our correspondence. As far as the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is concerned, I want to be perfectly clear. The presence of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in every part of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina is legal and legitimate to the same extent the presence of other military formations that do not recognize the supreme command of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency is unlawful and unacceptable. The Bosnia-Herzegovina army cannot be an aggressor in its own country. Only armies sent in from other centers withut permission from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency can be aggressors. Hence, the allegations made in your letter regarding the Nova Bila humanitarian convoy have no grounds. Nor do the allegations about the Bosnia-Herzegovina army's conduct. The following facts are, however, indisputable. First, the field hospital donated by the South African Union to the population of eastern Mostar has been waiting for as long as six months in Ploce. It was stopped by Croatian authorities and is now being slowly cannibalized. Who is irritated by a field hospital? What is the justification for this inhumane act? Second, in Medjugorje your forces confiscated and blocked two months ago two of our helicopters which had been sent in agreement with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and given its assistance to collect the wounded although Medjugorje is on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Third, your police, in the course of the last campaign against the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Croatia, without any basis or explanation, confiscated 2,760 vehicles that were the property of our citizens. This is a figure that can be substantiated by documents in our embassy in Zagreb. The true number of vehicles that were taken could only be larger. We stated that the Croat authorities in Herzegovina founded concentration camps and imprisoned in them tens of thousands of innocent civilians. You have persistently rejected this assertion as slanderous. A few days ago your minister of foreign affairs, in a letter to the UN Security Council, boasted that the Croatian authorities, and I quote, freed 5,600 Muslim prisoners. How can prisoners be freed from camps that do not exist? I am intentionally not setting out here the historical details of the conflict in Herzegovina that has been accompanied by the brutal ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population in Mostar, Stolac, Capljina, Livno, and other places, the culmination of which was the barbaric destruction of the Old Bridge [in Mostar]. Nor am I setting out here worrying reports of the presence of significant elements of the Croatian armed forces on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, something which shows the open interference of Croatia in the internal affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina, because this is contained in our letter to the Security Council. Despite everything that has been said, and many negative facts, I wish to convey equally seriously to you our sincere interest in improving the relations between our two countries, and in developing all forms of cooperation. For this to be achieved, however, a true change in your policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina is needed. Furthermore -- as I have stressed to you many times -- you cannot expect us to improve relations by negotiating with people who have been branded as executioners [djelati] of the Muslim people. With my respects. This is the content of the letter that Alija Izetbegovic, president of the presidency, sent to Franjo Tudjman.
