Claims of outstanding performance must be based upon actual accomplishments. Clear, precise documentation will be required. Maps must have a census tract or block numbering area (BNA), and they must be in accordance with the 1990 Census data. Additionally, maps must identify the locations of areas with minorities by census tract or BNA. If there are no minority areas, state so on the map. Only population data from the 1990 Census will be acceptable for purposes of this section. Please note that a ``minority'' is a person belonging to, or culturally identified as, a member of any one of the following racial/ethnic categories: Black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaskan Native. For the purposes of this section, the separate category_``women''_is not considered a minority. Counties claiming points under this criterion must use county-wide statistics (excluding entitlement communities). In the case of joint applications, points will be awarded based on the performance of the lead entity only. The following factors will be used to judge outstanding performance in these areas. Please note that the criteria are the same for Comprehensive and Single Purpose applicants, and that points for outstanding performance may be claimed under each criterion: (1) Housing Achievements (40 points total). (a) 20 Points_Provision of Assisted Housing_Providing assisted housing for low- and moderate-income families, located in a manner which provides housing choice in areas outside of minority, or low- and moderate-income concentrations. Points will be awarded where both of the following criteria are met: (i) More than one-third of the housing assistance provided by the applicant in the last five (5) years (excluding Section 8 existing and housing assistance provided in place) has been in Census Tracts (CT) or Block Numbering Areas (BNA) having a percentage of minority population which is less than the minority population in the community as a whole; and (ii) With regard to the Section 8 Existing Program, a community must show the location (CT or BNA) of its currently occupied family units by race/ethnicity. Points will be awarded if more than one-half of the minority assisted families occupy units in areas which have a lower percentage of minority population than that of the community as a whole. A community with no minorities must show the extent to which its assisted housing is located outside areas of concentrations of low- and moderate-income persons. In order to receive points under this criteria, applicants should follow the process outlined in (i) and (ii) above, substituting low- and moderate-income persons and families for minority persons or families. Applicants addressing the first criterion must use a map indicating the location of all assisted housing and a narrative which indicates the number of units and the type of assisted housing. The map also must show the general location of low- and moderate-income households and minority households, giving the numbers and percentages for both. To qualify as housing assistance provided, the units being claimed must be part of a project located outside minority or lower income concentrated areas which has, at a minimum, received a firm commitment from the funding agency. (iii) Points also may be awarded for efforts which enable low- and moderate-income persons to remain in their neighborhood when such neighborhoods are experiencing revitalization and substantial displacement as a result of private reinvestment. Applicants requesting points under this criterion would not need to meet the requirements of (a) and (b) in order to receive points. Points will be awarded where more than one half of the families displaced were able to remain in their original neighborhood through the assistance of the applicant. Applicants must show that: _the neighborhood experienced revitalization; _the amount of displacement was substantial; _displacement was caused by private reinvestment; _low- and moderate-income persons were permitted to remain in the neighborhood as a result of action taken by the applicant. If the community is inhabited predominantly by persons who are members of minority and/or low-income groups, points will be awarded where there is a balanced distribution of assisted housing throughout the community. (b) 20 Points_Implementation of a HUD-approved New Horizons Fair Housing Assistance Project or a Fair Housing Strategy that is equivalent in scope to a New Horizons Project. The applicant must demonstrate that it is implementing a HUD-approved New Horizons Fair Housing Assistance Project or demonstrate participation in a HUD-approved county/State/regional New Horizons Project; or that the applicant is implementing a fair housing strategy that is equivalent in scope to a New Horizons Project. If the applicant is implementing a New Horizons Project, it must include: _the date it was approved (by HUD); and _those actions taken to implement the plan. If the applicant is implementing an equivalent fair housing strategy, it must include: _the strategy being implemented; _those actions taken to implement the strategy. Please note that a fair housing strategy must include the four elements of a New Horizons Project in order to be considered equivalent in scope: _Local compliance activities;
