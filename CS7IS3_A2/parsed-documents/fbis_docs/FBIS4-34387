[Begin unidentified reporter recording] Abstention was defeated very early in Santa Fe de Bogota, especially at the largest polling station, Corferias [exhibition center], where thousands of people lined up at the 226 voting tables there. A high percentage of young people decided to break their silence and vote in this round. However, many voters were turned away because they were not registered on the electoral lists. The voting took place in an atmosphere of relative normalcy without the presence of entertainers [animadores] -- as was permitted in the elections four years ago -- in keeping with the new electoral laws banning partying. In the presence of authorities, electoral information tables were set up outside Corferias with propaganda of the Liberal candidate, while the public force closely watched the voting inside the Santa Fe de Bogota exhibition center. There were no incidents, and the abstention that marked the 29 May elections suffered a relative defeat today. [end recording]
