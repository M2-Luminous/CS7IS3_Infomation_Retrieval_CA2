"We remain committed to sustaining our contribution through this winter, and working to improve further its effectiveness," he said. But Mr Hurd betrayed his anger at the "constant obstruction" which humanitarian aid troops face on the ground. "I was there last week. The outlook is bleak. The latest round of talks in Geneva made no progress. The prospect is for continued fighting, which may intensify in the spring," he told the Diplomatic and Commonwealth Writers Association at Marlborough House, London. Mr Hurd said the achievements of British troops were threatened by the deliberate obstructiveness of the parties. "Aid is stuck in warehouses in Croatia. The road the British troops hold open could carry many more convoys. Our engineers are working to keep open power stations in central Bosnia, but essential spare parts are being blocked. No wonder then that people ask how long we can sustain this involvement, in the face of constant obstruction on the ground. We have to consider carefully, and with the others who contribute troops, how long we can reasonably be expected to sustain this involvement and how meanwhile we can improve its effectiveness." Mr Hurd said that no decisions had yet been taken. "We shall not act hastily or alone to withdraw our troops. We remain committed to sustaining our contribution through this winter, and working to improve further its effectiveness. Because the Serbs carry the main responsibility for starting the conflict, sanctions against Serbia must remain in force."
