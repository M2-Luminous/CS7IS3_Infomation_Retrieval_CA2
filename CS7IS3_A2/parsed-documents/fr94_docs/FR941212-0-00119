FR941212-0-00119 FR941212-0-00019 (2) United States military personnel and civilian employees of the U.S. Government or its agencies and instrumentalities and their dependents, who are normally residents of the United States and who, at the time of the incident giving rise to the claim, are residing in a foreign country primarily because of their own or their sponsor's duty or employment status, are not foreign inhabitants and are excluded from coverage under the Foreign Claims Act. (i) Foreign born spouses, children and other dependent family members of such military personnel and United States employees are also deemed to be inhabitants of the United States and excluded from coverage under this subpart if they have resided with their sponsor in the United States and are now overseas primarily because of their sponsor's duty assignment. (ii) Children born to or adopted by a member of the force or civilian component who has not been reassigned to the United States since the date of the birth or adoption, are deemed to be an inhabitant of the United States and excluded from coverage under this subpart from the time they are born or adopted. However, children born or adopted overseas will be deemed to be foreign inhabitants if there is clear evidence that they are not a member of the sponsor's household and are not residing overseas primarily because of the sponsors duty assignment. For example, a child born or adopted overseas would be deemed to be a foreign inhabitant if the child continued to reside overseas with the other parent after their military or civilian employee sponsor returns to the United States or is transferred to another foreign country on permanent change of station orders. (See paragraph 7&hyph;4c, DA Pam 27&hyph;162.) (iii) In the case of a spouse married overseas to a member of the armed forces or a U.S. civilian employee, the spouse continues to be a foreign inhabitant until he or she moves with the sponsor to another foreign country or to the United States. (iv) Parents or other relatives who are financially dependent on a member of the military or civilian employee, but are not members of the household, continue to be foreign inhabitants. If they are members of the sponsor's household they lose foreign inhabitant status once they have resided in the United States or another foreign country with the sponsor. (3) Other residents of the United States, or its territories, commonwealths, or possessions who are visiting, touring, or employed overseas, but not inhabitants of a foreign country, are excluded. (c) Insurers or other subrogees. (1) Under this subpart the property claim of an insured, but not that of a subrogee, may be considered. This precludes consideration of the claim of an insurer subrogated by operation of law or the terms of a policy of insurance for payments made by it to or for its insured. However, an insured party will not be required to exhaust a remedy against an insurer, which the insured obtained by payment of a premium to that insurer, prior to payment of a property damage claim under this subpart. (2) Further, no claim or any part thereof, the amount of which has been recovered or is reasonably recoverable from workmen's compensation, health insurance, social security, or any indemnifying law or indemnity contract, may be paid. (3) Provisions of paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section are intended to preclude any payment that does not go to and remain with the injured party claimant. (4) If the application of paragraph (c)(2) of this section would impose severe hardship upon an individual, the claim should be forwarded to Commander, USARCS, who is authorized to make exceptions in individual cases upon presentation of adequate justification. ยง536.152 Claims payable.

(2) Civilian employees of a military department of the Department of Defense who are U.S. citizens. Claims generated by U.S. citizens who are employees of a nonappropriated fund activity who are paid with nonappropriated funds will be paid in accordance with the provisions of this subpart and subpart L from nonappropriated funds. (3) Other civilian employees who are not U.S. citizens and were recruited or transferred from a country other than the one in which they are employed and where the incident occurred.

Claims arising from the operation of U.S. Armed Forces vehicles or other equipment by the employees described in the preceding sentence, however, may be paid, even though the employees are not acting within the scope of their employment, provided the employer or owner of the vehicle or other equipment would be liable under local law in the circumstances involved. (2) Officers or civilian employees of the American Battle Monuments Commission, acting within the scope of employment. Claims generated by such personnel will be paid from American Battle Monuments Commission appropriations.
