Using data from soundings carried out by a drifting scientific research ship, the author attempts to determine the amplitude functions of the individual modes of tidal internal gravtitational waves by means of an analysis of vertical temperature soundings. Soundings, which were carried out in the region of 9�10' North latitude and 176�06' West longitude, were at 30-minute intervals and reached a depth of 600 m. For an analysis of the profiles of the vertical soundings the method of empirical orthogonasl functions was used. The conclusions which could be drawn from the results of the soundings were as follows: 1. In the part of the ocean which was examined the average state of a random field of internal gravitational waves on tidal frequency can be represented in the form of a superposition of vertically standing internal waves. 2. In the open ocean the mechanism for the generation of tidal internal waves with a modal structure may be the parametric instability which is produced by tide-forming forces.
