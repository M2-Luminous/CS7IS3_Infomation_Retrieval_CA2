It is natural that both Japan and the U.S. should make efforts but Japan has to make its own efforts on both macroeconomic and microeconomic problems in view of the fact that this country plays a large role in leading the world economy, Hosokawa said during a session of the House of Representatives' budget committee. The powerful lower house started deliberation on a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 which calls for a spending increase of 2,185.2 billion yen over the second revised budget, to cover the largest-ever economic stimulus package of 15.25 trillion yen, and an increase of the overall general account budget for the current year ending in March to 77,437.50 billion yen. Commenting on last week's breakdown in the Japan-U.S. "Framework trade" talks in Washington, Hosokawa said that it was regrettable the two countries could not reach an accord, but that both sides agreed not to let the issue disrupt friendly relations between Japan and the U.S. Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to agree on trade negotiations aimed at reducing Japan's bloated trade surplus and opening its markets to U.S. firms. "Japan must tackle what it can voluntarily...such as making procedures transparent for insurance and government procurement, promoting cooperation between the two countries' auto industries, deregulating the economy, accelerating imports and investments, and securing competition," Hosokawa said. He made the remarks in response to questions by Shigeru Goto, a lower house legislator of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the leading bloc of the seven-party ruling coalition. The prime minister expressed his hope that the U.S. would act with sensible judgment, referring to recent U.S. moves toward retaliatory measures against Japan following the failure of the framework talks. On U.S. criticism that "bureaucrats" have led the negotiations on Japan's side, Hosokawa denied the charge, saying that though the officials of each ministry made considerable effort to protect national interests, neither the politicians nor the bureaucrats can accept the U.S. "stance against economic deregulation."
