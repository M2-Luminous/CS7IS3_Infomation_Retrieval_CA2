Jasenka Dudic is on the phone with a report. [Dudic] The program which is being implemented in the health service is part of the overall stabilization program, so I -- just like Dr. Hebrang -- would as a man of principles refuse to head the government if that program was brought into question. Prime Minister Valentic said this when he refused the minister's resignation and announced a discussion of the situation in the health service for the next session. He stressed that the government would not allow anarchy in the health service. The prime minister admitted that opposition to the stabilization program has been much greater than the government has admitted before, and that there is still some opposition on the part of those who oppose order. Concerning prices, they are under control, and the government's message to those who have increased them is to reduce prices to previous levels, or the state will intervene. The Croatian Government has adopted two-phase emergency measures for improving the water supply to Zadar and Biograd. Over the past two years the government has done everything to provide the water supply to those two towns, Prime Minister Valentic and Deputy Prime Minister Seks stressed. However, we have to exert additional pressure on UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] because they did not do anything to improve the water supply and protect the Kakme source, thus enabling the crime against humanitarian law.
