During the interview, the minister indicated an intention to visit Japan this year to hold talks with Japanese leaders on measures to increase trade with Japan and Japanese investment in the country, following similar talks with the United States and the European Union (EU). He stated that, in addition to investment in resources-related industries, South Africa hopes that direct foreign investment will lead to an improvement of the social infrastructure in such areas as housing construction, electrification, and water supply as well as in tourism, to which the Mandela administration is attaching importance. Both the United States and the EU have moved toward closer trade relations with South Africa. For example, they have decided to apply general preferential duties to the country, which has put an end to its apartheid policy following a constituent parliamentary election in April. In showing interest in consultations with Japan, the trade minister stated: "Japan has been positively investing in foreign nations, and it has enjoyed trade surpluses." He expressed hope that Japan will help revitalize the South African economy by promoting both investment and trade.
