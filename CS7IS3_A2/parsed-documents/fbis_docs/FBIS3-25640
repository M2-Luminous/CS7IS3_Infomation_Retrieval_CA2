The looting started at Kuisebmond Mill and Salvage compound after the crowd, who were apparently looking for a place to sleep, overpowered security guards. Joined by compound residents, the mob looted a former hostel building of thousands of litres of ice-cream, 12 tons of fish, 388 beef carcasses, crab meat worth R56,000, eight tons of processed mielie meal and R15,000 in cash. The mob then cordoned off the building and threw stones at police. Lt Frik Conradie, District Commissioner of the SAP [South African Police] in Walvis Bay, said the SAP, accompanied by the Namibian police, later brought the situation under control. Businessmen and residents said they were concerned that the looting would spill over into the town. No one was arrested.
