We are at the end of our tether," says the owner of a mid-level defense firm who is up to the ears in trouble these days. He continues: "The defense budget cut has led to continuous falls in the Office of Supply procurement. Exports also have been on the downtrend since the latter half of the 1980's due to the technological stagnation and the constant checking by the United States. We simply cannot make both ends meet. Factories remain idle but wages nearly doubled over the past few years. Still, because of the peculiarities of defense industry, we find it difficult to convert to another industry." The Korean defense industry is reeling to its foundations. And academia and research groups are warning, in increasingly loud voices, that it "must not be left as it is." According to informed sources, the situation apparently is more critical than generally thought. The confirmed average rate of operation of defense firms in 1992 was as low as 53 percent. The number of workers moving to other industries has also been on the increase; some 1,500 of them left the defense industry in 1992 alone. They were either separated in reduction-in-force actions or changed their employment. It is known that many firms are on the brink of close-down. A well-known company recently moved part of its operations to the United States to find a way of exporting to third countries, averting U.S.-imposed restrictions. Exports, which earned as much as $400 million to $500 million in the mid-1980's, have plummeted to a $100 million level in recent years. General trading companies have sharply reduced their operations for arms and equipment exports. Currently, while only two or three of them, including Kolon, maintain their old levels, most of those companies have at most four or five employees assigned to defense industry export business. The government procurement of weapons and equipment from defense firms in the country was 1 trillion 300-odd billion won [W] in 1992, a drop by more than 30 percent from the 1991 level. The downtrend continued in 1993, it is known. The reason is that, as a result of improvement in the Northeast Asian situation and further democratization in Korea, which spurred demand for increased welfare spending, the defense spending was forced, relatively, to a standstill. Another factor was that as the Ministry of National Defense [MND] focused on high-tech equipment in its arms procurement program, purchase orders kept shrinking for domestic firms whose production capabilities were limited to basic arms and shells. This led straight to falls in the firms' sales. The "A" firm, a leading shells firm, capable of producing 300 billion won-worth shells, turned out only 120 billion won-worth in 1993. The "S" company, a mid-level firm which needs 25 billion won in annual sales to stay in business, had only 8 billion won in sales from government procurement in 1993. The plight is the same of chaebol [conglomerates] defense firms. In the case of Hyundai Precision & Industry Co., mainly producing T-88 tanks, it had 190 billion won in annual sales from government procurement until 1992, when the sales fell to 120 billion won. Its 1993 sales are known to have dropped further. The situation is worse with exports. The nation's arms exports once registered more than $400 million in small arms and shells alone in the early 1980's. It did not include clothing and other outfits. The amount has continued to shrink since the latter half of the 1980's, falling below the $100 million mark in 1992, according to industry estimates. Meanwhile, defense-related organizations estimate the 1992 exports at $20 million or so. The reported $25 million-worth export last year of "K-200 Korea-type armored cars" to Malaysia by Daewoo Heavy Industries turned out to be not an export in fact. The fact, according to reports, is that the Korean government provided--at Washington's request--the armored cars in support of Malaysian combat troops sent to Somalia, and that in doing so, it took the form of export. There are, roughly, two reasons for the sharp decline in exports since the latter half of the 1980's. One is the increasingly tight restrictions imposed by U.S. authorities on guard against growth of the Korean defense industry, and the other is the industry's technological stagnation. In respect to high value-added equipment, Korea is totally under U.S. control under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) of the annual Korea-U.S. Security Consultation Meeting (SCM). In other words, its access to export itself is blocked. As for lower-class products such as bullets, Korea had to lose the markets to developing nations, such as China and Malaysia known for low labor costs, because of the sluggish technological development since the 1980's. These developments are in part attributable to the global easing of the Cold War. As a result of the easing, the defense spending has continued to drop the world over since 1990. The 1990 world defense spending marked a 5% drop from the previous year, and 1991 marked another 3% fall to $921 billion. The decline continued in 1992--to an estimated $800 billion. International arms trade also has continued to shrink by more than 20% every year. Japan virtually has been the only exception to the downtrend in defense spending. In major defense industry countries like the United States, France and Russia, the large-scale restructuring of defense industry is causing continued mergers and close-downs of firms. In the maelstrom, 600,000 workers have lost their jobs in the United States since 1989. It can hardly be denied that the current plight of defense firms in Korea should be seen in the light of this global restructuring. At the same time, however, interested parties are unanimous in viewing the policy shift--away from the defense industry buildup by the Fifth and Sixth Republic governments--as the cause directly responsible for the present situation. The view generally accepted is that the Korean defense industry was founded in 1970, when President Pak Chong-hui, stunned by the 1969 commando assault on Chongwadae by Kim Sin-cho, instructed the formulation of a "10-year defense industry development plan." The National Defense and Science Institute [NDSI] was thus established, and the Defense Industry Council was created under the president's direct control. The council decided to begin where domestic production was possible, such as that of ammunition and communication equipment, selecting 20 firms for that purpose. The industry, combined with heavy chemical industry development policies in the mid-1970's, was on the rise. It developed the assembly capabilities for conventional weapons such as guns, tanks and helicopters in the late 1970's. It even began exporting products like M-16's and parts of communication electronics to Iran and the Philippines. The industry was the "goose laying golden eggs," bringing in big money. The trend made a turnaround in the Fifth Republic. The government, pursuing a basic "economic stability program," saw the excessive investment in the heavy chemical industry as the culprit of inflation. As a natural development, the defense industry was taken off the priorities list. The Defense Industry Council was dissolved and procurement from domestic firms stayed flat. Some research institutes went out of existence. The downtrend is still on. "In the general view of researchers, the nation's defense technology today has nothing much different from what it was in the 1980's. Responsible for this are both the government remaining indifferent to changes and the defense firms that spent their earnings of the 1970's not for research and development but to buy land," says an NDSI researcher. The problem is that consequences are not confined to deteriorations in the payments position of some defense firms. Experts note that even in the basic weapons branch, the possibility cannot be ruled out of a collapse of an adequate production capability itself, either for wartime or peacetime. Further, under the present circumstances, it seems to be fundamentally impossible to expect domestic defense firms to perform a positive role in the building of independent high-tech weapons systems. Defense industry is a key state industry in most of the nations, because it not only has big pervasive technological effects on high-tech industries but also contributes greatly to creating jobs. This explains why those nations are intensifying protectionism for their defense industries against the optimistic trends of the post-Cold War. The U.S. F-17 is about four times the cost of the Russian MIG counterpart. Nevertheless, the U.S. Government buys the American product. The Japanese Government also pays four times the international price to procure T-17 tanks from Japanese makers. Major Japanese defense firms such as Hitachi and Mitsubishi receive 400 million yen to 500 million yen in technology development subsidies from the government every year. The Korean defense industry is in a critical conversion period now. Interested parties are unanimous in pointing out that it should come out of the conventional manufacturing of basic arms and convert to high-tech fields for more pervasive effects in technology. However, firms are already too weak at the moment to tide over the restructuring period. Chi Man-won, a military affairs expert, says that "strategy for the survival of domestic defense firms should be found not in a hasty push for domestic production but in developing specialties in the production of parts and tie-ups with foreign companies." "More important, however," he noted, "is to improve the administrative system which is now so inefficient that papers sent to the MND take months to reach the intended offices." Paek Yong-hun, director of the Korea Industrial Development Institute and chairman of the Defense Industry Society, said: "We are in the Uruguay Round age in which subsidies to protect domestic industries are totally abolished; however, as far as defense industry is concerned, subsidizing it is unlikely to cause any international controversy, because advanced nations like the United States, Japan and Germany are all subsidizing their defense industries to protect them." "The government should not try to cut the defense spending blindly but keep it at adequate levels and, in particular, increase the budget for technology development sharply," he stressed. Currently, there are 84 defense firms in Korea. Cooperative firms included, the number will be nearly 300. The number of workers in the 84 firms alone is about 26,000. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimates the Korean defense industry manpower at 40,000. The SIPRI number, however, seems to include NDSI and other researchers plus employees of some cooperative firms.
