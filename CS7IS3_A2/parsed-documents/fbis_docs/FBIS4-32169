The president has not been elected by the parliament and cannot be summoned to answer for his acts at the initiative of several parliamentary groups who have involved through this invitation the whole parliament without previously consulting the whole parliament." Reiterating the essence of the president's statements made during a visit in the country [in Satu Mare] with regard to the issue of the nationalized houses, the presidency spokesman said that the statements were perfectly legal and in concordance with the presidential prerogatives and therefore "the president has nothing to retract." The very fact that the president would not follow a procedure, considered to be unconstitutional, of coming in front of the legislative, does not exclude the president's readiness for dialogue with any political formation on the basis of mutual respect, said the spokesman. "The president will come in front of parliament any time it is necessary, but only if the constitutional provisions are observed," said presidency spokesman Traian Chebeleu.
