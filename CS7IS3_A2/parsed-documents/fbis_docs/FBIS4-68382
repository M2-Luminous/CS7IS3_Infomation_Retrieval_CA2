Yesterday, fares on the St. Petersburg subway increased by 50 percent. Now one ride in the subway will cost R150. Streetcar, trolley bus, and bus fares now will be R150. Transporting luggage will cost the same. The fare will be accepted by punching a R2 or R5 coupon, which will now be assigned a face value of R150. The most impressive price hikes will occur with respect to monthly fare cards, however. From now on the cost of an unlimited monthly fare card for one type of ground transportation will be R7,500; for two, R11,200; and for three, R13,500. A universal fare card will cost R16,000. Students, as well as vocational and regular school pupils, will not fare any better. For instance, a "student" fare card for one type of ground transportation will now cost R3,700, and a "pupil" one--R2,500. A fare card for two types of ground transportation will cost these categories of riders R5,600 and R3,700, respectively, and the "universal" will cost R8,000 and R5,300, respectively. At the same time, the fine for riding without a ticket or not paying for luggage will remain the same. As before, it is R5,000.
