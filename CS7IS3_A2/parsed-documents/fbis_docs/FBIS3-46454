Qiao is the first top NPC leader to visit West Europe since New China was founded in 1949, and also another significant visit abroad following his five-ASEAN nation tour last year. Sources from the NPC said: "The visit marks that the relationship between China and these three countries have entered a new stage of the all-round development." During the visit, Qiao had talks and meetings on more than 20 separate occasions with the three countries' presidents, government and parliament leaders and exchanged views with them on bilateral ties, parliament-to-parliament exchanges and cooperation in particular, international or regional situation as well as issues of common concern. "They have reached consensus on a wide range of issues, thus promoting mutual understanding and friendship and laying a sound basis for developing bilateral ties in depth, the sources said, adding that "the visit has achieved anticipated results." During the talks and meetings, the leaders between China and the three countries all set their eyes on their future relationship. All of them agreed that furthering and enhancing the existing good ties between China and the three countries will not only benefit the both, but also play an unmeasurable roles in safeguarding the world peace and stability. China and Germany are two important and influential countries in the world. During the visit, the leaders of the two countries had the full confidence in the prospects for bilateral ties. Qiao stressed that in developing Sino-German ties, the two countries should not only set their eyes on the 90s in this century, but also toward the next century. He said it is imperative to handle such relationship with a strategic sight and develop long-term and stable friendly ties and cooperation between the two countries stradling across the next century on the basis of mutual respect and trust, seeking common ground while reserving differences and equality and mutual benefit. Switzerland is one of the first Western countries to establish diplomatic ties with China. The two sides shared a common view that vigorous and dynamic economy in China will create more favorable conditions for the expansion of the all-round development of bilateral relations. The Swiss side showed great interest in conducting economic cooperation with China. Austria which is regarded as the "home of music" has enjoyed special and good relations with China. Qiao noted during the visit that both China and Austria are in the different period for development. There still exists a gap between the two countries in economic growth. But it does not affect bilateral ties, and on the contrary makes them attach greater importance to their friedship and ties in the future. The past few years have seen rapid development of bilateral economic ties and trade. Statistics show that from January to November last year, the volume of trade between China on the one hand, Germany, Switzerland and Austria on the other amounted respectively to 8.34 billion U.S. dollars, 1.08 billion U.S. dollars and 364 million U.S. dollars, representing increases of 64.3 percent, 91.6 percent and 5.9 percent respectively compared with the same period of 1992. By the end of last June, the number of the German-invested enterprises in China rose to 386 with a total investment of 1.365 billion U.S. dollars. Switzerland invested a total of 210 million U.S. dollars in 88 enterprises in China. Qiao's visit to these three countries opened a broad prospect for such economic ties and trade. During the visit, Qiao Shi also held working talks with top parliamentary leaders of the three countries, exchanged with them experiences on the parliament work, thus playing a positive role in strengthening cooperation and exchanges between the NPC and the three parliaments. Qiao formally invited Rita Suessmuth, president of the National Assembly of Germany, to visit China and welcomed Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock to China too. Qiao also announced the establishment of a China-Germany friendship group for parliamentary members. Qiao also reaffirmed China's consistent stand on the issues of human rights and Tibet. The central government's policy toward dalai lama remains unchanged, he said. "Dalai Lama is welcome to Tibet. Every issue that we can talk about, except the issue of `Tibet independence'," he said. [sentence as received] On the issue of human rights, Qiao said it is imperative to integrate with every country's reality while talking about this issue. Qiao expounded this issue to the leaders of the three countries by using China's modern history. He said: "It is an arduous task for us to solve the problems of clothing, food, housing, transportation, education and employment in China which has a population of 1.1 billion." The aim of safeguarding state sovereignty and maintaining its domestic stability by the Chinese Government is to continuously guarantee its reform and opening up. "The fundamental way to ensure the Chinese people to enjoy the human rights is to concentrate our efforts on developing economy and productive forces, raise our comprehensive national strength and improve the people's living standards," Qiao said. Both Qiao and the leaders of the three countries held that the direct dialogues between them on the relevant issues of common concern is beneficial to promoting mutual understanding and trust on the basis of seeking common ground while reserving differences. Looking toward the future, it is believed that Qiao's visit to the three countries will exert a great influence on the promoting closer relationship between China and the three countries.
