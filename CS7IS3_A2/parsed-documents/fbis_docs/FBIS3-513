They were speaking after holding talks in Mmabatho this evening. Mr. Cronje quashed rumors that the Bophuthatswana government is on the verge of collapse. He claimed that the situation in the country was not as serious as it was portrayed in the media. Earlier today chaos erupted in the capital as the strike reached crisis levels. Estelle Pienaar reports on events outside the capital: [Pienaar] With the tension reaching fever pitch in Mmabatho, the South African Defense Force [SADF] is on standby in nearby Lichtenburg. A shopkeeper in the town told us that a contingent of SADF trooops had arrived in the town during the day. We went to investigate and found several Puma helicopters and a Dakota aircraft at the aerodrome. Curious town folk had gathered in the mealie fields surrounding the aerodrome to witness the event. With the Bophuthatswana police and miitary still staunchly supporting the Mangope government, and doing everything in their power to put down the riotous crowds, the SADF presence in the area might be a stern warning of what could lie ahead for Bophuthatswana if peace and stability are not restored soon.
