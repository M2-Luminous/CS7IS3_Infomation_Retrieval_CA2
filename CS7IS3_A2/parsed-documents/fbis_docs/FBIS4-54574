[Coposu] Currently our country is facing an economic crisis that is close to a catastrophe. One could say that it has entered the phase of economic collapse. In my opinion, however, the principal crisis is the moral one. Besides the political and social crisis, besides the economic one, which everyone perceives, I believe that the gravest crisis currently facing Romania is the moral one. That crisis has been caused by the postrevolutionary governments' obvious inability to direct the country toward the restructuring of its democratic institutions and the establishment of a free economy. All the attempts made by the governments that have been ruling the country since December 1989 -- which all lacked a program and which tried to compensate for their failure in administering public affairs by supplying economic-social program strategies, that is, in practical terms, merely a listing of goals -- have failed to yield any positive results. On top of that, it was all followed by a series of bills of a Marxist-Leninist nature that made the government look like a new hardline communist nomenklatura. All the bills there have been have loopholes and present a series of deficiencies that became obvious after those bills became effective. For instance, in 1990 they refused to elaborate a bill on the restitution of land. Now they are refusing to elaborate the bill on the restitution of urban real estate. I mean, they promoted imperfect laws, beginning with the Constitution. This situation, interwoven with their lack of political will to implement democratic reform and the transition toward market economy has generated this crisis.... [CURIERUL NATIONAL] You asserted that all post-December bills have loopholes. This takes us by surprise, considering that some of them were sanctioned by the representatives of the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] and, generally, by those of the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania] as well.... [Coposu] That is right, the opposition representatives have not always adopted negative-oriented stances. Among the hundreds of negative things it has done, the government has also managed to accomplish certain good things that enjoyed the opposition's support. Ours is a firm stance, as we already asserted when the current government took office. We promised that we would support all democratic initiatives, everything that stands for progress and is directed toward establishing democracy. This is why we have always reacted positively to all signals that indicate a tendency toward democratization and privatization. We have opposed, however, all attempts -- which, as a matter of fact, eventually succeeded owing to their majority in parliament, which is ensured by the extremist parties -- that oppose democracy and the rules of the market economy. One such example would be the taxes foreseen for the farmers' incomes. Such taxes represent a tremendous gaffe, and will have serious consequences upon the government. It is a gaffe in which we played no part, but rather walked out of parliament hall so that we could not be connected, even indirectly, with that abhorrent law. [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Let us return to the crisis. In your estimation, how could it be overcome? [Coposu] There is no way out of this crisis other than by altering the structure of the majority in parliament and by the government's expressing and also implementing its will to accomplish reform. Currently no such will is available, and we are turning about and about in a vicious circle of positive affirmations and praiseworthy intentions regarding reform, but which, however, are never applied in practice or followed by concrete steps intended to achieve transition. How can we overcome this crisis? In my opinion, considering the lack of will on the part of the executive bodies and, especially, of President Iliescu to renounce his monopoly over the authority he very firmly holds in state matters, all negotiations with the opposition are useless. They are merely a waste of time. [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Today quite a number of political analysts consider that the opposition made a mistake after the elections held in the fall of 1992, when it rejected the PDSR's [Social Democracy Party of Romania] offer to jointly set up a coalition government. Similarly, now they are also criticizing the then intention of the CDR to push the PDSR into the arms of the left wing and the nationalist-extremist parties. What is your opinion on this? [Coposu] The reason for our refusal was different. Accepting the responsibility of ruling means to have access to the levers of power and to be able to implement one's own program. The experience of the PNL [National Liberal Party] was eloquent in this sense, as they participated in the Stolojan cabinet without being allowed to appoint any of its members as public servants. I mean, if they put at the opposition's disposal the office of interior minister, for instance, and give that person a ministerial salary, a chauffeured limousine, and a villa in the Primaverii district, the problem will still remain unresolved. Such a minister should be given full authority to reorganize its ministry down to the lowest level. Otherwise the supporters of neo-communism in his ministry might resort to sabotage. What we asked for could easily have been fulfilled. We asked for full authority to implement their programs for all portfolio holders of the ministries entrusted to the opposition. They, however, refused. We said: "If you do not wish to share power with us, you cannot share responsibility either, so why don't you keep it for yourselves alone. As long as you behave democratically, we will support you. The moment you come up with law-making initiatives that endanger democracy, we will stop supporting you." Thus, they denied us access to the levers of power. Under such circumstances, we could not cooperate with them. My party cannot participate in a government with three ministers while power is actually held by Mr. Iliescu. [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Are you really convinced that Mr. Iliescu has full control over PDSR? [Coposu] No, I am not. But he is inclined to wish to control the progress of life in all domains of activity down to the minutest detail. Such is his tendency, but I have no way of knowing the extent to which he is also being sabotaged by his own party, the former Securitate, and the current SRI [Romanian Intelligence Service]. [CURIERUL NATIONAL] You said that the solution to overcome the crisis would be to alter the majority in parliament. How could that be achieved? [Coposu] There are two angles to this issue. First, I believe it will be very difficult for them to continue ruling with the current parliament. I consider it similarly difficult to achieve a different majority with the political spectrum currently existing in parliament. And yet, how could a different majority still be achieved? By means of a future cooperation, rather than an alliance government. Cooperation is something that could be done even by political groupings with contradicting programs and diametrically opposed ideologies. What does cooperation mean? It means the temporary cessation of the parties' own initiatives, on the basis of a minimal program, accepted by everyone, and intended to overcome a difficult moment that has emerged in the ruling of the country. Therefore, theoretically speaking, such cooperation could be achieved by the PDSR's appointing a number of its own delegates, which should be in accordance with the people's updated option, while, on the other hand, representatives of the opposition parties should be appointed, similarly, in accordance with the proportion held by each of those parties in the people's updated option, all those representatives ensuring the functioning of a department each. All departments should be left entirely to the care of their leaders, without any meddling on the part of any of the other factors. After having attempted to overcome the crisis situation, a balance is to be drawn up to single out all those who have not complied with their duties and to make them assume responsibility for their inability to govern. This is what cooperation means. And it could be achieved if the group of the moderates within the PDSR were stronger and could impose its point of view on the group of radicals. However, currently the radicals are terrorizing the moderates and compelling them to submit to the measures they dictate. The best proof of this is the fact that persons who were considered moderates, under the terror of the radicals, meanwhile changed their stance and have swung to the other extreme. Mr. Adrian Nastase [executive chairman of the PDSR] has become more radical than the radicals themselves, because he knows that the majority of the party tolerates him merely because of Mr. Iliescu's insistence. If the group of moderates could impose its own views, then they, together with the opposition and perhaps with the PD-FSN [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front], of which I do not know whether they would participate or rather merely support such a government, the alteration of the parliamentary majority could be achieved. [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Lately you have frequently mentioned the idea of holding early elections. On what grounds do you venture to make such assertions? [Coposu] I see no way in which the current parliament could go on functioning until the mandate entrusted to it by the nation expires. And it is my belief that if no early elections are to be held this fall, they will certainly have to take place next spring. Early elections are always determined by the inability to overcome crisis situations. Well, our current government does not even have a program to overcome the crisis. Look at their [1994] draft budget.... It is full of nonsense and illusory provisions. It hopes for state spending to be covered by borrowing 800 billion lei from the nation. I wonder, will anyone in Romania be ready to credit the Vacaroiu government with such an amount? [CURIERUL NATIONAL] You mentioned the moderates and the radicals within the PDSR. Would a rift between those two wings be beneficial for our political life, or rather not? [Coposu] That rift will occur and it will doubtlessly strengthen the left. If one were to examine the political concept of the parliamentary majority, one would find that they are former communists who have now declared themselves democrats. There is no difference whatsoever between Mr. Verdet's [chairman of the Socialist Party of Labor -- PSM] chamber of deputy members and those of the majority in parliament. They have the same type of mentality and they are similarly unable to break through the shell of their Marxist-Leninist way of thinking. Such a rift within the PDSR would be welcome to clear things up once and for all. However, it is important that the wing that breaks off should not be a majority one, because this would come to prove the label we have given to the PDSR, namely that it is a crypto-communist party. [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Judging by your reasoning you seem to be more interested in the rift itself than in anything else. Have you ever considered the risks it would imply? On the one hand, the minority of the moderates could be absorbed by the opposition, while, on the other hand, the left wing would be strengthened by helping itself to the PDSR structures. [Coposu] In this phase of confusion we are currently going through, one needs to get one thing straight. The important thing in any multiparty system is that there should be a powerful opposition, even if it is a left-wing one. Who is stopping us from having the current opposition run the country with the left wing in the opposition? In the current phase, in our transition toward a market economy, it might even prove to be beneficial to have a left-wing opposition throttle tendencies to wild capitalism. There has to be a crystallization of the situation regardless of the sacrifice and I believe that it would be better if the radical half of the PDSR joined the communists, so that at least one would know who one has to deal with. But of course, such crystallization implies perils.... [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Do you think that the opposition is able to handle such perils? [Coposu] The opposition is structured upon certain persons who left their prison cells with their pockets empty and their assets confiscated. They had no access to radio, or television, and could not have their programs circulated by the press. If you want to have the press, you need money. Only I know what hardships we have to put up with to keep the daily DREPTATEA afloat, considering its 7-8 million lei monthly deficit. The opposition is poor, but I limit that to the CDR, because the others, such as the PD-FSN have already been in power, so they were able to make some money. They have their own press. [CURIERUL NATIONAL] In connection with the crystallization needed within the PDSR, do you think that this process should be extended over the CDR, as well? [Coposu] It would be childish if I asserted that there are no divergences within the CDR. However, our democratic conception compels us to the unanimous acceptance of the ideas supported by the majority. The CDR consists of eight parties and 10 political groupings that do not have a party character. This means 18 determining factors, each with its own identity and political ideology. The criteria at the basis of the setting up of this alliance is a minimal program, a platform containing certain very restricted points. [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Even with that minimum program, the CDR member parties have disagreed, at crucial moments, in parliament.... [Coposu] They did, doubtlessly. A common denominator is inconceivable. It is right to have divergent points. And there is divergence among the CDR members and among the parliamentary factions of the opposition. However, each of those parties realizes that if it were to leave the CDR, it would immediately be annihilated and doomed to disappear from our political life. The fate of Mr. Campeanu [former chairman of the National Liberal Party] and his party can prove it.
