EFFECTIVE DATE: October 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Brinkmann (202&hyph;482&hyph;5288) or Cindy Robinson (202&hyph;482&hyph;4087), Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20230. POSTPONEMENT OF PRELIMINARY DETERMINATIONS: The Department of Commerce (``the Department'') is postponing the preliminary determinations in the antidumping duty investigations of furfuryl alcohol from the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of South Africa (South Africa) and Thailand. The deadline for issuing these preliminary determinations is now no later than December 9, 1994. On June 20, 1994, the Department initiated antidumping duty investigations of furfuryl alcohol from the PRC, South Africa and Thailand (59 FR 32953, June 27, 1994). The notice stated that we would issue our preliminary determinations on November 7, 1994. On July 15, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission determined that there was a likelihood that a U.S. domestic industry was materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of furfuryl alcohol from the PRC, South Africa and Thailand. On October 7, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15(c), QO Chemicals, Inc., the petitioner, requested that the Department postpone until December 9, 1994, the issuance of its preliminary determination in each of the above investigations in order to ensure that adequate time is available for the Department and petitioner to fully address the issues in these investigations. Petitioner's request for postponement was timely, and the Department finds no compelling reasons to deny the request. Therefore, we are postponing the deadline for issuing these determinations until no later than December 9, 1994. This notice is published pursuant to section 733(c)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and 19 CFR 353.15(d). Dated: October 18, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26443 Filed 10&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
