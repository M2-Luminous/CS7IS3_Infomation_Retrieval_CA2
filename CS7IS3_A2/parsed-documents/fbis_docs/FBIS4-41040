The cash gap between the planned revenues and budgetary expenditures in 1994's 1st quarter amounted to almost 40 trillion karbovantsi [K]. NBU [National Bank of Ukraine] granted 26.6 trillion [currency not specified] credits to bridge it. Considering the latter circumstance, expenditures amounted to K145 trillion (67 per cent). 82.8 per cent of budgetary outlays were channelled to welfare and support for societal, cultural, educational and other state-financed institutions related to the societal domain. According to Mr. Zvyagilski, reduced revenues resulted from not only objective causes, but because of "certain ministers and departments having failed to take adequate moves to mobilize revenues for the state budget, as provided for by the Law." In the meantime, Vitali Masol, the newly appointed prime minister of Ukraine, said in his inaugural speech in the Ukrainian parliament that, according to IMF experts, about 1.3 billion US dollars hard currency incomings had failed to return to Ukraine in 1993.
