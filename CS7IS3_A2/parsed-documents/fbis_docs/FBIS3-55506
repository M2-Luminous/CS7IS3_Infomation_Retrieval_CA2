[Parchimowicz] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy told me that he intends to visit Poland in the very near future. The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia was in a good mood today and declared his fraternal feelings for Poles. Many evil things happened in relations between the Tsarist empire and Poland, as well as in relations between the Soviet Union and Poland. One must forget and neutralize all that, Zhirinovskiy said, so that our relations will become good and Poles should not be afraid of us, because Russians and Poles are Slav brothers. Asked whether Russia will allow the Germans to take away from Poland the former Prussian territories, Zhirinovskiy replied that he is against any changes of borders, which were finally recognized in Helsinki in 1975 at the CSCE conference.
