Take notice that on November 15, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, Second Revised Sheet Nos. 215 and 216, First Revised Sheet No. 216A, Second Revised Sheet No. 233, Original Sheet No. 233A and Third Revised Sheet No. 355, to be effective December 1, 1994. Natural states that the tariff sheets were submitted in compliance with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) order issued October 17, 1994 at Docket Nos. RP94&hyph;399&hyph;000 and RP94&hyph;401&hyph;000. Natural has modified its Tariff to (1) delete the requirements that it file further quarterly reports and that it make a one-time operational data submission, and (2) include the Automatic Agency procedure which enables upstream shippers to utilize, through an agency arrangement, the priority of downstream firm shippers to which gas is delivered at a pooling point. Natural requested waiver of its tariff or of the Commission's Regulations to the extent necessary to permit the tariff sheets to become effective December 1, 1994. Natural states that copies of the filing are being mailed to Natural's jurisdictional customers, interested state regulatory agencies and all parties set out on the official service list at Docket Nos. RP94&hyph;399&hyph;000, et al. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests must be filed on or before November 28, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
