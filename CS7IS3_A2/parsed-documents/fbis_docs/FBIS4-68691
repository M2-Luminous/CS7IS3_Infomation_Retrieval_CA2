After a month-and-a-half-long absence, UTRO finally has found its way into your mail box. The interruption was hard for both you and us. Our telephones rang off the hook: What has happened to the newspaper? We once heard crying on the other end of the line: "I am recovering from a heart attack... You are all I have. And now the box is empty--so I do not have you anymore either, do I?..." Most calls, however, ended with the sentence: "Hold on, we are with you!" The cause of the protracted silence hardly needs any comment. We are not living in a desert, and everybody hears about stoppages of giant enterprises, the bankruptcy of entire industrial sectors, and delinquency files. We have also been unable to escape this fate--no paper or money. It is doubly disappointing that the oxygen vent was closed at the time the subscription campaign began... But even on the brink of disaster we found out once again that there are enough good people in the world for whom the notion "credit of confidence" is not an empty sound. They believe in the newspaper's vitality, and this is why we are with you today. We are still struggling with tremendous hardships. But we want to assure our loyal readers, like-minded in spirit, that the newspaper will try to not let you down in your expectations. It will honestly inform you about everything that is happening in the kray. We will continue to delve into such topics as economics and politics, social protection and ecology, culture and science, spirituality and human rights. Such notions as work and morality, honor and conscience, love for the Motherland and duty--everything that makes the nation that preaches them great--will never get rusty or lose their value in the eyes of our authors. Neither will we ignore the shoots of healthy entrepreneurship, the reforms taking root, and the normal market, as well the as strengthening ties with the countries of the Asia-Pacific region. There is only one item that is banned here--dirt. In every sense of this word--whether it is distorting the substance of the issue in published materials or catering to unhealthy instincts--in short, catering to the "consumer." With the right of a friend, the newspaper expects of its allies-readers one thing--patience and tolerance. Initially we will not be able to publish five times a week--we will somewhat reduce the periodicity and will have an issue on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. And let the reader not be offended by some excessive advertising--we cannot survive without it economically. Moreover, we invite the active business cooperation of businessmen, entrepreneurs, and economic managers. We will gladly publish any private advertisement for a moderate price. In short, let us shake hands for friendship. Stay with us, friends, for the second half of the year. Our index is 53402.
