Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun spoke at the forum. Tian Jiyun said: The five principles of peaceful coexistence were first formulated by China and later advocated by China, India, and Burma. These principles represented the common aspirations of the newly independent nations and their peoples. Over the past 40 years, the five principles have been accepted by more and more countries and have played an important role in maintaining world peace. Exactly as Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Reviewing the practice of international relations, the five principles of peaceful coexistence proved to have the greatest vitality." Tian Jiyun pointed out: The five principles of peaceful coexistence are of immediate guiding significance in establishing a new international political and economic order. The five principles represent a summarization of the most fundamental norms of international relations, conform to the purpose of the principles of the United Nations Charter, illustrate the fundamental characteristics of a new-type of international relations. They should be the basis for the establishment of a fair and reasonable new international order. He said: Nowadays, some nations flaunt the banner of human rights and democracy and use them as a major tool of foreign policy to exert pressure on other nations in an attempt to impose their will on them. Historical experience told us that no matter what banner they flaunt, so long as they pursue such practices as the big bullying the small, the strong insulting the weak, and the rich suppressing the poor, they will never win people's hearts, and they will be condemned and opposed by people around the world, and they are doomed to fail in their attempt.
