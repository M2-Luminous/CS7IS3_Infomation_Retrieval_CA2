The $140 million project will provide a third fibre communications path out of Australia and reinforce WA's push to become a regional business hub. Companies dealing with Asia would be able to set up leased services linking them with their trading partners and offshore offices in the region taking advantage of the wider bandwidth available on the new link, officials said. The Australian cable will make land near Port Hedland and Jakarta at the Indonesian end, providing 60 times the capacity of the existing analogue link between Australia, Indonesia and Singapore which will gradually be withdrawn. A joint statement from Telecom and Optus said tenders would be called in July for the cable which would be ready for service by the end of 1996.
