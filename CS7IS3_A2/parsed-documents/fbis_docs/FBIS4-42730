Twenty states of the former East Bloc and ex-Soviet Union have already joined the PFP. On Friday [10 June] in Istanbul, Kozyrev will meet his colleagues from NATO and the other countries of the former East Bloc at the meeting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. This will take place, in accordance with tradition, after the meeting of the NATO Council of Ministers. Russia wants its entry to the PFP, greatly desired by NATO, to be accompanied by an agreement which recognizes its status as a major power, in the form of a special relationship between Russia and NATO. This point will be one of the major subjects of the Council of Ministers on Thursday. But in that respect, NATO is caught between two fires. All 16 member states agree that a good relationship between the alliance and the major power in the east of this continent is of the greatest importance for European security. But at the same time, NATO must not give the impression to the countries of Central and East Europe, which regard Russia's ambitions toward its "near abroad" suspiciously, that their fate is being fixed without them being consulted, that they are in some way second-class states. The relevant formula of British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd, that the dialogue between NATO and Russia must be one "without vetoes and without surprises," has already been adopted by Russian leaders. Nevertheless Russia, which rejects the eastward expansion of the alliance, is using a kind of veto against the Central and East European countries pushing for membership of the alliance. In any case, the alliance is also contributing to this. Various of its leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, have said that NATO "does not want to draw any new lines in Europe." From which Russia concluded that the old partition continues to exist in a lesser form. While all NATO countries agree on the importance of a good relationship with Russia, attitudes differ regarding the question of to what degree this special relationship can overshadow the plans of the Central and East European countries. The United States gives the highest priority to the best possible relationship with Russia. They want no initiatives which could destabilize President Boris Yeltsin and the government team of Vyktor Chernomyrdin. Just the fact that Russia has enough nuclear weapons to destroy the whole world makes it for the United States a partner which far outweighs the aspirations of Central and Eastern European countries. In addition, Washington is striving for the closest possible cooperation with Moscow in combating the spread of technology and material for nuclear weapons, one of the priorities of the Clinton government. At the other end of the spectrum, Germany is now pushing less openly than in the past for the Central European countries, to start with, to join NATO as quickly as possible. But the fact remains that Germany does not want to remain the eastern border of NATO (and the European Union), that it gives precedence to integrating Central and East Europe in the Western institutions. All this will provide new matter for discussion at the NATO Council of Ministers on Thursday in Istanbul. And as yet there are also no clear answers to the question of what form can be given to the special relationship between NATO and Russia. NATO is a strict intergovernmental alliance. There is no question of its secretary general starting political dialogue with Moscow in the name of the 16 member states. Should there be NATO Councils of Ministers in which their Russian colleague participates? Or should there be special consultation about questions in which Russia wants to have its say? And what answer will be given when for example Poland, which has so often in its history been the victim of the ambitions of powerful neighbors, asks why Iceland is involved in dialogue between NATO and Russia over European security, but Poland is not? These are all questions to which there is as yet no answer. The communique of the Council of Ministers in Istanbul will probably talk about "substantial dialogue" between NATO and Russia. But its content will remain vague and will also depend on the price wanted by Russia for joining the PFP.
