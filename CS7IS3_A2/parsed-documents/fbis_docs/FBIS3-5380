However, setting macroeconomic numerical targets is acceptable." He then proposed that as a specific numerical target, the government set itself the task of reducing Japan's current account surplus to about 2.5 percent of gross domestic product (the government proposes a figure of 2.8 percent in its economic outlook for fiscal 1994). At the same news conference, Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, touched on the government's 430-trillion yen public investment plan, saying: "The government should consider reviewing the plan, including increasing that amount." Her comments were a call for Japan to reduce its surplus by strengthening domestic demand.
