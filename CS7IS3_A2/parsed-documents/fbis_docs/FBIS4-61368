According to information from KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, the Russian Army newspaper, the opposition has almost 15,000 men under arms. This month the first step was taken toward a solution of the conflict, when representatives of the opposition and the government were persuaded to sit down to negotiate. Akbar Turadzhonzoda, who lives in Iran, did not attend the talks, but he has had meetings with senior Russian diplomats and ministers. Turadzhonzoda received EL PAIS in a building belonging to the Foreign Ministry, guarded by soldiers of the Russian Army -- the same army that is fighting his own men in Tajikistan. "The present regime is illegitimate, because it acceded to power thanks to the intervention of other countries (that is, Russia -- EL PAIS editor's note), and not as the result of a democratic election. This government survives only thanks to Russia's military and economic support," Turadzhonzoda said. However, he gave assurances that the opposition respects Russian interests in Tajikistan. The Muslim leader is in favor of a peaceful solution. To this end the present government must resign and be replaced by a government of national reconciliation, "comprising neutral and competent individuals." The return of the thousands of Tajiks who fled the country because of the civil war must be guaranteed, and free and democratic elections must be held. "We reject all proposals leading to coexistence with the present regime. There has been too much bloodshed and too much hatred. Everything depends on Russia. The Russians defend the borders, help to maintain internal order, and provide economic support. Russia must put pressure on the present government. If it does not do so, we will sink further and further into this dirty war, which can only end in one way -- with a shameful withdrawal, as happened in Afghanistan," he explained. The opposition's proposal, its leader said, would permit Russia to protect its interests "at less expense" and at the same time "to improve its relations with all parts of the Tajik people." The opposition is willing to disarm, but demands that this be done also by "all government structures, apart from the police." The functions of these structures will be taken over by peace- keeping forces, "comprising troops from other CIS countries." Russian officialdom in Tajikistan -- which has combated the opposition -- must be replaced. Turadzhonzoda said that he understands "the anxiety on the part of Russia and the Central Asian republics concerning our possible responses in the event of our winning the free elections that must be held after a two-year transition period." The Muslim leader was of course referring to "the bugbear with which they frighten themselves and others -- Islamic fundamentalism." In order to dispel these fears, Turadzhonzoda says he is willing to negotiate certain basic articles of the future constitution that will define the "nonconfessional and democratic character of the Tajik state." The opposition leader is also aware of the importance of the uranium deposits in Tajikistan and says that Russia will have priority in exploiting them. "I stress that no country of the West or of the Islamic world can take Russia's place at present," Turadzhonzoda said. "We are not demanding the withdrawal of the Russian Army, because that would be a disaster. There are too many enmities among the Tajiks, and the experience of Afghanistan frightens us. If Russia leaves, it will support part of the population, and the other part will be supported by Uzbekistan -- there are over a million Uzbeks in Tajikistan. As a result, we could lose our country and suffer a national tragedy in which the Tajiks will kill one another," he concluded.
