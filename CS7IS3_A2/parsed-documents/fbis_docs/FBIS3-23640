I will not take it upon myself to refute that information, I would only point out that there are aircraft and helicopters that are not combat-ready or have limited readiness in the 14th Air Army. Moreover, most of them are the rotary-winged craft from army aviation that were until recently under the subordination of the PrykVO [Carpathian Military District]. One of my features already talked about the 17 Mi-26 helicopters that are standing idle without main rotors (NA of 29 December 1993). Whatever the quantity of faulty aviation hardware, however, it must evoke anxiety among all of the officials connected with it. The more so as it will increase with every day if the appropriate measures are not taken. The paradox consists of the fact that there are getting to be more and more faulty aircraft, while the operation of the aircraft repair enterprises is slowing down or even coming to a halt. It is also worth noting that there are more than fifteen aircraft-repair plants (ARZs) in Ukraine. They are not only capable of repairing all of the disabled aircraft and helicopters, but also of filling orders for the repair of aviation hardware from other states, which would provide quite a bit of currency receipts for the state coffers. But... I will show how matters look using the example of the aircraft repair plant in Lviv. That collective has been headed for quite a long time now by Colonel Vyacheslav Kupch. He came to that enterprise as a lieutenant to the assembly shop, so he knows the business he is engaged in very well. And this allows him even during these difficult times to keep the "ship" afloat, so to speak, which is quite difficult. The Lviv ARZ has specialized in the repair of MiG aircraft since its very creation. It has a good technical base, skilled specialists and solid ties with other enterprises for the performance of all repair operations. So they have everything for the performance of their appointed duties. They even recently mastered the repair of the most modern MiG-29 fighter. And that was at their own expense. (The state, through the Ministry of Defense, did not allocate a single karbovanets to them for it). The enterprise, moreover, started to repair that type of aircraft last year, and has returned six MiG aircraft to their units. But even greater difficulties have appeared. The first is finances, since the Ministry of Defense has not paid for any of the aircraft. It turned out that the plant workers themselves suffered from their own initiative in mastering repair of the MiG-29... The difficult situation has also affected the aircraft repair plant in Lutsk, which specializes in the repair of jet engines for aircraft. Here, also at their own initiative and at their own expense, they mastered the repair of the RD-33 engines that are used on the MiG-29. They have repaired several of the units. But they have not been paid a single karbovanets for it. The work has thus been halted at the plant since December of last year. The workers have been sent on "vacation." Many of them have already found new jobs, and certainly will not return to the enterprise. The costly equipment is standing idle. The plant, in short, is collapsing. The Ministry of Defense, of course, is not failing to settle up with the repair plants out of some whim or ambition. It simply has no money. There is not even enough money, as is well known, to pay the servicemen. I remind you of the popular saying of penny wise, pound foolish. And when someone hits upon the idea of "economizing" through the payments to the repair enterprises, then we will have to pay not twice as much, but tens of times more. And as early as today. If the ARZ stops working, the aircraft have to be sent to Russia for repairs, and that requires hard currency. Budgetary financing, of course, is the main source for the enterprises of the Ministry of Defense, but it is far from the only one. They could also find their own, quite significant sources, and that without considerable efforts. Here are a few. The author of these lines has already had occasion to write about 164 aircraft that have been repaired and are being preserved at the ARZ in Lviv. These are aircraft that are not needed in practice to arm the Air Forces of Ukraine. But other countries could acquire them for their armies. So why not sell that surplus aviation hardware while it can still find buyers, and organize the repair of our own aircraft using the funds received? This question sounds almost rhetorical, since it has already been asked at various levels more than once. But weeks, months and even years are passing, and no one will make the decision. The aircraft are thus standing idle, growing functionally and physically obsolete, to the benefit of no one. The plant, on the contrary, suffered losses of some 726 million karbovantsy for the upkeep of the aforementioned 164 aircraft last year; the total will be considerably higher this year. Quite a few repaired engines have accumulated at the ARZ in Lutsk that are also not needed by the Air Forces of Ukraine, and in such quantity that they exceed a five-year supply. They could also be sold. A significant portion of the assemblies that are removed from aircraft destroyed in accordance with international agreements could also be offered for sale. Quite a bit that could be sold abroad, getting profits where there are losses today, could certainly be found at other ARZs as well. But unfortunately no one is occupied with this. Rather, there is no one to be occupied with it, since the aircraft repair plants do not have the right or the capability, while the the corresponding structure has not been created in the directorate of the Air Forces. There is yet another way to obtain funds--to perform repairs on the aviation hardware of other states. The Lviv ARZ repaired several aircraft for Poland last year, and was paid in hard currency for it. Those funds, by the way, were spent to master the repair of the MiG-29 and maintain the operability of the enterprise. The plant will have the opportunity to repair aircraft that are in service with the armies of Western Europe, India and some others in the future as well. But concluding agreements independently at the international level is outside the scope of authority of Colonel Kupch and his subordinates. A coordinating body in the Air Forces directorate is required here once again. It is also required in order to plan and analyze the work of the ARZs and place state orders. Its absence led to the fact that some enterprises last year were engaged in the repair of aviation hardware that is not in service in Ukraine. A situation has moreover taken shape today where there is not a single order for the targets of the ARZs that would stipulate the product range and volume of repairs of aviation hardware. This means that there is no legal basis for payment for the output for military purposes that would be produced by the enterprises. There are many other problems as well, connected with the fact that no one wants or is able to coordinate the affairs of the ARZs. They are left, so to speak, to the whims of fate, under the slogan of "every man for himself." So it ends up that Lutsk and some other plants have shut down, while Lviv, in order to survive, is engaged in the production of kitchen furnishings, medical instruments and even the assembly of intercity buses. That is possibly necessary, but the main thing for them is the repair of aircraft for the Air Forces of Ukraine. And they are not letting the plant pursue that business. So it turns out that almost half of the aircraft are out of order, but the aircraft repair plants are standing idle.
