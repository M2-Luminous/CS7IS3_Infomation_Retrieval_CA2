Since then, he has abandoned the intricacies of competition policy for the international stage as the Commissioner for external economic relations, and moved from the asbestos-ridden Berlaymont into the Commission's new home, the Breydel building. Sir Leon, the former British trade secretary forced to resign over the Westland helicopter scandal, has unquestionably made a professional success of his five and a half years in Brussels, and his continued enthusiasm suggests that it has been a personal triumph as well. Billed before his arrival as little more than the prime minister's poodle, Sir Leon has proved his critics wrong. In the tradition of Britons abroad, the disgraced ex-minister went native early, surprising Commission staff and earning the ire of Margaret Thatcher, who found her poodle's bite at least as bad as its bark. Sir Leon defends the goal of a single currency and is campaigning for the inclusion of minimum social laws in international trade agreements -- enough to leave him not only out of step with the British government, but dancing to an altogether different tune. However, it is his very nativeness which has made him London's choice to succeed Jacques Delors, who in January steps down as Commission president after ten years. At a time when many are alarmed by a "democratic deficit" -- and at the horse-trading over the appointment of Delors' successor -- Sir Leon is sanguine. Sinking into a deep-red sofa in his office overlooking the Parc Cin-quantenaire, he defends the selection process, dismissing the notion that the president should be directly elected. "I think that would be a complete change in the balance of the institutions," he says. If the European Parliament, directly elected by universal suffrage, is the Union's democratic anchor, the Commission is only the motor, and the Council of Ministers -- comprising representatives of member states' governments -- is both the brake and the throttle. "It is precisely because the Commission is not a democratically- elected body that others are entitled to put on the brakes," he insists, with a hint of fatigue. Perhaps it is the job -- he is midway through a programme taking him to Moscow, Brussels and Kiev inside 48 hours -- or the rounds of interviews which are tiring him. Sir Leon would dearly love the president's job, but he faces stiff competition from Ruud Lubbers, the former Dutch premier, and the Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. And other member states are nervous of a Briton in the driving seat when Westminster has signed up to neither a European social policy nor a future single currency. He is anxious to play down the depth of Tory rifts, dismissing reports that leaving the EU [European Union] for some less- threatening free trade arrangement is an option now favoured by a Euro-sceptic minority. "I don't think there has been the slightest intention or desire in any serious political body to do this," he says. There is no official campaign for the presidency. But Sir Leon, 54, is on the hustings, squeezing hurried interviews to promote his first book into his already hectic schedule, and there is no doubt that Europe: The Europe We Need, already translated into French and soon to be published in German and Italian, is a manifesto for Europe's most controversial job. Sir Leon has used its 246 pages to expound his support for a single currency, for the swift enlargement of the Union, and for more radical plans to streamline the Commission itself, turning the 17-member college into a cabinet- style hierarchy of senior and junior Commissioners. This is the nearest to a public debate that the contest for the appointment of a new president has ever come. The new president, whoever it is, faces two inescapable priorities: reforming the EU's institutions to accommodate its swelling ranks -- Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway are due to join next year -- and laying the path for further membership to the east and the south. Sir Leon wants swift enlargement but warns against setting artificial deadlines. He says there are "moral, economic and political" reasons, for speeding the integration of six former Soviet satellites, but insists that they should join on the same terms as existing members. The incorporation of micro-states such as Malta and Cyprus need not create new problems: "The question is not do we have them in or not, but how to accommodate them," he says. Asking the right questions must, he says, be the priority for the next inter-governmental conference (IGC), due to start in 1996. The last IGC which spawned the Maastricht treaty, was not -- as some have argued -- rushed, but it did lack direction. Public scepticism over Maastricht could not have been avoided simply by prolonging the process, and there is no reason why the next IGC should not be completed by the end of 1996. Adamant that reforms are urgently needed to accommodate an EU of 16 or more he reasons: "We must use the IGC to decide what changes are needed to ensure enlargement doesn't slow down our capacity to act." But on whether the IGC should also tackle a wholesale reform of the Commission -- perhaps along the lines laid down in his book -- he refuses to be drawn. With uncharacteristic coyness, the man who would be president declines to even hazard whether he will be given the chance to put his plans into practice.
