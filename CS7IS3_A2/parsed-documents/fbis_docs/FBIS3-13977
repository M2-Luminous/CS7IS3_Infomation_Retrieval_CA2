FBIS3-13977 "drnes055__s94026" FBIS-NES-94-055-S Document Type:Daily Report 12 Feb 1994 INDIAN VIEWS Peoples League Party Leader Fears Disintegration 94AS0206D Bangalore DECCAN HERALD in English 12 Feb 94 p 7 94AS0206D Bangalore DECCAN HERALD Language: English Article Type:CSO [Text] Jammu, Feb 11--Top Kashmiri secessionist leader Shabir Ahmed Shah has warned that India and Pakistan could meet the same fate which befell the Soviet Union if they do not seek a negotiated settlement to the 46-year-old Kashmir imbroglio in harmony with the people of Kashmir. "Soviet Union was a superpower and India and Pakistan are just developing countries--no match for erstwhile Soviet Union even as India mistakenly claims to be a superpower," he told newspersons after he came out of a special court in Jammu trying cases under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (Tada). The Kashmiri leader, recognised as a prisoner of conscience who had spent a total of 21 years in jail, recalled telling India: "We have not (sic) enemity with Indians but we are opposed (sic) usurption of Kashmir by Indian Government." Shah, who heads the powerful Peoples League Party of Kashmir, said the present armed movement would continue until India "honestly" came forward for talks with the Kashmiris and Pakistan to solve the dispute in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiris. "We are even prepared for talks and invite all parties to the dispute namely Kashmirs, India and Pakistan besides international observers and some friendly countries (to) settle the problem." Earlier, at the first hearing of the Tada case field against him by the State Government, Shah, in a statement presented to the court, denied the charge made when he was arrested in 1989 that he was going to Pakistan, and that Pakistani currency notes had been recovered from him. He said he wanted the implementation of a UN resolution on Kashmir, which he said Hari Singh, the former Kashmir Maharaja, and Nehru, too, had accepted. Asked whether he stood by two options of India and Pakistan declared in the UN resolution, he said ultimately the people of Kashmir had to decide, and if they wanted "independence nobody can prevent them." Shah spoke of the destruction caused in Kashmir in the past four years and said: "Hundreds of people were killed and hundreds of women were molested as hundreds of human settlements were destroyed." "Thousands of people had been arrested and many of them (were) subjected to torture at interrogation centres." Shah said the accession to India was "illegitimate and unlawful," arguing: "If saying so is a crime (I am) prepared (to) confess my guilt." Outside the court, Shah's 75-year-old mother told newspersons that she was proud of her son. "He is a great mujhahid (freedom fighter) and even if he is hanged (I) will have no regrets because he has been fighting for the cause for last 21 years." Meanwhile, an official spokesman said four militants, including a self-styled company commander of the pro-Pakistan Hizbul-Mujahidin, were killed in two separate encounters with security forces during search operations in Baramulla district last evening. A militant was apprehended and four AK 47 rifles, five magazines and 30 rounds were recovered during the searches. The spokesman said security forces averted a major disaster when they detected and defused three powerful improvised explosive devices (IED) and an anti-personnel mine at Anantnag last night. Some unidentified gunmen shot at and seriously wounded a person at Alichabag in the district. The spokesman said security forces apprehended six militants during search operations and recovered a large quantity of arms and ammunition in the Valley during the past 24 hours. Pakistan-trained militants fired four rockets fitted with mines in the Manjakote area of Rajouri district last evening. Two rockets exploded at a deserted place without causing any damage, while two others did not explode and were recovered by security forces during searches, official sources said. The said earlier militants and Pakistani troops had fired several rockets fitted with time bombs in Poonch and Rajouri districts during last month. This is the first time the rockets were fitted with mines. *
