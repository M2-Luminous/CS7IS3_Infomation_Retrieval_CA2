Czaczkowska and Kazimierz Groblewski: "Crises in the Coalition; Pawlak Wins"] [Text] The prime minister is delaying the decision concerning Rosati. Politicians of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], who unofficially do not conceal their anger, officially say: Nothing has happened. "Nothing has happened," they said when the establishment of the government was being decided, when the prime minister had accepted Borowski's resignation. It took the SLD a long time to find a successor to Borowski. When it finally... Found Dariusz Rosati ...it started to demand that the prime minister accept him immediately. Why is Pawlak delaying his decision? One reason has been given officially: He wants to familiarize himself with Rosati's views on the economy; he wants to be certain that there will be no conflicts between him and the "economic" ministers of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. Other reasons are mentioned only unofficially. Pawlak is afraid to employ such a high-ranking politician, who will be making better impressions in the mass media, especially on television. Before forwarding the appointment to the president, the prime minister also wants to explain the nature of Rosati's connections with the financial affair of the Foreign Debt Service Fund. He knows that, until he does that, the president will not take on the responsibility for this appointment. The Result: One to One In the games played so far in the coalition, the SLD won one point by forcing Pawlak to change the minister candidate lists when the government was being formed. The PSL scored one point as well--in the February conflict between Borowski and Pawlak. The first serious crisis shook the coalition even before the government was formed. The SLD threatened that, unless the names on the list of the Cabinet members submitted to the prime minister were different from earlier joint agreements, it would leave the coalition. Pawlak had to make a concession and agree to sign the appendix to the coalition agreement. The beginning of the next crisis was the issue of the privatization of Bank Slaski. Deputy Prime Minister Borowski took on responsibility for it. Despite that, the prime minister recalled, without Borowski's consent, Finance Deputy Minister Kawalec, which forced Borowski and the SLD to submit certain conditions to the prime minister. As a result of their rejection, Borowski handed in his resignation, which, to the surprise of SLD politicians, was accepted by Pawlak. Borowski's issue revealed... Still Other Controversies ...different views on the pace of privatization and on the budget (the prime minister announced on television prosocial amendments to the budget, but, on the following day, as PSL leader, he agreed to support the government's version of the budget). The government's information policy has become a steady source of controversy. The SLD has demanded all along that a government spokesperson be appointed; it has become increasingly critical of Press Secretary Ewa Wachowicz. Quite recently, SLD politicians have stated that the decision concerning the appointment of a spokesperson has already been made, but it is still not clear who will be appointed to this post. The recent declaration by Minister Michal Strak that the replacement of voivodes has already been completed may finally end the coalition's disagreements concerning the filling of these posts. There was no observance of the principle that the post of the voivode is filled by a candidate of the party that has won the elections in the given district. In February, out of 30 appointments to the posts of voivodes and deputy voivodes, only eight candidates were recommended by the SLD (one of them is a member of the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic), and 22 were proposed by the PSL. As a consequence, the SLD demanded... That the Role of Minister Strak Be Limited ...and that their representative be employed in the Office of the Council of Ministers, who would exert influence on the appointment of voivodes. For several months now, the SLD has been making efforts to appoint its own people to deputy ministerial posts in the "presidential" ministries: the Ministry of National Defense [MON], the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW], and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ]. The bits of information that leak from the meetings between Aleksander Kwasniewski and Waldemar Pawlak suggest that the prime minister hears out the demands of the SLD head and then changes the subject of the meeting. He is said to have promised several times that he would take care of the issue. Most often his response is silence. Pawlak is keeping Kwasniewski in suspense, he is delaying his decision; he... Never Told Him "No," Though ...as far as the issue of deputy ministers was concerned, this is why it has not turned into an open conflict in the coalition. The prime minister put off the decision, waiting for the Belweder to soften its negative stand. This tactic proved effective. The MSZ and MSW heads declared that they were ready to give deputy ministerial posts to the coalition; recently, the MON head agreed to that, too. Not long ago, he even threatened to submit his resignation if he was going to have a "party activist" in his ministry. The closer the moment of the appointment of SLD Spokesman Zbigniew Siemiatkowski to be deputy minister of MON, the more quietly the SLD is protesting Jerzy Milewski's merging his positions in the National Security Office and in MON. Before that, National Defense Committee Head Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the SLD even went so far as to threaten the prime minister: He gave him several hours to say which function Jerzy Milewski was supposed to fulfill. It is to the president's advantage that, in the coalition conflicts, Prime Minister Pawlak, rather than the SLD head, gain the upper hand. Walesa sometimes... Discreetly Supports Pawlak... which happened, for example, when he immediately signed Borowski's resignation. However, he does not allow the prime minister to triumph where he may triumph himself. This is why he took advantage of Pawlak's visit to Moscow. All things seem to suggest that, no matter whether Rosati is appointed to the post of deputy prime minister and finance minister, Pawlak's position, in relation to the SLD, will be strengthened. The prime minister wins again because, by delaying the decision, he again places the SLD in the position of petitioner. Once again he gives everyone to understand that coalition agreements are only coalition agreements, appendixes are merely appendixes, but, in fact, everything is decided by him. Remaining silent and delaying decisions are the main methods employed by the prime minister. This is accompanied by obstinacy.
