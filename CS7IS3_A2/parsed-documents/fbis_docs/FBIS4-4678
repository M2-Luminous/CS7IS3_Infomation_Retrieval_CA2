FBIS4-4678 "dreas065__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-065-A Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan U.S. Recognizes Proprietary Rights to Technology U.S. Recognizes Proprietary Rights to Technology OW0404160694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 2 Apr 94 Evening Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0404160694 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] It has been disclosed that the Defense Agency [DA] and the U.S. Department of Defense, which are promoting joint development of a next-generation support fighter (FSX), agreed that technology used to produce radio-wave absorbing material belongs to Japanese companies, which are in charge of developing the material. Seven companies, including TDK Corporation, are buckling down to the task of developing the radio-wave absorbing material to improve the aircraft's stealth nature. In the past, the United States had maintained that it was entitled to use all technologies related to FSX development free of charge except for four items, including highly efficient radar. But, the DA submitted an additional proposal to the United States calling for recognition of Japanese companies' technological proprietary rights for several pieces of equipment. The radio-wave absorbing material will be applied on leading edges of the FSX's main wings and intakes. The material, which is the subject of the recent U.S. approval, was jointly developed by seven companies -- including TDK, Mitsubishi Rayon Company, and Nippon Carbon Company. This is the fifth item approved as Japan's own technology; Mitsubishi Electric Corporation's highly efficient radar, computer, and integrated electronic warfare system and Japan Aviation Electronics Industry's inertial navigation system were approved previously. Following the previous approvals, the DA proposed at a meeting of the FSX technological steering committee (TSC) held in mid-March at Kelly Air Force Base (in Texas) claiming proprietary rights for Shimazu Corporation's optical display, Yokogawa Electric Corporation's multifunction liquid crystal display, and other equipment. The United States is expected to answer the proposal as early as this summer. Agreeing to remodel Lockheed Corporation's F-16 jet fighter, Japan and the United States started the joint development. The United States insists that technologies related to the FSX development are "derivative technologies" created during the process of F-16 remodeling. According to a memorandum signed between the two governments in 1988, the United States can use derivative technologies free of charge. However, the DA and Japanese defense industries, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, are maintaining the stand that "nonderivative technologies," which they independently developed, are also included in the memorandum. The two countries are continuing behind-the-scenes negotiations. In principle, the United States will have to pay for the use of such technologies if they are recognized as nonderivative technologies. We can say that the recent U.S. recognition is an "outcome of the negotiations." The radio wave absorbing material is a product of a technology that can be widely applied to nonmilitary goods production. Therefore, the companies wanted to get their proprietary rights. It is believed that dozens of items in the memorandum are still not clarified as to whether they are "derivative or nonderivative technologies." Japan will continue to seek U.S. recognition of technologies Japan developed on its own. But, there is a possibility that the U.S. Congress may oppose such an attempt and the issue may become another source of Japan-U.S. friction. However, it seems that Japan and the United States will make mutual concessions since the FSX will make a maiden flight in the summer of 1995 and also because it is expected that a budget for its mass production will be earmarked starting fiscal 1996.
