Guillermo Valencia filed this report: [Begin recording] [Valencia] The FMLN's political future remains uncertain. On 4 and 5 June, the Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers [PRTC] advocated a new unity pact, but it rejected an alliance. [Unidentified speaker] We must reach an agreement with those we identify with in terms of politics, programs, and what a leftist party should be. [Valencia] Have you talked about striking an alliance? [Unidentified speaker] Actually, we do not know what our conclusions will be; however, according to the negotiations we have held so far with the rank and file, we are not likely to strike an alliance among the five FMLN factions. [Valencia] The Communist Party of El Salvador, the People's Revolutionary Army, and the National Resistance last week agreed to seek a new alliance. However, the PRTC pointed out that it is unwilling to enter into a pact of this kind. Instead, it will come to an agreement with only those movements that are advocating a new kind of pact. [Unidentified female speaker] This is a practical problem. The FMLN has limitations and lacks force as long as it cannot reach unified opinions and beliefs. Our struggle consists of forging a strong left and constructive opposition, but it must be coherent in its proposals and actions. Should we strike an alliance based upon the understanding of common issues, anyone could at any moment strike an alliance with other sectors that oppose the new agreement. [Valencia] The FMLN National Council on 26 June will meet to decide on ways to approach a new political pact. [end recording]
