Talks dealt with the friendly bilateral relations and the assistance that France can provide to Jordan in the fields of tourism, transportation, and infrastructure. Discussions also dealt with ways in which France can participate to advance the peace process in the region. Talks also dealt with ways to ease Jordan's financial difficulties resulting from its commitment to the UN resolutions dealing with sanctions on Iraq and the inspection of ships heading for al-'Aqabah port since France is a member of the UN Sanctions Committee and the Security Council. The guest minister promised to raise and discuss these issues with the officials in his country in order to achieve the best results. The meeting was attended by Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, acting minister of state for foreign affairs, and the French ambassador in Amman. Meanwhile, the Jordanian side led by Dr. Abu-al-Ghanam, and the French side led by Alain Juppe, held talks at the Prime Ministry this morning in which bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest were discussed. In a statement to journalists following the talks, Finance Minister Sami Qammuh said that the two sides discussed bilateral relations in the political, economic, and cultural fields with emphasis on a subject that is important to Jordan, that is, Jordan's foreign debts that are beyond Jordan's means, especially since the Paris Club's upcoming meeting late March will discuss rescheduling the Jordanian debts. Gammu said the guest minister has expressed his country's full understanding of Jordan's position, and his support for Jordan's positions and role in the region, as well as the importance of bolstering this position and easing Jordan's burdens, particularly its foreign debts. He added that Juppe showed full understanding, and promised to support Jordan during the Paris Club meeting that will discuss rescheduling debts for 1994. These debts amount to about $950 million, excluding the financing gap. He said: Jordan's demand was not to be restricted to a rescheduling process, which is a way of delaying these debts. Our demand is to ease and reduce these debts because they constitute a burden, and this step will not be easy without the consensus of the international community. He emphasized that the guest minister promised to extend all appropriate support through the EEC and the Paris Club members.
