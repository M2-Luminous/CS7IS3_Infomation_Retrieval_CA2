Can we talk of a mission failure? Thierry Perret put the question to the Canadian Jean-Guy Plante, military spokesman of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda]: [Begin recording] [Plante] No, I would not say it was a failure, one could rather talk of difficulties. Mr. Riza has in fact had [word indistinct] from the representatives of the Patriotic Front. He did not meet the commander of the patriotic forces, but he met important figures in this movement. So one cannot really talk of a failure. Mr. Riza is expected to met the representatives of the Rwandan Government and the chief of staff of the Rwandan Army tomorrow. [Perret] So it seems that the UN envoy intended to visit Kigali but could not do so, why? [Plante] He could not visit for security reasons. The route he was expected to take is under the control of the Patriotic Front. The latter preferred to warn us that this route was not secure. He will board a plane of the Canadian Armed Forces for Kigali tomorrow. This plane, which comes regularly to Kigali, landed in the capital today for the first time in five days. [end recording]
