However, in order to prevent the release of an overwhelming number of inmates, the government also decided to extend the judicial emergency decree. The decree, which was signed by the president and all his cabinet ministers, stipulates that the emergency will be extended for an additional 90 days. The government justifies the measure by indicating that the Prosecutor General's Office and the courts will now have sufficient time and resources to complete investigations still under way as well as to render a decision. As of today, all circuit judges will be allowed to become involved in cases which up until now were restricted only to special judges. Ten days ago, 42 regional judges were responsible for handling 4,500 cases dealing with drug trafficking, terrorism, and kidnapping. This backlog prevented them from completing the cases within the period stipulated by law, the reason for which the judicial emergency was declared.
