A spokesman said in a statement that a meeting with Beijing was "urgently needed to enable us reach agreement, so that these important projects can proceed without delay." He said the government regretted the statement issued late Tuesday by China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, adding that it would not help with the construction of the 20.3-billion-U.S.-dollar airport. The Chinese statement stressed that without a Sino-Hong Kong financial agreement on the project, China refused to recognize any laws or contracts associated with the airport that straddle the colony's reversion to Chinese rule in 1997. China has repeatedly warned Hong Kong against pressing ahead with the airport without an agreement on financing arrangements as called for under a 1991 pact with Britain. "We have always taken the view that it is much more constructive to discuss these issues in formal meetings of the airport committee, rather than through press statements," the spokesman said. China's announcement came four days after Hong Kong's administration announced that it had offered to put an extra five billion Hong Kong dollars (646.83 million U.S.) into the airport in a bid to revive talks with Beijing on the project. Hong Kong's financial secretary, Sir Hamish Macleod, revealed the offer Friday as the colony's legislature approved 1.67 billion dollars in stop-gap financing to keep work going on the airport. Talks on the airport have stalled since Governor Chris Patten angered Beijing by launching his proposals to extend democracy in Hong Kong prior to 1997. Although the Chinese statement expressed hope that talks would resume, it gave no direct response to a formal request from Britain Monday for a meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, charged with deciding technical aspects of the 1997 transition.
