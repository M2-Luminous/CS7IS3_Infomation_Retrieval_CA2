An operator may use the actual refinery production records to attribute the feedstocks used to the removed or consumed products. Customs shall accept the operator's recordation conventions to the extent that the operator demonstrates that it actually uses the conventions in its refinery operations. Whatever convention is elected by the operator, it must be used consistently in order to be acceptable to Customs. Example. If the operator mixes three equal quantities of material in a day tank and treats that product as a three-part mixture in its production unit, Customs will accept the resulting product as composed of the three materials. If, in the alternative, the operator assumes that the three products do not mix and treats the first product as being composed of the first material put into the day tank, the second product as composed of the second material put into the day tank, and the third product as being composed of the third material put into the day tank, Customs will accept that convention also.
