FBIS4-6029 "dreas074_d_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 South Korea `Sea of Fire' Remark `Made Out of Excitement' `Sea of Fire' Remark `Made Out of Excitement' SK1804020794 Seoul YONHAP in English 0154 GMT 18 Apr 94 SK1804020794 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The head of the North Korean delegation to the eighth round of inter-Korean working-level talks will likely be relieved of his post due to trouble caused by his remarks at talks threatening to turn Seoul into a "sea of fire," South Korean Government officials said Sunday. Pak Yong-su, also deputy director (vice-minister level) of the Secretariat of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, has been in an awkward position since the threat triggered international criticism. Pak's position was seemingly worsened by Seoul's withdrawal of its demand for an envoy exchange, the officials said. "We saw Pak trying to make his ability acknowledged by the North Korean leadership during the eighth round of inter-Korean talks," they said. "The only way for Pak to survive seems to be proving his value once another round of working-level talks resumes." The officials added, however, "It is not likely that he will survive because we are not pursuing the exchange of envoys." North Korean officials have recently tried to appease the international community, with Workers' Party Secretary Kim Yong-sun explaining that Pak's remarks were made out of excitement. Moreover, one of the other delegates to the meeting said on a Pyongyang talk show that Pak's remarks had been distorted by the South.
