The following is the excerpt of his statement: "The right of peoples to self-determination has been universally recognized as the most fundamental prerequisite to the enjoyment of all human right and fundamental freedom. "Respect for the right of peoples to self-determination means, first and foremost, opposing any foreign aggression, interference and domination, safeguarding independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, and ensuring the people of each country to freely determine their political status, social system and economic development model. This is a basic guarantee to a country's survival and the precondition for the people of each country to fully enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedom. "The right of peoples to self-determination is applicable to peoples who are under foreign or colonial domination and foreign occupation. It must not be used as a pretext for supporting aggression or infringing upon the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of any state. "The Vienna declaration and program of action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights last year clearly points out that the realization of the peoples to self-determination shall not be construed as authorizing or encouraging any action which would dismember or impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political unity or sovereign and independent states. [sentence as received] "The 48th session of the UN General Assembly, in its recently adopted resolutions, reaffirms the right of peoples to self-determination, and the legitimacy of the struggle of people for independence, territorial integrity and national unity. "To strictly abide by these principles in today's international relations has an important and practical significance. Some events happened in certain parts of the world have shown that any distorted interpretation and application of the principle of self-determination, will only lead to or exacerbate ethnic conflict and social upheaval, or even result in a civil war or regional conflict, thereby posing a grave threat to world peace and security. "How to deal with the right of peoples to self-determination has become a question of serious concern to the international community. The Chinese delegation has always maintained that the international community must uphold the original meaning of this right and should implement in earnest the principles set out in the UN Charter and a series of international instruments and UN resolutions in this regard."
