FR940803-0-00036 FR940803-0-00014 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ASO&hyph;8] Establishment of Class E Airspace; Thomaston, GA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace at Thomaston, Georgia. A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) Runway 30 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) for the Thomaston-Upson County Airport has recently been developed. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL), is needed for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations when utilizing this SIAP. This action is intended to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations at Thomaston, GA. The operating status of the airport will change from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 U.T.C. October 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert L. Shipp, Jr., Airspace Section, System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, Federal Aviation Administration, P.O. Box 20636, Atlanta, Georgia 30320; telephone (404) 305&hyph;5591. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On May 2, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Thomaston, Georgia, (59 FR 24990). The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators executing the NDB Runway 30 SIAP serving the Thomaston-Upson County Airport. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments relating to this Class E airspace proposal were received. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The operating status of the airport will be changed from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Thomaston, GA, to accommodate a new NDB Runway 30 SIAP to Thomaston-Upson County Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet to 1200 feet AGL is needed for IFR operators executing the developed SIAP. The operating status of the airport will be changed from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
