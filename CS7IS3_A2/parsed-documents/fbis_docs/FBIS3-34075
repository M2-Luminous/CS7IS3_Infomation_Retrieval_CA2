Effective security measures have been taken to protect him. Weizman was invited by President Demirel. His arrival in Ankara is regarded as his first visit to a foreign country after he was elected to serve as Israel's president. The officials in Ankara and Tel Aviv have described his visit as vital. Meanwhile, Weizman has said that his first visit to Turkey is very important for Israel. It is common knowledge that the relations between Ankara and Tel Aviv have improved noticeably in the economic and military fields during the past few years. It is also common knowledge that the Zionist regime and the Turkish Government have maintained high-level relations for a long time. Turkey was the first Islamic country to officially recognize Israel on 28 March 1949. President Demirel has said that the objective behind Weizman's visit is the improvement of relations between Ankara and Tel Aviv, which have existed since 1948. Several experts have linked the improvement of relations between Turkey and Israel to their common interests, stressing that the geopolitical conditions in the Middle East after the agreement the PLO reached with Israel have given momentum to the relations between the two countries. Meanwhile, the Zionist officials believe that the strengthening of the Islamic movements in the Middle East pose a threat to Israel's security. In fact, Prime Minister Rabin has recently described the Islamic movements in the region as a threat to the Middle East peace process. Tel Aviv is convinced that Turkey plays an important role in the region not only because it supports the Zionist regime but also because it is an Islamic country governed by a secular administration and has significant water resources and advanced technology, which enables it to manufacture F-16 aircraft. As such, Turkey can meet Israel's vital needs. For example, it can supply water to Israel. It has been reported that Demirel and Weizman have held talks on the joint use of water resources in the region, developments in the Middle East, the agreement between the PLO and Israel, and the improvement of bilateral cooperation between the two countries. However, considering a possible reaction by Turkey's Islamic people, the Turkish officials must try to find a logical explanation for the recent improvement of relations between Ankara and Tel Aviv.
