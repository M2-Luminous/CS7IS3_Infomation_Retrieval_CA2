Lee Physics Laboratory, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433: ``Electro-Optic Characteristics in Surface-Stabilized Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal,'' supported by grant from 863 Program; MS received 18 Nov 93, revised 17 Dec 93] [Abstract] The liquid-crystal light valve is the most prevalent type of spatial light modulator (SLM)--a key component in optical information processing and optical computing systems. Via an improved polymer-film directional rubbing method, the authors have fabricated a 5-micron-thick surface-stabilized ferroelectric liquid-crystal (SSFLC) cell with high contrast ratio and excellent bistability. The fabrication process begins with 5-micron polyester thin films as spacers, then the CS-1024 FLC is heated to about 100ï¿½ C and via vacuum capillarity injected into a casing, then slowly cooled to room temperature and encapsulated with epoxy resin. SSFLC contrast ratio exceeds 140 and response time is 100 microseconds. Four figures, not reproduced, show the following: three SSFLC single-cell polaroid micrographs, an oscilloscope plot of optical bistability in the SSFLC single cell, a graph of response time vs applied voltage for the SSFLC single cell, and an oscilloscope plot of SSFLC single-cell transmitted optical intensity/triangle-wave voltage. There are no tables. References: 1. Clark, N.A. et al., APPL. PHYS. LETT., 1980, 36:899. 2. Johnson, K.M. et al., APPL. OPT., 1989, 28/22:4888. 3.
