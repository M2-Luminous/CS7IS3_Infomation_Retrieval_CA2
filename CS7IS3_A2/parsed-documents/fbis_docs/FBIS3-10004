In order to get more details about the work being done in the FAR in that connection, I am talking to Colonel Filiberto Rondon, second in command of the Western Army Rear Services. Colonel, I have had the opportunity to tour this great Western Army unit. I have noticed that many of the things done here are things that lie within the realm of many centers, of many state organizations. Why...[pauses] what is the basic reason that these solutions are sought here, and that effective solutions to the needs of the population -- the soldiers and the population in general -- are found here? [Rondon] We have instructions from our minister, who is the head of the Army, to seek solutions; and we have been told that we must guarantee, with fewer resources, the sacred duty of defending the fatherland. Therefore, we are obliged to seek solutions. We draw our inspiration from the thoughts of Jose Marti, who said that if there are capable men, there are no difficult times; and that difficult conditions and situations must be given practical solutions. That is why, given this situation, without abandoning its main tasks -- such as being combat-ready and willing to repel aggressions, preparing the theater of military operations, and preparing our troops ideologically -- our Armed Forces also...[pauses] the self-sufficiency plans too are a main part of our tasks. As I said earlier, in order to improve the living conditions of our troops independently of the resource limitations, we have been obliged to seek solutions that will allow our troops to be in both mental and physical shape to carry out their missions. And we feel that -- and you have seen it in this tour -- the results are there. They are not just words. We have already obtained results. We can speak of results obtained in 1993, 1992, and 1991. We have been trying to keep our Armed Forces from being a burden on our working population, and trying to lighten that burden progressively. Unlike other organizations, we ourselves cannot shut down a unit. We cannot send soldiers home. We are obliged to seek solutions. And I think that that has really forced us. Moreover, above all, we have drawn inspiration from our Armed Forces minister, who demands that we maintain, despite resource limitations, a high level of combat readiness and a high degree of capability to respond to any enemy aggression. [Guerra] That was Colonel Filiberto Rondon, second in command of the Western Army Rear Services, who has discussed the work the FAR is doing to improve the living and working conditions of the workers and the Armed Forces' civilian workers.
