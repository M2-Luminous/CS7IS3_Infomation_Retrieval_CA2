In an interdependent world -- regardless of whether we agree with it -- many domestic policy decisions end up becoming part of a conflict with other nations, which are sometimes more powerful than Brazil and can impose conditions during a negotiating process. The Senate is currently debating two items that have a strong effect on our relations with the United States: 1. The approval of agreements between Brazil and Argentina and the quadripartite agreement between Brazil, Argentina, the nuclear agency created by both governments, and the International Atomic Energy Agency -- all related to the international supervision of the Brazilian nuclear program -- and; 2. the approval of the law on patents. The delay in approving the agreements has produced all kinds of negative effects. Now only a very swift and expeditious Foreign Ministry action will be able to make the members of the select nuclear club believe that Brazil does not have a second purpose in developing its nuclear program. The damage produced by the delay in approving those agreements affects the image of Brazilian diplomacy, and wears out our relations with the nuclear club, but it does not produce immediate damage to the country's economic interests. The delay in voting on the intellectual property law has doubly negative effects, as it affects the image of the country's diplomacy and hurts it economically. The Senate seems incapable of realizing that the U.S. Government -- following U.S. domestic laws and subject, without the shadow of a doubt, to reasonable pressures -- has designated the month of February for verifying whether or not the legislation on intellectual property rights in Brazil contemplates certain requirements. If the answer is negative, that country will apply sanctions on Brazilian exports. The problem for the Brazilian Foreign Ministry -- which at the beginning of the month will send the Foreign Ministry secretary general to Washington to attempt, once more, to postpone a judgment on the question -- is that the U.S. position is sometimes so oblivious to reality that it is comparable to that of some Brazilian industrial groups. These national groups are blind to the fact that the economy today has a global scope, and that all states do not have equal power. On the contrary, the new scope accentuates the differences between states. The Americans, on their part, appear to be virtually blindfolded in that they fail to realize that the Brazilian Government also suffers pressures, and must also take the national interests it represents into account. What is important to bear in mind, for as long as the Americans do not make a decision, is that the Senate must act if it wants to influence foreign policies. You cannot support old rhetoric and simply refuse to vote on items that are important for our foreign affairs agenda. You cannot implement policies, much less foreign policies, by omission -- particularly when on the other side of the table is a party that wants action, and can demand it by applying sanctions.
