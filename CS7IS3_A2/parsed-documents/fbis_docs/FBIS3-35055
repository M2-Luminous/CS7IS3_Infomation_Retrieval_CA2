Addressing a session held by the Security Council on Tuesday on the Bosnian situation, Ambassador Jaafar al-Leqani, the Saudi permanent representative to the United Nation, stated that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had taken an steadfast stand since the start of the crisis to support the people and government of Bosnia- Herzegovina and expressed full support for the resolutions and recommendations made by the London conference, the United Nations and Geneva talks on the matter. He called on for implementation of the resolution adopted by the Security Council on protection of safe havens in the Bosnian lands and to boost the Bosnian Government's capabilities of self-defense. " The Saudi position has been emanated from a strong commitment and absolute adherence to the attitudes of the international legality and the international laws and norms." he said. He called on the Security Council to undertake all possible means to implement more than fifty resolution it made on the Bosnian crisis and said any efforts for a peaceful settlement should take into consideration equal and fair bases because such settlement would be useless if the Serbs were allowed to go ahead with their vicious aggression and genocidal war against the Moslems of the region. Ambassador Al-Leqani expressed hope that the international community would take a serious and rational step towards the just and legitimate demands of the Republic of Bosnian Government and make sure that the republic would not subject again to any aggressive of genocidal policies, give the Islamic republic a sea outlet and enable her of practicing the legitimate right of self- defense. Ambassador Al-Leqani denounced the genocidal war being waged by the Serbs and their allies against the Moslem population of Bosni-Herzegovina that led to a tremendous and tragic loss of lives and displacement of thousands. He cited with resentment the recent bombardment of a marketplace in Sarajevo that killed more than 60 people and the recent Serbian attacks on many of the safe havens declared by the United Nations. He said the untold and nefarious acts of the Serbs are constituting a great insult for the world's conscience. Leqani recalled the Saudi warning that any failure in dealing with the Bosnian crisis on bases of the new international order would no doublt endanger the very existance and credibility of that order.
