"This is not going to be like in a factory, with a lot of noise and mountains of wrecks in the courtyard," says the graduate engineer; "we don't want to be a scrapyard but function like a modern auto repair shop." Not too large, extremely friendly toward the environment, without impact on the residents around it, easy to fit into any business area, are Pommerenke's terms of reference. The engineer heads Berlin's newest pilot project for recycling old cars. The Lepkojus Innovations-Gesellschaft (LIG) fuer Entwicklung und Fertigung fuer Aufgaben im Umweltschutz mbH [Lepkojus Innovation Company for Development and Production for Environmental Protection Tasks Ltd.] operates this auto disassembly facility at a former Sero site in the city district of Hellersdorf. Approximately 15 vehicles a day are now being disposed of here. The goal is to do twice that amount. The principal advantage: The work is done with "nonspecific models." The operator of the facility, the Alba company, once again "had its finger on the pulse and recognized a future market," praised Federal Environment Office President Dr. Heinrich von Lersner when the project was taken into operation. More than 2.5 million vehicles wind up on the scrap heap each year in the FRG; in Berlin alone it is about 200,000. In Hellersdorf a maximum of 7,500 scrapped cars, precisely three percent, can be recycled in the first expansion phase. A drop in the ocean in comparison with Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer's goal of recycling half of all old cars by the year 2000. The Berlin pilot project is aimed at future safety. The basic sealing of the work hall is the same as in waste dumps; 1,000 square meters of disassembly surface was sealed with high-pressure polyethylene foils. Under that lies a 10-centimeter-thick concrete plate on top of a 20-centimeter-thick sub-base. One out of every three German marks [DM] of the DM 6.6 million investment cost--half of the expenditure was provided by the Federal Environment Ministry--went for soil and ground water protection. Waste water is led through separate dirt and rainwater channels, passing through an oil and coalescence separator. The waste water from the hot steam vehicle cleaning unit also flows through an de-emulsification facility. Dr. Dieter Pautz, in charge of old car recycling at the Environment Ministry, praises the Berlin-Hellersdorf facility: "Here an example is being set for the integration of all known technologies." The Federal Government's cost sharing is for the purpose of "raising the level of the technology in this field." Five points are of primary importance for auto recycling: Complete removal of fluids--so far it is only possible to drain about 95 percent, separation of all synthetic parts by type, extracting secondary raw materials, the greatest possible profit from sales of replacement parts and, finally, consideration for all ecological requirements. The project has national economic proportions. If projected onto the entire annual German number of cars, a total of about 1.7 million tons of metal and 450,000 tons of special waste in the form of oils and fluids, synthetic and compound materials, rubber and glass would result. Thus, professional and ecological disposal has its price: The Association of German Automobile Industry allocates DM 400 per car; experts from various institutes estimate DM 300 to 600. Pommerenke would like to push the cost down to an acceptable DM 150. Utilization of replacement parts from the old cars for maintenance and repairs can also make a contribution. On the shelves at Hellersdorf are stored engines, wheels, tires, doors, body parts, seats, radiators, tanks, carburetors, propeller shafts, dashboards, gear shifts, headlights, rear lights, mirrors... Pommerenke manages the inventory with the help of a computer: "We can react quickly to customer inquiries." The price advantage for auto firms, private persons, car repair garages, reprocessing enterprises and exporters is 30 to 50 percent below the new price. A supraregional operating system is being established at this time. In addition to the old oil, particularly the synthetics require a great deal of expenditure. If the legislators actually decree the return of cars and exclude thermal disposal, plastic parts must be easily separated out and properly recycled. For that reason, a laboratory is already a part of Pommerenke's pilot project. Dr. Dietrich Schumann is often a guest. In his laser laboratory in Adlershof (LLA GmbH), synthetic waste products with various fillers, contaminations and dyes are being studied. As a result, a near-infrared sensor was created (0.7-2.5 micron wavelength), with which synthetics can be detected in 10 milliseconds and--in a facility down the line--semiautomatically separated out. A type purity of 96 percent is to be possible. With his development, the LLA marketing chief says, he can only succeed in industry if the method does not get too expensive: "There must be no DM 250,000 lasers in a recycling facility." The frequently black automobile synthetics make this more difficult: "Just as plastic parts with metallic coatings, they produce a type of fog when looked at with spectroscopy. The LLA device has now got this problem under control." Trabant: No Problem At least 500,000 Trabants are still rolling on the roads. Unless it involves as few prized specimens with options for future increases in value, these must also be disposed of at some point. But the plastic bombers are not a special recycling case: "The Trabant is not an environmental problem," says Dr. Dieter Pautz, an engineer. "Anyone who wants to make money on it is getting a bad deal." With not quite 35 kilograms--"all of it uncomplicated Duroplast"--there is less synthetic material in the Trabant than in the Golf, for example. Recyclers can easily deal with this plating on bumpers, roof, doors and trunk lids.
