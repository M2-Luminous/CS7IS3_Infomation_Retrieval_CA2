[Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] With his statements, Schoenhuber has unmasked himself. One who makes such a statement publicly after the shocking attack on the synagogue in Luebeck, repeats it, and is impertinent enough to bring a charge against the chairman of the Central Council of Jews for the instigation of people not only reveals what sort of person he is but also what political movement he stands for. There must be an end to the minimization of the Republikaner! The competent judicial authorities will have to examine whether Mr. Schoenhuber's statements are punishable or not. [DIE WELT] Expressions of dismay about Schoenhuber's statement after the attack on the Jewish synagogue in Luebeck have come from all the democratic parties. Is verbal condemnation sufficient? [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] Of course verbal outrage is not enough. Yet it would be a mistake to believe that an open political dispute can be avoided through criminal prosecution. In a democracy, political dispute is based on words, and therefore it is important to use these words in a conscious and responsible manner. Politicians who use terms like "mixture of races" and "infiltration with foreign elements" in a careless manner appear to have no sense of responsibility about the form of political dispute and the political climate in the country. They more or less accept that public statements like that of Mr. Schoenhuber, which are clearly reminiscent of our worst past, are possible again today. [DIE WELT] Do you join those who call for legal investigations against Schoenhuber? [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I believe that Schoenhuber's statements might be punishable. The authorities responsible have already started investigations. [DIE WELT] Have the politicians made mistakes if such statements are again possible 50 years after the holocaust? [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I do not believe that it would appropriate to speak of mistakes. However, there are alarming developments and politicians are partly using a language conducive of a climate that makes statements like Mr. Schoenhuber's possible again. Thus, it is important to continue consistently and increase the political argument against the right and to point out developments that might pave the way for demagogues. [DIE WELT] Are Schoenhuber and his Republikaner right-wing radicals or right-wing extremists? [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I think that Schoenhuber's statements speak for themselves. No politically minded person will find it difficult to assess them.
