Commenting on the three rounds of talks with Milosevic, which altogether lasted about five hours, Churkin told journalists he was satisfied with the talks, that they were constructive, and had focused mostly on the cessation of hostilities in the whole of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. "I can say now, after the third round, that what I have in my hands now is a good basis for achieving an agreement on the cessation of hostilities in the whole of former Bosnia-Herzegovina," Churkin stressed. The Russian envoy told journalists he was leaving for Pale and Sarajevo early tomorrow morning and that he would work very intensively on the realization of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. "My main objective is to end the current very difficult situation and to proceed toward the political resolution of the Bosnian crisis," Churkin said. He refused to give any more details regarding the talks with President Milosevic, but expressed hope that the other (Muslim) side would show as constructive an approach as the Serb side. "In any case, I am awaiting the talks in Sarajevo tomorrow with hope," Churkin added. Asked whether he was now, after the third round of talks with Milosevic, more optimistic then before the talks, he said: "I think we have done a good job and, with a bit of luck, we could change the situation in Bosnia."
