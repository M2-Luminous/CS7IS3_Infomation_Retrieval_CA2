He carried Syria's aspirations and the Arabs' issues on his strong and solid shoulders. He gave the workers and all the producers in this homeland most of his attention and support. I also convey to you the president's congratulations on this great day, along with his wishes that are full of love and confidence, confidence that the innovative and productive human being will continue to be the basic pillar of any society aspiring for growth and development as well as confidence that people armed with national and pan-Arab awareness alone can see their way through all circumstances, events, and changes. They are the force that can overcome obstacles and challenge dangers. People who are armed with national and pan-Arab awareness can raise the edifice and work to increase production. They are the ones who make out of their self dependency and potential a launching pad to embody their will, strengthen their unity, reinforce their cause, promote their prestige, and confront challenges, no matter what form they take at any time.

The prime minister then spoke about the determination of Syria, under the leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, to achieve a just and comprehensive peace as well as its determination not to relinquish any inch of its or any Arab territory. He said: [Begin al-Zu'bi recording] The Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton [applause] showed how objective the Syrian stand is and how capable it is of defending the principles of pan-Arabism and Arab interests. The Geneva summit also showed how much attention the international community gives to Syria's role in this region. Syria made the Geneva convention a forum for the national stand, the Arab right, pan-Arab dignity. The Geneva summit highlighted the continuous achievements of a big Arab leader, around the leadership of whom Syria's masses rally with strength, awareness, and persistence. The masses of the Arab nation surround leader al-Asad with their hopes, wishes, and pan-Arab feelings. Syria was and still is determined to continue the peace process, but with clarity, comprehensiveness without separate deals, and full response to the international community and its will and resolutions that cannot be subject to changes or falsification. A just and comprehensive peace that embodies the land for peace principle is the basis that enables the peace process to continue without obstacles toward its true objective. [end recording] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi concluded his speech by renewing allegiance to big leader President Hafiz al-Asad.
