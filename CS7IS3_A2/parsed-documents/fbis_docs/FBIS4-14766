The statement by the Working Moscow was delivered to Interfax. It says civic peace will be unattainable in Russia without the restoration of Soviet power. The Working Moscow was willing to join efforts to draw up an agreement for civic peace but different classes and social groups could reach accord only if they obeyed the provisions of constitutional law. In the Working Moscow's view, what Yeltsin said contradicted his own constitution. The Working Moscow quotes several provisions of constitutional law violated by Yeltsin. First and foremost, Yeltsin violated the national constitution last fall by signing Decree 1400 which did away with Soviet rule and provoked many civilian casualties.
