A total of 39 local governments -- 29 of Japan's 47 prefectures and 10 of its 12 ordinance-designated cities -- eased such controls as of April 1, agency officials said. Five or six local governments are expected to follow suit by the end of May, the officials said. All prefectures, except Aomori in northeast Japan, and all 12 ordinance-designated cities established systems to monitor local land prices after they experienced skyrocketing prices in the booming economy in the 1980s. They have obliged those who trade land of more than a certain acreage to report the transaction to the local authority. Such relaxations followed an agency instruction last November that local governments deregulate land transactions to help stimulate the sluggish economy. The local governments may have believed that drops in land prices indicated strict controls were no longer needed, they said. A government report released last month said Japan's land prices in 1993 dropped for the third consecutive year. In most cases, only those who buy or sell 300 square meters or more are obliged to report the transactions to the local government, while the previous requirement applied to 100 square meters or more. Gunma Prefecture northwest of Tokyo is the only prefecture that scrapped all prefectural areas under such control. It is expected that more than 10 local governments will not ease controls, including Nagano Prefecture, where land prices may rise in line with the hosting of the 1998 Winter Olympics, they said.
