In his statement to reporters, Denktas said: "The package is based on the principle of providing major economic benefits to the Turkish side. The UN secretary general and experts confirmed this. Our people will witness this. If such a situation really does exist, then naturally it will be easy to hold talks." What Does the Mini-Package Include Briefly, Denktas said the following: 1. "So far, we were concerned with what the package gave to and took from us. In approaching the package, we are still defending the principles that we uphold, and we are agreeing to talk with goodwill. 2. "We are given firm guarantees that we can fly anywhere in the world from Nicosia Airport with our own passports, that the flight control area of Ercan [Tymbou] Airport and the Ercan flight information zone will not be affected, and that Ercan will continue to function as it does at present. 3. "Our airplanes registered in Turkey will land and take off from Nicosia Airport without any intervention. 4. "This way, the embargo will be mostly broken. The entrance to this airport will be through two separate doors enabling us to have full control over entrances to TRNC. 5. "The FIR [flight information region] between us and Turkey will probably not be affected and will continue to exist as it is, as this is related to our security." 6. Explaining that they have been told that the package has been drawn up not to deceive the sides but to open the way to new cooperation and, in the words of the UN secretary general, to provide major economic advantages to the Turkish Cypriots subjected to embargo for years, Denktas said: "We will look at the results at the end of the talks to see if our expectations are justified, and then we will ask our people: What do you say? "I do not want to start an argument by replying to Kliridhis' statements in Thessaloniki. "The UN secretary general is well aware of our position. He also knows on which principles we will not retreat. Our desire is to hold talks in goodwill." Shuttle Diplomacy in TRNC Starting Today Indicating that the UN secretary general's special representative in Cyprus Joe Clark will meet with him and Kliridhis today, Denktas said that shuttle diplomacy might start between the sides at the end of February, and in the case of positive results the need might arise to go to New York.
