FR940304-1-00032 FR940304-1-00008 Comment: Commenters indicated that the language contained in proposed §146.94(c) regarding the removal of product from a refinery subzone is specific to a calendar week. However, an accounting period may be greater than a week. Response: While a manufacturing or accounting period may be greater than a week, there is no authority to permit a consumption entry covering products removed from a zone to exceed one week. Thus, the language of §146.94(c) remains in substance as originally proposed. However, Customs will reevaluate the possibility of permitting monthly entries, in light of the Customs modernization portion of the recently passed North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, particularly §637. Currently, a refiner who desires to make attributions on the basis of a monthly manufacturing or accounting period must attribute and make any required relative value calculation by attributing current removals or consumptions to final products that were produced in a prior manufacturing or accounting period. A refiner who reports removals and consumption on a weekly basis and who elects to attribute a final product that is removed or consumed, in the same week that it is produced, must make the appropriate attribution and relative value calculation for that week. Comment: Commenters noted that attribution is more appropriately dealt with in proposed §146.99 (now redesignated as proposed §146.96), rather than in proposed §146.95 titled ``Feedstock inventories''. Response: Customs agrees with the comments that attribution can be dealt with more appropriately in proposed §146.99 (now redesignated as §146.96); therefore, proposed §146.95 concerning feedstock inventories has been deleted. Proposed §146.97 titled ``producibility'' is now renumbered as §146.95. Comment: Commenters suggested deleting the last sentence and four reports listed in proposed §146.96 concerning a subzone activity report. Response: As already stated above, this proposed section has been deleted in its entirety. Comment: Commenters noted that proposed §146.97(a) must provide for products consumed within the subzone. Response: Customs agrees with the comments that proposed §146.97(a) must provide for consumption within the zone. Therefore, appropriate language has been included in proposed §146.97(a) (now redesignated as §146.95(a)). Comment: Comments indicated that, as currently worded, proposed §146.98(a) is limited to operators using producibility. Response: Proposed §146.98(a) (now redesignated as §146.93(c)) has been modified to avoid any misunderstanding in this respect. Comment: Commenters stated that attributions are binding except for adjustments needed upon reconciliation. Response: Proposed §146.99(a) (now redesignated as §146.96(a)) has been modified to address this concern. Reconciliation is limited to changes in amounts, and mathematical and clerical errors, but does not include changes in the identity of the feedstock. Comment: Commenters noted that other inventory control methods are already covered in proposed §146.93(d)(2), so there is no need for proposed §146.99(c). Response: Customs has decided to essentially revise former proposed §146.99(c) and to make it the subject of a new §146.97 regarding the approval of other recordkeeping systems for subzone oil refinery operations. As already noted above, proposed §146.93(d)(2) (now redesignated as §146.93(a)(3)) has been revised to refer exclusively to the use of the FIFO method of inventory accounting. Comment: Commenters also indicated that the proposed regulations do not take into account the three relative value methods listed in proposed §146.98(b). Commenters also pointed out that the proposed regulation does not provide a mechanism to attribute consumption within the zone.
