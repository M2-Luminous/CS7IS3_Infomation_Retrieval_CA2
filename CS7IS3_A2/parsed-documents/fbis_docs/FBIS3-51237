The new GATT, concluded last month after seven years of tough bargaining under the so-called Uruguay Round, will govern international trade into the next century. NAFTA, on the other hand, is expected to shape future trading relations among countries of the western hemisphere, including Caricom's 13 members. "Our priorities in the region must take into account these important developments," Carrington told CANA during a visit here this week. If Caricom is not "effectively strengthened" to deal with these changes, he warned, the region will face the prospect of marginalization in the world Community. "Unless Caricom is effectively strengthened, it cannot take an effective part or play an effective role, or protect itself effectively or take advantage of the opportunities, withstand the challenges or deal with the challenges that will emerge from these international developments," Carrington said. As the first priority for this new year, he said, Caricom should move speedily to establish the proposed single market and economy. The second priority was deciding how the region will deal with NAFTA which took effect on January 1 and links the United States, Canada, and Mexico in a free-trade zone. NAFTA, a United States idea, envisages the eventual creation of a free-trade zone embracing all democratic and free market-oriented countries in the hemisphere. Carrington said NAFTA was an important issue for Caricom countries because the bulk of their trade and investment relations are with North America, in particular the United States. He indicated the United States was setting tough conditions for considering a Caricom request that some key regional exports, including garments, sugar, and petroleum, be granted temporary parity with mexico in terms of access to the U.S. market. Because these Caricom exports do not enjoy duty free access to the U.S. under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), Caricom producers fear they will lose out to Mexican competitors in these areas because Mexico has an advantage under NAFTA. If its request for same treatment as Mexico is granted, Caricom hopes to use the period -- three years is the time proposed -- to make necessary adjustments and to negotiate participation in NAFTA if it decides to go that route. ".... The U.S. is saying ...Before we can give consideration to the question of parity, we would like to know how you stand on intellectual property rights, ... What are your conditions of worker rights, what is the status of democracy and good government, what is the CET (Caricom's Common External Tariff) going to be on critical products like rice, what about investment guarantees for our investors in your countries, ...What is your macroeconomic framework and policy?" "All these they are demanding just to talk about the question of parity, which is a temporary limited concession, before we get to the next stage of the question of full NAFTA membership if we so decide," Carrington told CANA. The Caricom secretary-general said Caricom's approach to NAFTA is linked to the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), expected to be established in July. Membership will be open to all countries within and bordering the Caribbean Sea, including some Central American states. "...Those countries of Central America which are covered by the Caribbean Basin Initiative face exactly the same challenge like we face with respect to NAFTA," Carrington said. "What are trying to do right now is ... Design a machinery to work jointly with them. We agreed in principle so to do, but the machinery for doing is now being established." The Caricom secretariat plans later this year to mount a number of seminars dealing with NAFTA and the new GATT for various regional sectors.
