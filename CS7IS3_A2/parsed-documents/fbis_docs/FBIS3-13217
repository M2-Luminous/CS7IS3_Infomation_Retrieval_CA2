The U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, and Undersecretary of State for Near East Affairs Robert Pelletreau, have recently made statements indicative of U.S. intentions to open a direct dialogue with the Islamic Republic. Following 14 years of desperate efforts to undermine the legitimacy of Iran, the United States is finally heeding international pressure and is trying to come to terms with the political realities of the Islamic Republic. Pelletreau recently told the House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs that the United States will not try to destabilize the government of Iran and no longer considers the Islamic Republic to be a temporary phenomenon. Washington's apparent change of heart is motivated by two objectives. First, since the demise of the international bipolar political power structure, and due to the ambiguous nature of the emerging `new world order,' Europe has exercised its right to make political decisions independent of the U.S., and has therefore gained increasing influence in the Middle East. Most European countries, in defiance of the United States, have established and maintained cordial relations with Iran, thereby limiting American influence in this region. Second, the failure of the U.S.-imposed Middle East peace talks has prompted Washington to consider using Tehran's spiritual influence in the Islamic world to revive and legitimize the peace accord, and to indirectly contain what it perceives to be the epidemic spreading of 'Islamic fundamentalism' in the Muslim Middle East. Realizing and accepting global realities, America is eagerly awaiting to reoccupy its dominant position in the Middle East. Iran has all along endeavored to stay faithful to its own Islamic Revolution while leaving open the possibility of reconciliation with the U.S. provided that America releases Iran's assets, which are frozen in U.S. banks, and refrains from covert and overt operations aimed at isolating and destabilizing the Islamic Republic. Considering the resulting benefits for both sides, if relations are indeed re-established, the United States stands to gain a lot more than Iran, therefore, it should be prepared to make greater concessions. Iranian officials are well aware of this fact and will base their demands and proposals accordingly.
