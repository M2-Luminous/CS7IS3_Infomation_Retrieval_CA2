First of all, we would like to declare to the entire Angolan people that our desire to reach an agreement with the government led by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] is serious. Our commitment to peace is also very serious. We would like, before anything else, to also clarify that there is an infernal disinformation machine mounted in complicity with the MPLA, and for the MPLA, to convince the Angolan people and the international community that UNITA took up arms because it lost the legislative elections in September 1992. All the Angolan people know and nobody should forget that the results of the 1992 legislative elections were announced on 17 October 1992, but armed clashes only began in November 1992, after the massacres which took place in Luanda. We would like to point out without ambiguity that the reason for the war that is currently being waged in the country is not because we contested the results of legislative elections held in September 1992. What caused this war is UNITA's moral and civic duty to defend itself from the elimination designed for it by the MPLA because of the MPLA's (?hatred) and [word indistinct] toward our movement. It is not very easy for us to forget the memory of our ever-missed Vice President Jeremias Kalandula Chitunda, a (?firm negotiator). We cannot forget the memory of our Secretary General Adolosi Paulo Mango Alicerces and Engineer Elias Salupeto Pena, who was the head of our representation to the Joint Political and Military Commission [CCPM]. What is more, the massacres continued in Novo Redondo, Benguela, Lobito, and Lubango. We experienced treacherous attacks in Huambo, Bie, Menongue, Malange, Ondjiva, Luena, and Saurimo. All this forced us to try with all the resources at our disposal, no matter how few they were, to defend our populations, our militants, and sympathizers. All of you also know that (?there was a desire) to make the first multiparty elections in the country transparent; but from registration to voting processes, we witnessed only unrestrained manipulation by the MPLA. Already in August 1992, the MPLA [words indistinct] the winner, and asked the UNITA leadership to subscribe to a document in which our party accepted the results of the elections which had not yet been held. They were very sure of victory. The catastrophe came, however, when Ms. Margaret Anstee declared the elections to be free and fair. After [words indistinct] months, the same lady says that she did not have the resources to organize and observe the elections. This is what she should have said on the occasion. Only after having plunged our country in [word indistinct], the lady says that of the two [words indistinct] one was doubtful and [words indistinct]. Those who took part in manipulating the election results are now confronted with a conflict whose end is completely unforeseen. As is always the case in history, there must be scapegoats. The scapegoat in the present national crisis is UNITA. There is a witness, however, who does not forget -- the Angolan people themselves [words indistinct]. Despite all this, we took upon ourselves the serious responsibility to accept the results of these elections. There is a major problem, however, in the legal framework emerging from these elections -- there is a lack of moral strength to understand, to forgive, (?to work), and to reconcile the Angolan nation whose fabric was damaged by much [words indistinct]. The MPLA regime has been desperately sticking to the principle of sovereignty, even when its police (?steals), violates, and humiliates common citizens, [words indistinct], and many Angolans today [words indistinct]. The MPLA propaganda is only aimed at oppressing the people. It is equally aimed at [words indistinct] the international community regarding its real intentions. All the same, we think that the MPLA propaganda's effectiveness is already reaching its end. [Words indistinct] we in UNITA think that they remain the only [word indistinct] judges [words indistinct] our own conscience and our people themselves. The others are just messengers, carrying messages, as we have seen them do for over 15 years. What UNITA is worried about is the constant resort to weapons. What UNITA is worried about is the existence of political, economic, and social differences among the Angolan people. Thirty-three years of war for a people and for an African country are too much. The African culture believes in dialogue and not in a constant resort to violence. It is for this reason, and it is not a minor reason, that we are committed to peace. We believe, however, in a true peace which demands concrete and real actions. The Angolan people know today that as part of its contribution to peace, UNITA has taken the following steps forward: It accepted the results of the elections held in September 1992. It accepted the Bicesse Accords as a foundation for discussions. It accepted the Abidjan Protocol and the many resolutions approved by the UN Security Council against [words indistinct]. What is more, UNITA unilaterally declared a cease-fire [words indistinct] which permitted the resumption of negotiations and the sending of humanitarian assistance to needy people. In addition, all the concessions made in Lusaka were made by UNITA. At the present period, the cease-fire is already (?real), and the formation of the Angolan Armed Forces has been accepted, as well as all the consequences resulting from there. What are we seeing on the side of the MPLA, however? We are seeing a very serious (?desire) to eliminate UNITA militarily and to transform our glorious party into an instrument [words indistinct] of what we are, where we came from, and where we are going. What is more, the MPLA regime has not yet learned to coexist with other parties. Accordingly, it concerns us to see a party that was officially recognized by the MPLA Supreme Court, the Democratic Party for Progress of the Angolan National Alliance [PDP-ANA], infiltrated today, because its president who has been an authorized voice of a true opposition [words indistinct]. Over the last 18 years, we have seen many ploys by the MPLA government to try and create a new UNITA: UNITA B, UNITA C, UNITA E. None of those UNITA's has survived because there is only one UNITA and it has its own philosophy, its own objectives, and wants to contribute with its role and with its own [word indistinct] (?suffering) to the building of a strong and united Angola, which is, however, [words indistinct]. All attempts to create a new UNITA are bound to fail. Furthermore, the MPLA has lately embarked on a disinformation campaign concerning possible UNITA military [word indistinct], the sole aim of which is to disguise the MPLA's undoubted desire to militarily eliminate all its opponents. [Words indistinct] in the cover of democracy, a one-party regime for many long years. This kind of democracy does not promote us. What is more, it does not [words indistinct]. The UNITA delegation to the Lusaka peace talks will leave today, 1 January 1994, with the firm desire to meet with the MPLA. Those who tried to speculate that UNITA would not leave for Lusaka have erred yet again. We leave two days earlier so that the Angolan people and also the international community can see that we want to hold serious discussions and that we want to find solutions within a legal, political, and administrative framework which will guarantee peace, the tranquility of the people to promote economic and social development for the well-being of all Angolan people. What is more, we are realistic. If we cannot [words indistinct] we should at least reach a general cease-fire so that with the silencing of weapons, (?civilians) can [words indistinct] but this time, we are not going to Lusaka [words indistinct]. We would like a cease-fire that will allow humanitarian organizations to continue to assist people affected by famine, disease, and nakedness. UNITA would be ready to sign such a cease-fire immediately. Perhaps it is very difficult for the MPLA, which has purchased arms to assume the same attitude of transparency, clarity, and [words indistinct]. During the coming round of talks, UNITA [words indistinct] political and administrative throughout the country since this balance was seriously thwarted by the Luanda massacres. That is why, [words indistinct] since we shall no longer accept [words indistinct] guarantees. We cannot repeat the (?mistakes) [words indistinct]. Furthermore, our delegation [words indistinct] to reach viable and verifiable agreements. We would also like to ask UN mediators not to treat Africans (?as inferiors). It pains me to say that, with so many conflicts in the country, so many conflicts in the world, so many conflicts on the continent, there are [words indistinct] but there is always a time for discussion and a time for reflection. There are many conflicts on the African continent, as the conflicts that are now emerging in Eritrea, the Sudan, the Congo, Sierra Leone, and other parts of our beautiful continent bare witness. There has always been a time for discussion and time for reflection. In the case of Angola, timetables of slavery have been imposed on us, however. This was the case in Bicesse. It was the case in Abidjan, and it was also the case in Lusaka recently. This behavior does not only detract from the prestige of the mediation because it is a behavior that is adopted only toward Africans, but the world is experiencing conflicts such as the one existing in Bosnia, conflicts between Israel and Palestine, [words indistinct] discussions, a break for reflection and the resumption of discussions. I profoundly regret such behavior which makes Africans inferior beings. No one can doubt UNITA's [words indistinct] political problems, problems arising from a newly born democracy, economic problems, but we continue to believe in the destiny of our continent. After we have learned, we shall one day know [words indistinct]. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the patience shown by UN Special Representative Dr. Alioune Blondin Beye, who has never spared any efforts to try and bring UNITA and the MPLA together. We would also like to remember a great African [words indistinct] the principles of African culture. It is not by negotiating under (?duress) [words indistinct] dialogue must be [words indistinct] but firm. Dialogue must be [word indistinct] but determined. Dialogue must be intelligent but also [words indistinct] that we Africans find solutions to our various problems. We would also like to express our gratitude for the role played by the peace process observers. They have tried by all means to find [words indistinct] the MPLA government and UNITA. We also think that the United States, Portugal, and Russia have an important role to play in the peace negotiations in Angola. I would also like -- since circumstances so dictate [words indistinct] -- to say a word about Portugal. UNITA hopes that in 1994 our relations with the Portuguese Government will improve, for the interest of our peoples [words indistinct]. Our relations have been very difficult. This has greatly hampered the negotiating process in Angola. We have a common language, culture, and [word indistinct] but, Africans that we are, we should not be penalized for trying to defend our values. At this stage, we are [words indistinct] of Angola. Portugal has an important card to play so we can find an agreement [words indistinct] at least try to arrive at an understanding with UNITA. It has an ambassador in Luanda and it has a great capacity to talk. Other European countries, notably France, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Italy, should not in any way encourage the MPLA to follow unjust paths, because, by selling weapons to the MPLA and giving economic support to Jose Eduardo dos Santos -- who is still a candidate in the second round of presidential elections -- they only make the MPLA more intransigent, more radical and [words indistinct] with little desire to make concessions. Peace is the overriding interest both to the Angolan people and to the other countries concerned about Angola [words indistinct] UNITA [words indistinct] attitudes that were [words indistinct] we also share a common background, culture, and language with Brazil. We hope that relations with Brazil will improve in 1994. Regarding the United States, now that the USSR has become a conglomerate of countries, it is up to the United States to guarantee peace for all, whether they be big or small. The UNITA team will hold constant contacts with Holden Roberto, president of the Angola National Liberation Front representative, brother Daniel Julio Chipenda, Engineer Catete, and all opposition leaders who are abroad because the issue of peace is not a matter that only concerns UNITA. It concerns all the Angolan people, all of us. It is not because [words indistinct] in 1992 that UNITA [words indistinct]. To all Angolans, to the proven militants: We have passed the thorny path of 1993. The year of 1994 shall be known as the year for thinking about our African identity and it will lead to new gains, the greatest of which shall be peace. Peace will be built with UNITA and peace will not [words indistinct] UNITA. To all the Angolan people, to all our militants, our wishes of a happy new year.
