The tests, already approved by the U.S. Food And Drug Administration, will be conducted on a small number of patients at the U.S. National Cancer Institute, starting in mid-March. Japan Energy is the first Japanese enterprise to begin clinical tests on a second-generation AIDS medicine. Company officials said the firm hopes to file with the U.S. authorities in about three years for permission to produce the new medicine and market it as an oral drug. The medicine will inhibit the working of a protease necessary for the growth of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), thereby arresting AIDS, the officials said.
