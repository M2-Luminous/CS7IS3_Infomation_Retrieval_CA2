Shahin] [Excerpt] Amman--A last-minute veto by Israel prevented the return of three Palestinian expellees close to Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) chairman Yasir 'Arafat from joining 43 other expellees who return to the occupied territories today. Scaled down from a list of 49 whom Israel was allowing to return as part of an agreement with the PLO, the 43 expellees, along with up to 25 family members, will enter the West Bank and Gaza today via Jordan and Egypt. "Twenty-seven deportees will leave Jordan for the occupied territories on Tuesday," confirmed 'Umar Khatib, deputy chief to the PLO's mission in Amman. "They will take their families with them. The other 16 deportees in Egypt will enter Gaza from Egypt, also on Tuesday," Mr. Khatib added. Two expellees allowed to return to the West Bank by Israel left to the occupied territories on Monday on their own and another, Mursi Abu-Ghuwaylah, is in the United states and will return later, said officials at the PLO mission in Amman. "The list we received today did not include the names of Akram Haniyah, Jibril Rujub and Muhammad Dahlan," said Mr. Khatib. The return to the occupied territories of Mr. Haniyah, senior advisor to Mr. 'Arafat on occupied territories' affairs, was reportedly blocked by Israeli negotiators in Cairo. "The Israelis felt that Haniyah was too senior, too close to Chairman 'Arafat to go in this early," one PLO official in Amman told THE JORDAN TIMES. Mr. Rujub and Mr. Dahlan are also close to the PLO leadership in Tunis, where they were until Monday night, according to PLO officials in Amman. They were seen by the Israelis as "too close to the leadership to return at this time," one official said. "The three men are still in Tunis. Therefore we don't expect any last-minute changes," said Mr. Khatib. Mr. Rujub is from Hebron, where dozens of Palestinians were gunned down by a fanatic settler on Feb. 25. Mr. Dahlan directs Fatah military operation in his native Gaza Strip from his exile in Tunis. All three men are expected to exercise influence on behalf of Mr. 'Arafat and his Fatah factions in their respective areas once they are allowed to return home. According to reports from the occupied territories the popularity of Mr. 'Arafat has been waning since the Hebron massacre. [passage omitted]
