No criticism should be spared from the prime minister and the foreign minister for not having spoken the truth. Small wonder that now we ask ourselves whether all the details of the foreign minister's letter to 'Arafat were fully disclosed. In spite of our doubts, let us assume for one moment that the letter does not contain anything other than a long quote from the foreign minister's address to the Knesset on 9 September 1993. If so, why did he keep it secret until Yasir 'Arafat disclosed its existence and contents? The PLO leader demanded a pledge from Israel that it would maintain what he termed the "status quo" in Jerusalem and the status of the Palestinian institutions in the city prior to the discussions about Jerusalem's permanent status. Peres chose not to speak about "Palestinian" institutions, and instead elaborated on the freedom of religious worship and Israel's willingness to recognize the importance and significance of Jerusalem to followers of the monotheistic faiths. Nevertheless, it could be inferred from his speech/letter that the term "status quo" applies to institutions that have no religious or cultural mission; Peres also mentioned "other institutions" and the orderly functioning of "the relevant institutions and systems." 'Arafat's allegation that he signed the Cairo agreement on early empowerment of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and in the Jericho area only thanks to the Israeli foreign minister's letter concerning Jerusalem leads us to believe that he was seeking to guarantee the continued presence of a Palestinian political center in Jerusalem; namely, the building in the eastern side of the city known as Orient House. Had Peres publicized his letter immediately after he sent it there might have been no controversy. However, because he kept it secret and even denied its existence, the letter is now seen as a political concession on the part of Israel. Regardless Israel conceded to the Palestinians when it agreed in Oslo that the question of Jerusalem would be dealt with in the negotiations about the permanent arrangement. Although the Israeli delegation extracted the mention of the settlements in the same clause of the agreement in exchange -- that is, the continued existence of the settlements until the end of the negotiations about the permanent arrangement -- the government must now defend itself against allegations that it placed the unity of Jerusalem as Israel's capital as an open question on the negotiating table. Against this background there is room to question whether the operation of Orient House, as we have known it in recent years, is still tolerable. Its contribution as a liaison between the Palestinians here and the PLO leadership in Tunis was quite limited. The PLO leadership is expected to move to Gaza or Jericho, and the Israeli Government does no longer need any Palestinian institution as an intermediary. When the PLO leadership relocates to Gaza or Jericho, the bunch of wheelers-dealers that had to date worked out of Jerusalem will lose its stature. The continued and heightened operation of Orient House might give the impression that Israel has come to terms with a situation in which its tenants are allowed to behave as if they were a Palestinian self-rule outside Gaza and Jericho. Israel should not agree to the creation of such an image and should take action to prevent it. The PLO leadership, with which we will have to negotiate an interim and a permanent arrangement, should not sit in any part of Jerusalem. As long as it has not been agreed otherwise, it can relocate from Tunis to either Gaza or Jericho. If 'Arafat sees Peres' letter as corroborating his argument that Orient House, at whatever level of political activity, can come under the banner "other institutions," the foreign minister must alert him to his error.
