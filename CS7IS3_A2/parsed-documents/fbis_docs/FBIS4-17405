Tuleyev, chairman of the Kemerovo Oblast Legislative Assembly, and M. Kislyuk, head of the oblast administration, have signed a treaty on accord and joint actions. Strictly guided by Russia's Constitution and laws and the oblast's legislative acts, and steadfastly observing the principle of the separation of powers, they have agreed to be guarantors of accord and constructive activity in the Kuzbass, help boost the revenue section of the oblast budget, and pursue a coordinated social policy. The struggle against crime and corruption is regarded as one of the main areas of joint activity. Paragraph 11 of the treaty is highly indicative in this regard: "In criticism of one another, to strive to be completely proper and constructive and to prevent the use of information based on conjecture and rumor." The heads of the authorities have urged the Kuzbass population to civil peace and accord which, as the document says, "will make it possible to transform the region from `striking Kuzbass' into `creative Kuzbass'." But what about the responsibility for observing the spirit and letter of the treaty? "At the moment it is moral and ethical," M. Kislyuk acknowledged. Meanwhile, the mechanism of responsibility for the treaty and documents to develop it in the future will have to be elaborated by the oblast Legislative Assembly. It is well known that A. Tuleyev and M. Kislyuk, men of differing and in some ways diametrically opposed political views, opposed each other most strenuously on virtually all matters of principle in the recent past, a time characterized by a fierce struggle between the two branches of power. However, approximately a year ago they agreed to work together in all the main areas where they have common viewpoints and to seek compromises in those areas where they do not -- without abandoning their political standpoints. Thus the present treaty is not a sensation but rather a further development of that policy.
