PUNR President Gheorghe Funar called for withdrawing the parliamentary support granted to the current government, while vice president Ioan Gavra pleaded for the maintenance of the current coalition and for further participation in the negotiations with the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], alongside of the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM], the Greater Romania Party [PRM], and the Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania [PDAR]. Ioan Gavra's proposal did not obtain the vote of the PUNR leadership; consequently, the final decision was to withdraw the parliamentary support for the PDSR. During the proceedings, Gheorghe Funar received a message from the PDSR inviting him to a discussion with Oliviu Gherman, president of the ruling party, the following day [1 February]. Parliamentary sources told us that Oliviu Gherman managed to "persuade" Gheorghe Funar and the other members of the PUNR Standing Bureau to accept the continuation of the negotiations. The only condition raised by the PUNR was that the PDSR and the other parties of the majority coalition should accept the government protocol adopted at Cluj. In the end, it was decided that the protocol should be the subject of the PDSR-PUNR-PRM-PSM-PDAR talks that will conclude on 1 March.
