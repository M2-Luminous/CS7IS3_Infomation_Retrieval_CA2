N. Illarionov and A. P. Komarov, Military Academy of Chemical Defense, Moscow; UDC677.4-96:541.183.12] [Abstract] Safeguarding the air and water media from harmful substances is a pressing problem, especially in regard to compounds of sulfur, nitrogen, chlorine, fluorine, and other toxic substances. Chemosorption on fibrous materials has evolved as the preferred method for removal of these substances. These fibers may be produced by: a) graft polymerization of active monomers capable of chemosorption to a finished monomer; b) forming a fiber from a copolymer containing chemically active groups; c) forming a fiber from a mixture of polymers containing chemosorbing groups. However, the output of these fibers by all known methods does not exceed several tons annually, and the immediate task consists of developing broad scale production of these materials in so far as experience indicates their undisputed advantages in resolving problems in safeguarding the environment. At the same time, the assortment of chemosorbent fibers should be broadened to include oxidation-reduction groups and groups capable of selective sorption. The report [sic] also discusses experimental data on the use of the chemosorptive fiber Vion for sorption of pollutants from industrial effluents. Results are presented on the testing of protective clothing which has good moisture and air breathing qualities, but is also impermeable to chemically active substances such as acids.
