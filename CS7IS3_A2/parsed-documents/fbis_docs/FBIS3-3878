Yesterday's meeting was attended by more than 600 people, including provincial party, government, and military leaders, such as Wang Maolin, Yang Zhengwu, Yang Minzhi, Luo Haifan, Wang Keying, Wen Xuande, Shen Ruiting, Zhou Shichang, Zhuo Kangning, Liu Tingying, and Huang Shigen; provincial discipline inspection commission members; prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city party committee secretaries or deputy secretaries in charge of discipline inspection work; prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city discipline inspection commission secretaries and supervision bureau chiefs; leading party group secretaries, discipline inspection group leaders or secretaries, and supervision office directors of the units directly under the provincial authorities; retired veteran leaders of the provincial discipline inspection commission and supervision department; and other leaders. Yesterday's meeting was presided over by Yang Minzhi, provincial party committee standing committee member and provincial discipline inspection commission secretary. Provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin delivered an important speech divided into the following three parts: 1. Conscientiously implement Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech as well as the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee. 2. Fruitfully, consistently, and profoundly carry out the anticorruption struggle. 3. Further Strengthen leadership over the anticorruption struggle. Secretary Wang Maolin emphatically stated in his speech: In order to implement to the letter the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee, we should first and foremost appraise the anticorruption struggle in the previous period, strengthen confidence in the anticorruption struggle, and profoundly and protractedly carry on the anticorruption struggle. At the moment, we should further heighten and unify understanding in this connection, this being of paramount importance. Secretary Wang Maolin pointed out: We should see to it that leading cadres at all levels in Hunan continually remain honest and strictly abide by discipline in discharging official duties. To this end, the provincial, prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and county party committees leaders, as well as the principal party and government leaders at all levels in the province, should take the lead and set a good example in the anticorruption struggle. We should waste no time in investigating and handling major and serious corruption cases, severely punish corrupt elements, and resolutely put an end to those malpractices that have caused strong resentment among the broad masses of people. To this end, first and foremost, we should make continued efforts to wipe out all unreasonable administrative charges and service fees. Second, we should strictly investigate and handle cases of commercializing the party and state powers as well as such cases as distortion, blackmail, holding banquets at public expense, demanding gifts, and so on. Third, we should make continued efforts to put an end to such malpractices as making overseas and domestic trips at public expense. Fourth, we should be cautious in handing economic entities run by party or government organs. Fifth, we should strictly investigate and ban such malpractices as party and government organs or functionaries using, by abusing their powers, vehicles, computers, telephones, and other types of equipment of enterprises without compensation and such malpractices as party and government organs making unauthorized use of enterprises' funds under various pretexts for their own financial purposes. Moreover, we should make redoubled efforts to eradicate such malpractices as party or government organs making unauthorized use of public funds to decorate offices and residences or installing central air-conditioners and residential telephone lines, and resolutely put an end to extravagance and waste as well. Secretary Wang Maolin asserted: The enterprises should also step up clean government building and wipe out all sorts of corrupt phenomena. In combating corruption, we should make persistent efforts to rectify and eradicate each and every malpractice by looking into both root causes and symptoms. The anticorruption struggle conforms, he noted, with the fundamental interests of the party and state and enjoys popular support among the people. So long as we strictly follow the basic work principles worked out by the central authorities, unswervingly rely on the party organizations and the broad masses of people, and work with one heart and one mind and in a down-to-earth manner, we will certainly be able to attain more tangible results in the first-stage anticorruption struggle in 1994, thereby making due contributions to the overall work of the party!
