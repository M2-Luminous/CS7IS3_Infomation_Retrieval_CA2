At the same time, President Boris Yeltsin dismissed Nemtsov from the post of presidential representative in the Nizhniy Novgorod region which he had so far combined with the post of governor. This was reported to INTERFAX by Yevgeniy Krestyaninov, who was appointed by Yeltsin as presidential representative in the Nizhniy Novgorod region. Krestyaninov was chairman of the former Nizhniy Novgorod regional council of people's deputies. Together with Nemtsov on December 12, 1993, he was elected a member of the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly from the Nizhniy Novgorod region. According to Krestyaninov, he was recommended to the post of the presidential representative by Nemtsov. "Our region was the only one where the posts of the presidential representative and the governor were combined," he explained. Krestyaninov noted that he and Nemtsov had good business relations which he hopes will promote further development of constructive relations between the Nizhniy Novgorod region and the federal authorities. In the meantime, the press attache of the Nizhniy Novgorod regional administration Mikhail Levin told INTERFAX that Nemtsov himself proposed to dismiss him as the presidential representative in the Nizhniy Novgorod region. He was appointed as presidential representative in the region by Yeltsin's decree in the autumn of 1991. Later by another decree Nemtsov was appointed the governor of the Nizhniy Novgorod region, in contradiction of the previous decision.
