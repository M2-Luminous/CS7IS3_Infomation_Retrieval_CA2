This was decided during a working meeting between Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetsky and Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel Kozlovskiy in Lvov yesterday. The ministers said at a press conference on the results of the negotiations that after the Soviet single armed forces had collapsed, their equipment and property had been divided. According to the ministers, there were not enough funds to acquire new equipment, which makes the two states seek closer cooperation in all military areas. For instance, the agreement provides for exchange of military equipment between the two states. However, the defense ministers stressed that this did not mean unification of the Ukrainian and Belarusian armies. Neither did it provide for restoration of a single command. Radetskiy pointed out that Ukraine had declared its sovereignty and non-participation in military blocks and that it regarded the military cooperation only as a bilateral one. Ukraine will take part in military cooperation within the CIS only as an observer. Commenting on the issue concerning nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Radetskiy emphasized that Ukraine would carry out the January 14 trilateral agreement between the U.S.A., Russia and Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian defense minister, the terms for withdrawal and dismantling of the nuclear weapons have already been set.
