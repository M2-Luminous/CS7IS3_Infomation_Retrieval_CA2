They discussed measures to take henceforth. Minister Han and Secretary Christopher agreed that the nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] was not satisfactory [sunjoropchi mottaha] and no progress was made in the issue of exchanging North-South special envoys. As the result, a third round of U.S.-North Korea talks is undecided. The foreign ministers of the two countries shared the view that the two countries will make last-ditch efforts for dialogue to persuade North Korea but will seek new measures -- omni-directional -- if the efforts for dialogue are not successful. The ministers of the two countries agreed that it is important for the two countries to implement consistent measures at this point under close mutual consultations. In the conversation, Minister Han revealed that during President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China beginning 26 March, the North Korean nuclear issue will be discussed at a ROK-PRC summit and in other occasions of consultation.
