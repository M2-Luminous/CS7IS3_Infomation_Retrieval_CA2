However, we live and work under conditions of war, which makes it very difficult indeed to solve numerous, very sensitive issues within a short period of time, within 30 days or so, and at the same time deal with many other issues imposed on us by the incidents of war. Although lately there has been an abundance of events that (?pretended) to be that, to be not only important, but also historic, there is no doubt that the Washington Agreement and the adopted Federation Constitution will find their place among these events. In brief, it is in fact these events that mark a qualitatively new stage characterized by essentially different relations and a much faster pace of development. It is very important that we preserve and further develop this new qualitatively new component, and at the same time step up the dynamics of the process that has begun. The Washington Agreement and the adoption of the Federation Constitution represent an exceptionally important breakthrough in unblocking relations caused by the aggression. First of all there is a shift in the balance of power in the political and military spheres, which had significantly shifted to the advantage of the aggressor prior to the conclusion of the Washington Agreement. The setting up of the Federation has facilitated the consolidation of relations between Bosniaks and Croats and the unified stand toward aggressive Serbian nationalism. This in turn facilitates a strategic change in relations not only in Bosnia-Herzegovina but also further afield in the region. At this moment this is the only real way to effectively oppose the idea of the creation of a great Serbia. This orientation has already yielded some results. There were, however, some risks that the process to implement the Washington Agreement would be blocked. The Vienna Agreement had removed that danger and instead of a new blockade, we now have an open path to implement the federal Constitution and realize the entire political project deriving from the Washington Agreement. Proceeding from the standpoints of the Constituent Assembly, we have reached concurrence on several very important issues, proposals that will enable the assembly to adopt decisions needed to definitely realize [word indistinct] the Federation in actual life. First, we have agreed on the national composition of the incumbents to the federation's executive branch. These proposals are already known and there is no need for me to repeat them here. The proposals are based on provisions of the Federation Constitution and the provisions of the Constitutional Law on Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We bore in mind the fact that in the transitional period, within constitutionally determined rights and duties, the constitutional organs of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the organs of the Federation will function simultaneously. However, the national composition of the federal incumbents is not the only important issue. At this moment it is extremely important that the people who are to carry out these duties are firmly, sincerely, and personally committed to the consistent implementation of the Washington Agreement. Their readiness to work resolutely on the implementation of the constitutional setup of the Federation as a whole is especially important. It is not redundant to stress that every person proposed for these posts from one nation must be acceptable to the other nation. Incumbents for federal posts will however not perform their duties only for the nation from which they come. They are state officials who have constitutional rights, duties, and responsibilities toward all peoples and all citizens. It is therefore important that they are people who enjoy widespread trust. When we were creating conditions for the effective implementation of the Constitution of the Federation we also (?adopted) proposals for the territorial organization of the cantons. This is a very important and sensitive issue. It took a considerable amount of patience, effort, and understanding to find acceptable solutions. It is in fact this issue that has demonstrated that the concept of federation does not lead toward rifts and divisions, but that it is opening up opportunities for the reintegration of people and regions, respecting at the same time the principles of national equality and the rights of the Bosniaks and Croats to exercise the constitutional status of constituent nations in all parts of the federation. Regarding the Central Bosnian and the Neretva Cantons, one should particularly stress that the proposed solutions are such that it is in fact these two cantons that, instead of being battlefields, can represent the backbone of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is one of those solutions that is strengthening mutual trust among Bosniaks and Croats and pointing to the readiness to set up the Federation and develop it as a real expression of common, long-term, and vital interests of the two peoples. The issue of the territory of the Federation as whole is directly connected to the territorial organization of the cantons. Full agreement has also been reached on this issue. The territory of the Federation is defined according to the constitutional principle that the Federation will be set up in those areas of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in which the Bosniaks and Croats constitute a majority of the population. The territories of the areas defined in this way encompass 55 percent of the total territory of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Sarajevo region, which makes up another 3 percent of the republic, is treated in a special way. In the transitional period this region would be placed under the administrative supervision of the international community and the United Nations. According to the map established by the Vienna Agreement, there are 2,844,000 people living on the territory of the Federation, according to data from 1991. Of these, the Bosniaks make up 52.07 percent, the Croats 24.11 percent, the Serbs 16.93 percent, and members of other nations make up approximately 7 percent. In relation to the total number of the Bosniaks in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 77.81 percent of the members of this nation are living on the territory of the Federation. Of the total number of the Bosnia- Herzegovina Croats, 90.12 percent of them live on the territory of the Federation. Of the total number of Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 35.25 percent live on the territory of the Federation. Of course, one cannot see from the statistical data on ethnic composition all the components important for the survival and functioning of the territorial integrity of the federation. However, the analysis of other elements shows that the territory of the Federation satisfies the most vital political, economic, defense, and other parameters necessary for the realistic functioning of the Federation. I would like to stress in particular that the aim of creating the Federation is not to establish some kind of exclusive space for Bosniaks and Croats. On the contrary, I think that this is only an important step in the search for a just and lasting political solution that will bring peace back to this region, and that will enable members of all nations to live free in all parts of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and enjoy full national equality and all human rights and freedoms. It is in fact for these reasons that our invitation is permanently open to the members of the Serbian nation to accept the federal concept on the same principles that apply to the Bosniaks and the Croats. This is (?fair) proposal that represents a reasonable and acceptable alternative to the war options. The members of the Serbian nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina have every reason to react positively to this proposal. Esteemed deputies, the decisions that the parliament is supposed to adopt today have great importance in the context of the peace process that is again gaining pace and intensity with the initiatives of the United States, Russia, and the European Union. The realization of the Washington and Vienna Agreements has already considerably contributed to the removal of the imposed notion about three warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina. A few day ago, at the meeting with the contact group in France, we were formally and essentially one side, a side that (?impressed) with its arguments and with constructive proposals aimed at achieving a peaceful and just political solution. The implementation of the Constitution of the Federation at all levels, and (?organization), will contribute to the further strengthening of such [words indistinct]. Of course, one should not have any illusions that everything will go smoothly. Before us is lies the important political duty of reestablishing mutual trust with words and deeds, especially in the regions where past events have had serious consequences. For the sake of truth and political reality, one should say that there are forces in whose interest it is to obstruct and even openly prevent these positive efforts. It is our duty to prevent and eliminate these extremists, because their existence and activities only serve the aggressor and weaken our position. Further (?consolidation) of the situation and relations in the Federation in our view means above all a step closer to peace. However, if the war option continues to be imposed on us, then this is a precondition for our successful resistance against aggression. Esteemed Deputies, before this parliament are proposals on which it must decide with much prudence, tolerance, and political responsibility. By adopting the Constitution of the Federation and supporting the Washington Agreement, this assembly has already demonstrated these qualities. I believe that the executive bodies that will be elected and appointed at this session will have the same attitudes toward their future duties. This particularly refers to the peace process; the strengthening of the defense forces for the struggle against the aggressor; the speedy establishment of other entities envisaged by the federal constitution, at all levels; the further consolidation of the situation on the territory controlled by the legislative branch; the creation of conditions for the survival of the population in areas particularly affected by the war; and especially the care for refugees and displaced persons, that is, the creation of conditions for their soonest return to the places and homes that they had to leave. I appeal to you to contribute with your decisions to the even more resolute and successful realization of these principles that are of vital importance for every individual, every family, and all peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thank you. [applause]
