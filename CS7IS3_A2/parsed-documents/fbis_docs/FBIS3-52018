After meeting with evangelicals on 26 January, Camacho considered as very damaging to the peace process the statements accusing church members of instigating the armed conflict. He explained this could create new forms of violence instead of contributing to the resolution of the situation. After leaving Los Pinos Residence, where he met with President Salinas de Gortari, Camacho announced that things are moving on the right track, adding that at noon on 27 January he will report the results of the measures taken to the Zapatist National Liberation Army forces.
