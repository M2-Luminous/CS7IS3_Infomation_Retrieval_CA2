Among those pardoned are former President Eric Arturo Delvalle and the 510 corregimiento representatives who appointed Francisco Rodriguez as president for the presidential term that started on 1 September 1989. Also included in this pardon granted to those who committed only political crimes are Benjamin Colamarco Patino; Arturo Diez; Rafael Arosemena; Orville K. Goodin; Olmedo David Miranda; Nander Pitty Velasquez; Jorge Eduardo Ritter; Marta Amado Trevia; Manuel Solis Palma; Francisco Sanchez Cardenas; Julio Shaik; and Jaime Simmons. Meanwhile, Tomas Gabriel Altamirano Duque, who allegedly slandered and offended Omayra Correa by publishing three political cartoons in LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in August and September 1989, was also granted a pardon. Others who were granted presidential pardons include journalists Escolastico Calvo and Guillermo Keevers. These pardons fail to absolve these people from being prosecuted for committing common crimes, however.
