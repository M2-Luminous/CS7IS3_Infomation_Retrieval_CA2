Just as the Earth celebrates the blossoms of April, every year our struggler Arab masses celebrate the anniversary of the establishment of our great party, the ASBP. [passage omitted] Comrades, on the 47th anniversary of the establishment of the ASBP, I have the honor to convey to you on this great anniversary, and through you to all the party's strugglers and to all Arab strugglers, the greetings and congratulations of the first Ba'thist, the leader of the march of our people and nation, struggler comrade President Hafiz al-Asad. [applause] At the same time, it pleases me to convey to you greetings and congratulations from the party leadership, and its wishes for further success on the road to the objectives of the party and the masses: Unity, freedom, and socialism. [passage omitted reviewing ASBP history, principles, and achievements] Al-Asad's Syria today, with all worthiness, carries pan-Arab concerns. It will not allow the loss of Arab rights. It is capable of raising the cultural pan-Arab banner that is the honorable image of our nation despite the difficult times through which this nation is passing. The Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton is considered an event that confirmed that Syria's leader, the great Arab leader Hafiz al-Asad, [applause] constitutes, before the world, the true image and the nation's cultural face, committed to rights, pride, and dignity. Within this framework, Syria is working to reinforce Arab solidarity based on the ASBP's great pan-Arab principles, to bolster the Arabs' role, and to coordinate their efforts to liberate their occupied territories, restore their usurped rights, and defend themselves in the face of the challenges that threaten their present and future in a way that proves that they reject humiliation, submission, and capitulation to fait accompli. The right to defend oneself, land, and rights, is a right recognized by all the world's laws and charters. Struggle for liberation is also a right and a national duty to every people whose land was occupied and whose rights were violated. Al-Asad's Syria, just as it was in the past, will not be prevented from playing its pan-Arab role in defending Arab rights by any pressure, false accusations, and unjust lists on which the Zionist lobby insists. For a long time, this lobby has been used to working in the United States to drag its administration into creating a rift in Syrian-U.S. relations, and to try to disrupt Syria's position toward the peace process, especially since this lobby and its henchmen are angered by Syria's abidance with Arab rights and constants, and by the diplomatic successes it has made, which were clearly displayed by Syria's dealing with the peace process through adherence to Arab rights, and confrontation of Israel's intransigence and crude terrorism. Comrades, brothers: Based on all this, Syria has offered great pan-Arab sacrifices to support brothers everywhere. By doing so, it had no motives other than the great pan-Arab motive, which is entrenched in ASBP ideology and thought which was expanded and enriched by the thought of the honest leader Hafiz al-Asad and his limitless sacrifices. [applause] It is the pan-Arab understanding of the issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict, which is the pivot of the activities of al-Asad's Syria and its struggle within the framework of achieving a just and comprehensive solution to this conflict based on restoring the occupied Arab territories and the usurped rights in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions and the land for peace principle. Syria joined the peace process in the region, which is based on the international legitimacy, more than two years ago in order to be a means to achieving clear objectives, whose contents were included in UN Security Council Resolutions No. 242, 338, and 425, and the land for peace formula. It has exerted continuous efforts to contribute to the success of this process and to achieve its objectives of establishing a just, comprehensive, and honorable peace. However, Israel has not stopped, through its maneuverings and practices since the outset of the peace process, to obstruct this process and to divert it from its basic objectives, as part of its plans to impose capitulation on the Arabs. Comrades, Syria does not agree that this process should be derailed from its specified track, and the formula agreed on in Madrid. Syria has confronted, and is resolutely confronting all the Israeli maneuvering, intransigence, and attempts to evade the requirements and prerequisites of peace, foremost of which are the withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and the recognition of the Palestinian Arab people's legitimate rights. [applause] Israel is still resorting to the means that enable it to divert the peace process from its objective. After it dealt separately with the Palestinian side through the Oslo agreement in an attempt to strike at Arab coordination and to weaken the Arab position, it perpetrated the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, whose hideousness is beyond any one's imagination. It was also behind the massacre perpetrated at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. The objective behind all this is to abort peace efforts and to foil the Arabs' efforts to restore their rights and territories. The UN Security Council's denunciation of the abhorrent holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, through its Resolution No. 904, shows that the whole world began to complain about Israel's terrorist behavior, and began to expose Israel's intransigence and adherence to fascism and occupation. This is despite the fact that the resolution itself is not commensurate with the hideous nature of the crime. Nor does it constitute sufficient deterrence to the terrorist behavior of which Israel has been known since the beginning of its continuous aggression against the Arabs. Comrades, brothers: The quick pursuit of those who exploded the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Lebanon has exposed those involved in successive explosions. They are linked with Israel and work to execute its schemes. This proves the fraternal people of Lebanon are determined to foil Israeli plots to reinvolve Lebanon in acts of violence and to disrupt its efforts to achieve stability and national accord, and to liberate southern Lebanon. These plots use the most hideous and the crudest means of terrorism, as we saw at Sayyidat al-Najat Church and before, and as we see in what is taking place in occupied southern Lebanon everyday. The measures the Lebanese Government has taken to confront the conspirators against Lebanon's security and stability, and to confront all those who would contribute to returning Lebanon to the whirlpool of violence and fighting, were received with great satisfaction inside and outside Lebanon. These measures, which are backed by Syria, have contributed to exposing tools manipulated from outside Lebanon in order to implement Israeli schemes. These measures have exposed Israel's intentions against Lebanon. They prove the march of security and accord in Lebanon is stronger than all who want this fraternal country to return to the climate of war, violence, and destruction. [applause] Comrades, brothers: The struggle of our zealous kinsfolk in the Golan and their valiant confrontation of the occupation troops, the valiant Palestinian intifadah in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and the heroic Lebanese resistance in southern Lebanon, are all important factors that integrate with Syria's struggle to impose the Arab right on an intransigent Israel that wants peace with land. As its leader, the great Arab leader Hafiz al-Asad [applause] said, Syria will not relinquish a single inch of the Golan and the other occupied Arab territories. Neither will it give up any Arab rights. Syria is confronting all the obstacles Israel places on the road to peace with the objective of arriving at a just and comprehensive peace in the region that restores full Arab rights and territories to their people, and opens the doors of free development and progress to the region's peoples, avoiding aggression, hegemony, tyranny, and occupation. Comrades, based on the humanitarian dimension of the pan-Arab movement and the Arab nation's civilization and culture, the ASBP established a network of relations with several parties, organizations, and liberation movements, to gain the greatest possible support for our Arab issues, and to confront the world's misleading Zionist media. These relations are part of the peoples' common struggle to build a world free of all forms of aggression, hegemony, tyranny, and the policy of variable standards--a world based on justice, equality, and respect for every people's right to opt for their own way of development with complete freedom. Developments in the international arena prove the end of the Cold War has not brought security, stability, and peace, as indicated by the slogans that accompanied its end. The number of conflicts, tensions, and civil wars has increased. They have escalated in several countries, such as Afghanistan, Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the former Soviet Republics, and in other countries and continents. These countries feel they are left to fight, as if they exist outside this world. In fact, the policies of hegemony and tyranny, and the hostility to Arabs and Muslims, have increased the pains of peoples and made their causes a field for external interference and a game for the balances of power and interests in the world. Comrades: We stress that world peace, security, and stability, are an indivisible whole. It is necessary to consider all peoples' interests and aspirations, aside from all forms of fascism, Zionism, hegemony, and tyranny, and aside from the policies of aggression, nuclear arms, and mass destruction weapons stockpiled by those who took the policy of aggression and hegemony against peoples as a profession. Taking all peoples' interests into consideration is an indispensable condition for building a new world order based on democracy in international relations, on justice, equality, and mutual respect, and on eliminating the current discrimination among the world's poor and rich, north, and south. Comrades, based on a rich experience gradually built by the party until it grew and became strong, and proceeding from the sacrifices and energies of a great leader who is leading the contemporary pan- Arab struggle, the honest leader Hafiz al-Asad [applause] -- based on all this, we are optimistic about the future. On this occasion, the party's 47th anniversary, we renew the pledge to pursue the march with a greater determination and stronger enthusiasm behind our honest, symbol leader Hafiz al-Asad. [applause] A march that is led by Hafiz al-Asad has no choice but to go ahead toward further victories and achievements. Comrades, on this occasion, on behalf of you, all the party's strugglers, and all the Arab strugglers, I send heartfelt greetings and congratulations to the leader of the march of our people and nation, the secretary general of the party, and the president of the republic, struggler leader Hafiz al-Asad. [applause] Greetings to all the Ba'thist strugglers in the entire greater Arab homeland. Greetings to our struggler Arab masses, the source of the party's inspiration and the minaret of its policies and march. Greetings to our steadfast kinsfolk in the heroic Golan. Greetings to the sons of our people, the heroes of the heroic Palestinian intifadah, to the valiant resistance men in southern Lebanon, and to all Arab strugglers. All greetings to the leader of the march of our people, party, and nation to victory and liberation, the honest leader, struggler comrade Hafiz al-Asad. [applause]
