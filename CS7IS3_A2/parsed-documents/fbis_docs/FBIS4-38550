Finance Minister Erkeshbai Derbisov said so in an interview with INTERFAX after Monday's session of the Cabinet of Ministers held to consider changes in Kazakhstan's budget for the current year. Earlier the finance minister said that President Nursultan Nazarbayev's decision to raise the minimal wages to 100 tenges may entail a rise in the budget deficit. According to estimates, in May inflation in Kazakhstan will reach 26 percent, Derbisov said. In January it ran at 42 percent, in February at 27 pct, in March at 17 percent and in April at 31 percent.
