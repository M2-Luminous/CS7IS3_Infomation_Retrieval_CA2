This is not the case. Nevertheless, in today's Gallup opinion poll it is a fact that once again the Center Democrats -- as they did in November -- are succeeding in keeping their nose above the threshold for representation in the Folketing -- this time with five deputies to boot. On the other hand the Liberal Party has fallen from 30.5 percent in December to 27.5 percent this month. If there were a Folketing election tomorrow, the Liberal Party would have 49 seats -- as against 57 in December. Nevertheless, Liberal Party taxation spokesman Peter Brixtofte has faith in a landslide when the election comes. "Our standing is high regardless. It is still double what it has been in the past. The other things are temporary fluctuations. Things go up and down. But with these figures I would like to urge the Center Democrats to return to the fold where they belong," Brixtofte said. Neither a Liberal Party-Conservative People's Party-Progress Party bloc nor the present government would have an absolute majority. The Unity List would again enter the Folketing.
