The PLA's powerful political department has issued a circular, published on the front page of newspapers here Monday, calling on the military to stand four square behind current economic reforms. The call for loyalty follows a series of similar appeals to rank and file party members and leading social figures issued by senior leaders during last week's national conference on ideology and the media. The meeting was the most important since 1957 which led to purges against rightists. Emphasising that the "new situation had created new problems" -- an implication that accelerated economic reforms this year could bring the risk of social instability -- the circular called on all army units to back the programme and to work to strengthen the "socialist spiritual civilisation." The text called on soldiers to be in the "forefront of patriotism," to study the works of Deng Xiaoping and publicise the Communist Party central committee's decisions. The party also called on soldiers to follow the example of soldier Lei Feng, a legendary hero of the 60s who devoted his life to the motherland and the party before his death aged 22. The military should study the spirit of Lei Feng and improve their ideological knowledge, it said. Last week, before an assembly of PLA veterans, party chief Jiang Zemin told the armed forces to remain united behind the party. Chinese leaders are visibly concerned about the threat of social, or even political unrest this year as economic reforms speed up, somewhat unevenly. Deng also celebrates his 90th birthday in August this year. Many foreign and Chinese analysts fear his death could bring chaos to the country. In the event of unrest, the party leaders want to be able to count on the armed forces to ensure the system does not collapse around them.
