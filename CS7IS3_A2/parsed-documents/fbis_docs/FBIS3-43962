Troops surrounded and sealed off Tshisekedi's Kinshasa home early in the morning according to his close advisor and former Tshisekedi government communications minister, Lambert Mende. Kinshasha streets were deserted Wednesday morning in answer to an appeal from Tshisekedi for a strike to protest Marshal Mobuto's dissolution of rival parliaments. Frequent gunfights in the capital overnight also helped clear markets and close shops. However, the volatile working-class districts of the city were reported quiet Wednesday morning. Tshisekedi has been in a year-long stand-off with Mobuto following his refusal to step down as prime minister when the president dismissed him in October 1992, dissolving his whole government in February 1993. Tshisekedi was foisted as premier on the reluctant Mobuto by a national conference that began its work, often interrupted by political strife and bloodshed, in 1991. The latest conflict was sparked by Mobuto's declaration last week that the signing of a political agreement between his own Political Forces of the Conclave (FPC) movement and the radical Holy Alliance opposition coalition entailed the dissolution of the country's rival parliaments. The High Council of the Republic (HCR), appointed by the national conference in 1992, and the National Assembly, comprising members of the former sole, ruling People's Movement of the Revolution (MPR), both claim legislative authority. Mobutu called for a meeting Wednesday among members of the rival bodies, which he wanted grouped in a new high council, to consider a new constitution and the premiership of the large, impoverished central African nation of more than 38 million people. The HCR, however, has refused to accept Mobutu's position, as it refused to accept the authority of Faustin Birindwa, the prime minister he appointed after dismissing Tshisekedi for a second time in two years in October 1992. The HCR has been summoned into session around midday Thursday by its vice-president, Joseph Ileo, a member of Tshisekedi's Christian Democrat and Social Party (PDSC), who stated that the HCR would not attend the meeting proposed by Mobutu. The HCR president, Archbishop of Kisingani Laurent Mosengwo Pasinya, had called for a meeting of the council as soon as possible to discuss forming a single body with the national assembly. Mobuto's 29-year-old regime is showing increasing signs of falling apart with mounting reluctance of his main backers, former colonial power Belgium, France, and the United States to support him.
