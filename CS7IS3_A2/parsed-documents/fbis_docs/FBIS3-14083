The rabbi also ruled that Muslim tourism to the site should not be encouraged. Our correspondent Mikha'el Tuchfeld reports that the halakhic edict stated that Muslim tourists endangered the existence of the Jewish people in their country. Meanwhile, Waqf officials in Jerusalem said they would continue to bar Israelis and tourists from entering the Temple Mount. Israel Police, on the other hand, said that it was preventing the entry of Israelis and tourists out of operational considerations. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that representatives from the police and the Jerusalem Municipality met yesterday with Waqf officials on the matter. [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 23 March in a page 14 report by Shlomo Naqdimon reports that "Former Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren yesterday said that `Masada could repeat itself in Hebron.'" The paper notes that Rabbi Goren "warned that the evacuation of the Jewish settlers from Hebron would end in bloodshed." Goren added that "the Jews in Hebron must hang on by their nails. They must on no account agree to be evacuated. I am hereby declaring that I will stand at their side when this happens. I am ready to give my life together with them and to resist any attempt to evacuate them." YEDI'OT AHARONOT goes on to explain that "in Masada, the defenders of the Jewish fortress preferred to commit mass suicide rather than surrender to the Roman conqueror."]
