Discount Rate Some commenters believed that the proposed requirement to limit the discount rate used in the quarterly PMSR valuation to a rate that is no less than the discount rate used at the original acquisition of the assets contradicts the concept of determining current market value. The limitation on discount rate would only be used in calculating book value. The agencies believe that requiring a discounting approach that uses the discount rate embedded in the yield estimate at original purchase is appropriate in calculating book value because it will deter any overvaluation of the book value of PMSRs and is consistent with historical cost accounting. This final rule is consistent with the final rules of the other agencies. These rules retain the requirement to use a discounting approach but transfer the specific guidance on the applicable discount rate and other valuation guidance to their Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports). The Thrift Financial Report will require PMSRs and PCCRs to be carried at a book value that does not exceed the discounted amount of estimated future net cash flows. Management of an association must review the carrying value at least quarterly, adequately document this review, and adjust the book value as necessary. If unanticipated prepayments, defaults, account attrition, or other events reduce the amount of expected future net cash flows, a write down of the book value of the PMSRs or PCCRs must be made to the extent that the discounted amount of future net cash flows is less than the assets' carrying amounts. The discount rate used for this book value calculation may not be less than the original discount rate inherent in the intangible asset at the time of its acquisition based upon the estimated net cash flows and the price paid at the time of purchase. 6. Valuation Limitation of 90 Percent of Original Cost Some commenters recommended that the agencies drop the proposed requirement that qualifying intangibles be carried at no more than 90 percent of their original purchase price. They argued that this limitation provides no additional protection to the insurance fund from economic risk and unfairly penalizes institutions with recently acquired PMSRs or PCCRs. The agencies agree and believe that the other valuation limitations should ensure that qualifying intangibles are conservatively valued for capital purposes. Accordingly, the 90 percent of original cost limitation has been removed.
