The rebels seem to have taken refuge in the Lacandon Jungle, to where they have been pushed by Army troops, who chase and bomb them, journalist of the Tuxtla Gutierrez daily "CUARTO PODER" told EFE. Military sources told our informants that the chase has extended to the town of San Juan Chamula, in the Lacandon Jungle, where residents captured four rebels who were armed with harquebus-type shotguns. The Army expelled the rebels from the town of Altamirano, the last of seven towns they had occupied and which still remained under their control. In Altamirano shooting between the rebels and Army was still heard, however. Fighting has left at least 121 dead, half of whom are Zapatista rebels, according to official sources. A journalist of the daily "CUARTO PODER" told EFE that the Mexican Army controls totally three of the four municipalities in which the rebels had concentrated.
