FR940228-2-00086 FR940228-2-00054 IV The staff, based on its independent evaluation as embodied in the July 13, 1993, SRM on SECY&hyph;93&hyph;127 ``Financial Protection Required of Licensees of Large Nuclear Power Plants During Decommissioning,'' has concluded that sufficient bases exist for our approval of relief from the financial protection requirements for the FSV. The staff has also concluded that granting the proposed exemption does not increase the probability or consequences of any accidents or reduce the margin of safety at this facility. V Based on Sections III and IV above, the NRC has determined, that pursuant to 10 CFR 140.8, that this exemption is authorized by law and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the NRC grants an exemption from the requirements from 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to the extent that primary financial protection in the amount of $100,000,000 shall be maintained and that an exemption from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan (secondary level financial protection) is granted for FSV. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the NRC has determined that the granting of this exemption will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 6311, dated February 10, 1994). A copy of the licensee's request for the exemption and supporting documentation dated February 25, 1993, and the NRC staff's Safety Evaluation, included in the exemption, are available for public inspection at the NRC's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037, and at the Weld Library District_Downtown Branch, 919 7th Street, Greeley, CO 80631. This exemption is effective upon issuance. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 17th day of February, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. John T. Greeves, Director, Division of Low-Level Waste Management and Decommissioning, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.
