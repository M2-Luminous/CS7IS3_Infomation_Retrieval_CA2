The head of state, who was speaking at UNESCO Headquarters at the opening of the Interparliamentary Union [IPU] conference, which will be chaired by National Assembly Speaker Philippe Seguin throughout this week, mentioned the recent G-7 meeting on employment: "I and others in France have worked very hard to ensure that the big countries deal with the actual problems of their fellow citizens. That has been made possible because a few big countries are no longer advocating wage cuts or questioning social protection as a remedy for unemployment, although many countries still are tempted to do so." Preventing Conflicts Stressing the need to create "good, real jobs," Francois Mitterrand said that although, "strong growth remains vital," it is also necessary "to exploit new ways of creating jobs through the development of research, technology, education, training throughout life, and a new organization of work. There will only be lasting progress when social clauses are included in international agreements," the president of the Republic concluded. The head of state also defended the cause of the United Nations, which he thinks is the "perfect framework" for preventing conflicts. "This organization is irreplaceable for consolidating peace," he said. Philippe Seguin, for his part, argued in favor of parliaments, which "have emerged as the main protagonists of modernity since the 18th century (...). According to the National Assembly speaker, far from demonstrating that national parliaments are outdated, the new big world issues -- environmental protection, development aid, the organization of exchanges of products and capital, the fight against criminal networks -- emphasize the need for their determined involvement in international affairs." He added that "democracy cannot be decreed or improvised; it is the fruit of a patient apprenticeship to which we must contribute." This remark is in line with the concerns of the Interparliamentary Union which intends to draw up in Paris this week, for the first time, a "resolution" concerning the conduct of free and democratic elections in the world. Senate Speaker Rene Monory said, along the same lines, that "parliaments have an important role to play in international relations," adding that "no culture, no civilization can escape the citizens' legitimate demand to participate in the major political decisions through elections by universal suffrage and institutions which respect human rights."
