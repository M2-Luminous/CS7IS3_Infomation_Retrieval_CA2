The same sources also noted that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that his country, which will take over the EU Presidency on 1 July, would like to convene an extraordinary summit on 15 July to settle the issue. The deadlock in appointing Jacques Delors' successor is caused by Britain's opposition to the candidacy of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. British Foreign Secretary said that the names of other candidates will also be discussed. Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and British Commissioner on Trade Affairs Sir Leon Brittan have withdrawn from the race for the Commission presidency. The Greek presidency expressed its displeasure at Britain's stand toward the Belgian prime minister's candidacy. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that Greece does not see what can change by 15 July when the next extraordinary EU summit will convene. He added: The Greek presidency proposed the renewal of Jacques Delors term of office. Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation special correspondent Petros Petridhis reports that the Greek proposal is being explored and that Mr. Venizelos did not give any further details on the proposal. At any rate, Mr. Delors' consent will be needed for the proposal to be realized.
