They seized computers, documents and large quantities of drugs. Up to 1,000 officers from six police forces, co-ordinated by the Royal Ulster Constabulary's [RUC] specialist C13 anti-racketeering squad, took part in the operation. It came after 12 months of "intensive investigations" into the terrorists' financial activities. Operation "Madronna", designed to halt the 6 million pounds a year that flows to the IRA to purchase its arms and explosives, was unprecedented in its scale and scope. In simultaneous dawn raids, heavily armed units searched 41 premises -- eight in the north-west of England, 14 in London and Surrey, eight in Northern Ireland and 11 in the Irish Republic. The RUC said that eight people were arrested and officers seized a "substantial" quantity of drugs, stolen property and money. Four people were detained in the south-east of England, including one held after raids on addresses in Woking, Surrey, and four in the Republic but none in Northern Ireland. Computers and a large amount of documents, some of which are believed to relate to building society and bank accounts, were also seized. Irish police said they could not confirm a report that a key IRA financier who headed the wanted list had evaded capture. In the Republic, addresses were raided in Dundalk and Dublin. One security source said: "We are trying to tie the purse strings of IRA active service units in Britain." In Belfast, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, welcomed the operation. "The funds for terrorist organisations are important. If you get hold of their funds then you prevent them from doing the worst things they wish to do." Mr Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist MP for East Belfast, said: "The use of apparently legitimate businesses as a front for funding terrorism has been a long standing problem and people in Northern Ireland will be eager to determine the scale of this operation and the consequences to the bankrolling of the IRA."
