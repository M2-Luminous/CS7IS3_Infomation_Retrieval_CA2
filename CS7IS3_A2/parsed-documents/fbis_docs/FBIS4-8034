[Correspondent K. Koziol] This is the first Polish-Slovak contact at government level following the changes in the Slovak Government. It is also the first trip of the new foreign minister of Slovakia. After the meeting, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak told journalists that he had discussed with the head of Slovak diplomacy all matters linked to our cooperation, mainly the agreements that have been prepared and are ready to be signed. These are, said the prime minister, agreements regarding economic cooperation, the safeguarding and support of investments, and an agreement on double taxation. The foreign minister of the Slovak Republic conveyed to Prime Minister Pawlak an invitation from Slovak Prime Minister Moravcik to pay a visit to Slovakia. I am certain, said Kukan, that my visit to Warsaw will speed up the legal regulation upon which our relations are based. From the Council of Ministers Office, Kukan made his way to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a face-to-face meeting with Minister Andrzej Olechowski. At the same time, the two delegations are holding plenary talks. This is Krystyna Koziol for the First Program.
