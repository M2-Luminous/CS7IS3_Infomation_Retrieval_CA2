But among Social Democratic voters interest in the Union remains cool -- only 23 percent are in favor, while all of 51 percent are against. This is shown by DAGENS NYHETER/Temo's June opinion poll on the EU. The result is not significantly different from the previous poll. In the whole of the population the no-side clearly has the upper hand with 43 percent against the 31 percent of those who support EU membership. For the time being at least the bodies of public opinion on the EU seem to have stabilized at these levels. The Temo figures square well with the recent poll by the Central Bureau of Statistics. The Temo poll was carried out between 8 and 15 June, and 1,012 people were asked by telephone what decision they would reach in a referendum today on EU entry. The number of those who are undecided is still large -- 26 percent. A majority, 52 percent, among those who vote for the four government parties would vote yes to the EU today. This is a slightly lower level than in May, when the figure was 56 percent. The yes-side has shrunk a little among Moderates and Center Party supporters, but increased among Liberal Party supporters. In June, 27 percent of those who vote for the nonsocialist parties would vote no. The Center Party and the Christian Democratic Community Party still have a majority of opponents of the EU among their voters. Among Social Democrats and supporters of the Left Party a majority -- 53 percent -- would vote no. However, the yes-side has increased by 4 percentage points since May. Among Social Democrats the yes-side has increased from 18 percent in May to 23 percent in June. The no-side has increased from 49 to 51 percent, while the proportion of those undecided has fallen by 7 percent. The proportion of undecided voters is somewhat higher for the Social Democrats plus the Left Party than for the nonsocialist parties -- 26 percent against 21 percent. Men remain much more positive toward the EU than women -- 37 percent of men say yes against 25 percent of women. But women are also more undecided than men. Of the different age groups the youngest, 18- to 29-year-olds, are most negative toward the EU -- a total of 55 percent say no. The only age group which has a majority for EU membership is 45- to 59-year-olds. There the positions is 40 percent for and 34 against. Those who have made up their minds for or against the EU were asked a follow-up question about how firm they are in their choice. Among EU supporters 86 percent are firm in their choice, a marginal decrease since May. Among opponents of the EU, 91 percent are firm in their choice -- a figure that has increased somewhat over the most recent polls. The proportion of firm noes among those interviewed is clearly bigger than the proportion of firm yeses -- 39 percent against 28 percent. In May the figures were 37-27.
