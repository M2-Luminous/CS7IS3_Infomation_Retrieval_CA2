According to Norrback, late September/early October is the best time. "After the referendum a large amount of legislative work will still be needed. The vote also affects the work on the budget. The Eduskunta will have a great deal of work this fall," Norrback argued. "The adjustment of regional policy and agriculture will also require time. An early date for a vote is therefore vitally important for agriculture and for all the areas where changes are great," Norrback said at a meeting of the executive of the RKP yesterday. Norrback pointed out that we also need time to prepare for the Eduskunta elections in March 1995 if the election campaign is to be able to deal with the important questions the Eduskunta and the government will have to decide in the latter half of the nineties. According to Norrback there is a risk of a confusion of questions that belong to the referendum and questions that belong to the Eduskunta election if they are too close to each other in time -- and this would be to the detriment of both. Norrback warned against rough estimates in the debate on cost and on who it is who benefits from or pays for membership. "There is no room for a permanent increase in costs for the state as a result of membership." According to Norrback, the tight budget line that the state has decided on must hold if the government's economic policy is to be seen as credible. According to Norrback, the cost of the transition to free prices in the food industry, for example, must be seen as an investment in the future. Norrback also warned against excessive promises of support for the regions or of a higher level of income for farmers.
