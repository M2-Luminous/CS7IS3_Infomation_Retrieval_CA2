In his speech at the meeting, Kim Chin-pom, vice-chairman of the Committee for Cultural Relations With Foreign Countries, said that Cuban woman lawyer, the author of the book "Korea I saw Again 40 Years After", impressively wrote what she saw, heard and felt during her revisit to Korea 40 years after she visited Korea as a member of an international fact-finding team during the fatherland liberation war (June 1950- July 1953) and exposed to the world people the bestial atrocities committed by the U.S. imperialist aggressors against the Korean people. He expressed the hope that this book would help the revolutionary people of the world to have a clearer understanding of the validity and invincible vitality of the socialist cause for its rich, truthful and revolutionary contents and for its diversified, concise and vivid method of expression. Candelaria Rodriguez, the author of the book, spoke next. Noting why she wrote the book, she said: "I have come to write this book in order to inform the world people, even a little, of the true looks of Korea which rose like a phoenix from heaps of rubbles and has completely changed its appearance startling the world people under the wise guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. In his speech, Han Pong-chan, deputy director general of the Foreign Press Group, noted that the book in Spanish was translated and published in French, Chinese, English and Russian and disseminated among foreigners. This book, he added, will greatly encourage not only the Korean people in their tireless efforts to defend and further glorify the Korean-style socialism centred on the masses but also the revolutionary people of the world in their righteous struggle.
