Christopher departed Damascus for Cairo yesterday afternoon where he met with President Husni Mubarak and Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. He briefed them on the results of his talks with Syrian and Israeli officials. An Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman told AL-HAYAH that the talks focused primarily on the Syrian-Israeli track, which is receiving the United States' attention to stress that what it is seeking is indeed a comprehensive peace. In Damascus, Christopher held a round of talks with President al-Asad. In a statement to AL-HAYAH U.S. sources expected Secretary Christopher to return to the region at the end of the month to resume his role in conveying ideas between the two sides and bring their views on a peace solution closer, as Israel continues to give precedence to normalization questions, confidence-building measures, and security arrangements over the withdrawal question. While Syria stresses that the peace process begins when Israel is committed to full withdrawal from the Golan. Then it would discuss with Israel the question of equal security arrangements, relations, and other questions. Al-Asad met with Christopher in the presence of Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of the peace process. Presidential spokesman Jubran Kuriyah announced after the meeting, which lasted four hours, that al-Asad had been handed a message from President Bill Clinton, "stressing the U.S. keenness to continue its efforts to achieve a fundamental breakthrough in the peace process. While the Syrian president renewed his demand that Israel withdraw from the occupied Golan Heights to the 4 June [1967] lines." Kuriyah pointed out that al-Asad "expressed his appreciation for U.S. efforts, stressing Syria's keenness to continue the peace process to achieve a just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli dispute in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy and the land for peace principle." He added that "Christopher briefed al-Asad on the results of his talks in Israel which demonstrated that the differences are still wide because the Israeli stand is far from the foundations and requirements of the peace process launched at the Madrid conference" in 1991. The presidential spokesman added that the Syrian president renewed his country's "position on and commitment to the foundations of the peace process based on the Security Council resolutions, which commit Israel to full withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 lines in order to achieve a just and comprehensive solution in the region." Syrian sources have said that when Christopher comes to Damascus carrying "Israel's agreement to full withdrawal to the 4 June borders, he will have brought a key for the launch of a process" toward achieving progress in the peace negotiations. While al-Asad stressed the existence of "wide differences" between Syria and Israel, Israeli radio yesterday spoke about Syria's "flexibility" in its peace stands. [passage omitted]
