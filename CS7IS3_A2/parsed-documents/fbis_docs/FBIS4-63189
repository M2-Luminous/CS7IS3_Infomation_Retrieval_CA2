The satellite was lofted into space atop a heavy-duty three-stage Proton-K booster rocket with a Dm-2 boost section. This is the second Gorizont satellite launched under a contract between Russia and the U.S. Rimsat company (the first one was launched on November 18, 1993). The contract provides for the launching of seven Russian satellites -- three Gorizont ones and four Express ones -- within the period of September 1993 to March 1996. They are put into geostationary orbits with fixed postions over the Pacific Ocean region. The full value of the contgract is 150 million U.S. dollars. The successful launch was watched by Rimsat company representatives, a spokesman at the SDF press centre told ITAR-TASS. The launch was the 210th one since 1967 when a Proton-K booster rocket was used for the first time and the 188th successful one.
