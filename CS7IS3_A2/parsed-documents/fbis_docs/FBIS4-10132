[Begin recording] [Suarez] We have been criticized for not having a strong enough hand, but we have a list of 262 judges and employees assassinated in Colombia. We would not have such a long history of bloodshed if we weren't doing something. The U.S. State Department's remarks are interfering and an attempt to meddle in Colombia's administration of justice. That is why we, just this once, support the prosecutor general's policy. [De Vega] As far as my office is concerned, the report is objective and measured. [end recording] [passage omitted]
