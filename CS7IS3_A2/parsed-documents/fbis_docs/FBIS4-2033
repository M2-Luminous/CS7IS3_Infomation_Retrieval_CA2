During the forum, they discussed the plan for making up deficits and increasing profits and stressed that efforts should be made to emancipate minds; to seize the opportunity; to reinforce the dynamics; to take stopgap and radical measures simultaneously; and to accelerate the handling of the knotty problems of losses with greater boldness and determination. The municipal party committee and the municipal people's government always attach great importance on the work undertaken by the state-owned industrial enterprises to make up their deficits and to increase their profits. Over the past few years, the municipality has scored certain achievements in this regard through the arduous efforts made by various social circles and achieved good progress each year. However, the number of money-losing enterprises is tending toward an increase due to a series of internal and external reasons, which have become knotty problems tolerating no neglect at present. Yuan Zhenguo, manager of the Beibingyang Foodstuffs Company; Lin Shichang, director of the first knitwear mill; Zhang Kean, director of the printing and dyeing mill; Song Borao, director of the chemical briber plant; Qiao Guichen, director of the battery plant; Liu Zhizhan, director of the No.1 plastics plant; Chen Jianguo, director of the No.10 plastics plant; and Guo Zhaoshun, director of the No.2 electric wire and cable factory, spoke at the forum to report their business situation, their reasons for losses, their existing difficulties, and their plans for further switching their losses to profits. Chen Xitong and Li Qiyan earnestly listened to the speeches made by these managers and directors and also joined in the discussion by frequently raising questions. In his speech Li Qiyan said: Boosting the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises represents the work emphasis of the municipality this year and the issue of how to have the money-losing enterprises switch their losses to profits represents the focal point of the work emphasis. The fundamental key to successfully conducting this work lies in emancipating minds and seizing the opportunity. Money-losing enterprises should work out every possible way and means by proceeding from their reality and according to their own conditions and adopt the methods suitable to their own work in this regard. We should note that in the transition from the planned economy to the socialist market one, enterprises will encounter pains -- some of them will survive and some will die out. As for enterprises that are hopeful for switching their losses to profits, we should actively support them and the municipal authorities should actively give a helping hand to the money-losing enterprises that deserve to receive their assistance. Enterprises should enhance their contingent of personnel in charge of scientific research and product sales. Only by successfully conducting technical renovations and overcoming the scientific and technological difficulties can enterprises obtain their vigor. Having the money-losing enterprises switch their losses to profits represents not only an economic matter but also a matter having a bearing on the people's lives and social peace. It is hoped that plant directors should set an example in emancipating minds, conduct more consultations with workers, explore methods, and work out their own way of switching losses to profits and achieving development. In his speech Chen Xitong said: These money-losing enterprises have reflected the large number of contradictions cropping up among industries and the problems cropping up in the economic operation. The appearance of money-losing enterprises is inevitable. However, having too many of them is abnormal because they have a bearing on the people's lives, on maintaining stability, and on having the municipality overfulfill the plan of becoming better-off. Leadership at all levels must attach great importance on the work in this regard and earnestly deal with the problems in the work. "In doing everything in the world, all problems can be revolved through an earnest attitude and the Communist Party mostly stresses earnestness." Only by earnestly grasping the work can the leading personnel of party and government organs at all levels deal with the difficulties encountered by the money-losing enterprises. Chen Xitong said: Although we have dealt with some problems that have caused a large number of state-owned industrial enterprises to lose money, the dynamics used to deal with these problems has not been enough. It is imperative to reinforce the dynamics in this regard and to work out new methods by applying the basis of successful experience gained in this regard. Efforts should be made to put forward practical measures to accelerate the handling of these problems. Building the socialist market economy represents a great opportunity. Through the measures of regulating the markets, enterprises should carry out again the rational allocation of essential factors of production. There are so many ways to remove the difficulties, however, the key to this regard lies in finding out a way by deepening the reform. Chen Xitong pointed out: In encouraging the money-losing enterprises to switch their losses to profits, we must take stopgap and radical measures simultaneously. By no means should we deal with the problems by treating symptoms but not the disease. As for some enterprises that have suffered production suspension or semisuspension at present, we should work out methods for enabling workers to have a job and certain income. This is the practice of dealing with the temporary problems on a long-term basis and of taking radical measures to let enterprises achieve prosperous development. Leadership should make early determination and vigorously readjust the structure of industries, enterprises, and products to emancipate the fettered productive forces. A good job should be done in closing the money-losing enterprises, suspending the production of them, merging their production with others, and transferring their production to others. Efforts should be made to popularize the experience gained by the first light industrial front in conducting comprehensively auxiliary reforms; to accelerate the utilization of foreign capital; to push forward the shareholding system; to make smaller units on the basis of cost accounting; and to enforce integration among technology, industry, and trade. Chen Xitong stressed: In dealing with the problems caused by the money-losing enterprises, we must uphold the emancipation of minds and break away the fetters of idealism and metaphysics. By no means should we divorce from the reality and blame everyone and everything but ourselves. We should boldly face the fierce market competition and foster the lofty aspiration and great ideals of being the boss of our business. In readjusting the structure, we should resolutely overcome the "three bad habits" (overly stressing the famous trade mark, giving priority to the high position occupied by enterprises in the national economy, and being concerned about face-saving); and particularly overcome the fetter of "three ownerships" (such as the state, collective, and individual). We should encourage the enterprises of various industries and trades and under various departments to set up economic associations or to merge their production. Chen Xitong urged leadership at all levels to show greater boldness and determination in having the money-losing enterprises switch their losses to profits. They should vigorously seize the opportunity and accelerate the pace, in addition to not putting off the work by giving up the decisions on enterprises that deserve to be made. By paying great attention to the interests of the state, enterprises, as well as staff members and workers, we should go ahead with the work as long as the targets have been fixed. Various departments, commissions, offices, and bureaus should work out methods for the money-losing enterprises to switch their losses to profits. As for things that cannot be decided by enterprises, they should help enterprises make determinations and do more practical deeds for enterprises. The plant directors and party secretaries of money-losing enterprises should heighten their spirit, boldly face the difficulties, and switch their losses to profits as soon as possible by relying on the masses. Attending the forum were leading personnel from the municipal level organs, including Wang Baosen, Duan Bingren, Li Runwu, and Fan Yuanmou; as well as responsible persons form the relevant commissions, offices, bureaus, and banks.
