The Intas, which was created on the initiative of the European Commission, will contribute up to 21 million ECUs to these 509 projects, each of which associates at least two European laboratories and one laboratory in a former USSR country. The funds will be used primarily to pay CIS researchers. The projects selected concern all scientific fields, from the exact and natural sciences to the applied, social, and economic sciences. The principle of this cooperation is to ensure that laboratories remain in the new CIS states and are able to continue their work. Created in June 1993, the Intas includes the twelve members of the European Union, Austria, Finland, and Switzerland, and the twelve members of the CIS.
