"From our perspective, we hope that situation (with China) will continue as it is, and on the same basis as before," Romulo said, adding: "I am confident that in the long-term, friendly and cordial ties with China will be enhanced further." Romulo stressed the Philippines continues to adhere to a `One-China' policy and clarified that a committee chaired by Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino formed last year was not meant to revise nor reassess the country's "One-China" policy. According to Romulo, the President's orders to the Severino committee does not include a review of the Philippines' `One-China' policy but only focused on studies on a "wholistic" approach regarding the country's relations with China and economic ties with Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. Romulo said President Ramos ordered the formation of the committee after his state visit to China to underscore that country's importance to the Philippines, Asia, and the rest of the world as an emerging superpower and a key economic player in the world market. Romulo stressed that the government did not violate its `One-China' policy because President Ramos' meeting with Li last Wednesday in Subic only focused on trade and investments. "Trade, investments, and economic diplomacy with Taiwan is not in contradiction with the `One-China' policy," Romulo said. The Chinese Embassy, however, stressed the meeting violated the Philippine policy on recognizing only one China. It emphasized that before the Ramos-Li meeting took place, the Chinese Government had repeatedly expressed concern over Li's trips to Southeast Asia. "The incident has greatly hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and sabotaged friendly relations between China and the Philippines. Thus, the Chinese Embassy is instructed to lodge a protest with the Philippine Government." The embassy said it hoped the Philippines would learn a lesson from the recent incident and would prevent similar events from recurring in the future. A DFA [Department of Foreign Affairs] official, however, said that the Chinese Government's protest was "baseless" since the meeting could not be construed as a violation of the Philippines' `One-China' policy. Romulo said that the Chinese Government "may be dismayed but they cannot be surprised" over the Ramos-Li meeting since they have been notified of it beforehand. "We value China in this part of the world so we will not antagonize its government," Romulo added.
