This is a historically memorable sentence of topical significance. At a time when nationalist and neoimperial voices are rising in Russia, it proves Yeltsin to be a courageous man who frankly admitted that Moscow posed a danger for far too long. In spite of such reasonable behavior, however, the leader of the Kremlin and his military officials showed little understanding for the mistrust that still prevails in the close and more distant neighborhood. The Russian leadership reacts more sensitively than ever before to persisting doubts regarding its assurances that it is fully committed to fruitful international cooperation. When the Soviet Union still existed, one of its most powerful leaders in foreign policy made it clear that the West's difficulties in understanding Russia stem from the fact that "we are a nuclear superpower with an inferiority complex." No matter how adequate such descriptions may be, such explanations can easily lead from realpolitik to a wrong psychological path and cause even more misunderstandings. Moscow contributes to this in a way that cannot be fully explained with the after-effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Whereas the relief over the disappearance of imperial burdens and the prospects for a democratic Russia based on the rule of law seemed to outweigh the pain over the fall of the Bolshevik empire that was reminiscent of the czarist realm, Moscow seems to fluctuate between the greater Russian desire to regain international respect as a reawakened superpower as it were and the need to seek closer relations with the West dictated by its economic decline. Thus, the uncertainty that prevails in the world regarding Russia's future course, caused by Russia's inferiority complex and its megalomania, makes Western efforts -- which were once more confirmed by Germany -- to integrate Russia in the European network of relations understandable. It is generally expected that this will curb the country's unpredictability, while at the same time strengthening its self-confidence. However, such endeavors are limited because, despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has continued to be an enormous Eurasian colossus that can only be incorporated into European structures while risking an upsetting of the balance. Thus, Russia's demand for special treatment seems plausible at first sight. However, if one takes a closer look and analyzes Moscow's ideas, as expounded by Yeltsin and his Defense Minister Grachev in Bonn, considerable doubts arise. Russia is not only trying to ensure that its possible participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace is rewarded with the promise for a special role that would be justified to a certain extent in view of the country's status as a nuclear and military power and its ability to defend itself if need be. However, apart from the fears that such preferential treatment would prompt, particularly among the former satellites of the Soviet Union in Central and East Europe, Moscow wants much more. It wants to be consulted prior to all major NATO decisions, and, via a right of veto resulting therefrom, it strives for something like the subordination of the Atlantic alliance under the roof of the CSCE, which would weaken NATO at the expense of an -- inefficient -- collective security system. Since the Russian leadership cannot expect the West to comply with its wishes, the suspicion is not unfounded that, with a deliberate exaggeration, it wants to ensure that other demands are met more easily. These demands include Russia's desire to be recognized by NATO, the CSCE, and the United Nations as a power within the boundaries of the former Soviet Union that influences the world order. In fact, the West is inclined to grant this role to the Russian armed forces in such unstable regions as the Caucasus and Central Asia because of its own lack of readiness to become active there. However, one should not overlook that Russia contributed essentially to the creation of conflict zones, including that in Georgia, in Nagorno Karabakh, over which Armenia and Azerbajan are fighting, and in Tajikistan. Moreover, Moscow's efforts to establish closer political and military ties with the successor states to the Soviet Union, which are now loosely united in the CIS, and to present the whole territory again as a geopolitical unit dominated by the key country of the former empire are also questionable. It does not really suit the West to see Russia as a future partner of whom nobody need be afraid any more. In fact, the West should not do anything to strengthen Russia's deep-seated feeling of offended national pride and of loneliness as a state, which really exists. However, Russia can only free itself from this feeling -- by depriving the neighboring countries of the basis of their mistrust and by conceding priority to inner reforms and not to external greed.
