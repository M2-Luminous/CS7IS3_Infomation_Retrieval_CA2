The Fuzhou police recently decided to further boost the administration of public order for foreign-invested enterprises here in a bid to safeguard the normal running of these enterprises as well as the legitimate rights and interests of investors. There are now some 3 000 foreign-funded enterprises approved for operation here and public security for these enterprises and their running was generally stable. Incidents in breach of the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-funded enterprises, however, such as thefts committed by workers in a handful of foreign-funded enterprises, disruption of enterprises by outsiders, blackmail and extortion as well as fighting are not something new. Adverse effects on these enterprises are therefore the result. The Fuzhou bureau of public security set up a special leading team responsible for public order for foreign-invested enterprises. The team will keep an watchful eye on public security for these enterprises while at the same time working out policies, carrying out inspections and supervision as well as studying the main security problems related to foreign-invested businesses. The bureau has asked the police at various levels to carry out their duty of protecting foreign-funded enterprises. Great attention must be given by the local police regarding various kinds of criminal offences reported by these enterprises and a rapid response and settlement of the problem must be made. In a similar development, Vice Mayor Mr. Gong Xiong has asked the judicial department to actively deal with economic disputes related to foreign-invested enterprises in accordance with the law.
