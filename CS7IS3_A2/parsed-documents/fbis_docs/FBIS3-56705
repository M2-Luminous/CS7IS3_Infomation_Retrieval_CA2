[Topchyan] Is it possible to speak of relations of alliance between Armenia and Russia? [Stupishin] Of course, and this is why. The Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Security between Russia and Armenia was signed back in December 1991. Although it has not for various reasons been ratified, our two states are nonetheless implementing many articles of this treaty in other agreements. In addition, state delegations are functioning highly actively in order to conduct talks between the two countries and to prepare bilateral agreements on specific questions. Further, Russia and Armenia are parties to the Collective Security Treaty concluded among certain CIS member countries. It is a treaty of alliance and provides precisely for alliance commitments. In addition, a treaty has been signed on the status of the Russian troops in Armenia -- Russian troops are stationed in this country, serve here, hold exercises.... This treaty also governs certain parameters of our military cooperation. Finally, in accordance with the Treaty on the Status of the Border Troops, Russian border guards guard the common borders of the CIS in this area along with their Armenian colleagues. [Topchyan] Mr. Ambassador, there is a quite widespread opinion that Russia, which has perfectly explicable geopolitical and strategic interests in the Transcaucasus, relies in its policy in this region on Armenia as its traditional ally. Does Moscow really have priorities in the Transcaucasus? [Stupishin] As a region which for long years was incorporated in the Russian Empire and then in the Soviet Union and as a region inhabited by peoples who have built a joint life over centuries, the Transcaucasus is undoubtedly a sphere of Russia's state interests. I believe that it is not quite accurate simply to say that Russia relies on one republic. Rather, we are relying on new treaty relations. It so happens that Russia was one of the first to start building such relations with Armenia. Owing to the different nature of the regimes which have been established in the Transcaucasus and the different approaches in their attitudes to Russia and the CIS, new relations have been established juridically with other Transcaucasian republics either later or somewhat differently. Quite honestly, your question contains a somewhat frightening expression which can be understood as...: Russia relies on just one country in the Transcaucasus. Does this mean with it against the others? Russia's policy is not quite like that; it is different, in fact. It means with this country, but not against the others. We also seek to organize good-neighborly relations with the others. For Russia has an interest in ensuring that its closest neighbors are able to build their lives under peaceful conditions. The normal development of Russia itself depends on this. The bloody conflicts in various parts of the former USSR damage our economic interests as well as those of others. Russia therefore seeks to help everywhere and to be of service in settling conflicts. [Topchyan] Incidentally, please tell us about Russia's role in settling the Karabakh conflict. [Stupishin] Obviously, in seeking to help find political means to resolve that conflict Russia acts in the role of a go-between. As the experience of the past few months shows, it is precisely these peacemaking efforts and the readiness shown last summer by both Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan to come to the negotiating table that have, in fact, brought the first positive results in the form of a cease-fire. [Topchyan] Many people believe that Russia is interested only in "freezing" the Karabakh conflict -- and not just the Karabakh conflict.... [Stupishin] Russia sets itself no such goal. What does "freezing" mean? A cease-fire -- and everything is postponed indefinitely? Our aim is to bring all conflicts, at least those on the territory of the former Union, to a peaceful political settlement. A genuine settlement implies using a cease-fire as a means of creating favorable conditions for a process of negotiation. [Topchyan] What is the state of Russian-Armenian relations, and what are the prospects? [Stupishin] They can be described very positively. They are developing normally. The existing difficulties are primarily of a technical nature. They are also connected with the fact that we are living through a period of the breakup of the Soviet structure and the building of new relations both within the CIS framework and on a bilateral basis.
