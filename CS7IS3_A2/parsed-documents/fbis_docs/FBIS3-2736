Foreign investors have been lying about their capital investments, falsifying their accounts, over-charging for out-of-date fixed assets and changing the nature of their businesses without official permission. Local authorities in Guangzhou and Shenyang have revoked over 100 licenses, said the Shanghai-based XINMIN EVENING NEWS. Beijing and Taiyuan, capital of the northern Shanxi Province, have also cracked down, according to the GUANGMING DAILY and BEIJING DAILY. Local systems will be established to improve supervision and control of joint-venture financing. And the crackdown will help to protect the legal rights and interest of local Chinese and foreign investors. Many joint ventures exist in name only, according to XINMIN EVENING NEWS. Many investors fail to meet their financial commitments years after being granted business licences, and some leave China without saying goodbye. The administrative crackdown officially takes these companies off the map, the newspaper added. It is hoped that project approval and management loopholes will now be closed, the Shanghai paper said. Licence applications will have to be backed up by company market research. The lure of the fast buck has led many ventures into trouble, said GUANGMING DAILY. The administrative move signals the re-establishment of governmental macro-economic control over Sino-foreign ventures, as the country becomes a global investment hot spot, said the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. There are 174,056 joint ventures and their foreign trade accounted for one third of the country's total imports and exports last year.
