In the transfer of state property it was enough for a bundle of shares in privatized property to be transferred to whoever won the competition to take over the state company, and leave further gradual privatization to developments in the privatized company, he said. The present method of coupon privatization broke up the real owner relationship into too great a number of shareholders, and consequently companies' dependency on the results of economic management was lost. New Slovakia is against the privatization of strategic industrial branches, such as energy, gas and telecommunications. "The government has to retain control over these basic means of influencing the country's economy," he explained. The movement wants to stimulate the successful transformation of the Slovak economy by changes in tax policy and tax law. These should provide foreign capital with suitable conditions. New Slovakia representatives said they had already been negotiating resources from unspecified countries in the Far East and Western Europe. Changes in tax policy would stimulate saving and investment, they said. This could be achieved by abolishing savings taxes, taxing only that part of incomes which was spent and tax relief on investment in machinery and equipment. Turning to the Czech Republic, the movement's economic expert Jaroslav Zapletal said that if the insolvency of state companies was included in the state budget, as was normal in Western European economies, the Czech budget would have had a deficit of 60 million crowns (2 million USD) last year. "The economic results of the Czech Republic are good, but they are camouflaged," Zapletal said. In the Czech and Slovak Republics the insolvency of state companies was not funded from the state budget, but the money had to come from the pockets of their suppliers, he added. This was confirmed by inflation in the Czech Republic. "There can be no inflation with a surplus of four million crowns; if anything it causes deflation," he said. Mosny said the success of economic reform in the Czech Republic was the result of successful propaganda. The economic results of companies privatized by the coupon method were worse than before the 1989 revolution, he claimed.
