According to the Sichuan Rural Labor Management Department, Sichuan has 5 million migrant laborers all over the country and last year the income from labor services in Sichuan reached about 10 billion yuan. An official of the department said that the number of self-employed households and private enterprises totals more than 1.6 million. About 10 percent of the bosses of these businesses are former migrant laborers. In recent years, many of the migrant laborers applied their experience and technology gained from their labor services in other provinces, even in foreign countries, to economic development in their home villages. They opened their own businesses and served as "managers", "directors" and even "chairmen of the board of directors". Ma Zhizhen, director of a cement packaging factory in Pengshan County, was once a baby-sitter in Chengdu city. She collected all her savings from her work and set up her factory in the early 1990s. With the rapid growth of the profits and fixed assets of her factory, in 1992, she jointly set up a rubber products company with a Hong Kong investment firm and hired over 200 laborers in her village. Last year, the profits and taxes of Ma's new factory reached more than 2 million yuan. In Tiangong Township of Langzhong city in northern Sichuan, a forest park was recently set up along the dike of the Jialing River by a young farmer named Zhao Xiaorong. The 28-year-old Zhao collected more than 1.2 million yuan for the project, which also has holiday accommodations. Now the park has opened to the public with swimming pools, entertainment facilities, traditional-style tea rooms and a tavern. Zhao worked in Shenzhen city for a decade before 1992. "The migrant labor brought me opportunities to make money and gain skill in management," he said. In Guang'an County, Liu Yanlin, a 29-year-old millionaire, built his fortune from being a migrant laborer in Shenzhen and Henan in the past decade. He now manages Chuanhui Hotel in Huizhou city, Guangdong Province, and his annual taxes to the state exceed 100,000 yuan. He has donated more than 1 million yuan to the primary and middle schools in his hometown.
