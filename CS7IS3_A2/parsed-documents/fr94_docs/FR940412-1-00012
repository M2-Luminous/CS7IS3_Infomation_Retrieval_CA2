FR940412-1-00012 FR940412-1-00003 Current maintenance inspection provisions do not allow for thorough viewing of the wing structure. With this in mind, Univair issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 29, dated January 27, 1994, which specifies procedures for (1) installing inspection openings in the outer wing panels, and (2) inspecting the outer wing panels for evidence of corrosion. After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above including the referenced service information, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to prevent wing structural damage that, if not detected and corrected, could progress to the point of failure. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Univair Models Ercoupe 415&hyph;C, 415&hyph;CD, 415&hyph;D, 415&hyph;E, and 415&hyph;G, Forney F&hyph;1 and F&hyph;1A, Alon A&hyph;2 and A&hyph;2A, and Mooney M10 airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require installing inspection openings in the outer wing panels, inspecting (one-time) the wing outer panel structure for corrosion, and repairing any corrosion found. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Univair SB No. 29, dated January 27, 1994. The inspection will become part of the affected airplanes' annual maintenance inspection program. The compliance time for the proposed AD is presented in calendar time instead of hours time-in-service (TIS). The FAA has determined that a calendar time for compliance is the most desirable method because the unsafe condition described by the proposed AD is caused by corrosion. Corrosion can occur on airplanes regardless of whether the airplane is in service or in storage. Therefore, to ensure that corrosion is detected and corrected on all airplanes within a reasonable period of time without inadvertently grounding any airplanes, a compliance schedule based upon calendar time instead of hours TIS is utilized. The FAA estimates that 2,672 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 8 workhours (maximum) per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $67 (maximum) per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,354,704. This figure is based on the assumption that no affected airplane owner/operator has accomplished the proposed action. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption `` ADDRESSES ''. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new AD: Univair Aircraft Corporation: Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;05&hyph;AD. Applicability: Models Ercoupe 415&hyph;C, 415&hyph;CD, 415&hyph;D, 415&hyph;E, and 415&hyph;G, Forney F&hyph;1 and F&hyph;1A, Alon A&hyph;2 and A&hyph;2A, and Mooney M10 airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any category. Compliance: Required within the next 12 calendar months after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished. To prevent wing structural damage that, if not detected and corrected, could progress to the point of failure, accomplish the following: (a) Install inspection openings in the outer wing panels and inspect the wing outer panel internal structural components for corrosion in accordance with the PROCEDURE section of Univair Service Bulletin No. 29, dated January 27, 1994. Prior to further flight, repair any corrosion in accordance with instructions contained in the above-referenced service information. (b) Send the results of the inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD to the Manager, Denver Aircraft Certification Field Office, 5440 Roslyn Street, suite 133, Denver, Colorado 80216. State whether corrosion was found, the location and extent of any corrosion found, and the total hours TIS of the component at the time the corrosion was found. (Reporting approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB no. 2120&hyph;056.) (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with 14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an equivalent level of safety may be approved by the Manager, Denver Aircraft Certification Field Office, 5440 Roslyn Street, suite 133, Denver, Colorado 80216. The request shall be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Denver Aircraft Certification Field Office. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Denver Aircraft Certification Field Office. (e) All persons affected by this directive may obtain copies of the document referred to herein upon request to the Univair Aircraft Corporation, 2500 Himalaya Road, Aurora, Colorado 80011; or may examine this document at the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Issued in Kansas City, Missouri, on April 6, 1994. Larry D. Malir, Acting Manager, Small Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
