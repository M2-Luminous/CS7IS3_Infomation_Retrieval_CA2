AL-JUMHURIYAH advises the Arab negotiator to rearrange his cards, priorities, and stances, noting that there is no time for sorrow or he will lose his mind. The paper adds that the Palestinian negotiator must benefit from conditions around him and from the repercussions of events in the occupied territories, where the Palestinian people are enduring a great historic ordeal. The paper writes that the massacre proved to the world that the Israeli expansionist settlements constitute a security threat to the Palestinian people, a threat that should be eliminated. The massacre also showed the world that the continuing Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories will mean unceasing massacres day and night, since confrontations between the Israeli army and the unarmed people do not stop. AL-JUMHURIYAH adds that the world has discovered that peace is indivisible; it either involves all the parties or none. The world has also discovered that negotiations will remain the only approach to a balanced peace. AL-AKHBAR regrets that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre finds someone at the UN Security Council to protect the culprits and try to obstruct any resolution that condemns Israel and demands serious protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories to avoid a recurrence of the barbaric massacre. The paper is surprised that the world, which condemned the massacre, is turning a blind eye to the massacres occurring daily in the West Bank and Gaza for years. It notes that Israel has given its soldiers the freedom to practice the hobby of hunting children and women with their automatic rifles. It wonders about the difference between the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the massacres that have continued since the intifadah started in the occupied territories. True, the Hebron massacre was committed by a deranged Israeli officer, as they say, and finished off by the Israeli army to avert any Palestinian reaction. But the unceasing daily massacres against the Palestinian people lead to the same result of shedding and depleting Arab blood, the paper says. AL-AKHBAR adds: If the members of the Israeli Government are truly sincere in their sorrow over the victims of the massacre, they would have prevented their soldiers from committing daily massacres in the occupied territories. AL-AHRAM contends that the limited, cosmetic measures taken by Israel will not absorb the Arab, Islamic, and world rage over the horrific massacre that occurred in the Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn last Friday. The paper believes that the world needs to know whether Israel really wants peace with the Arabs and Palestinians or merely wants to wear the mask of peace and pursue the policy of hegemony behind it. AL-AHRAM says the logic of peace is clear and its course is straightforward. This makes it incumbent on Israel to adopt actual measures, pledge to disarm settlers, ban the activity of extremist Jewish organizations, and dismantle the Qiryat Arba' settlement, from which the Jewish butcher who committed the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre came, it stresses. The paper concludes by saying that real peace begins by truly believing in a mutual and equal security, not by believing in one side's security at the expense of the others' lives.
