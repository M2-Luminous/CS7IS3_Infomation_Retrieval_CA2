It asked for new possibilities for their education, because the number of the Albanians enrolled in schools in Macedonia is small. The juridical commission of this party is working to prepare a draft law for the creation of private higher schools to be presented to the Macedonian parliament. There is hope that this parliament may help solve the problem of education in the Albanian language in Macedonia.
