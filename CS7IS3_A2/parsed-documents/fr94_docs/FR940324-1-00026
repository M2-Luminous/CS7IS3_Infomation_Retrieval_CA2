FR940324-1-00026 FR940324-1-00007 12. Disposition of E-Mail Records E-mail records may not be deleted or otherwise disposed of without prior disposition authority from NARA (44 U.S.C. 3303a). This applies to all versions of E-mail records, including the original record that is on the E-mail system and all copies that have been forwarded to a recordkeeping system. NARA authorizes records disposition through two mechanisms; issuance of the General Records Schedules developed by NARA for temporary records common to most or all Federal agencies, and approval of schedules developed by agencies for records unique to the agency. The authorization process employed by NARA involves appraisal, which is the determination of the historical or other value of the records including the most appropriate format for future use when the same information is captured in records on different physical formats. Electronic records must be scheduled even if the same information is available in another medium, including paper printouts of electronically stored records. Information in electronic records may have greater research utility than similar information stored on another medium because it is easier to access and manipulate. Also, it may be more efficient to capture transmission and receipt data in electronic systems. Thus, the disposition of electronic records may differ from the disposition of paper records with the same information. The disposition of all records, regardless of medium (paper, magnetic, microform, etc.) must be in accordance with an approved schedule. A. Records on the E-Mail System If an agency has an E-mail system that is designed for or is adaptable for use as an agency recordkeeping system as well as a communications system, users must be instructed on the required steps to be taken to ensure that the record on the user's screen or in his or her mailbox is forwarded to the recordkeeping feature of the system. If, on the other hand, an agency has an E-mail system that cannot also serve as a recordkeeping system, users should be instructed to forward all records from the E-mail system to an appropriate recordkeeping system to ensure that the records are preserved and the E-mail system continues to operate efficiently. When the necessary steps have been taken to preserve the record by using the recordkeeping feature or by forwarding it to an appropriate recordkeeping system, the identical version that remains on the user's screen or in the user's mailbox has no continuing value to the agency or for future research. Therefore, NARA considers the version of the record on the ``live'' E-mail system appropriate for deletion after it has been preserved on a recordkeeping system along with all appropriate transmission data. NARA will revise General Records Schedule 23 to authorize deletion of the copy of the record on the ``live'' E-mail system after the necessary preservation steps have been taken. This general authorization will apply only to the E-mail record on the ``live'' E-mail system. There is no formal authorization at this time for agencies to delete E-mail records from the E-mail system if they are stored only on the system itself or if they have been transferred to an electronic recordkeeping system. The revised General Records Schedule will extend the authorization to these categories of records. B. Records in Recordkeeping Systems Because E-mail records must be maintained for varying retention periods and, when appraised as permanent, transferred to NARA, it is not appropriate for NARA to issue a General Records Schedule that pertains to all E-mail records in recordkeeping systems. Consequently, those E-mail records that have been incorporated into a recordkeeping system that includes records from other sources or systems must be managed in accordance with the records schedule of the recordkeeping system in which they are filed. Alternatively, those E-mail records that are maintained as a separate system must be separately scheduled. Agencies must develop and submit to NARA schedules that identify the categories of E-mail records in their systems if they are maintained separately so that NARA can appraise the records and provide appropriate disposition authority. As indicated previously, it is established NARA policy that agencies that maintain records in paper and electronic formats must receive the approval of NARA before disposing of either format. This will ensure that future use considerations enter into determinations of the most appropriate format for the preservation of permanent records. 13. Security of E-Mail Records Agencies must take adequate measures to protect records in E-mail systems (36 CFR 1234.26). Security measures must protect E-mail records from unauthorized alterations or deletions. Agencies should regularly back up messages stored on-line to off-line media to guard against system failures or inadvertent erasures. 14. Training Employees Agencies must ensure that all employees are familiar with the legal requirements for creation, maintenance, and disposition of records on E-mail systems. The agency's directives must provide sufficient guidance so that agency personnel are familiar with the agency's specific recordkeeping requirements and can distinguish between records and nonrecord materials on E-mail systems (36 CFR 1222.30). Because Federal records may be created using an E-mail system, each agency using an E-mail system should provide records management training and guidance for all employees which includes criteria for determining which E-mail messages are records. As indicated above, it may be useful for agencies to have designed into their E-mail systems a feature that helps users to identify Federal records.
