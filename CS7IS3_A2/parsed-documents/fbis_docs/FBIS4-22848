P. Vorobyev, M. A. Dedunovich; UDC 621.396.967] [Abstract]Techniques are described for analyzing and designing solid-state active devices within a systems approach. Some engineering solutions are examined, as well as attainable parameters for modern Hanna diode generators and frequency generators in the shortwave portion of the millimeter range (_l_ = 2 mm). It was found that the field of solid-state active devices of extremely high frequencies is a broad one because the devices are small in size, and require little energy. In particular this applies to their use for radar stations. 1 figure and 5 references.
