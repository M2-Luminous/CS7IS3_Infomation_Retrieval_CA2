Over the past few days the editorial offices have been inundated with rumors of an energy ration increase. Armenergo chief controller Mr. Martirosyan told a RESPUBLIKA ARMENIA correspondent absolutely officially that the limit on electric power supplied to the capital city residents remains two hours. To the question as to whether an increase in the power supply is expected in the near future, he offered no comment--either positive or negative. Although we have to admit that this would be of little help to those who do not get even the allotted two hours a day.
