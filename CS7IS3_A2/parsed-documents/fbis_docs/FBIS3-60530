[Pokrovskiy] We have a system of mass compulsory testing. Zealous medical personnel send to the laboratories everyone who does and does not need it, with no account taken of human rights or of the material cost. There should be a different approach to this problem. [Dianova] How many people are infected with the HIV virus in Russia at the moment? [Pokrovskiy] Six hundred and ninety-two. As a comparison, there were 652 recorded in May. Some people (not least some journalists) are unimpressed by this figure. And there are voices claiming that the AIDS problem in our country is imaginary or exaggerated. But the situation in the United States 20 years ago was exactly the same! If we do not want to catch up with America in terms of these sad statistics we need to raise the AIDS issue to the level of state policy. And this presupposes the creation of a national AIDS committee, the adoption of a Russian law on AIDS, and the instilling of order in the structure of organizations called upon to combat the HIV infection.
