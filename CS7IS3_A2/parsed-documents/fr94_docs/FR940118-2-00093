FR940118-2-00093 FR940118-2-00057 [Docket No. 50&hyph;333] Power Authority of the State of New York; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;59 issued to the Power Authority of the State of New York (the licensee) for operation of the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant located in Oswego County, New York. The proposed amendment would add Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) and Surveillance Requirements to Tables 3.12.1, ``Water Spray/Sprinkler Protected Areas'', and 4.12.1, ``Water Spray/Sprinkler System Tests'' and clarify the associated Bases to reflect the installation of a new full area fire suppression system in the east and west cable tunnels. This new full area fire suppression system was installed because the previous sprinkler system did not provide coverage to some cable trays and the sprinkler head orientation did not provide full coverage of the cable trays where it was installed. The proposed amendment would also correct other portions of Tables 3.12.1 and 4.12.1 for consistency with changes made to reflect the east and west cable tunnel modification. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes revise the Technical Specifications to incorporate a modification to the James A. FitzPatrick Fire Protection System and to make existing Technical Specifications consistent with the specifications proposed for the modification. The modification will improve the ability of the plant's fire protection system to detect and suppress fires. The modified system has been designed, analyzed and constructed in accordance with fire protection system requirements. These changes to the Technical Specifications assure that the modified system is operable by periodic surveillance and that required actions are taken if it is not available. The surveillance requirements meet or exceed past requirements. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. The only potential for a new or different type of accident arises from different failure mechanisms of the system. An analysis of flooding has demonstrated that there are no associated failures of shutdown equipment. The new system has been designed and constructed so that there is no damage to safety related equipment due to missiles or water spray. The modification to the first protection system provides additional protection for possible fires in the east and west cable tunnels through increased spray coverage. There are no changes to plant operations or operating procedures other than Surveillance Requirements. The Surveillance Requirements are consistent with past plant practices and industry codes and standards. 3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The piping has been designed and constructed to prevent damage to safety related equipment due to missiles or water spray during a seismic event. The modification improves the plant's capability to detect and suppress fires. The potential for flooding or water damage has been evaluated and does not result in failure of shutdown equipment. The LCO and Surveillance Requirements meet or exceed past practice. This change results in no reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
