At these ceremonies, self-flagellation by mourning groups and participants and chanting of lamentations were carried out. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani addressed the gathering, elaborating on the dimensions of the thinking, and the political characteristics of Imam Khomeyni, may God be pleased with him. He referred to his social impact in the renaissance of Islam. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani alluded to the jurisprudential, spiritual, moral, ethical, and inspirational aspects of the thinking of Imam Khomeyni--may his soul be sanctified--and deemed his existence a divine bounty and stressed: The Imam's inspiration was the quintessence of these qualities. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: The Islamic Revolution of Iran led by Imam Khomeyni--may God be pleased with him--in the course of the history of Islam was unprecedented after the esteemed Prophet of Islam, may God's peace and blessings be upon him and his scion, in such a manner that it can be described as a miracle. He stressed: Imam Khomeyni, may God's blessings be upon him, made an appropriate decision regarding the selection of the next leader by playing the best role at this juncture in history. If today we are able to ward off spewing venom, mischiefmongering, discord, and the destructive activities of the enemy, it is because we are treading the path of the revolution blazed by the imam behind the leader of the revolution without the slightest hesitation, and it is entirely due to the apt management of Ayatollah Khamene'i. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani continued: Five years ago, at this same time, we were apprehensive about the future of the revolution. However, our trepidation was eliminated by the imam's guidance and with the allusions and clear indications by the imam regarding the future; the situation became completely obvious in this regard. He explained: The imam propounded the issue of leadership in such a manner that it would be safe from the treachery of the enemies who were constantly awaiting an opportunity to settle scores and to capitalize on the vacuum in the leadership. Therefore, he did not announce any individual choice openly. However, we found our path in the light of the imam's wishes and the Assembly of Experts--after these allusions evolved into a definite form--was able to make a suitable decision about the future leadership. The president emphasized: During the course of the Islamic Revolution, we have perceived divine succor and bounties and the God of our imam did not stint in showering His kindness and blessings on the Islamic ummah. Following the demise of the imam, the multifaceted and comprehensive expediency and management continued to resolve the problems of the revolution in such a manner that it went on treading its path. The fear that had weighed on the hearts of the ever-present-on-the-scene ummah metamorphosed into confidence, trust, and self-reliance and we continued on the imam's path. In another part of his speech, President Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed his gratitude to Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Seyyed Ahmad Khomeyni, the esteemed remembrance of the imam, for his services during the struggle period, and in the aftermath of the revolution and he also thanked the household of the imam. At the conclusion of his remarks, the president said that if today we are able to continue down our path behind the rightful successor of the imam -- who is the best person imaginable to shoulder this responsibility, to reconstruct the country, and to insist on the aspirations of the imam -- it is entirely due to the guidance and foresight of our dear imam.
