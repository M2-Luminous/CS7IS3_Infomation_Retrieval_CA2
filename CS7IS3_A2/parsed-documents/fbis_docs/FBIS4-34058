The same procedure was used some months before to demand Brazilian action against Canada, which was allegedly harming Argentine wheat exports to Brazil. Argentine Ambassador Alieto Guadagni yesterday confirmed to this newspaper that his government sent a note to Brazil on the basis of Resolution No. 3/92 of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] Council, which allows a signatory country to ask another signatory country to begin an investigation if it feels harmed by unfair commercial practices by third countries. In the case of wheat, the Brazilian Government agreed with the Argentine Government, which asked for an investigation into Canada's alleged "dumping" practice. Brazil is still investigating Canada. Concerning malt, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism reported that the government has not yet adopted a position, because the Argentine request is still recent. Official sources, however, have said that it is necessary to decide what to do with Mercosur legislation, because if a case begins on the basis of the Treaty of Asuncion, it will have to conform to Mercosur laws. At least two Mercosur members -- Brazil and Argentina -- import subsidized EU products. Argentina imports subsidized pork from Denmark and powdered milk from the Netherlands, Brazilian sources have said. In the case of malt, Argentina has complained that Brazil, its main market -- Brazil buys 90 of Argentine malt exports -- has increased its malt purchases from France and Belgium, which are Europe's main producers. It has been reported that Argentina sold Brazil 94,000 tons of malt in 1991, while the EU exported 200,000 tons. Last year, Argentina sold 55,000 tons on the Brazilian market. Brazil consumes 600,000 tons of malt, of which 200,000 are produced locally. The Argentine Government claims that if no subsidies were being paid on malt, the EU product would be sold in Brazil for $480, instead of $260, per ton. "There is an 85 percent reduction in the European price because of a $201 subsidy per ton of malt," an Argentine entrepreneurial source explained. The average price of the Argentine product in 1992 was $300 per ton. According to the EU delegation in Brasilia, the standard or domestic price for the harvesting period that will be over at the end of this month is $150 per ton. If the international price stands below this ceiling, the EU producer is entitled to compensation. The Argentine Government has estimated a potential loss of $70 million for its malt sector. The Pampa Malt Plant, which is a partnership between Brahma and an Argentine group -- headquartered in Buenos Aires Province -- has reportedly reduced its production because of Brazilian imports from the EU.
