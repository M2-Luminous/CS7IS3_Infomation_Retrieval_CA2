An Eskom statement said chief executive Mr Allen Morgan on Friday [1 April] informed the Goldstone Commission and the South African Police [SAP] about the matter. "The deal was cancelled before delivery took place, when it was discovered that the dealer intended to sell the weapons within South Africa," said the statement. The transaction, it said, was to have taken place in terms of an export permit issued by the SAP according to the arms and ammunition act. "The transaction was cancelled by senior management when it became clear that the weapons were destined for a customer within South Africa, in this case the kwaZulu Police." The statement said the weapons were originally acquired by Eskom in terms of its obligations under the national key points act. "The act has subsequently been relaxed and surplus weapons were being disposed of," he said. Eskom added that an internal investigation would be conducted into the circumstances surrounding the transaction, in collaboration with the Goldstone Commission and the SAP. Assisting them will be forensic auditors from the firm, KPMG-Aitken and Peat. "Members of the Eskom protection services involved in the transaction have requested to be relieved of their duties pending further investigations." Eskom added that an audit at its main armoury at Megawatt Park showed all automatic rifles had been accounted for, and that country-wide audits were continuing.
