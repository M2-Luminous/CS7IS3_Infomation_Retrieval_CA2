Energy Impacts The energy benefits of the renewable oxygenate program depend on the oxygenates used and the production processes used to produce them, which can vary depending on the timeframe of interest. As described above, in the early years of the program the renewable oxygenate requirement is expected to be met primarily with ethanol blended into winter RFG. For at least the first two years, this ethanol would be produced in existing plants or new plants equipped with current technology. Some diversion of ethanol currently being blended into conventional gasoline may also occur. Small additional quantities of ETBE may be used in summer RFG and ethanol use in summer RFG may decrease, but these shifts and their energy impacts will be very small relative to the effects of the increase in wintertime ethanol use. According to a study prepared by the Department of Energy, 24 if the 30 percent renewables requirement is met by blending ethanol produced from new ethanol plants and ethanol plant expansions (as opposed to ethanol produced in existing facilities and displaced from its current markets) into winter RFG, the overall fossil energy consumed in RFG production and use would be 0.7 percent lower than would be the case if MTBE produced from natural gas were the only oxygenate used in RFG. This estimate by DOE was reduced to as low as 0.5 percent when more conservative energy input assumptions were incorporated into their calculational methodology, and was increased to as high as 0.9% when energy input assumptions from USDA were incorporated. The even greater reduction in natural gas use would be partially offset by a 2.0 percent increase in crude oil use. It should be noted that even with this increase in crude oil use, the total amount of crude oil used to produce RFG under today's rule would still be 8.6 percent lower than if conventional gasoline were produced instead. 24 ``Analysis Memorandum: Energy Requirements and CO2-Equivalent Emissions of RFG,'' prepared by Margaret Singh, Argonne National Laboratory, for Barry McNutt, U.S. Department of Energy, June 6, 1994. DOE projected that as ETBE capacity becomes available, its use in summer RFG would reduce fossil energy use by 1.7 percent relative to MTBE used in summer RFG. The DOE study indicates that if ETBE is blended into VOC-controlled RFG to meet the 30 percent requirement in the summer, and ethanol is still used to meet the requirement during the winter, the fossil energy benefits of the program being promulgated today program would be approximately 0.6 percent (0.4 to 0.8 using the range of input assumptions evaluated in their final report) lower than would be the case if MTBE produced from natural gas were the only oxygenate used in RFG. The energy benefits of this program are expected to become more pronounced in later years. Improvements in the energy efficiency of ethanol production will further reduce the fossil energy required to produce ethanol. Further gains can be achieved by reducing energy consumption in corn farming through changes in farming practices, using more energy-efficient equipment, increasing per-acre crop yields, and decreasing fertilizer use. Comments submitted by USDA and others, as well as previous studies by DOE and EPA cited in the proposal, indicate that as new feedstocks for ethanol such as cellulose are commercialized, and as renewable methanol production becomes viable, the fossil energy benefits of this program would increase substantially relative to nonrenewable MTBE use. Using current estimates of the energy inputs relative to the energy outputs for ethanol from cellulose (approximately 1:5), the fossil energy benefits of the program being promulgated today program would increase to approximately 1.3 percent relative to the case if MTBE produced from natural gas were the only oxygenate used in RFG. By providing a secure market for renewable oxygenates, today's program will help provide the certainty needed to encourage private investments in modern, high-efficiency renewable oxygenate production technology.
