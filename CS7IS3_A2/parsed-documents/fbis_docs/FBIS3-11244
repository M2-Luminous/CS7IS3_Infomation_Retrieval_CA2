No one can deny the atmosphere of calm surrounding the elections. We must cite the absolute freedom, without coercion or pressure of any sort, the voters enjoyed as they exercised their sacred right and duty of voting. We must also admit there are certain aspects that are outside human control; in this regard, we must admit at certain polling stations the opening of the elections was delayed for a few minutes due to difficulties stemming from the election of station presidents and secretaries at 0600, as required by law. Such stations are comprised of representatives of all political parties participating in the elections. Moreover, we must admit some citizens who had voter registration cards did not appear on the voter registration list. This will be noted, and, as the TSE, we will adopt corrective measures. After the last municipal council election in [word indistinct] in 1991 a company specializing in polls conducted one indicating 10 percent of 1 percent--that is, a tenth of 1 percent--of the voters claimed to have been left off the voter registration list; thus, we will be able to determine this figure after the elections. We will be able to quantify this. We want to underscore a very important aspect regarding compliance with Electoral Code provisions. I will read Article 230, Paragraph Two. It reads: Fifteen days prior to the elections and until the results of it are definitely declared, no political parties or coalitions, individuals or corporations, associations or organizations of any nature may publish or disseminate, via any medium, results of polls or projections on candidates, political parties, or contending coalitions that might indicate the trend of possible electoral results. Failure to abide by this will be punished in keeping with Article 290 of the Electoral Code, which states: Violation of the provisions of Article 230 of this code will result in the levying of fines between 10,000 and 50,000 colones on the violators. This is the legal situation. The TSE will enforce these provisions, and thus, we warn all media to abstain from making these kinds of publications banned by the code; in fact, this is not only banned by the code. The candidates and political party representatives have signed a document before the president of the Republic, UN Observers for El Salvador, and the TSE. Part of it states the following: We will abstain from reporting on the results of the elections until the TSE issues the corresponding reports. Now that this has been clarified, we warn the media may not report anything banned by law; thus, the Salvadoran people are duly informed of the aspects we have cited. We also want to note that, according to the same pact the political parties have signed, the closing of the elections will occur after every voter waiting to cast his vote has done so. This is of what this tribunal wished to inform you to avoid regrettable incidents later.
