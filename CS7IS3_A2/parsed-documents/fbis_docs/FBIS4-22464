Topical problems of social development in Russia following the formation of a new government and the start of work of the Federal Assembly were examined. Yuriy Georgiyevich Aleksandrov, doctor of economic sciences, Academician Aleksey Mikhaylovich Yemelyanov, member of the State Duma, Aleksey Vasilyevich Kiva, doctor of historical sciences and political scientist and current affairs writer, and Viktor Leonidovich Sheynis, doctor of economic sciences and member of the State Duma, took part in the debate. The meeting of the club was anchored by Leonid Petrovich Kravchenko, first deputy chief editor of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. Let Us Clarify the Situation L. KRAVCHENKO. Esteemed colleagues! We are today holding the latest meeting of our political debating club. On the last occasion, as you will recall, we examined the situation that had taken shape in Russia following the tragic October events, the Federal Assembly elections, and the adoption at the referendum of the new Constitution of the Russian Federation. We concluded at that time that the polarization of political forces in society had intensified. Against the background of the intensifying socioeconomic crisis in the country there has been a loss of confidence among various strata of society in the policy of economic reforms that has been pursued. This was reflected also in the election results, when many seats were unexpectedly won by representatives of the opposition forces. Unfortunately, the decline in production continues. The rate of inflation and the price rises remain high. Threats of mass strikes have arisen once more. Certain forces interested in a destabilization of the situation are spreading rumors concerning a possible coup d'etat and the removal of the president from office. What opportunities do there continue to be under these conditions for accord and civil peace, for which, incidentally, both the president and the State Duma are calling? It is this question that I would like to present for discussion. A. KIVA. I will express certain general points, which, it seems to me, elucidate more broadly the situation in which we find ourselves. First. I believe that the postcommunist development of our society is, generally, proceeding in normal fashion. The failure of the democrats at the elections was entirely logical following two years of difficult reforms. Nor does the figure of Zhirinovskiy represent anything out of the ordinary, although for Russia extreme nationalism or neofascism are unusual, of course. The president has changed in some respects. The events of recent months, the October events particularly, have made their mark and have turned him in the direction of greater consideration and an inclination toward compromise and agreements. I would say that the government is different also. It is more independent, more sure of itself than before. In other words, an evolution, an on-going movement, is under way. Second. It seems to me that the democrats already have something to lose. For this reason they should be not only members of the avant-garde, not only revolutionaries, but also custodians. There is a constitution, a democratic constitution. A line has been drawn beneath our Soviet past. Forever, I believe. And when we hear some facile opinions to the effect that we have only chaos, only failures, this is to me simply incomprehensible, therefore. Third. I am convinced that the economic reforms still require appreciable correction. And if some people have yet to recognize that the former system of our financial stabilization is not working and that there is a very great danger of economic collapse and the disintegration of the social sphere, a danger of social explosion, this is distressing. Fourth. I do not doubt that the democrats also are at an impasse. Primarily Russia's Choice and its leaders. They simply cannot, in my view, recover, simply cannot get their bearings in the new situation, cannot understand realities as they are. Nor can they accept, in the full meaning of the word, the rules of the political game according to the laws of democracy. Fifth and finally. An active regrouping of political forces is under way in the Duma, in my view. It is complete [as published], I believe, but a very strong tilt toward the center may be observed. A regrouping of political forces outside of the Duma is taking place also, evidently. And the strategic question is this: What alternative awaits us in the immediate future--left or right? It seems to me that liberalism is departing from the political front stage. It will very shortly be departing from the economy also. I foresee opening up historically as a replacement for liberalism most likely an alternative course to that which has been realized in Poland or in Lithuania, that is, social democratic. And the state, which in the past took shape as a civil society, will be required to endeavor to assume social patronage. It should be considered, however, that with us people, particularly of the older generation, will accept a policy which aims at social protection of the populace. If such a policy is implemented, the chances of accord in our society will be enhanced. Between Scylla and Charybdis V. SHEYNIS. The main question concerns the vector of Russia's historical development. There is with us a real danger of us becoming enmeshed in bloody chaos. I am talking about a difficult transitional period, which began several years ago and which will hardly end any time soon. And there is no more important task currently than averting this bloody chaos, lawlessness, and disintegration of the state. It is essential for this, of course, to undertake a whole number of positive actions. Aleksey Vasilyevich Kiva said that Russia is completing the transition to postcommunism. I believe that this is correct, but I would posit an even broader historical framework. We are completing the transition from historical underdevelopment, which is typical decidedly of all countries, other than the pioneers--the West European countries--to a developed modern society. For some time now I have, what is more, been deliberately avoiding such concepts as socialism and capitalism, which, in my opinion, are capable more of blurring the heart of the matter than elucidating it. And so in attempting to reveal the distinctive aspects of Russia's transition I would highlight four essential points. First, as distinct from China and as distinct from the countries of Latin America and Southeast Asia, we are switching not from an undeveloped market to a market economy but from an entirely antimarket system, a virtually ideal model of the distributive-state economy. Second, as distinct from, say, the East European countries, we are having to create from scratch institutions of the civil society. It was sufficient to pull down the Berlin Wall, it was sufficient to remove the threat of Soviet troops' invasion of the East European countries, for all the institutions of the civil society, which they had had formerly, to grow there instantly. Third, the superpower complex. This is a distinction from many other countries. And this complex had entirely material outlines also, what is more, namely: a warped economy, an economy with a tremendous preponderance of military production, an economy with plant-cities, which it is very difficult to escape and which we cannot simply up and reform in a comparatively short space of time. Fourth. Transition requires political stability. This we do not have, unfortunately. There are, generally speaking, two basic ways to achieve stability: either the decisive victory of one side or the achievement of accord among the main antagonistic forces. That is, a social compact--formal or informal--but observed by the opposite sides. In the last parliament I took part in the formation of a faction which called itself Accord for Progress. And although we cannot boast of any appreciable political achievements, I believe that the faction and its program, expressed in its name, had nothing to be ashamed of. It pursued a policy which, perhaps, could not have been realized in that specific situation but which sowed good seeds. A particular feature of the situation today is that both sides into which society is divided are oriented toward victory. But this orientation is increasingly assuming the cover of accord. That is, the idea of compromise, the idea of the achievement of some degree of accord, is present and is being proclaimed. The only trouble is that we write one thing and hold on in our minds to something else. Everyone is preparing for the main political event in Russia of the latter half of the 1990's, namely, the presidential elections. In this connection, one further essential point. In the new constitution the role of parliament has, unfortunately, been reduced. Structures of the executive headed by the president are coming to the fore. What kind of Russia will enter the 21st century and whether it can successfully overcome all the dangers of the transitional period will depend, therefore, on who is elected president at the next elections. Passing between Scylla and Charybdis is a well-known popular expression. But the vast majority of those who employ this image misinterpret it. They proceed from the fact that the hero of the ancient Greek epic poem had an opportunity to somehow slip through, avoiding both Scylla and Charybdis. But Odysseus did not have this opportunity, and he had to choose the less fearsome of the two monsters. And this, truly, is our situation today. We are choosing not between good and bad but between bad and very bad. YU. ALEKSANDROV. Viktor Leonidovich, I have the impression that the preparation of different political forces for the struggle for the presidency is under way, as it were, in the Duma and that the powerful bloc-forming of the opposition forces in order to begin the antipresidential campaign even now is taking place simultaneously. Isakov, in particular, has declared that the president is the main destabilizing factor at the present time. What do you think? V. SHEYNIS. Isakov's speech attracted attention, of course. As distinct from many other representatives of the implacable opposition, Isakov, who possesses many of the "virtues" of this political current, is an educated individual. He is not Anpilov. He is a professional. And when he said that the constitution affords an opportunity for presidential elections via parliament, he understood full well that he was telling an untruth. And do you know why? This was simply a trial balloon. For the opposition in parliament does not have the requisite majority even for raising this matter. The approximate correlation of votes is at the most 200 on one side and around 170 on the other. A. YEMELYANOV. A few words to add to what Viktor Leonidovich said. Remember how the speaker of the house was elected in the State Duma. The opposition rejoiced when Ivan Petrovich Rybkin's candidacy was successful. Now, it seemed, they could bar admission to power of anyone from blocs of a democratic persuasion: both committee chairmen and their deputies. But look what has happened. The leaders of the blocs have agreed not to "devour" one another but to share these committee chairman and deputy positions proportionally. They proposed Mikhail Mityukov as first deputy speaker, yet they could have barred him altogether. And, what is most important, they agreed to a block vote. This means that they proceeded from common sense, from an understanding that a new alignment of forces has emerged in parliament. The Barometer Is Common Sense A. YEMELYANOV. I would like to distinguish several aspects of the following nature. See how the recent turnabouts in economic policy and the personnel shuffles in the government were interpreted, particularly in the news media. They made a fuss about the fact that this was essentially a recoil, a return to the old ways. It is our former delusions that were, I believe, the basis of such opinions. In this case, monopolism of the truth. And although we are fighting this and have condemned it in theory, it is this that we are encountering even now in the interpretation of the reforms. We want in practice to reduce an understanding of the essence of the reforms to the way in which they were presented and implemented since the start of 1992 by Yegor Timurovich Gaydar and his team. But you cannot make provision for everything with such profound reformations. Mistakes are inevitable, corrections are inevitable, and there is nothing to be ashamed of if the reformer himself sees this and changes and improves and does not present matters as a renunciation of the reforms. And, then, what have we to be ashamed of? We have, after all, achieved a great deal. Let us recall. Two and a half years ago the very words "enterprise" and "private property" were rejected in what was then the Union Supreme Soviet by the majority, Gorbachev included. And even Sobchak, this is a historical paradox, was the first to protest and "ax" the concept of ownership of the land. When we deputies proposed this, he said that both the Black Sea coast and everything else would then be bought up. This is how ideology prevailed over common sense. These were the nineties. But now no one any longer disputes, not even the most conservative figures protest, private ownership or enterprise. This is a breakthrough in ideology, a breakthrough in management philosophy. But the problem lies elsewhere. The reforms should not have been "spurred." The transition from one society to another, from one economic and social system to another, is a process of decades. And what did we do? I will give you just one characteristic with reference to agriculture. Remember how the task that was set was reorganization and the liquidation of all unprofitable kolkhozes and sovkhozes by 1 April 1992. In just three months. Stalin carried out collectivization this way, but the timeframe was somewhat longer even then. It is also bad that the reforms have been implemented exclusively in accordance with the from-the-top-down principle. Although it is now generally recognized that the interests of the individual cannot be disregarded. YU. ALEKSANDROV. Just one comment concerning economic policy. There are two extremes here. It seems to me that if Gaydar's policy is evaluated in the context of the political conditions of that time, these unpopular measures that were pursued by Gaydar's team are explained to a large extent not so much by theoretical views as by the need to give a boost to the reforms, overcoming the very strong political resistance. Although, I agree, there were, of course, extremes. But we should beware that in the process of present-day corrections we not cross over into another system. We know that it is possible to build a market economy which proves to be confined, as it were, to the sector of inefficient works. How, after all, are they supported currently? Only by the redistribution of some limited economic resources of society. And we can build an economic system that has a sector of inefficient works protected against outside competition that supports the sufficiently high living standard of those who are associated with it. But we would be leaving the bulk of society overboard in these sumps of unproductive occupations. A. YEMELYANOV. I know all the reformers, they are almost all graduates of our Moscow State University Economics Faculty. I admire the talent of Yegor Timurovich and his colleagues. But on the practical level they did some foolish things. The general scourge of our economy, for example--the nonpayments. Tens, hundreds of enterprises are coming to a halt. This is a multi-aspectual issue. But I believe that the main obstructions concerning these payments are being created at the top. The nonpayments are like a clot in a blood vessel. They have arisen in one or two places, and the entire organism will be paralyzed. I shall explain this by the example of the peasants. They collected the grain, gathered in the harvest, but money has not been paid the peasants. And this has gone on down the line. There is no money, they can no longer purchase trucks and combines. The machinery for the manufacture of trucks and combines has been halted. All of agricultural machine building has been paralyzed. Not to mention fertilizer, we are working the land to exhaustion. And Minister Fedorov was adamant: No, we will not provide any money. This is a simply a violation of the elementary requirements of common sense. YU. ALEKSANDROV. I would like in literally two words to dwell on the nonpayments problem. This is an extraordinarily complex problem, all the same. Chernomyrdin is still holding back money even now. Because there is none. After all, the nonpayments problem was born in various ways. Take agriculture, say. Yes, of course the harvest needs to be paid for. But, Aleksey Mikhaylovich, you will surely recall how the idea of the government contract arose, when essentially very high prices for grain were promised. I do not know how this decision was born politically. But there are, in any case, two points here. The first is that the state tied itself by its undertaking to pay unduly high prices. And that the agrarians, for their part, failed to offer a clear program of the reorganization of inefficient farms. A. YEMELYANOV. You are wrong as regards the very high prices. They are still artificially low even now. But even this is not the point. It is something else that is of fundamental importance: If you purchase grain, please be so kind as to pay, not drag out the payment for many months, when the money "dries up" before one's eyes. And, in addition, the present leadership has as a result found itself in a very difficult situation. After all, it has to pay off the debt to the peasants and, in addition, allocate credit for the spring sowing, for the new harvest, which, incidentally, is being done. And here we have a surge of inflation. Sins that go back to last year are having to be paid for. This is why the need for personnel shuffles arose. This is the correct position of both the prime minister and the president. Struggle for Power as an End in Itself L. KRAVCHENKO. Aleksey Mikhaylovich, listening to you, I came to think that there was something symbolic in these personnel shuffles. Perhaps we are finally coming to the conclusion that we can no longer put fate to the test, allowing politics undivided sway, allowing politics to rape, if you will excuse the expression, economics. It has long been clear that priority should be given economics, where everything is dictated by common sense and precise business calculation--economics free of political predilections. The more the politicians understand this truth, there more chances there are that economics will be given priority, not the struggle for power. For the sake of salvation of the economy, salvation of the country, it is, perhaps, time for all political forces to seek accord and to unite their efforts. A. YEMELYANOV. I agree. Continuation of the struggle will bring about self-destruction. I would draw, conditionally, an analogy with the former Union republics. After the 1991 putsch they all wanted full sovereignty. But time has elapsed, and many of them have recognized that you cannot survive alone. I am afraid to oversimplify this question, but there are things in common. There is not one political force that is currently capable of getting the better of the others independently. A trend toward a certain convergence is probably inevitable, therefore. These processes, despite all the difficulties, are occurring here in the Duma also. V. SHEYNIS. It would be correct to conclude that the struggle for a new course of the reforms has become interwoven here with the struggle for power. Struggle for power as an end in itself. Particular clans, some of which identify with the democrats, others, with their opponents, have taken shape, since 1989, at least. And in each case it is not simply for one clan but for several that power is a value in itself, and which are struggling to establish their control of power and property. YU. ALEKSANDROV. I now have the impression that the conditions for the achievement of social accord are better. At the same time, on the other hand, political forces are, truly, grouping in the struggle for peace, primarily for the presidency. And quite a wide-ranging bloc of forces opposed to Russia's Choice in the struggle against the current president and for early elections is possible here, what is more. This could inflame the situation. I see a further danger in the fact that the state is becoming bureaucratized very quickly and that its machinery is growing unchecked. And the state is in this sense once again becoming divorced from the people and is perched, so to speak, on its own machinery, on a bureaucratic foundation. This is perceived very strongly in society and is being reflected onto the democrats, who are being identified with the state. The growth of nationalism, which is preventing a strengthening of accord in society, is very troubling. It is encouraging, it is true, that there have already been examples of the successful resolution of most complex contradictions, as was the case in the elaboration of the treaty with Tatarstan, and there is now hope of a start on an improvement of relations with Chechnya. A. KIVA. I also share the belief that the efforts to achieve civil peace today are far more auspicious than was the case earlier. If we recall last year, particularly the unyielding antagonism that developed into diarchy, the opposition had at that time a hope of revanche. They only needed to overthrow President Yeltsin, and they could have expected to have turned the ship of state in another direction. This is no longer the case. De jure we are living in accordance with a new constitution, de facto also, to some extent. The soviets are no more, and it came as a surprise to us to find that these soviets were not that deeply rooted. And, besides, a certain balance of political forces has taken shape. No one has the clear advantage. There is no temptation to resort to manifestly power solutions. Evil Disappears With Satiety L. KRAVCHENKO. Do you not think that one of the main prerequisites for the achievement of accord and civil peace would be the imparting of a socially attractive character to the economic reforms. It is said that evil disappears with satiety. I do not wish to oversimplify the problem. No one either in the present or the past government would have refused to have channeled more resources into social programs. But there were no reserves. Nonetheless, monetarist projects are inadequately oriented toward man and his concerns and needs. After all, the more poor and destitute people there are, the broader the social base for the opposition and the greater its chances of election success. This was clearly understood by the president, I believe, when, in his report to parliament, he put more emphasis on social policy and subsequently issued an edict geared to combating the delays in the payments of wages and pensions. Instances of enterprises deliberately having kept money in accounts in order to "rotate" it via the banks have already become known. The directors are at every step establishing for themselves wages of several millions, while the workers get 50,000-70,000. This multiple discrepancy in pay is sending people into a rage. I would like to emphasize, that is, that despite all the difficulties there are real opportunities for strengthening the social content of the economic reforms. Do you agree with this formulation of the issue? A. YEMELYANOV. There is no doubt that any reform should one way or another be passed through the prism of man. What happened was that we cast aside social regulation, rushed recklessly into the market, and began to transfer everything absolutely to a commercial basis. Health care and education and science and culture.... It is here primarily that an adjustment is needed lest we conclusively kill off that which is healthy that has developed and in order that we rectify all this distortion. Otherwise we democrats will simply lose in the future: at both the presidential and parliamentary elections. A. KIVA. I once published an article entitled "Postcommunist Syndrome." It said, inter alia, that we have a passion for doing everything other than the way it was done under the socialist system. Even that which is good that should have been preserved--the social sphere, medicine, the health and fitness centers, the recreation centers, children's establishments--everything has been uprooted. This, unfortunately, is a trait of our national character, it is Bolshevism of the first water. We rushed over to one side, and the pendulum swung to the other. YU. ALEKSANDROV. There are contentious aspects here also. What is meant by socially oriented reforms under our conditions? Production is declining. Everyone is short of money. There is not one sector that is not in need of credit. If we halt the landslide in production and if we all start to work better--everyone without exception--general prosperity will begin to grow also. Meanwhile, I believe that it may rather be a question of smoothing over as much as possible the negative social consequences of all the structural and other reorganizations. L. KRAVCHENKO. I would like to touch on one further topic. Society was recently agitated by the amnesty that was announced. Many fears have arisen: Khasbulatov, Rutskoy, Anpilov, Konstantinov, and Makashov have been set free and they will rush into the fray and will want revanche. All kinds of inventions have arisen also. The amnesty plays, allegedly, into the hands of the president, who does not want any investigation of the tragic White House events. And the amnesty was all but a result of a compact between the president and the leaders of the Duma. This, in any event, is what Gavriil Popov has openly hinted at in his speeches. A. KIVA. I have not shared the panic fear that has arisen in the democratic community in connection with the amnesty. This is an ambiguous event, of course. There are big minuses here, but there are pluses also. When the smoke had cleared, for example, it was ascertained via opinion polls that many of Zhirinovskiy's supporters had gone over to Rutskoy. Zhirinovskiy had a 6 percent rating, Rutskoy, 5 percent, apparently. There is much that could still change. This does not mean that Rutskoy is for the country an acceptable figure as president, but every cloud has a silver lining, as they say. And a second point. However paradoxical, this amnesty has, perhaps, boosted the aspiration to accord and revealed that not all questions were solved in essence on 3-4 October. We need, therefore, to be viewing matters in a broader perspective more than simply thinking about the losses the amnesty caused. A. YEMELYANOV. If the upsurge of social protest in society grows, the amnesty could prove to be to the benefit of the united opposition. The leaders of the radicals were released, but the question of an assessment of what they did has remained unexplained. There have on their part been no words of repentance or, at least, regret. True, the State Duma is as yet examining certain documents supplementary to the amnesty decree, intending smoothing over some of its negative consequences. Heed the Advice, Democrats! L. KRAVCHENKO. It is evidently time to "round out" our discussion. I would like in conclusion to ask whether you have suggestions concerning an increase in the chances for a strengthening of civil peace and accord. Your personal suggestions.... V. SHEYNIS. I have specific advice addressed to the democrats: what they should do first and foremost. First. Clearly understand the actual possibilities, content, and limits of so-called accord. Do not allow yourselves to be carried away by rhetoric. Accord under the specific conditions means three things, in my view. First, the renunciation of forcible action and unconstitutional solutions, whatever the constitution and whatever the attitude toward it. Second. Undertake corrections of the economic course. Third. Uphold your positions on the criminal and civil codes, the election system, the Referendum Act, and so forth. Fourth. Firmly defend the foundation of the reform course. Corrections are essential, but let us pay tribute to the courage of Gaydar and his team, who pushed the ship away from the shallows. Got it moving and created a new economic situation. We need to understand here the difference between our interests, the interests of the people and society, and the interests of the new nomenklatura, which today calls itself democratic, but which is deciding its own power and property interests. It is essential to clearly understand this. And fifth and finally--patiently build up an election organization. For parliamentary elections are impending at the end of 1995 even, then come presidential elections in 1996. It will be necessary to prepare a leader and prepare organizations. This, in my opinion, is today a most important task because the two years will fly by extraordinarily quickly. A. KIVA. I largely agree with Viktor Leonidovich. The question of the team of reformers and of ways of continuing the reforms is urgent today. The opposition is demanding the creation of a coalition government. This is a difficult question, but we have a coalition government even now. On the other hand, we cannot oversimplify matters to such an extent as to conceive of a government with the participation of, say, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Gleb Yakunin, and Yegor Gaydar. To a considerable extent civil peace and accord are guaranteed by the president personally. He is required to do so by the constitution. But I would like to hope that both he and the government would regularly confer with the people. Seek, if you wish, their consent to this step or the other that affects society's living standards. Do not disregard public opinion and consult with people more often, speaking on television and radio and in the press. Explain to them your policy, do not conceal difficulties. Lift this depression and lack of confidence in the future, when it seems that no light can be seen at the end of the tunnel. This might then be repaid a hundredfold.
