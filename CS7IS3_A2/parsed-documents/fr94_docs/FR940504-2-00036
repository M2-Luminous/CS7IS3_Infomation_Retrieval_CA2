FR940504-2-00036 FR940504-2-00033 Although the project review process cannot be delegated, EPA will consider, to the maximum extent possible, any existing or future state, tribal, and local control mechanisms in protecting the groundwater quality of the aquifer. VI. Summary of Public Comments EPA received six letters during the comment period. Sixteen people spoke at the public hearing at Kaunakakai, Molokai, Hawaii on January 6, 1994. Of those who expressed an opinion, six supported the designation of a Sole Source Aquifer for Molokai, whereas one opposed a designation. The public's written and oral comments are fully addressed in EPA's Responsiveness Summary which is available to the public during normal business hours at EPA, Water Management Division, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California. VII. Economic and Regulatory Impact Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that the attached rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of this certification, the term ``small entity'' shall have the same meaning as given in Section 601 of the RFA. This action is only applicable to the area within the boundaries of the Molokai Sole Source Aquifer. The only affected entities will be those businesses, organizations, or governmental jurisdictions that request Federal financial assistance for projects which have the potential for contaminating the aquifer so as to create a significant hazard to public health. EPA does not expect to be reviewing small, isolated commitments of financial assistance on an individual basis; accordingly, the number of affected small entities will be minimal. For those small entities which may be subject to review, the impact of this action will not be significant. For most projects subject to this review, a ground water impact assessment will be required pursuant to other federal laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq. Integration of those related reviews with Sole Source Aquifer review will allow EPA and other federal agencies to avoid delay or duplication of effort in approving financial assistance, thus minimizing any adverse effect on those small entities which are affected. Finally, today's action does not prevent grants of Federal financial assistance which may be available to any affected small entity in order to pay for the redesign of the project to assure protection of the aquifer. Under Executive Order 12866, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. This regulation is not significant because it will not have an annual effect of $100 million or more on the economy, will not cause any major increase in costs or prices, and will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States enterprises to compete in domestic or export markets. This action only affects the area within the boundaries of the Molokai Sole Source Aquifer. As a result of this action, no commitment of Federal financial assistance (through a grant, contract, loan guarantee, or otherwise) may be entered into for any project which the Administrator determines may contaminate such aquifer through a recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health, but a commitment for Federal financial assistance may, if authorized under another provision of law, be entered into to plan or design the project to assure that it will not so contaminate the aquifer. Dated: April 14, 1994. John Wise, Acting Regional Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10551 Filed 5&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
