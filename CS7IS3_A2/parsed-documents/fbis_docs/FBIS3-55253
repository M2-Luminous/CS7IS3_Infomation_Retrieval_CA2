Our correspondent Gulsafa Ahmedova reports: [Ahmedova] Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Afiaddin Dzhalilov chaired the National Assembly session. Though the bill on martial law was endorsed [as the basis for further debate] at its first reading at one of the previous session of the National Assembly, in view of proposals that have been made, it was recommitted to the relevant commission for amendments. Metleb Mutallimov, chairman of the commission, submitted the new version of the bill to the parliamentarians. A new debate began. Its importance for the republic that is living under war conditions was noted. Tofik Gasymov, chairman of the commission that drafted the bill on border guards, briefed the National Assembly about the bill. The parliamentarians put forward a number of interesting proposals during the debate. The bill was then put to a vote paragraph by paragraph. It was adopted on the condition that some editorial changes be made to it. The parliamentarians then expressed their agreement with the removal of the Deputy Prime Minister Vakhid Akhmedov and Finance Minister Salekh Mamedov from their posts. The bill on the legislative plan for the first quarter of 1994 was debated and adopted in full after certain proposals were taken into account.
