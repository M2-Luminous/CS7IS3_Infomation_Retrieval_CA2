He will continue his journey to Belgrade this afternoon. "I would like to show the Serbs that there exists another Russia, a new leading political party, a new Russian parliament", said Zhirinovskiy in his statement for TANJUG. He hinted at "Russia taking a new stand in order that the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina may end as soon as possible", and so that "no Serb and no Slav would ever have to die in the Balkans. The Balkans will flourish" -- was the message of the leader of the Russian Liberal Democrats. In the course of his official and unofficial meetings in Serbia and the Serb Republic [in Bosnia-Herzegovina], Zhirinovskiy is expected to put forward his proposals for the settlement of the Yugoslav crisis, and especially for an end to the war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Fully supporting the Serbian and Montenegrin people, whom he considers as brotherly, he will strongly oppose the air strikes on Bosnian Serbs persistently threatened by the United Nations and NATO. "My party and the official Russian policy will keep demanding that the international community abolish the sanctions against the FRY and allow its return back among the recognized European countries", said Zhirinovskiy.
