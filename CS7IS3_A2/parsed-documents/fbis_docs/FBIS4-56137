What we oppose to are talks between a grouping and the Czech Government," Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told journalists today. He said the Czech Republic's stand towards the Sudeten German question is "clear and does not ensue from its relation to Germany but from the international and legal nature of the problem." The "Four Plus Two" treaty on Germany's unification essentially substitutes a peace treaty from the view point of the Allies, Zieleniec said, when asked what prevents the Czech Republic from concluding a peace treaty with Germany.
