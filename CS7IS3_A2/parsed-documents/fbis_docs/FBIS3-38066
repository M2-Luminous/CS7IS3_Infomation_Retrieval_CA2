His wife Maria was arrested at home. The Ames are accused of spying for the former USSR and for Russia for nearly nine years. [passage omitted] In principle the arrest of a foreign agent is not that rare an event in the invisible war the various special services have been waging among themselves for many centuries. But the arrest of the Ames caused, perhaps, an overreaction in the United States. In Moscow U.S. Ambassador Pickering made an official protest to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Lavrov. In Washington Secretary of State Christopher asked those Russian diplomats who had been in contact with the Ames' to leave the United States quietly, as it were. President Clinton, who, as it happens, was aware that U.S. counterintelligence had had the Ames under surveillance for 10 months, ordered administration staffers to carry out a detailed analysis of the consequences of the spies' activities for U.S. national security. Some senators were calling for aid to Russia to be frozen. According to our experts, there are several ways of explaining the ballyhoo in the United States over the arrest of the Ames. First and foremost it could be a wish on the part of the U.S. special services to obtain one-sided advantages in conducting intelligence on Russian territory. Actually, Russian intelligence is doing no more in America than U.S. intelligence is doing in Russia, according to one Foreign Intelligence Service representative. Incidentally, CIA Director James Woolsey has repeatedly stated that his department is keeping an extremely close eye on Russia. It is not inconceivable that the Ames case got such heavy publicity in view of the exposure of more than 20 foreign, including U.S. intelligence agents in Russia last year. They included a Russian citizen, who, as Nikolay Golushko, director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, said in an IZVESTIYA interview, had caused damage to Russian national security interests comparable to the damage caused by former GRU officer Penkovskiy, who was shot in 1963. Some observers believe that the furor caused by the arrest of the Ames' is a kind of adverse reaction on the part of certain U.S. circles to the shift of emphasis in Russian policy in the Balkans.
