A Foreign Ministry statement said in this connection that the UN employees were on a reconnaissance mission agreed upon by Operation Lifeline Sudan to carry out a survey to assess relief requirements and to organize a campaign for the vaccination of children in the area. The statement said that the detained UN employees were four Sudanese and a Briton, namely (Brian Tattersall), a Briton working for the FAO; (John Owal), a Sudanese working for the FAO; Dr. Malik Muhammad al-Badawi, a Sudanese working for UNICEF; and (Christopher Farmela Noli), a Sudanese working for UNICEF. The Foreign Ministry said that on 27 February (Brian Tattersall), the Briton, was released but not the others, who are Sudanese employees of the United Nations. They have been flown to Nairobi. The statement said that the commander of the rebels, (Jacob Miarbin), stated in his report on the attempted aggression that the aid workers' return to the town of Attar was not guaranteed on the pretext of military operations in the area. However, the area is completely secure and this is confirmed by the fact that the steamboat (Baldiyah) which they traveled on, continued to travel unhindered and was moored at Attar, which was made the center for the vaccination campaign. The Foreign Ministry said it was not surprised by this inhuman stand on the part of the rebel movement, which has never cared about values and ideals. This incident is only another link in a series of crimes it has committed against the innocent, starting with its assassination of relief workers in September 1992 and its attacks on relief trains in May and November 1993, as well as attacks on relief boats in January and May 1993. The Foreign Ministry statement said that the Sudanese Government condemns and denounces this barbarous behavior of the rebels and said it will hold the rebel movement fully responsible for the safety of the detained persons. It demanded the release of the detained persons immediately. The statement confirmed that this action must be regarded as a violation of the tripartite agreement signed by the Sudanese Government, the United Nations, and the rebels to ensure the safety of Operation Lifeline Sudan. It is also a violation of international norms. The Foreign Ministry statement demanded that the United Nations ensure the safety, protection, and return of its four Sudanese employees who have been detained and demanded their immediate release without any prior conditions.
