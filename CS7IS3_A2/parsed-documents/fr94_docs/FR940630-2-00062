FR940630-2-00062 FR940630-2-00045 [Report No. I&hyph;6991; File Nos. I&hyph;T&hyph;C&hyph;93&hyph;031, I&hyph;T&hyph;C&hyph;93&hyph;050, I&hyph;T&hyph;C&hyph;93&hyph;054] Pleading Cycle Extended for Comments on AT&T's Petition for Reconsideration of Commission Order Authorizing Three International Resale Carriers Proposing To Provide ``Call-Back'' Services June 22, 1994. The Commission recently granted the above-referenced Section 214 applications of VIA USA, Ltd., Telegroup, Inc., and Discount Call International Co. to resell international switched services of other carriers using a ``call-back'' configuration. ( VIA USA, Ltd et al. , FCC 94&hyph;86, released May 11, 1994). This service allows a customer in a foreign country to use foreign facilities to dial a telephone number in the United States and receive dial tone at a switch at the reseller's U.S. location, which the customer can then use to place a call via an outbound switched service of a U.S. carrier. The through calls are billed at U.S.-tariffed rates. AT&T petitioned to deny these applications alleging that this service constitutes an unreasonable practice under Section 201 of the Communications Act (``the Act'') and may constitute wire fraud. The Commission denied AT&T's petition. On June 10, 1994, AT&T filed a petition for reconsideration asking the Commission to find that uncompleted call signalling is an unreasonable practice under Section 201(b) of the Act, is contrary to the public interest for purposes of Section 214 of the Act, violates Section 202(a) of the Act, and violates the federal wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. 1343. In order to develop a complete record on the issues raised by AT&T's petition, the Commission on its own motion is extending the time for the filing of comments. Interested parties may file comments by July 22, 1994, and reply comments by August 8, 1994 with the Secretary, FCC, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554. A copy should also be sent to Troy F. Tanner, Common Carrier Bureau, FCC, Room 534, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554. For further information, contact Troy F. Tanner, International Facilities Division of the Common Carrier Bureau, at (202) 632&hyph;7265. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary.
