FR940721-2-00051 FR940721-2-00035 Health Care Financing Administration Privacy Act of 1974; Systems of Records AGENCY: Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). ACTION: Notice of proposed new routine use for existing systems of records. SUMMARY: HCFA is proposing to revise the system notices for the ``Carrier Medicare Claims Records'' (CMCR), System No. 09&hyph;70&hyph;0501, and the ``Intermediary Medicare Claims Records'' (IMCR), System No. 09&hyph;70&hyph;0503. The Privacy Act permits disclosure of information without the prior written consent of an individual for ``routine use'' that is; disclosure for purposes compatible with the purpose for which the data is collected. HCFA is proposing to revise the CMCR and IMCR by adding a new routine use for release of intermediary and carrier maintained beneficiary data to servicing Medicare banks and/or provider banks. The purpose of this new routine use is to allow fiscal intermediaries (FIs) and carriers to send claims payment and beneficiary information to providers or their banks either directly, or through a Value Added Network (VAN) telecommunications service and for provider banks to use this information to perform account management activities on behalf of providers. Under this scenario, the electronic funds transfer (EFT) and the electronic remittance advice (ERA) flow together through the banking system. The consolidation of Medicare beneficiary and payment information will reduce paperwork and administrative costs. EFFECTIVE DATES: HCFA filed an altered system report with the Chairman of the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), on July 18, 1994. To ensure all parties have adequate time in which to comment, the altered systems of records, including routine uses, will become effective 40 days from the publication of this notice or from the date submitted to OMB and the Congress, whichever is later, unless HCFA receives comments which require alterations to this notice. The proposed new routine use shall take effect without further notice 40 days from the date of publication unless comments received on or before that date would warrant changes. ADDRESSES: Please address comments to Mr. Richard A. DeMeo, HCFA Privacy Act Officer, Office of Budgetary Services, Office of Customer Relations and Communications, HCFA, Room 2&hyph;H&hyph;4 East High Rise Building, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21207&hyph;5187. Comments received will be available for inspection at this location. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph Morical, Division of Financial Management, Office of Contracting and Financial Management, Bureau of Program Operations, Health Care Financing Administration, Room 1&hyph;B&hyph;4, Meadows East Building, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, Maryland 21207&hyph;5187. His telephone number is (410) 966&hyph;7477. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The IMCR and the CMCR exist to assure proper health insurance benefit payments to or on behalf of entitled Medicare Part A and Part B beneficiaries. The Privacy Act permits disclosure of information without the prior written consent of an individual for ``routine use'' that is; disclosure for purposes compatible with the purpose for which the data is collected. The IMCR and CMCR systems of records were last published in the Federal Register at 55 FR 37549; September 12, 1990. Currently, there are 23 routine uses in the IMCR system and 25 in the CMCR system that permit disclosure of information to individuals and/or organizations for a variety of reasons, the majority of which relate to the timely and accurate processing of Medicare claims, payment safeguards activities, and research. There are safeguards in place, as described in the safeguard section of both systems, to protect the data which have been developed in accordance with part 6 of the HHS Information Resource Management Manual and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Information Process Standards.
