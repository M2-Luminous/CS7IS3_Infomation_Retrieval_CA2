This was announced after a meeting between visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and his South Korean counterpart Yi Pyong-tae here Wednesday [20 April]. Perry, who delayed his visit to Seoul due to last week's downing of U.S. Army helicopters by friendly fire in Iraq, arrived here late Tuesday night. The two defense ministers focused on the nuclear issue in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). They decided to hold the "Team Spirit" exercise if no progress is made on the issue by the end of October. They believe that the deployment of Patriot missiles at American military bases in South Korea will contribute to deterring war. They agreed, however, that there are no particular signs of military confrontation at present. The "Team Spirit" joint military exercise had been held annually since 1976, but was cancelled for the first time in 1992 when the DPRK signed the nuclear safeguards accord with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The exercise was revived last year after a stalemate in inter- Korean talks over nuclear inspections. The first shipment of Patriot missiles and their launchers arrived in South Korea Monday aboard two U.S. military transport ships. South Korea and the U.S. claimed that the Patriots are purely defensive missiles designed to counter air strikes and SCUD missiles. But the DPRK said that the missiles are designed for offensive purposes, while describing the "Team Spirit" as a "rehearsal for invading the DPRK."
