The business-customer section will grow by 12 percent to around 29 billion DM, and private sales will increase 10 percent to 32 billion, said members of the board Horst Gellert and Dieter Gallist at the CeBIT in Hannover In the future, not only voice, but also images, data, and video will be transmitted over data lines. "The multimedia area, in which 300 million DM is now invested in Germany, will be worth 7 billion DM by the year 2000. Sales will also increase 24-fold," said Gellert. Telecom wishes to have a healthy share of this growth. Among business customers, Gellert is placing special emphasis on ISDN in addition to the traditionally largest business area of telephone services. Telecom can become the world leader in introducting this future technology with more than 1.2 million B-channels sold. ISDN sales rose more than 130 percent to 2.5 billion DM in 1993. An increase to 3.7 billion DM is anticipated for 1994. In the future, ISDN should become available as a high-performance data net for communication among personal computers. To date, few personal computers have been holed up to the telephone net in Germany. More and more, telephone connection will become a universal telecommunication medium, said Gallist. In the future, stationary and mobile telecommunications will grow together. "Every customer can be reached through one telephone number even during this decade, whether he is telephoning from a mobile or stationary set," says the telephone executive. The most important customer among private sales is a telephone service with approximately 30 million customers and with planned sales of 25.4 billion DM this year. Telecom also expects good business through interactive television. The feedback channel of custoiners for program requests will be telephone connection. The Pay-TV-Market also offers enormous potential. The number of subscribers will increase from 760,000 to 3.4 million by the year 2000.
