In an address to journalists, he acknowledged that the European Community lacked vision in dealing with the region and that its executive intended to embark on a process of "self-criticism" to map out a new policy. "The Community must delve into the roots of its history," he said, adding that "Vienna, Budapest, Warsaw and other cities are as much poles of our cultural identity as Berlin, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam or London." The European Community has negotiated association agreements with Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania and Bulgaria which are supposed to prepare the way for these countries to enter the European Community. But the applicants have been given no timetable for entry, or any assurance that they can expect to enter the Community before the turn of the century. The European Community has also been blamed for holding up the economic development of these countries by maintaining barriers to some of their most vigorous exports such as steel and agricultural products. The European Community's chief executive said the Commission intended to launch an analysis of all existing EC aid, particularly economic and technological, to East Europe. Delors is to give up his post as European Commission president at the end of this year. He has occupied the post since 1985.
