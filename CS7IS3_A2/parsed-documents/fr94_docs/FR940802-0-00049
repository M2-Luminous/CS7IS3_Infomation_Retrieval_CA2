FR940802-0-00049 FR940802-0-00008 VI. Environmental, Energy, and Economic Impacts A. Environmental Impacts 1. Overview Today's renewable oxygenate rule is projected to have a number of direct and indirect environmental impacts resulting from changes in the type of oxygenates that likely would have been used to fulfill the requirements of the RFG program. Determining the precise nature of these impacts is difficult because the renewables program provides considerable flexibility in meeting the 30 percent renewables requirement. In the case of VOC, NOx and air toxics, however, the impact of today's rule is constrained because the renewables program will take place within the context of the reformulated gasoline program. Today's rule may also have effects on carbon monoxide, global warming, and non-air quality aspects of the environment since these effects are not constrained by the RFG emission models or performance standards. Today's rule does not alter the VOC, NOx, or toxics emission performance standards for reformulated gasoline. Therefore, the emission performance of reformulated gasoline as measured using the relevant RFG emission model (the Simple Model in 1995&hyph;1997 or the Complex Model in 1998 and beyond) will remain essentially unchanged. Today's rule will affect VOC, NOx, or toxics emissions only to the extent that the effects of fuel changes resulting from today's rule are not included in the applicable RFG certification models. These effects (predominantly the commingling and front-end distillation effects of adding oxygenates to gasoline) should be beneficial for VOC emissions to the extent that ETBE displaces either ethanol or MTBE use during the summer months. Exact quantification of these benefits is difficult because the changes in ETBE use and the quantification methodology are both uncertain. Health studies of ETBE are being initiated, since virtually no health data exist at present. These studies in conjunction with studies of potential ETBE related exposures would contribute to our understanding of potential public health risk. This work is designed to resolve existing uncertainties as to whether unique concerns may exist with ETBE as compared to the ethanol, MTBE, and/or other compounds it could displace. Concerns with respect to potential VOC emission increases outside of the VOC control season were raised in the comments on the proposal. However, VOC emissions are not directly controlled outside of the VOC-control season under the RFG program (although some control due to early compliance with the requirements is expected based on past experience with other programs). The issue of VOC emission increases during the ``shoulder season'' is addressed in detail in section III.G. The remainder of this section is divided into four parts. First, the air quality effects of the renewable oxygenate rule in 1998 and later years (when the Complex Model is in effect) are discussed. Second, the air quality effects of today's rule during the Simple Model years (1995&hyph;1997) are discussed. Third, the global warming impact of today's rule is discussed. Fourth, the non-air quality effects of today's rule is discussed. 2. Air Quality Impacts Under the Complex Model As discussed in section III, the renewable oxygenate program is expected to stimulate the use of ETBE during the summer months and increase the use of ethanol during the winter months. According to the Complex Model, these oxygenates provide smaller toxics benefits than do MTBE or TAME when used at identical oxygen content levels. Any changes in oxygenate type resulting from today's rule will have no effect on overall air toxics emission performance, however, since the Complex Model will account for the effects of changes in oxygenate type and the emission performance standards are unchanged by today's rule. As discussed in section VI.C of this notice, however, the increase in ethanol and ETBE use may increase the cost of complying with the RFG toxics emission performance standards.
