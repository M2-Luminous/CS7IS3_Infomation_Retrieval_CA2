The most important cooperation project -- that with United Airlines -- is, however, still uncertain. [Weber] Since the signing of the partnership agreement, United and Lufthansa have cooperated well in many fields, but the joint flights cannot be organized because the Americans are blocking the aviation agreement. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] When will Washington finally give the go-ahead? [Weber] I would love to know that. Unfortunately, over the past few days, the Americans have placed new obstacles in our path. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What kind of obstacles? [Weber] Basically, the only issue that is stil contentious is the so-called third country code sharing. The Americans -- above all, American and Delta Airlines -- want to make joint flights beyond Germany with East European airlines, such as Poland's LOT, Hungary's Malev, or Aeroflot, and in unlimited numbers. [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Which you cannot accept? [Weber] No, this would set us back again on the path toward equal treatment. The fact that American and Delta may conduct such code sharing is fine with me, but not in greater numbers than we and United are permitted. Anything else is blackmail.
