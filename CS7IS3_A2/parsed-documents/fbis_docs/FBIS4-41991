Naturally, he is also visiting Moscow. He cannot fail to visit Moscow. Because the main topic of his visit is "Russian crime." In this instance you cannot avoid using inverted commas. "Russian crime" is just a term. Its meaning is broader than the words which reflect the phenomenon. Russian crime does not mean crime in Russia. Nor does it mean crime committed by Russians. It does not even mean crime which has carved out a niche for itself in Russia. The topic of the visit by L. Freeh and five other ranking representatives of the Department of State, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Department of the Treasury will be the peculiar status of organized crime in the world, which has now become a fact of life following the collapse of the communist system. Everything Can Be Bought "The Criminal World," a book published recently by Claire Sterling, a journalist specializing in organized crime, recounts that, a few hours after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, Giovanni Tanomento, a well-known Sicilian mafioso who was living in (West) Berlin at the time, received an instruction from his bosses to immediately go on a buying spree in East Berlin. "What exactly should I buy?", the mafioso asked in amazement. His boss replied: "Everything. Restaurants, discotheques, pizzerias, everything." Judging by initial results, the end of the Cold War was a boon not so much for capitalism, democracy, and the market-oriented economy as for organized crime. In a world of crumbling authority, in a world where people without money, capital, or assets either owned or temporarily controlled immense amounts of wealth on a quite tenuous basis, in this world of chaos and disorganization there has proved to be no more organized force than crime. The wholesale arrival of democracy and the weakening or disappearance of carefully guarded national borders has facilitated the international activities of criminal structures to an even greater degree. It become apparent at the recent U.S. Senate hearings from evidence given by leaders of the FBI, Germany's criminal investigation police, and the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs that the upsurge in organized postcommunist crime has caught everyone unawares. Many experts believe that the pooling of resources and finances by Sicilian godfathers, Colombian drug barons, Japanese "Yakuza" gangsters, and Russian gangs could turn the world into a nightmare compared to which "teetering on the brink of nuclear war" would seem like a transient problem. Recent history provides several examples of organized crime subsuming whole states. At the U.S. Senate hearings, M. Yegorov, Russian deputy internal affairs minister, repeatedly answered questions on whether criminals could reach the very highest levels of the Russian administration. The general from the Ministry of Internal Affairs did not deny the possibility that organized crime could place its own protege in the Duma or the Federation Council, but he assured the senators that for the foreseeable future the Kremlin was out of the criminals' reach. In the opinion of C. Sterling, whose book "The Criminal World" we have already cited, Russia has become "the world capital of organized crime." Without denying this threat, the FBI director described such views as "exaggerated and unfounded" at a news conference just before his departure. He Did Not Read the Decrees [Dekrety] The FBI director refused to comment on Russian President B.N. Yeltsin's recent decree on urgent measures to combat crime. Journalists asked L. Freeh whether this decree, with all its major restrictions on citizens' civil rights, would really be useful in overcoming organized crime. The director preferred to answer that he had not had time to read the decree. I have reason to believe that the text of the decree has been made available to the FBI leadership. It is likely that L. Freeh preferred not to complicate relations with his hosts on the eve of his important visit. On 4 July, Independence Day, one of the most important and solemn U.S. public holidays, Louis Freeh will open an official FBI mission in Moscow. It will not be a purely representative mission. A considerable number of Russian nouveaux riches, happy and shameless possessors of dirty millions, are laundering their money in America or through banking structures directly linked to America. Russian law enforcement organs do not have access to bank secrets in the West and are unlikely to have such access in the future. The FBI has far wider powers. The FBI's Moscow bureau will enable rapid communications to be established between the two countries' police forces, as well as ensuring that mutual assistance can be offered. At his news conference, the director clearly intimated that he regards the possibilities as limitless, but much will depend on how day-to-day work progresses, how far the two sides can trust each other, and how noticeable the results are. The second objective of the trip, the program for which includes visits to Ukraine and Belarus, and also Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria, will be helping to coordinate these countries' police services. Once fairly close, the relations between East European states in this sphere have degenerated into exclusivity and mutual mistrust literally within a matter of months. L. Freeh hopes that it will be possible to restore the professional contacts which are very important in the struggle against organized crime. To this end the United States is planning joint courses for the police forces of East Europe. Many experts consider it fortunate for the international community that criminal groups are by nature not inclined to coordinate their activities, they are characterized by an insurmountable urge to delineate zones of influence. It is no surprise that, following the collapse of communism, old criminal structures are being squeezed out by new, more brutal, and more aggressive structures. During the visit the U.S. delegation will suggest to its East European partners that they exploit this fact by establishing a computerized data base. This information will have to be protected from criminal groups which in many countries have their own network of paid agents in the police, the courts, and Prosecutor's Offices. Everything Is Still in the Future As a representative of the country which has the longest (and possibly the most successful) record of combating organized crime, L. Freeh warned against unrealistic hopes. He said it would probably never be possible to defeat mafia structures on a national and international scale once and for all. The task was to drive organized crime into a corner, deprive it of its international scope, and severely restrict its potential to move funds around.
