These millions of refugees will pose a far greater threat to Scandinavia than asylum-seekers from Africa or Southeast Asia who try to get into Denmark via Moscow and the Baltic states. Moscow -- The Scandinavian countries and Germany should make every effort to set up a cooperation with Russia to enable the world's second-largest nuclear power to accommodate the 6-8 million refugees from the former Soviet republics who will inundate the country during the next couple of years, according to Russian authorities. In the long run this task will be far more important for the security of the Scandinavian countries than the problems posed by the thousands of asylum-seekers from Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East who are currently using Moscow as a way station en route to Denmark and other countries. We were told this by a spokesman for the Russian refugee aid system. "Since the breakup of the Soviet Union accelerated and the republics were hit by internal ethnic conflicts and economic problems, 2.5 million refugees have come to Russia from the former Soviet republics. All forecasts indicate that another 6-8 million will come here from the former republics within the next three years," said Guran Sanikidze of the international division of the Russian refugee authority. Room for 150,000 Sanikidze added that Russia will probably have room for the maximum of 150,000 potential refugees from Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia who come to Russia as long as the country manages to deal with the reception of 6-8 million refugees from the former Soviet republics. "The 6-8 million represent a far greater threat to the Scandinavian countries and Germany than the thousands who come from countries outside the former Soviet Union. One can only guess at the social explosions this will lead to unless the economic and political situation becomes more stable and it will be much simpler for these millions of people to go to Scandinavia than it is for refugees from Africa or Southeast Asia," Sanikidze continued. Sanikidze said the Scandinavian countries could learn something from the agreement that Germany has reached with Poland and the Czech Republic on returning asylum-seekers to those nations. "One of the reasons why Poland and the Czech Republic signed the agreement was that Germany reciprocated by supplying technical equipment for the border police in the two countries. Russia is experiencing enormous problems with building up its borders and making them secure. It is not at the top of the economic agenda," Sanikidze stated. Russians Show Great Willingness Russia signed the UN refugee convention a year ago. This means that Russia has agreed to participate in solving the world's refugee problems. Among other things refugees will be able to seek asylum in Russia and obtain residence permits there. At present, however, the Russians have been unable to establish a procedure and infrastructure that would enable Moscow to process asylum applications and accommodate refugees. This may be the main reason why Moscow has become a way station for asylum-seekers from Sri Lanka, for example. "We see great willingness on the part of the Russians to live up to their commitments as signers of the UN refugee convention. However, the lack of a social system and other institutions makes it difficult," said embassy secretary Kathrine Walentin Jensen of the Danish Embassy in Moscow. She added, however, that Denmark does not yet regard Russia as a safe asylum country and this means that we do not automatically return asylum-seekers who come to Denmark from Russia. Same Rights If Russian refugee authorities approve the applications of the asylum-seekers from such areas as Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia who are currently registered with the UN Office of High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) here in Moscow, the 10,000 families will theoretically obtain the same rights as Russia's other inhabitants. "We hope that a procedure can be established for processing the 10,000 cases we have registered within a month's time," said Lawrence Jolles of UNHCR in Moscow. The Danish Embassy in Moscow revealed that it has not received any asylum requests from Tamil refugees. The embassy receives an average of two requests for asylum and five requests from those wishing to be reunited with their families a month. Most of the requests come from Iraqis and Somalis respectively. The number of Russians seeking Danish visas rose by 25 percent in 1993. At present the figure is stable at around 1,500-1,600 a month.
