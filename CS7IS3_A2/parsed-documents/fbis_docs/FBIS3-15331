Alexandr Udaltsev, senior official in charge of relations with the Baltics at the Russian Foreign Ministry, said his country had no intention to cause any protraction over determining the date for the next round of negotiations. He said protraction was "not in Russia's interests." The diplomat said his country now had to decide as quickly as possible on how to act. Udaltsev said Russia might well return to the earlier suggested Aug. 31 deadline for the withdrawal of its troops from Estonia if "the Estonian party abides by the conditions already on several occasions quoted by Russia." "It is necessary that the Estonian party took into consideration the minimum interests of Russia, and then we will be ready to meet them halfway over the deadlines," he said. Udaltsev reiterated the importance Russia gives to the issue of its retired military living in Estonia. "We cannot go away leaving them in a state of being let down. We are expected to cut the terms of the troop withdrawal, and Estonia wishes that a considerable deal of these people left together with the troops. This is a prospect we cannot accept," he said. He said it would be "very sad and shortsighted" if Estonia declared breaking off the talks. He mentioned that "refusing from negotiations is a senseless thing to do in any situation, they must go on and continue under whatever circumstances except for the very extreme ones." Commenting of the topic of the deadline for the pullout of troops from the Estonian territory, Udaltsev claimed that Russia was "not shifting any deadlines." He said that taking the suggested date of Aug. 31 as a formal deadline was a mistake that emerged largely due the activity of Russia's partners in the talks. Udaltsev said the delegations since last November had "discussed the possibility to withdraw troops by Aug. 31," and that this had just been a position for the talks. Russia told nobody about it, never took an obligation, the diplomat said, adding that the date existed nowhere in the CSCE and U.N. documents on the issue. He said there had existed a position for the negotiating process, which was linked to certain circumstances. These circumstances, in his words, have passed by the present moment, and, along with them, the negotiating position passed. "One can return to it and consider it anew," he added. Udaltsev said Russia under international resolutions had taken the obligation to pull its troops out "quickly, in an organized and orderly manner," and, as the resolutions emphasize, according to the respective agreements. He said these agreements were clearly named in the resolution of a foreign ministers meeting that took place in Rome at the end of last year. These are the agreements on the troop withdrawal, on social security guarantees for retired military, and, he added, also mentioned there is an agreement on the radar station at Skrunda, Latvia. "Our partners must read these resolutions with more attention and freshen the memory about by whom, where and what kind and obligations were taken," he said. He reminded that Russia so far had brought only forward the final date for its troop withdrawal -- starting from 1999, and finishing with 1994. Commenting on Estonia's reaction to his own remarks over the recent period, Udaltsev said it seemed to him that Estonia only needed "some kind of pretext." In his words Estonians had understood that they are entering a new round of negotiations without any serious baggage, and, therefore, had decided to make a sensation out of his remarks. The two countries should not waste their time seeking faults with each other but must simply sit down at a table and seriously look for a compromise, the Russian diplomat concluded.
