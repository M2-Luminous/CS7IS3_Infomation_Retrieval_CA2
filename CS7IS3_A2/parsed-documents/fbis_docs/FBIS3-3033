Jiang made the call when he participated in separate group discussions attended by deputies to the National People's Congress from Fujian, Qinghai and Liaoning Provinces. "Leading officials should learn more about basic Marxist economic theories, especially Deng Xiaoping's economic thinking, and general knowledge about the market economy," he said. Jiang described studying economics as "an urgent task." "Many party and government officials used to work in the fields of natural sciences and engineering," he said. "Today, however, they are taking the reins of economic development at central and local levels. They need to `make up' their missed lessons." In his talks with the deputies, Jiang also stressed two major issues: development of rural economy and development of large and medium-sized state enterprises. "Now that our goal has been set and major policies decided, the key to achieving success is to get down to work in a concerted way," he said. "Nationwide, we should always pay priority attention to two major issues. One is the rural economy; and the other is large and medium-sized state enterprises." Jiang called on Fujian Province to improve its investment environment to attract more capital influx from Taiwan and overseas Chinese. When he was with Qinghai deputies, Jiang emphasized the importance of maintaining unity among all nationalities in the province and the need for the province to exploit its natural resources in an efficient way. Liaoning in northeast China has a concentration of state enterprises. The province has adopted a policy of invigorating such enterprises mainly by way of technology upgrading. Jiang expressed appreciation of the policy. The state president also praised Liaoning for achieving self- sufficiency in grain and foodstuffs.
