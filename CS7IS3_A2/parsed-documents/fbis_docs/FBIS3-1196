However, the communique shows that President Habyarimana has created new obstacles. Among them we can mention those related to the Liberal Party [PL] ministers and the question of the Islamic Democratic Party [PDI] deputies. The other question raised by President Habyarimana is that of the Coalition for the Defense of the Republic [CDR]. Concerning the PL's minister, President Habyarimana is said to have asked Faustin Twagiramungu to continue talks with PL officials so that the justice ministerial post goes to the faction which has five deputies, namely Mugenzi's [PL chairman and Habyarimana ally] faction, claiming that this was agreed at the meeting he chaired on 27 February. Now that President Habyarimana has given an order to Twagiramungu, why does Twagiramungu have to meet PL officials? This clearly means that President Habyarimana is denying Faustin Twagiramungu the freedom of choice that was bestowed on him by the Arusha peace agreement. He is giving him orders on how to select and fill posts. It is worth recalling that President Habyarimana continues to torpedo the peace agreement. The agreement only allows him to preside over the swearing-in ceremonies and not to interfere with what does not concern him. Maybe he believes agreements are still mere pieces of paper. With regard to deputies, President Habyarimana went too far. In the communique issued by the presidency, President Habyarimana is said to have asked Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana to ensure that hindrances to the inclusion of the CDR in the National Assembly are removed. What can remove these obstacles? First, the CDR has not signed the political parties' code of ethics. One may recall how the CDR refused to sign that code. It does not even qualify to sign the code since it is against its contents. Since the signing of the Arusha agreement, the CDR has been promoting division and misunderstanding among Rwandans. In fact it should be banned. However, it will die a natural death since it owes its existence to the dictatorship. Once the dictatorship disappears, the CDR will disappear because it will have no platform and no audience. Habyarimana, who wants a seat for the CDR in the National Assembly, should remember that we do not need a transition to destroy the country, we need one to build it. He is once again interfering in questions that do not concern him. He is not responsible for the issue of deputies. The same thing applies to the PDI. Habyarimana has asked Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana to ensure that the PDI deputy has the support of the party. He wants to do the same thing he is doing in regard to the PL. The candidate who was elected a long time ago [words indistinct] 37 days, would be replaced by Habyarimana with one chosen recently with the help of a small group of his supporters in the PDI. [passage omitted] President Habyarimana's readiness to preside over the swearing-in ceremonies on 24 March is no different from his readiness to preside over the swearing-in ceremonies on the other dates he suggested. Perhaps he hopes his wishes will be respected through terror. These days he uses terrorism. He showed it in the communique. He said he expressed his dissatisfaction to Faustin Twagiramungu over the bad language used in his address announcing the list of ministers. Judging from the contents of the communique, one wonders whether Habyarimana is really seeking to implement the Arusha agreement or whether he just wants Rwandans' problems to remain. It is clear that he is capable of this. No one will extricate Rwandans from the current situation; they will have to do it themselves.
