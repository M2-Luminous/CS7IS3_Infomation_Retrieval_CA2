FR941230-2-00092 FR941230-2-00053 Mine Safety and Health Administration Petitions for Modification This notice amends a petition document published in the Federal Register on December 8, 1994 (59 FR 63382), docket numbers M&hyph;94&hyph;166&hyph;C and M&hyph;94&hyph;167&hyph;C, to correct the name of the county where the mine is located. The Energy West Mining Company, Trail Mountain Mine is located in Emery County, Utah. The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 1. L. V. Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;173&hyph;C] L. V. Coal Company, 235 Second Street, Joliett, Pennsylvania 17981 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.360 (preshift examination) to its No. 4 Slope Vein (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08014) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to examine each seal for physical damage from the slope gunboat during the preshift examination after an air quantity reading is taken in by the intake portal and to test for the quantity and quality of air at the intake air split locations off the slope in the gangway portion of the working section. The petitioner proposes to physically examine the entire length of the slope once a month. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 2. L. V. Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;174&hyph;C] L. V. Coal Company, 235 Second Street, Joliett, Pennsylvania 17981 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1), (4) and (5) (weekly examination) to its No. 4 Slope Vein (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08014) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous conditions and roof falls, certain areas of the intake haulage slope and primary escapeway cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to examine these areas from the gunboat/slope car with an alternative air quality evaluation at the section's intake level, and to travel and thoroughly examine these areas for hazardous conditions once a month. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 3. L. V. Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;175&hyph;C] L. V. Coal Company, 235 Second Street, Joliett, Pennsylvania 17981 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1100&hyph;2(a) (quantity and location of firefighting equipment) to its No. 4 Slope Vein (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08014) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use only portable fire extinguishers to replace existing requirements where rock dust, water cars, and other water storage are not practical. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 4. L. V. Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;176&hyph;C] L. V. Coal Company, 235 Second Street, Joliett, Pennsylvania 17981 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1200 (d) and (i) (mine map) to its No. 4 Slope Vein (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08014) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use cross-sections instead of contour lines through the intake slope, at locations of rock tunnel connections between veins, and at 1,000 feet intervals of advance from the intake slope and to limit the mapping of mine workings above and below to those present within 100 feet of the vein being mined except when veins are interconnected to other veins beyond the 100 feet limit through rock tunnels. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 5. L. V. Coal Company [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;176&hyph;C] L. V. Coal Company, 235 Second Street, Joliett, Pennsylvania 17981 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1202&hyph;1(a) (temporary notations, revisions, and supplements) to its No. 4 Slope Vein (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08014) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to revise and supplement mine maps on an annual basis instead of the required 6 month interval and to update maps daily by hand notations. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.
