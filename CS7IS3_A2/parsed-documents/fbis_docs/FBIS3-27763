Some people observe that North Korea is intentionally delaying negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] by considering the beginning time of the exercise. In the event satisfactory progress is not made in nuclear inspection negotiations with North Korea, the Team Spirit exercise will be conducted -- even in the later part of the year. Yi Kang- tok reports: [Begin Yi recording] A relevant government official revealed that if no progress is made in negotiations for solution of the North Korean nuclear issue, the Team Spirit exercise, which usually begins around February, may be conducted in autumn this year. The official said that no concrete preparation for this year's Team Spirit have been initiated up to present, unlike other years. If a decision is made on conducting the exercise, it can possibly begin with only one month of preparations. Therefore, the observation that if the ROK and the United States fail to decide on conducting the Team Spirit by next month, this year's Team Spirit exercise would be spontaneously canceled is erroneous. Some people recently viewed that as the Team Spirit exercise usually begins at end of February, the exercise will be not conducted after that period and the reason North Korea is delaying and not showing sincerity in nuclear inspection negotiations, is related to the time of conducting the exercise. The official added that if North Korea is positive toward resolving the nuclear issue, including acceptance of IAEA inspections, suspension of the Team Spirit can be announced in accordance with the agreement between the United States and North Korea late last year.
