The working group was charged with drafting this resolution. A resolution of the Supreme Council "On the implementation of the resolution by the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 20 May 1994 `On terminating the effect of the Law of the Republic of Crimea,' `On the restoration of the constitutional fundamentals of statehood of the Republic of Crimea'" was approved after its new wording had been discussed. It indicates that the resolution by the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 20 May 1994, in that part of it which stipulates the termination of the effect of the above Law of the Republic of Crimea, is valid. The resolution determines that the Supreme Council of Crimea failed to fulfill the demands stipulated by the resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine "On putting into effect the law of Ukraine `On introducing amendments and additions to the Law of Ukraine,' `On the status of the autonomous Republic of Crimea'" of 30 June 1992 which did not allow to put this Law into effect. The commission for issues of legal policy and judicial and legal reform was charged with submitting in two weeks' time a resolution for the consideration of the Supreme Council on bringing the entire legislation of Crimea in line with the legislation of Ukraine. The president of Ukraine, as a guarantor of the Constitution of Ukraine, was proposed to submit within six days a list and sequence of measures which stem from the Constitution and the current legislation of Ukraine and which can be taken by the bodies of state power of Ukraine. Also considered at the sitting was the proposal by the president of Ukraine, which was contained in his message to parliament, on the inexpediency of holding the elections to the president and local self-government bodies on 26 June. Oleksandr Moroz submitted a draft resolution envisaging that postponement of the election is inexpedient. However, the majority of deputies were inclined to the need for more substantial consideration of this issue in the groups and commissions. Some of the deputies proposed that the presidential election and the election of the chairmen of the oblast councils be cancelled and elections at other levels be held. Mykhaylo Kosiv of Rukh [People's Movement of Ukraine] emphasized the need to introduce amendments and additions to the Law on local self-government before the 26 June elections and thus remove Leonid Kravchuk's arguments about their inexpediency. Representatives of the communists' group supported the holding of elections and proposed that Leonid Kravchuk "meet the day of his defeat worthily." It was resolved to postpone consideration of this issue and the adoption of a decision on this issue till the morning sitting on 2 June. At the request of the provisional credentials committee "in connection with new facts concerning the election of Volodymyr Hrynyov and Pavlo Kudyukin as people's deputies of Ukraine" it was decided to give the commission another week to ascertain the results of the election. During this week the commission is to pay a second visit to the electoral districts.
