I thank you for the confidence that you have renewed in me, not only because of my victory, but especially for the political maturity that you have displayed through your massive participation in this first multiparty election and your calmness and tranquillity during the elections. This good example was well noted by the impartial observers. This is again to the credit of the Guinean people. I sincerely thank the entire Guinean people for this. I extend my sincere gratitude particularly to all those who contributed to the smooth organization of the elections. I particularly have in mind activists and supporters of the Party for Unity and Progress [PUD], the party which chose me as its humble presidential candidate, as well as activists and supporters of other parties and associations that supported my candidacy. Finally my gratitude goes to all anonymous persons who do not belong to any political parties or associations but who placed their confidence in me. Dear compatriots, in this regard I do not want to represent a particular family, ethnic group, or region. I want to be the humble servant of all Guineans wherever they are and whatever their social category. I want all Guineans to know that I will never consider the unfavorable votes of some compatriots as the expression of hostility against my person. On the contrary, I consider the expression of difference an indispensable element for strengthening democracy which I have resolutely introduced into our country. I wish that this viewpoint as well as the determination to build national unity through work and education will be shared by all the actors in the political life of our country. Never will I consider my seven competitors as my enemies but as indispensable actors in the democratic process. During my mandate, I will devote most of my energies and experience to the service of Guineans and our fatherland Guinea. In this task of nation building which we will accomplish together, I will need the ideas, competence, and know-how of each and everyone of you. This is why I am making a solemn appeal to all persons of goodwill, regardless of their political leanings, to join in building Guinea, for in my view, the victory of the PUD candidate is not the victory of one fraction of Guineans against another. It is the victory of all Guinean people over their agonies and over all the insidious forms of social disintegration. It is now up to all cadres to be responsible for safeguarding the presitge of our nation and the existence of the state by showing our people the highest degree of tolerance. Tolerance, which was the motto of my electoral campaign, is for me the most beautiful and the highest of all virtues. Nothing is possible in society without this human quality. It is a precondition for all relationships between men. Those who describe tolerance as a sign of weakness should know that tolerance does not leave out any ideal. It is a virtue whose force resides in the respect of others. Dear compatriots, one condition that will enable us to confidently begin this new page in the history of our country is for all political leaders to come together and together set up a solid foundation for a democratic society. For my part, and within the framework of the already defined conditions, I am open to dialogue, consultations, and cooperation with all Guineans of goodwill, regardless of their political leanings. Dear compatriots, the important changes that we undertook in all fields, should be pursued with more rigor and cohesion so as to confer more efficiency to our action. As I have said on several occasions, during my term of office, I will strive to pursue -- with your help -- the social program that was initiated in 1984 and that I proposed to concretize in December 1985. Of course, I will continue to proceed with the necessary assessments in order to readjust it and make the necessary changes. Therefore, priority sectors remain the same such as the strengthening of national unity to ensure the prevalence of peace in our country, the consolidation of a law-abiding state, and the respect of republican institutions. Dear compatriots, I am well aware of the importance of the tasks ahead, some of which deserve special attention. The war against delinquency and insecurity will be resolutely and firmly waged. We should know that this fight is the duty of each and every one of us. Families, schools, communes, and prefectures should play their role as educationists. All in all, the state will assume its responsibilities to maintain public order and to ensure the security of citizens. Fellow Guineans, the fact that the international economic circumstances are becoming more and more difficult has also led our country to be confronted with the painful problem of unemployment. At that level, the struggle to create a maximum of jobs requires the involvement of all our financial backers. We should facilitate their participation in order to achieve these objectives. To do so, we have to take global measures capable of making it easier for them to revamp the private sector and thus generate new jobs. In this framework, there is the need to be adapted to the labor market. Young graduates in search of jobs will have to benefit from the preferential recruitment quota on the basis of qualification criteria required by the employer. Our equipment and territorial development policy will particularly stress the solution of energy problems and the development of communication infrastructure in order to make the remote areas accessible. We must never forget that our prosperity depends mainly on the farmer. Helping the farmer to efficiently formulate factors of production and continuing to protect him from arbitrary fixing of prices of his produce are some of my main concerns. He must be encouraged in his fight to make our country self-sufficient in food production. These objectives cannot be attained without ensuring moral probity in the management of public affairs. I will personally watch over this. In order to implement this program, I place my great hope in women and young people, the active forces of the society. This is an occasion to salute the important role played by women and young people in all our achievements so far. I would like to remind them that we are looking forward to their contribution. It will be decisive in the successful implementation of the socioeconomic program that we have assigned ourselves. People of Guinea, in addition to the great efforts that we have to make in developing our country, we need the support of our traditional partners and the international community. We thank them for the assistance they have given us in the implementation of our democratization process. Fellow Guineans, your trust gives me a new force that I am determined to put to the service of our dear fatherland. All we need now is to accept our differences and reach a national consensus on the strategies and stakes for the country's economic development. In this connection, we must learn to resolve our problems ourselves without being discourteous. This means we must get down to work. Our ambition to be a strong, united, and prosperous nation calls for this attitude. Long live democracy. Long live the Republic.
