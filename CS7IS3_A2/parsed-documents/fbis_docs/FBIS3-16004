Radio Slavyanka's questions are answered by Yuriy Kobaladze, head of the service's press bureau. Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service has only existed as an independent organization since the end of 1991, when it was hived off from the KGB. Has this separation proved justified? [Kobaladze] I am convinced that it was justified. Several factors show that this move was the correct one. First, an intelligence service can never be a law enforcement agency. Its existence within the KGB, as it was then, meant that the intelligence service was expected to perform law enforcement functions. An intelligence service should not carry out such work. An intelligence service is a completely separate and independent organization, which performs a special, unique form of work. [Correspondent] But clearly, there must be some kind of legislative framework regulating the activities of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, stipulating the bounds beyond which its officers must not stray in their work. [Kobaladze] Yes, we are very proud of the fact that a law on foreign intelligence was adopted last year for the first time in Russia's history. This document was very carefully drafted. A great deal of preparatory work was done, and our experts were brought in to help. Everything that exists elsewhere in the world in this sphere was analyzed. It transpired that, basically, there is only one country, the United States, that has developed legislation in this sphere, a clearcut law that regulates the activities of the intelligence service. After taking all this experience, all this international, world experience, and modifying it, parliament adopted the law. We believe it is a very good law. [Correspondent] The Russian Federation's law on foreign intelligence clearly defines the powers and responsibilities of intelligence officers and stipulates the need for parliamentary control over their activities. What else does Yuriy Kobaladze regard as being fundamentally new in this document? [Kobaladze] I also wish to emphasize the fact that party influence in the intelligence service has been completely removed, and this requirement is now enshrined in law. In other words, an intelligence officer cannot be a member of any party, cannot get involved in party activities. Furthermore, the service has been de-ideologized. In other words, we in the intelligence service do not serve the interests of any party grouping or ideology, as it were. We have only one ideology: defense of the country's national interests, serving the fatherland, serving the lawfully elected authorities, and serving the constitution. We do not have any other ideology.
