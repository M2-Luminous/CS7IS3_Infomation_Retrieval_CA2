This statement was made to journalists today by Aleksey Prigarin, leader of the Union of Communists, who talked about the results of the meeting of the ruling bodies of all-Russia communist parties, held at the end of last year. The meeting, he pointed out, proclaimed the start of the consolidation of the previously uncoordinated and extremely small All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the Russian Communist Workers' Party, the Russian Party of Communists, the Union of Communists, and the Leninist Platform in the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation]. According to Aleksey Prigarin, the basis for the consolidation of these forces was provided by their common stance on the December elections and referendum. Particular attention was devoted by the news conference organizers to an exposition of their view on the stance adopted by the CPRF leadership, given the conditions actually existing in Russia. As Aleksey Prigarin put it, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, headed by Gennadiy Zyuganov, had, in effect, adopted social-democratic positions. Aleksey Prigarin decribed the emergent Union's relations with the CPRF as "amicably hostile."
