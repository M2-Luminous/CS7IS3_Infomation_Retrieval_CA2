The situation has now changed and the session has been postponed and will not be opened in the near future. On 8 March, the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee held a joint meeting of secretaries of various central departments and commissions, and of party committees of various provinces, municipalities, and regions. The meeting was chaired by Ding Guangen and Hu Jintao, who, on behalf of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat, announced the decision to postpone the convocation of the fourth plenary session. Hu Jintao discussed the reasons for postponing the convocation of the fourth plenary session and about the Central Committee's policy for work in future. Hu Jintao said that the convocation of the session had been postponed after taking the following six issues into consideration: Hu Jintao on Six Major Issues Causing the Postponement of the Session 1. The CPC Central Committee, the State Council, the National People's Congress Standing Committee, various central departments, ministries, commissions, and offices, and various provinces, municipalities, and regions should have an identical appraisal of the current political, economic, and social situation. (This implies there is not yet any identical appraisal.) 2. The anticipated goal of anticorruption work, the central task put forward by the Central Committee, has not yet been attained and the situation is grim. 3. The pressure of inflation -- the focus of society -- is intensifying and the central authorities and various localities have published or are to publish controversial or different views on measures and policies for reform. 4. Some time is still needed for various central departments, ministries, commissions, offices, and localities to thoroughly understand the resolutions and guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. 5. There is a gap in the knowledge and understanding of the establishment and development of the socialist market economy between various central departments, ministries, commissions, offices, and localities. Subjective and objective obstacles still exist in the course of implementation and promotion. 6. There are no concrete measures for overcoming, correcting, and resolving the mountain-stronghold mentality, selfish departmentalism, and anarchy in localities and departments. As a result, central policies and measures cannot be comprehensively and correctly implemented in good time. Hu Jintao said that the Central Committee holds that the fourth session of the party is to solve some practical problems, to discuss and adopt some necessary resolutions, policies, principles, and measures, and to sum up matters which the last plenary session of the Central Committee wanted to resolve or implement, and make those matters clear to the whole party and all the people of the whole country and that the session should not become a mere formality. Ding Guangen: Central Policies and Principles Are Damaged Ding Guangen said at the meeting that a major question is how various central departments, ministries, commissions, offices, party committees of various provinces, municipalities, and regions, and leadership of governments should comprehensively and thoroughly understand and grasp central guidelines for work and how they should conscientiously maintain a high degree of unity with the central authorities. We must take a stand on party character, the state's cause, and the people's interests and conscientiously safeguard the authority of the Central Committee and the State Council. This is a reliable guarantee and foundation ensuring the victory of our cause and our advance toward the new era. It cannot be denied that because of the expansion of individualism, the mountain-stronghold mentality, and anarchy in the leadership of some localities, the implementation of central policies and principles has been damaged. This has resulted in mistakes in work, it has objectively brought instability into society, has interfered and affected to varying degrees the work of the central authorities with construction as the core and progress in reform and opening, and has given rise to perplexities and pressure in the formulation of policies by the central authorities. Jiang Zemin: Localities Should Maintain a High Degree of Unity With the Central Authorities When the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee were in session, Jiang Zemin and other members of the Political Bureau and its Standing Committee separately talked with the number one and number two men of various provinces, municipalities, and regions and stressed that various localities should keep in closer touch with the central authorities, let the central authorities know better what they are doing, have a thorough understanding of the guidelines of the central authorities, and maintain a high degree of unity with the central authorities. Jiang Zemin and Wen Jiabao told leading party and government officials of Sichuan at a meeting on 10 March: The most important thing at present is for various localities to have a thorough understanding of the guidelines of the central authorities and by no means should each go his own way making the central authorities a mere figurehead. Jiang Zemin told leading party and government officials of Shanghai Municipality and Jiangsu Province: From now on, officials of the central authorities should meet officials of various localities more often, keep in closer touch with various localities, let various localities know what the central authorities are doing, and hold more small meetings with localities. We can go to various localities to meet local officials or ask them to come to Beijing for the meetings. This can solve problems faster and more effectively. This shows that the CPC Central Committee is no longer able to command localities and localities simply do not listen to the central authorities. It is already difficult to implement and carry out central guidelines, principles, or policies, and there are numerous contradictions between the central authorities and localities. Things are like this even when the chief architect is still living. We can imagine how the relations between the CPC Central Committee and various dukes or princes will become once the chief architect has gone to join the premier.
