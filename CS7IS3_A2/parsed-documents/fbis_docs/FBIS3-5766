The permission was granted on condition that they close their existing representative offices in the nation, the ministry said. When the insurance companies obtain approval from the government after completing the procedure of investment by foreigners, they will be able to establish agents who are allowed to sell policies issued by domestic insurance companies. The agents are required to conclude contracts with domestic insurance companies to sell policies on their behalf. But the agents are not allowed to sell policies issued by foreign insurance companies, the ministry said.
