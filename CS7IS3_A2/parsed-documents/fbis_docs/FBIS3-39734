But speaking in Edinburgh at the start of engagements in Scotland, he said his optimism was heavily qualified with caution. However Mr Major added that the situation in Bosnia had "greatly improved" in the last 24 hours. "A large number of heavy weapons have been handed in and have been corralled, and are now under UN control" he said. "That has been happening for two days now. It seems to be accelerating so it is certainly looking quite good at the moment." Mr Major, who had earlier met Scottish business leaders, said: "I think it is everyone's hope air strikes can be avoided. "The purpose of threatening air strikes was to stop the bombardment of Sarajevo and bring the heavy weapons under control. "If that can be done by negotiation, and it seems possible -- we can't yet be certain that it will be, but it seems possible that it might -- that is clearly very good news." The prime minister said he was "very pleased" at the Russian's intervention in the former Yugoslavia. "The Russians are a member of the permanent five of the Security Council and have a very considerable influence in that role, and a very considerable historical influence and relationship with the Serbs. I think their involvement is bound to be helpful and I welcome it." He declined to say if he had persuaded President Yeltsin to take the decisive step during his visit to Russia earlier this week, but agreed he discussed Bosnia with him. "I certainly express the view both privately and publicly that it was helpful for Russia, the U.S., and the European Community separately to use their influence and I am delighted the Russians are doing that." Mr Major said he had no fears that the United Nations would be unable to control the Russian forces in Bosnia. "I would have no concern about that at all," Mr Major said in interviews for the BBC and Scottish Television. "When the Russian forces arrive they will be part and parcel of the general command structure and I have no doubt at all they will come under UN control and make a material contribution." Changes in Russia in recent years have been profound and it was in everyone's interests to support the Russians, he said. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said his country was discussing with the UN how many Russian troops would be deployed around Sarajevo. He would know the figure "in a matter of hours".
