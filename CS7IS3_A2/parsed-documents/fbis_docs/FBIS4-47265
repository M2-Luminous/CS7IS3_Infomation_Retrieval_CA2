During production, the off gases from the oxidation stage are cycloned and vented to the atmosphere. These gases contain harmful organic substances in both the vapor and dispersed phases. The vapor phase consists mainly of durol and its oxidation products, while the dispersed phase contains organic dust particles (2.1 microns, average size) and consists of pyromellitic acid dianhydride (74-80 percent), 4,5- methylphthalic (12-14 percent), trimethyl, formyltrimellitic, and 4-methylphthalic, acid anhydrides and other substances. The dispersed phase is a pyrophoric substance which causes combustion and explosions in places where the dust accumulates. One of the least energy consuming methods for purging the off gases of organic matter is thermocatalysis. In the present work a three- stage scheme for treating the off gases is examined. The gases are passed sequentially through a blender-separator, a plate catalytic reactor, and a fluidized bed reactor (iron-chromium oxide catalyst). Design characteristics for the equipment and the results of industrial testing are presented. The off gases were 50 to 100 percent purged of pyromellitic acid dianhydride and other pollutants, depending on the operating conditions. Figures 3; references 5 (Russian).
