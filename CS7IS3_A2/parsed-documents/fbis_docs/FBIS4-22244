Kashpirovskiy, who has been abroad across the ocean for many months, addressed the State Duma with his own message, informing it from far-off America of his intention to leave the membership of the parliamentary faction of the LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia]. During the pre-electoral campaign, much ink was spilled over the somewhat strange alliance between the first Russian liberal, V. V. Zhirinovskiy, and the television hypnotist who successfully rid progressive mankind of enuresis [incontinency]. There was even some talk that Kashpirovskiy either secretly hypnotized voters or, at least, taught V. V. Zhirinovskiy the art of giving a post-hypnotic suggestion from the television screen. Now, however, the correspondence-deputy A. Kashpirovskiy, as they affirm, has seen the light, seeing, in his words, the contrast between the pre-electoral program of the LDPR which was humane in its essenceand the provocational position of its leader, V. V. Zhirinovskiy. He, Kashpirovskiy, they say, was always totally in favor of respect for national and religious rights, of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of foreign states, and of free education and medical care. Zhirinovskiy, however, having reneged on his former promises, preaches national intolerance, sows dissention and provokes military conflicts. In short, Kashpirovskiy has decided to divorce himself not so much from the LDPR as from V. V. Zhirinovskiy, since the latter has betrayed the declared ideals. However, today one does not exist without the other, and that, evidently, is why Kashpirovskiy is leaving the liberal-democratic faction. As it became clear, if the psychotherapist had known that departure from the faction does not mean automatic expulsion from the State Duma, he would have taken this step long ago. It turns out that even prophets are not given everything to know. Then again, we cannot exclude the possibility that Kashpirovskiy simply wants to call attention to himself once again, in the style of that very same Zhirinovskiy.
