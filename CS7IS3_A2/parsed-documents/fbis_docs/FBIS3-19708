Confronted with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, which, by winning a 35-billion-franc [Fr] contract in Saudi Arabia, have demonstrated the formidable political and diplomatic support they receive from the White House, the partners in Airbus Industrie will have to find a suitable response. Just like they will have to defend tooth and nail what they gained from the agreement of July 1992, which put a ceiling on reimbursable advances paid to Airbus and indirect aid received by American companies. In this difficult international context, the improvement in Aerospatiale's accounts brings a note of optimism to its President Louis Gallois. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] In 1993, Aerospatiale managed to reduce its losses compared to the previous year by almost half. What is your comment on this result. [Gallois] The improvement in the accounts is certainly insufficient -- we are still making a substantial loss -- but it is significant. This is all the more true since it is taking place against the background of a deteriorated economic climate. With sales down 4.5 percent, the operating results and the net results have improved by almost Fr1 billion. The need for operating capital has shrunk considerably, thus making it possible to reduce the net debt by Fr3.2 billion before the capital appropriation of Fr2 billion. These figures reflect the effort made by everyone in the company. They show the company's ability to adapt to a difficult period, and that is a highly encouraging sign for the future. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] From time to time voices are heard calling for a change in the legal structure of the Airbus Industrie consortium in order to turn it into a genuine, more efficient company. Do you share this concern? [Gallois] I would reiterate that, in the space of 20 years, the Airbus consortium has taken 30 percent of the world market in airliners with more than 100 seats. Airbus must adapt to the growth in its sector of activity and stay competitive when confronted with competitors, who are not inactive. To do that, it is essential that its industrial partners reduce their costs, which should encourage them to improve cooperation. Many things can be done in this respect without changing the legal structure. If serious obstacles were to arise to the needed progress, and if they justified a change in the status of the consortium, we would have to look into it, but then we would have to be sure that it was worth the trouble, because it would be an enormous task. I sometimes get the feeling that I am watching an ideological debate. Let us be pragmatic, and open! [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Could the European aviation sector be weakened by the Italian Alenia group's plan to take a stake in the capital of McDonnell Douglas? [Gallois] That is a good question. We are working closely with Alenia, with whom we share the ATR [Regional Transport Aircraft] consortium, which accounts for a major share of their work load. I have always regretted the fact that Alenia was not part of Airbus. However, to get the Italians to enter now would require a new program. The future large military transport plane, the FLA, which will be the subject of international cooperation, could provide the right occasion for bringing the Italians closer to European aviation. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] The Saudi contract of mid-February, which will entail the purchase by Saudi Airlines of some 50 Boeing and McDonnell Douglas airliners, caused indignation on the part of the Airbus partners, who were excluded from the contract because of the highly political campaign waged by the United States. How do you analyze this affair? [Gallois] The airplanes were sold a little like how military aircraft are sold. There has always been political intervention on the occasion of government visits, for example, but within certain limits. This time, the announcement of the contract was made by President Clinton himself. The White House publicly confirmed its role and Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown said that he himself negotiated directly with Riyadh. He also affirmed that the same thing would happen again in the future. The important thing is not to say whether this is good or bad, but to learn the lesson. For us in Europe, it means that we have to adjust our behavior and set up a device making it possible to act the same way as the Americans. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] The GATT member states are meeting from 12 to 15 April in Marrakesh to sign the agreements on the Uruguay Round. It is known that the aviation issue was not handled in the way the Europeans would have liked, because of opposition from the United States, and it is still pending... [Gallois] The GATT talks have demonstrated one thing, for lack of coming to a close: The Americans want to eliminate the reimbursable advances given to the partners in Airbus Industrie, but refuse to exercise any control over the indirect aid received by their own aircraft manufacturers. We want exactly the opposite. We want to see the reimbursable advances legitimized, as was provided for in an U.S.-European agreement of July 1992 on airplanes with more than 10 seats, and the control of indirect aid. We must set up indicators to assess the financing of upstream research practiced in the United States. This is not always easy, but there are objective data such as the NASA budget. We must also reach an agreement on the basis for making the calculation. NASA, for example, spends large amounts of money on research into the future supersonic aircraft, which has a significant impact on many of the technologies currently used, but the United States refuses to consider this money to be indirect aid as defined in the agreement of July 1992 because there is no formal program for developing a supersonic aircraft. We are proposing, in effect, to take advantage of the Marrakesh meeting to launch the negotiations, which are provided for in the agreements concluded on 15 December in Geneva. It must not be forgotten that Japan and Canada share the European view: To perpetuate and elaborate the 1992 agreement for indirect aid. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] However, we get the impression that we in Europe are still at the "we have to..." stage with regard to the United States, without actually adopting a firm position. [Gallois] The concept of a united Europe is not so easy to put into practice in our sector: We have to display a lot of pedagogical talent in order to convince certain countries of the importance of the stakes and to really activate European solidarity. The Saudi affair could be an important factor in this. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What do you recommend for making the European system of reimbursable advances evolve toward the American system of indirect support? [Gallois] Economically speaking, reimbursable advances are a good solution for providing financing because they involve the sharing of risks between the companies and the governments, and oblige the former to pay back the sums received. Thus, Aerospatiale pays back every year several hundred million francs. Rather than completely abandoning an intelligent system for another one, we should try to strike a balance between the two, which is what is stipulated in the 1992 agreement. Aerospatiale currently receives less than 0.5 percent of its research expenditures in indirect aid, whereas the ceiling set by the 1992 agreement is 3 percent of the annual sales of the aeronautics industry, and 4 percent of the sales of the company concerned. So there is room to evolve more toward indirect support without calling into question the concept of reimbursable advances. I would also reiterate that these advances, which were on the order of 60 percent for past programs, were capped at 33 percent by the 1992 agreement.
