It is unusual to scrap an official announcement by a prime minister. However, judging from the fact that this is a deep-rooted issue, it is a rightful decision. It is time for the Hosokawa administration to recognize the severity of the Japanese economy, which is bogged down in the worst recession of the postwar era, and rush to fine-tune economic measures by returning to its original stance of "implementing tax reductions first." There were some doubts about the contents of this tax concept, which Prime Minister Hosokawa announced abruptly, and about the policy making method. A substantial tax increase will thwart economic recovery. The announcement to introduce a welfare tax, which was merely a consumption tax with a different name, was nothing but an attempt to fool the people. There was absolutely no reason to change the name. It is not clear how this concept came about or what kind of decision-making processes were taken. We have to say that the recent announcement, which should have been made only after obtaining the people's understanding, was an unskillful act. Since the official announcement was scrapped, the prime minister should do some soul-searching. On the other hand, we have many doubts about a revised proposal made by the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which fiercely opposed the prime minister's concept. The proposal to turn the welfare tax into an object tax will be linked to freezing revenue from that financial resource. There is a possibility that no rules will be applied to the use of the revenue from the object tax. It is necessary to use every available means to avoid the introduction of an object tax. An income tax reduction will have no meaning unless it is linked to a revision of the tax system, which includes a review of the tax rates. The SDPJ's proposal to turn the consumption tax into a refundable tax is indeed an easygoing way of thinking. Following the scrapping of the prime minister's plan, the government and the ruling coalition parties must first ask themselves what is expected of the Japanese economy now. It seems that the Hosokawa administration's debate over the tax system was being promoted on the precondition that a "tax increase is a must." It is strange that we hardly heard that the debate had been held because of details of the income tax reduction plan. What we should recall is that a large-scale income tax reduction is needed for the Japanese economy, which is in a serious recession, before securing a source of revenue. We have repeatedly said that an income tax reduction amounting to over 6 trillion yen should be introduced first, as a pillar of the government's economic package, and that the consumption tax rate should be raised to six percent when economic recovery becomes apparent. The amount of this tax reduction will be about the same as that of the tax increase. We are certain that the income tax reduction will act as a measure needed for the time being to recover from the recession and to revise the ratio difference between direct and indirect taxes. We need to revise the tax rate difference between direct and indirect taxes so that we are prepared for the advent of an aged society. An introduction of comprehensive economic measures was delayed due to the deadlocked tax debate. There is a possibility that the compilation of a budget for fiscal 1994 will be further delayed unless the tax reduction issue is settled. This delay will have negative impacts on local autonomies' budget compilation too. We cannot ignore its psychological effect on industries either. The Japan-U.S. summit talks are just ahead while both countries are still divided over the issue of setting numeric targets for individual fields. Under such circumstances, we are certain that Japan-U.S. relations will become tense. Regarding the important tax issue, the Hosokawa administration should not rely on a rough-and-ready method again. However, we hope that the same administration will come up with responsible conclusions that are acceptable to the people as soon as possible. We hope that the prime minister, in doing that, will not only listen to the Financial Ministry's narrow-minded financial theories, but will make a decision with an eye on the current severe economic situation and on Japan's future economy. The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] has many politicians who are familiar with the tax system. If it thinks the Japanese economy is in a critical state, the LDP should stop criticizing the Hosokawa administration's blunder. It is the LDP's turn to cross the line of party interests and propose concrete economic measures.
