According to him, such a law would legalize a second land nationalization. But this law was not the main topic at the news conference of the right-wing opposition leader. Vytautas Landsbergis focused his principal attention on a statement adopted by the Homeland Union, the Christian Democratic, Nationalist and Freedom factions in the Seimas on tension in the national defense structure. One of the examples of such tension are searches in the apartments of servicemen, which violate the Constitution and provoke people. One of the main sources of such tension is the activity of the leading group of the present National Security Committee, its chosen unlawful way of exceeding the authorizations of parliamentary control and carrying out functions of the executive power, striving to take over the whole national defense system. He also says that lack of confidence in the chairman of the National Security Committee is rife and that the composition of this committee should be changed. Since the Democratic Labor Party leadership is capitulating to these extremists, stabilizing actions must be taken by the republic's president, he said. To a question on how the composition of the Seimas National Security Committee could be changed, Vytautas Landsbergis replied: In the usual way, like everything else. And if the ruling party does not take such actions, it will bear full responsibility for the consequences. Speaking of the collection of signatures by the Social Democratic faction under an interpellation to the government, the leader of the right-wing opposition said that material collected by the Social Democrats is essential for the analysis of the government's work, but stressed that the Homeland Union favors an interpellation questioning the ruling of the Democratic Labor Party and not of the Slezevicius government. There are no reserves to form a better Democratic Labor Party government, therefore we speak of new elections and not of a change of the government, he said. The Homeland Union intends to take further steps in solving Lithuania's problems, and these steps should be known next week, Landsbergis said. Landsbergis also spoke about the technical errors in the documents signed by the Russian president, stressing that this was an old tactic of Russian foreign policy: To reflect [as heard] and then deny, leaving this reflection in [word indistinct]
