Ramos with domestic correspondents at Malacanang Palace in Manila -- live; passages within slantlines in Tagalog] [Text] [Press Secretary Jesus Sison] Hi, Mr. President. This afternoon, we have the officers of the National Press Club and the new officers of the Philippine Press Institute [PPI]. They will take their oath before you later after the press conference. [Ramos] Good afternoon officials of the National Press Club. Would you rather have the press con [conference] first or would you rather have the induction and the inauguration ahead? [response from the correspondents] Press con /first/, so you are first and foremost journalist and reporters. Yes, in connection with my directive to the acting secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government yesterday to go as deeply and as comprehensively as possible into the killings arising out of the /village/ elections. And when I wrote that directive yesterday, there were 26 that have been reported killed already including two Comelec [Commission on Elections] officials, and today the report is 30. I wanted to make sure that these killings and its incident of violence would be thoroughly investigated so that we could get to the truth of the matter. And for the investigators, the police in collaboration with the Comelec, the DND [Department of National Defense], AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines], and the Department of Justice and NBI [National Bureau of Investigation] would be able to build up its case that would lead to a successful prosecution and the conviction of the guilty as maybe warranted by the evidence. I think it's about time that we reverse this culture of violence connected with elections. And that in our country as in any other democratic representative country, that people don't have to kill or get killed in order to succeed into a political office. We have many bitter lessons of the past which I suppose were part of our maturing into what we are now -- a functioning democracy -- based on people power, based on the decision of the majority of the electorate. And after many years of bloodletting, I think that situation should now be reversed, and present ourselves to the world as a mature, as a democratic, and as a peaceful society. And I would like to reiterate that message in the presence of the leaders of media who are here for a very special occasion. Okay? [Sison] Questions? The members of the officers of the National Press Club and PPI may ask questions. [Laughter from Ramos] [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, good afternoon Sir. [Ramos] Good afternoon. [Unidentified correspondent] The NDF [National Democratic Front] has threatened to pull out from the peace process. Can we get your response about this, sir? [Ramos] Well, so what's new? This isn't the first time they threatened to pull out of the peace process. But we have bent backwards to make sure that every opportunity is given to our long lost brothers and sisters who have (?thread) themselves out of the mainstream of our law-abiding society. And that opportunity is still there, the door is still open. And we are saying that many from the hills are taking advantage of our peace process and availing of our national reconciliation and development program so that they could again lead useful, productive, and join in the development of our country. [sentence as heard] [Unidentified correspondent] Follow-up, sir. When will be the peace talks to resume between the MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] and the government? [Ramos] We are awaiting word from the Indonesian Government because during the month of April when the talks, the second round of talks were scheduled, we were told that they had several state visitors. And that, maybe the month of May, or a little afterwards would be a better time. In any case, that is still very open. [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. President, the new value-added tax [VAT] law removes the exemption previously granted to the book and newspaper publishing industry. Now, with the additional imposition of the 10 percent tax on the newspaper industry in particular would just cause many newspapers to go (?under), to close shop. Is it possible under the terms of the law to ...for the president to suspend the effectivity of this particular provision? [Ramos] We are studying right now the implementation of the expanded VAT law precisely in regard to deferments in general because the original VAT and this amendment to the VAT in effect removed from our revenue books some 75 or 80 impositions. And so, if you take action on one side, there is a counteraction or a possible negative effect on the other. But I think you should be assured that this expanded VAT law was studied over a very long period, over several months in both chambers including in the two panels of the house and the Senate in the conference committee. And the president has no choice in that case except to approve or veto. This is not like the General Appropriations Act where the president can line veto certain items. So, all of this is still under close study in regard to the so-called deferments. [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you, Mr. President. [Ellen Tordesillas] Sir, this morning you met with the Papal Nuncio and I understand he delivered a letter from Pope John Paul II. May we know what was the message from the Pope? [Ramos] Well, at the moment that is still confidential. But it is connected with our support for family planning, which was discussed in the preliminary meeting at the United Nations in New York, to which meeting we sent a delegation headed by Secretary Flavier. On the other hand, the Papal Nuncio also came and I think this is the most important message for all Filipinos, to assure us that the Pope is coming in January 1995 as scheduled in spite of his injury from which he is now fast recovering according to Archbishop Morene, the Papal Nuncio. And I understand that from Archbishop Morene that the Pope is now back at work. So these are very reassuring words for all of us. In fact I have just received from the central committee of the Philippine Preparatory Commission of the Catholic Bishops that there is already out in circulation this brochure [brochure shown to media people] which says the Pope in Manila 1995, and it says here, the Pope is coming to Manila to see you, to see all of us. [Ellen] Sir, is this letter express concern over the ...[pause] your government's population program? [sentence as heard] [Ramos] No. [Ellen) Sir, thank you. [Correspondent identified only as Jake] Sir, just a follow-up question on the peace process. Attorney Veria, the spokesman of your party is seeking [changes thought] is recommending the release of Miss Tiamzon. [Ramos] I think he was just expressing his opinion as a member of one of our peace panels. But, uh,...the PNP [Philippine National Police] should be given an opportunity to follow-up this case to its logical conclusion because after all we are merely following judicial processes under the rules of court. [Jake] How do you find such opinion? [Ramos] Pardon? [Jake] How do you find the...do you think it's worth [question interrupted by Ramos]...? [Ramos] As I said, that is his opinion, perhaps in his personal capacity as a member of one of the peace panels but not as a Lakas [Lakas ng Bansa -- Power of the Nation] spokesman. [Jake] Thank you, sir. [Ramos] After all, as president, and as president of all Filipinos, I need not follow the party line. But that is not the party line, I assure you. [Correspondent identified only as Bobby] Good afternoon, Mr. President. [Ramos] Good afternoon. [Bobby] Yesterday you issued a directive to Customs Commissioner Parayno to follow-up the investigation on a certain Michael Que who was name-dropping at the airport last Friday after bringing in 1 million pesos worth of watches. There have been similar cases in the past of people dropping your name or any other government officials. How would you deal with such people and the officials helping them? [Ramos] Well, the policy is there that I will not allow any such poseurs or influence peddlers to be using my name or that of the first lady or even that of the rest of the first family. But I'm still awaiting the report of the customs commissioner on this because we don't really know the circumstances, so we've asked them to look at this matter. [Bobby] What about the other cases in the past, sir, when there were some people dropping your name, particularly at the airport? [Ramos] First, there were investigations that were conducted. In the case that I recall in which an influence peddler was trying to pose as a party leader using an old campaign calendar that we were circulating during the campaign period with my signature on it, he was upon the investigation, found out to be using that for nefarious purposes. So the police took action. [Bobby] Thank you, sir. [Correspondent identified only as Mike] Good afternoon, Mr. President. [Ramos] Good afternoon. [Mike] How would you assess the ongoing peace initiative of government at this point in time? [Ramos] We have taken a new initiative in the issuance of proclamation 347 and proclamation 348, which, as you already know were issued in late March, 25 March, to be submitted to Congress for ratification. And to their credit, Congress -- both houses -- are thoroughly engaged in consultations even in the countryside on the part of Senator Biazon to determine the people's reactions to these, including from among the possible beneficiaries. And we continue to work closely with those committees of Congress in order to maximize the chances of ratification. In general, that's the situation. On the three fronts, the talks -- whether formal on the part of the military rebels and regard to the MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] -- are continuing. Now, in regard to the CPP- NPA-NDF [Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army- National Democratic Front], we're still at the exploratory talks stage. But as I said we have kept the door open to give everybody the maximum opportunity to dialogue with the government. [Mike] Sir, don't you think that the continued detention of Wilma Tiamzon will not hamper the peace initiative with the communist rebels? [Ramos] Well, as I said, we must follow judicial processes. So, this states the government must hear to the law. The government must adhere to the judicial process that is there. After all, according to the police, there are existing warrants that must be served. [Mike] Thank you, Sir. [Correspondent identified only as Manny] Good afternoon, Mr. President. [Ramos] Good afternoon. [Manny) A top official of the House of Representatives said last week that the passage of the five landmark measures including the restructuring of the value-added tax would lead the freedom of this country from the influence of the IMF in three years time. Mr. President do you have, uh, do you agree with this assessment? [Ramos] Well, there are still certain legislative actions to be taken. One of them is the proposed liberalization of the banking industry in the Philippines. This is one of the structural reforms that has to be put in place before we can really be considered by the international community as open, liberalized, and competitive with a level playing field for the economy to flourish. But I would like to make clear again, because we discussed this during previous meetings, that what we are doing is not because of any IMF imposition. We are doing this because this is what we see as the right direction for the Philippine economy, for the political leadership to take. You will recall that the VAT law, for instance, originated back from the President Cory Administration. And the real VAT law was initiated as early as the first session of the 8th Congress in 1987 that became a law in 1988. And the economic stabilization program, into which we are still up to now, was initiated also about three years ago during the Cory Administration. But we have to see through all of these steps. So that we become really an open economy, not inward and protected, and import-looking kind of an economy. Because obviously the answer to the expansion of our economy and the sustained prosperity of our people in the future is to be into the export mode. The economy must be export-led and investment-led, and tourism- led, instead of us importing all the time goods from other countries. So, this entire program that we are into would lead to sustainable development. But we must finish all of the various components of the structure so that we will be on a sustainable mode, otherwise, we will have this cycle of boom and bust, or up and down, or advance and retreat, as we experienced during the past several decades. But now we have the opportunity to do it. That's why we are pushing, and pushing together with the leaders of Congress and the leaders of the private sector. So that what we have been aspiring for for many years will finally happen. [Manny] On another subject Mr. President. The first quarter of this year has seen the rise in heinous crimes in the city of Manila, including murders and bank robberies. Would you favor Mr. President a more police visibility, like fielding more police foot patrols and conducting saturation drives in crime-ridden areas? [Ramos] Well, the answer is really a much more comprehensive package of actions than just what you are suggesting, although that is part of it. We have thoroughly discussed this with the law enforcement authorities during our recent national summit on peace and order at Camp Crame. The formula really involves the five pillars of the so-called criminal justice system: the police, the prosecution, the judiciary, the corrections, meaning the penology and Bureau of Prisons people. And the fifth is the community -- led by the governors and the mayors in their respective jurisdictions -- plus, the very dedicated participation of the concerned citizenry. So that is what it will take. But in regard to the current situation, as I already reported here, we have asked the Department of Interior and Local Government, which has jurisdiction over the police and local government units to take the lead and to be more thorough and to be more dedicated in getting into the investigation of all of the /village/ election-related violence. Well, that is also true for the thorough investigation of the recent killing of Major Zarcal, of the Philippine National Police. And we must get to the bottom of that, we must get to the truth of the matter because, after all, Zarcal is one of their own. And they are now challenged to come up with a solution of the case and the apprehension of the killers, and for those killers to be brought before the bar of justice. But as I said, the entire anti-crime and peace and order effort requires the interaction and close collaboration of all of these five pillars of our criminal justice system. [Manny] Thank you, Mr. President. [Correspondent identified only as Jun] Good afternoon, Mr. President. This is a follow-up question to that of Mr. Yambot on the recently approved expanded value added tax. This concerns Mr. President the economics of media especially the struggling community press. For the first time, Mr. President in all these years, newspapers will be taxed for the first time and that the broadcast will be taxed for the second time. If you will allow me to trace, Mr. President, the history, until the third to the last regime, all newspapers and radio broadcasting stations were exempted from any tax. During the second to the last regime, the newspapers were left untaxed but the broadcasting stations were taxed. Now, Mr. President, I wonder if you will allow under your regime, both electronics and the print media to be taxed. [Ramos] As I said, I did not pass those laws, and I do not have the power of sectional or partial veto on these laws. But I'll be happy to receive your position from the various sectors of media. By the way, there is a very revealing feature story authored by Senator Herrera -- the author on the part of the Senate -- of this expanded VAT law which explains what this law is all about. And I would suggest, before we start getting too unhappy or demoralized, that we refer to study this. It's a primer really, where he explains the facts and the myths about the VAT law, and there are nine particular issues that he deals with very, very thoroughly, and very objectively in my view. And so I would suggest that that would be a good reading for all of you. But at the same time, as I said, I would welcome your suggestions and proposals because after all, what Congress has put in place, they can also amend. That's all there is to it. But the executive cannot do something beyond what is in the law. [Jun] Mr. President, section 17 of the law provides, empowers the president to exclude some sectors. [Ramos] That's what I said in answer to Danny Yambot here, and that's why I'm saying that we welcome your suggestions so that we can input whatever your opinions are. It will be studied that one maybe. [Jun] Thank you, Mr. President. [Ramos] Thank you. [Correspondent identified only as Vivian] Sir, a while ago you mentioned the killing of Police Major Zarcal. The ABB [Alex Boncayao Brigade] said its objective is to make government look helpless and ineffective in the face of crime and corruption as evidenced by their assassination of Zarcal and their threats to kidnap some government officials and make them publicly confess their corruption. What can you say about this, sir? [Ramos] You know, the police's progress reports indicate that it is not necessarily the ABB that did the killing. That is not yet a conclusion on the part of the police, they are looking at other angles. Now, as to the ABB making all of these threats, well again, this is not new. They have been making all kinds of threats in the past. And they have always wanted to disrupt our society and the well being and peace of mind of our people. But again as I said in my remarks in regard to fighting crime and fighting lawlessness in our society, we must continue to be united in our actions and in our vigilance so that we can finally project to the world and to our own people that ours is a peaceful and law-abiding society, and not otherwise. [Unidentified correspondent] Good afternoon, Mr. President. [Ramos] Good afternoon. [Unidentified correspondent] Yesterday or the other day, the Miss Universe candidates came to see you and again in around town. The game around town Mr. President is picking out at least three to five winners. May we know your choice? [Ramos] You know, in my welcome remarks to the Miss Universe delegates, they are called delegates not contestants, because they are considered as ambassadors of goodwill. I said that I have retired from beauty judging back in 1973 because in that one time that I was invited to be a judge to a Miss Philippines contest, our choice, Margie Moran became Miss Universe that same year. So, after that I retired already from beauty judging. I said because I have a 20/20 vision and a 1,000 percent batting average. So this time I pass, I pass. [Unidentified correspondent] Good afternoon, Your Excellency. It seems that the Indonesians are unhappy over the reports that the Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor is going to be held in Manila and there is a threat that the peace talks in Jakarta might be jeopardized. May we know your comment on this, Mr. President? [Ramos] I would like you to know that there are certain things here that must be understood. Number one, we have been very concerned about this meeting which will be held in Manila. But this was upon the initiative of a private group over which the government has no control. And there have been consultations between the Philippine Government and the Indonesian Government at the highest levels. In fact, for your information, I tasked Vice President Estrada, who is now in South Africa to attend the inauguration of President Mandela, to confer with Foreign Minister Ali Alatas of Indonesia about this matter, and for Vice President Estrada to explain to the foreign minister of Indonesia that while we are concerned about the possible effect on Philippine-Indonesian relations of the hosting by a private group in the Philippines of this meeting, that it would be unconstitutional on our part to prevent such a meeting from taking place in the Philippines. Secondly, however, I asked the vice president also to convey to our Indonesian friends through Foreign Minister Alatas that we feel that the strength of Philippine-Indonesia bilateral relations, as well as our relations as member nations under the brotherhood of ASEAN, is strong enough to withstand any such irritations as this may cause. Now, I would like to add to all of that. That the Philippines considers that East Timor is and remains a part of Indonesia as its 37th province. This is the position we took a long time ago. I also would like to take the opportunity to again express our appreciation for the full and unstated support that Indonesia has been giving to our peace process, which have been most helpful in putting together the MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] under Chairman Misuari and our Republic of the Philippines panel under Chairman Ambassador Yan. And that we will continue to be committed to maintaining those deep and strong ties with Indonesia. [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you, Mr. President. [Ramos] Now, let me add that there is a newspaper report. I think in one of the radio and TV stations and then entered in one of the evening paper last night, that a certain Carlos Forte is inviting Jose Maria Sison to come to the Philippines to join in that conference. And according to this report, they are to undertake some kind of a revolution. Well, that is one thing that we will not allow in the Philippines. Certainly we will prevent any such happening in the Philippines, meaning, for the two of them to get together in the Philippines to plant a revolution. But in any case that report still has to be verified. But it did come across my desk this morning and so I'm making that comment in relation to your question. [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you, Sir. [Unidentified correspondent] /Good afternoon, beloved president/. Sir, you did a lot of good changes in the previous sad experience of our country. /Through this village election held in your administration,/ will there be really a change, especially in our electoral processes, that there will be no more vote buying which has happened this previous /village/ election which lots of people fear might happen during the upcoming election. [Ramos] /That's what I've said just a while ago/ and I'm glad you asked this question because my answer a while ago was: I hope we change our political culture, of depending on the gun and together with that would be goons and gold, because those are our perennial diseases in elections -- guns, goons, and gold. We have to reverse that culture because we are now supposed to be a mature and functioning democracy that was created out of people power during the EDSA [Epifanio de los Santos Avenue] revolution of February 1986. And the whole world has been admiring this Philippine style of democracy. But there are other aspects of it that we must correct and change, and this matter of the use of force and money and economic or political influence where they should not be applied should also be changed. So, I'm hopeful that we improve step by step. I consider these /village/ elections to be an improvement in that direction towards change. But we must get away from this belief that it is going to be the strongman, the warlord, the guy with the most money that always wins elections in our society. [Unidentified correspondent] Sir, I just want to get your reaction, I do not create factionalism in our profession. But there is this news that came out that there is this 100,000 pesos that Malacanang has distributed during this previous /village/ election which I really hate to hear because I know your administration, sir. [Ramos] Thank you for again coming up with a question that has to be clarified. First of all, I deny any participation and I also deny for all of Malacanang. In regard to an alleged 100,000 pesos fund given to the congressmen, the congressmen have their own funds in the House of Representatives also appropriated by Congress. We are accountable for the funds that are appropriated for us. So, why should I risk the good name and the prestige of Malacanang by disbursing funds just like that, for an election where there is supposed to be no partisanship, no expenditure by anybody outside of the /village/, other than what the Comelec [Commission on Elections] has to spend for. [Joel Paredes] Good afternoon, sir. Sir, will the border agreement with Malaysia by January 1995 affect the Philippines' claim to Sabah? [Ramos] Will you say that question again please? [Paredes] Sir, will the border agreement with Malaysia by January 1995 affect the Philippines' claim to Sabah? [Ramos] The border patrol agreement is still really in the process of negotiation, but we hope it will be agreed to as soon as possible. But that is just a border agreement. It also includes a joint patrol agreement in order that smuggling, illegal entry, drug trafficking, the trafficking of guns as well as wanted persons will be better controlled by both parties. As I mentioned to you in a previous press con, and I think you are also the one that asked the question, and my answer is still the same. We have pushed the Sabah claim in the back burners so to speak. And we are dealing right now with immediate problems of labor, illegal entry, border problems so that we can facilitate trade between our two countries especially at the border areas. [Paredes] Sir, but will the Philippines still pursue its claim later, in the near future? [Ramos] We have not abandoned the claim. But as I said, at the moment, we are attending to more pressing issues that will lead to the economic and social and political benefit of both countries. [Unidentified correspondent] Good afternoon Mr. President and congratulations for your improved vision after that meeting with Miss Universe contestants. Anyway, Mr. President, in the presence of the gods of Philippine media, let me ask this question. Mr. President what is your perception or assessment of government and Philippine media relations, and your suggestions as to how this can be improved for the interest of the country, of course without waiving media's right, adversarial function as watchdog of Philippine society? [Ramos] I think we are agreed that government relations with media and my own personal presidential relations with media are very good, but they could be better. Did you not attend the gridiron put up by the National Press Club? As I said, we should have this gridiron once a month so that we will have a more frequent exposure to freedom of the press Ramos style. But levity aside, I welcome all of my encounters and opportunities to dialogue with media because that's the way government also has to operate. Government must be able to signal the correct messages to the public through media. And in this role, media to me is one of the most important pillars of our democracy, and one should not be isolated from the other. That's why I make it a point to always bring representatives of the Malacanang press corp as well as the gods of media with me when I make my trips; whether in country or abroad, even under water, they are invited to come with me. [Unidentified correspondent] Thank you Mr. President and thank you for your donations to the National Press Club. [Unidentified correspondent] My question Mr. President is of regional concern in Mindanao, because I come from Davao. On my way here last night, Father Barcelon who works in Cagayan says that there's a feeling that this East ASEAN thing, the growth polygon that's pushing in Mindanao which you have started going on is confined in Davao and that some regional centers there in Region IX and Region X feel that it's Davao getting all the action. And we noted that this month, we were told that you are going again to Davao three times, this month. And that might send wrong signal again to the other centers in Mindanao. What are really your plans Mr. President for Mindanao? [Ramos] Well, I hope you do not see yourselves again in Mindanao as being a bunch of cities and provinces. We are looking at Mindanao. We are looking at the southern Philippines in fact, and that includes Cebu now and parts of Palawan as within this East ASEAN growth area. But we have to start somewhere and we have to make sure that when we start this, that is going to be very viable and is going to take off and is going to spark into the other parts of Mindanao and also other parts of the Philippines. So, (?Mr.) Fr. Barcelon, for your prestigious media network, that we are really looking first at the corridor between Davao and General Santos City. But that there is a flagship project in each of the five regions in Mindanao and that includes the ARMM [Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao] and the flagship project there is the completion, the concreting of the Marawi to Cotabato City highway, to which we have assigned elements of two engineering brigades of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. And there in Northern Mindanao we have the (PHIVIDEC) [expansion unknown] Cagayan de Oro to Iligan corridor and this is already a well discussed development area for which we have already approved the master plan presented by the group chaired by Mayor Magtahas of Cagayan de Oro. And the opportunities for opening up that area are ongoing like the privatization of the National Steel Corporation in Iligan, concurrently with the studying of the proposals by the (PHIVIDEC) and by the National Steel Corp. and the National Development Corporation of the integrated steel mill in Cagayan de Oro for which we have already reserved some 500 hectares within the (PHIVIDEC) industrial state. Of course, there are also plans for Zamboanga that is the western side of the E-A-G-A and there are already a lot of interaction taking place between the business groups as well as officials. And there are also plans for other key centers even if they are not regional centers. [Ramos] So, I would hope that again, let us not let our envy overcome us because what is needed here is support, mutual support and synergy, what we are doing for Region X. The power plants are there. On the part of the private sector, the (Tomin) series in Iligan, that's about 100 megawatts with an investment of $100 million. And on the part of the government, Napocor [National Power Corporation], the 100-megawatt power barge in Nasipit, Agusan del Norte, Region X, but that serves all of Mindanao. So, don't worry, it's coming. But it will come to you if you go for it. Instead of waiting for the ripe guavas to fall on top of our head, we have to go and grab the opportunities. Now, one reason why I am going to Davao on three successive weekends is, first, I have not visited Davao Oriental. I have visited Cagayan de Oro and Misamis Oriental maybe four times since I became president, as well as other parts of Region X. I have not visited Davao del Sur, and I have not visited Davao del Norte, because there is one for the three separate regions that I am going there. So, please don't be envious of that because I visit these places on a need basis.
