The supreme commander in chief's visit to the building in Arbatskaya Square and the General Staff Central Command and his presence at the very intensive training session for alert-duty personnel, working with headquarters and main commissariats of the Strategic Missile Forces, Navy, and Air Force scattered all over Moscow and Moscow Oblast and their military units in the North and in Siberia, ended with dummy launches of three strategic missiles. His visit to the military was the first occasion in the history of our state when the leader of the country has personally seen how and in what actual situation the decision to use nuclear missiles might be formulated. Command headquarters exercises on strategic nuclear forces command and control are traditional in all countries possessing these weapons. They are conducted at least two or three times a year. At the end of May, for example, a strategic offensive forces training session took place in the United States and a Minuteman-3 ICBM was launched. The Russian president's presence at the routine command headquarters exercises of the Strategic Nuclear Forces has nothing to do with saber-rattling or with demomstrating nuclear might on the eve of the meeting of the heads of the eight leading world states on the island of Corfu and in Naples, your IZVESTIYA correspondent was told at the Defense Ministry. It is merely connected with the new political, military, and military-technical situation following the signing of Russia's agreement with the United States and Britain on not aiming ballistic missiles at one another. On 30 May we stated that our strategic missiles are on "zero" elevation. So Boris Yeltsin has to know how the leaders of the strategic nuclear triad would act in a hypothetical dangerous period and how quickly and accurately they would be able to aim Russian ballistic and cruise missiles in the required direction. Journalists notified of these exercises by ITAR-TASS and INTERFAX reports waited to greet the president outside the General Staff building, but he did not come out to address representatives of the press. But the exercises passed off, according to my information, without any hitches. According to confidential information in my possession, several divisions of the Strategic Missile Forces' RS-12M "Topol" mobile ground system participated in the exercises. Some of them carried out maneuvers in the forest near Novosibirsk, and one, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Sergeyev, went to a prearranged spot in the Plesetskiy test range in Arkhangelsk Oblast and launched a missile in the direction of the Kura test site in Kamchatka. The division fired from a regular launcher a missile that had been placed on alert duty back in December...1984. So we were able to check the reliability and technical readiness of these missiles for combat operation, I was told at the Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff, and, at the same time, to train officers, who now have a rare opportunity during their period of service to launch a real strategic missile. At the same time as the "Topol" was flying to Kamchatka a group of Tu-160 strategic bombers was in the air above Russia. On a command from the Air Force central command and the General Staff central command the crew headed by Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Danilchenko launched a long-range cruise missile. A Northern Fleet nuclear-powered missile-armed submarine [atomnyy podvodnyy raketonosnyy kreyser] commanded by Captain 1st Rank Aleksandr Zheltyakov, on alert duty in an area of the Barents Sea, launched a ballistic missile in the direction of the test range on an order from Moscow. All the missiles carried dummy rather than nuclear warheads, of course. The fact that the full command headquarters exercises on Strategic Nuclear Forces command and control and the launching of three strategic missiles coincided with 22 June, a sacred date for most Russian citizens -- the 53d anniversary of the start of the Great Patriotic War -- was pure chance, I was told by the military. According to the schedule approved back at the end of last year, the exercises were to have started a day later, but it was decided to change the date at the president's request because he was flying to Corfu. Finally. Comparisons are odious, but in 1799 a Russian-Turkish squadron commanded by Russian Admiral Fedor Ushakov stormed the island and fortress of Corfu, which was occupied by the French. Russia's military success served to strengthen its international authority and was the foundation for its new relations with the states of Europe. Two hundred years on, on the eve of the meeting in Corfu with the heads of the leading states, Colonel Boris Yeltsin, supreme commander in chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, sent a Black Sea Fleet squadron to the island's shores and tested the combat readiness of his Strategic Nuclear Forces by launching three strategic missiles. But it is clear today that military success is not going to restore our state's former authority without victories in the economy, of course.
