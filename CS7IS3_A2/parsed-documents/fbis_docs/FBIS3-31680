In spite of all that, he is optimistically looking forward to the arrival in Gorj County tomorrow of the governmental inquiry commission scheduled to investigate irregularities in the activity of the Brown Coal Public Corporation, which might lead to the strike being ended. Otherwise, Mr. Nicolae Mihu said, the coordinating council of the Lignitul Mining Trade Union Federation intends to continue the strike action in the mining units and to explain to the miners that they should no longer go to Targu Jiu, as Miron Cosma demanded from them last Friday night.
