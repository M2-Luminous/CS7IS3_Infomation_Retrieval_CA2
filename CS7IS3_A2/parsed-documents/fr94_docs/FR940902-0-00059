FR940902-0-00059 FR940902-0-00010 Several commenters voiced concern that a performance standard relating to costs might be required. Accordingly, ยง627.470(c)(2) is amended to clarify that Governors may not tie standards relating gross program expenditures to performance measures in making incentive awards. Governors are encouraged to make full use of available expenditure and participant data in monitoring SDA fiscal practices; at the same time, SDA's should closely monitor local service providers. States and SDA's are encouraged to explore ways of relating overall costs of job training to long-term employment, earnings and reductions in welfare. The final regulation also incorporates the requirement, in section 106(j) of the Act, for the imposition of a reorganization plan on SDA's failing for 2 consecutive years to meet an appropriate proportion of the performance standards, with the exception of the older worker programs. The Governor is to notify the Secretary and the SDA of the continued failure and to impose a reorganization plan within 90 days of the end of the second program year; otherwise, the Secretary will develop and impose the reorganization plan. As mentioned before, with regard to the 90-day deadline for imposing sanctions, a few commenters believed that 90 days was insufficient time for States to evaluate and implement an effective reorganization plan. In addition, a few commenters sought clarification of what might constitute the imposition of a reorganization plan. The Department acknowledges that there may be some difficulty in timing but points to the language in section 106(j)(5)(A) of the Act. In response to the latter comments and in an attempt to alleviate the level of concern about the imposition of a reorganization plan, the final rule is amended by adding a new paragraph (c)(4)(iv) to ยง627.470 which provides the minimum requirements for the imposition of a reorganization plan. The Secretary will give the Governor and the SDA 30 days in which to comment to the Secretary on the proposed reorganization plan prior to its imposition. Further, the Secretary will recapture or withhold up to one-fifth of the State's administration set-aside to provide technical assistance to an SDA where the Secretary has imposed the reorganization plan or where the Governor has not provided appropriate technical assistance. Reorganization Plan Appeals No comments were received on the provisions of this section and no changes are made in the final rule. Oversight and Monitoring Several comments were received on oversight and monitoring. Section 627.475 summarizes the roles of each administrative level in a comprehensive monitoring and oversight system. The monitoring provisions are expanded to require the Governor to develop a monitoring plan which requires that each SDA and SSG be monitored at least once annually. The plan must also require the collection and review of sufficient information to enable the Governor to determine whether substate entities have demonstrated substantial compliance with the oversight requirement to permit a waiver of the imposition of sanctions authorized under section 164(e) of the Act, or to determine whether a job training plan should be disapproved pursuant to section 105 of the Act. The regulations also require the Governor to be responsible for issuing standards to SDA's and SSG's for the development of a local monitoring plan. Additionally, the regulations require the Governor to develop general standards for PIC oversight responsibility for inclusion in the Governor's coordination and special services plans. One commenter requested that the Department of Labor provide greater details regarding its own monitoring responsibilities as well as those of the States. The Department is in the process of developing guidance in this area and, when completed, will provide more detailed information on monitoring and oversight through administrative issuances. One commenter observed that the emphasis in paragraph (b)(3) was unnecessarily on criteria for disapproval of the plan when, in fact, the Act called for the Governor to approve a plan unless it did not meet certain criteria. The commenter suggested that paragraph (b)(3) be revised to read ``Determines that a job training plan shall be disapproved if the plan does not meet the criteria established in section 105(b)(1) of the Act which states in part, the Governor shall approve the job training plan or modification thereof unless he finds that the plan does meet the criteria found in section 105(b)(1)''. The Department concurs with this comment and, although the Department did not adopt the suggestion in toto , paragraph (b)(3) is revised to better reflect the statutory criteria for disapproval of the job training plan. A few commenters requested clarification of what elements of an SDA's and SSG's operation must be monitored not less than once annually. The Department believes that an effective monitoring program is important to improving or maintaining high levels of program performance. The Department wishes to provide states with flexibility in designing the nature and extent of their monitoring programs while assuring that monitoring is thorough. Paragraph (b)(5) is revised to indicate that all aspects of the SDA and SSG program must be reviewed annually, although the Department wishes to clarify that the degree of emphasis placed upon the review of each area of a program may vary from year to year.
