He said, "I have no confidence in the 1997 changeover. I cannot bet my remaining years on fate." [passage omitted] Recently, a mainland scholar came to Hong Kong for a visit. He was surprised at the anxious expression of his friends. "What do you worry about?" he asked. "The critical year of 1997? I am afraid that the Communist Party cannot survive to that year." According to this scholar, the Chinese communists' current policy on Hong Kong, strictly speaking, is Deng Xiaoping's personal policy, and their rule-by-man tradition is that when the strong man exists, his policy prevails, and when he is gone, his policy is no longer valid. Once Deng Xiaoping passes away, the Hong Kong issue will take a turn for the better. Certainly, the Hong Kong people need not worry too much, says this scholar. Currently, all speeches on the Hong Kong issue made by high-level officials of the Chinese communist regime are strongly worded, and there appears to be no difference in view among them. Especially in the recent past when the Chinese communists were hurling Cultural-Revolution-type criticisms at Chris Patten, almost all the top leaders came forward to denounce him, either orally or in writing, sharing a bitter hatred against this enemy. Nonetheless, as revealed by mainlanders who are well aware of the inside story, the above phenomenon in no way means that the Chinese communist leaders are taking an entirely identical stand without the slightest difference on this issue. According to their observation, some of the speeches did come from a strong nationalist sentiment, but more of them were a declaration to Deng Xiaoping of the speakers' stance on the issue.. Declaring your stance on an external issue, they say, will not involve you in any factional struggle or rivalry for interests within the party. Since the big boss has set the keynote, there should be no opponent at the high stratum in the Chinese communist regime. Even so, however, some top Chinese communist leaders still refrain from commenting on the Hong Kong issue, sources in Beijing point out. The most noteworthy examples are Qiao Shi and Tian Jiyun, chairman and first vice chairman, respectively, of the National People's Congress [NPC], both of whom have the authority to comment on the issue. Yet, since the Sino-British political dispute began last year, neither Qiao nor Tian has uttered a single word about the Hong Kong issue. All those in diplomatic circles in Beijing regard this as food for thought. [passage omitted] Liberal intellectuals in Beijing believe that the young generation of Chinese communist leaders, even including Jiang Zemin and Li Peng--who are most disliked by the Hong Kong people--are more pragmatic and know the trend better than old leaders like Deng Xiaoping. Once Deng dies, they say, adjustment of the Hong Kong policy may not be an unrealistic illusion. As they point out, Hong Kong's future is principally dictated by the changes that will take place on the mainland. In the next two to three years, or around 1997, with the end of old-man politics, the Chinese mainland will certainly undergo an earth-shaking change, and the intensity of this change may even outstrip the one triggered by Mao Zedong's death. Now, they say, political circles in Hong Kong are vehemently arguing over the Legislative Council's through-train issue [meaning that members of Hong Kong's last Legislative Council may, upon confirmation by the SAR Preparatory Committee, become members of the first Legislative Council of the SAR on 1 July 1997]. Their argument is based on the premise that the present political situation on the mainland will not change. This is a moderate thinking, but using it as a premise shows an inadequate understanding of China's reality and a lack farsightedness about its future development. In a very affirmative tone, a liberal intellectual has made this remark: If the Chinese communist power is shaken, the Hong Kong Basic Law, which the Hong Kong people have now been forced to accept, will be radically changed. It may be even replaced by a new law to conform with the Hong Kong people's wish for democracy and autonomy. According to this intellectual, when talking privately, mainland scholars who are concerned about the Hong Kong issue look at the Hong Kong basic law drafting and advisory committees as copies of the mainland's NPC and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]. With their operations controlled by the Chinese communists, they are merely Beijing's rubber stamps disguised as organizations of voices of the people. Therefore, some people call them "small NPC" and "small CPPCC." It is doubtful that they can truly represent the will of the mainland and Hong Kong people. At least, they are far from legally sound as lawmakers. The new basic law in the future should not contain the extremely absurd concept of "one country, two systems." The gist of the new law should be the protection of Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, not anything like the capitalist system remaining unchanged for 50 years. This way, the dispute over the political system will be automatically resolved. Another liberal intellectual says that the main reason for the Chinese communists' strong stance on the Hong Kong issue is not that they want to totally control Hong Kong's politics after 1997. It is rather because they are afraid that a Hong Kong effect will appear on the mainland. The Chinese communists regard Britain's new policy of accelerating the democratic reform in Hong Kong as a bridgehead used by the West in laying an all-out siege to Red China in the post-Cold War era. [passage omitted] The Chinese communist authorities and dissident intellectuals, he says, take diametrically opposite stands on the Hong Kong issue. The latter view Hong Kong as a forward position to introduce democracy into the mainland. They have a very good opinion about Chris Patten and his political reform package, and support the democrats in Hong Kong. An academically prestigious magazine on the mainland, DUSHU, carries an article on the Sino-British Opium War in its last March issue. The viewpoint of the article is diametrically opposite to the official stand. It says that the objective result of the Opium War "was in essence the triumph of modern society over medieval society and western capitalism over eastern feudalism." This is a relatively powerful criticism of the nationalist hysteria that the Chinese communist authorities have energetically exhibited since the start of the Sino-British political dispute. With regard to Hong Kong's future, some mainland academics studying the Hong Kong and Macao questions hold that the degree of autonomy enjoyed by Hong Kong in relation to the mainland and the method of autonomy to be adopted will depend mainly on economic rather than political factors, or more specifically, the economic link between Hong Kong and the mainland, especially southern China. Judging from the present situation, they believe that the Hong Kong and mainland economies are closely linked and interdependent and are on the road of common prosperity. Because of this, it is almost impossible for Hong Kong to divorce itself from China and become independent even in case the Chinese communist regime collapses. These academics are rather interested in Hong Kong's legal system and political operations as well as its fledgling party politics. They say: As for political construction in the future, two systems are available for the mainland's reference: One is to learn from Taiwan; the other is to learn from Hong Kong. Hong Kong's political system has the same advantages as the British political system. For instance, it is rational, moderate, corruption-resistant, and governed by legality. This can make up for the insufficiency of China's traditional culture. According to their forecast, in the future Hong Kong may have a bipartisan system like Britain, that is, a Conservative Party and a Labor Party. The present Liberal Party may play the role of the Conservative Party, while the United Democrats of Hong Kong may act as the Labor Party. The Pro-China Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, though presently believed to have a great potential, may lose its position and disappear from Hong Kong's political arena as time passes by. They further point out that the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong now exists by attaching itself to the Chinese Communist Party. At present, it has the advantage of acting as a middleman between Beijing and the public of Hong Kong. If there is a change in China's situation in the future, this advantage will no longer be available. It appears that if the Communist Party collapses, the Democratic Alliance may follow the example of the communist parties in Eastern Europe to take the road of a socialist party and act as a spokesman for the working people. Such a road has proved feasible in Europe. In China, however, because the communist authorities have, for more than a decade, attached much weight to the capitalist side in implementing their united front strategy, the Democratic Alliance, which rose up by developing the worker movement, will find itself in a dilemma if it takes the above-mentioned road. Moreover, the United Democrats of Hong Kong, another party which represents the public at the middle and low strata and which has the character of a labor party, has quickly grown strong amid the democratic tide. Even if the Democratic Alliance would turn around, it would not be able to rival the United Democrats of Hong Kong. In contrast, the Liberal Party, though seemingly in a somewhat awkward position at present, will have a very promising future, according to mainland academics. In Hong Kong's modern industrial and commercial society, the middle bourgeoisie is a strong class. It is a firm supporter for the free economy. Most people of this class do not oppose democratic politics, but they may not necessarily approve of the free-lunch-type social well-being advocated by the United Democrats of Hong Kong. In view of this, after the Chinese communists' threat has disappeared, the Liberal Party, which represents the interests of the middle bourgeoisie as well as small and medium capitalists, will grow in strength. Even when there is no threat from the Communist Party, disparities in culture and systems will still perplex Hong Kong. This, the mainland academics say, will be a long-lasting problem difficult to overcome.
