In its monthly report, the bureau said retail prices soared 20 per cent during the first four months of this year compared to the same period last year. But in April alone, retail prices rose 19.6 percent, down from 24.5 percent in March. And increases in consumer prices, including the service sector, dropped 0.7 percent in April to stand at 21.7 percent, the report added. The bureau noted that government controls also throttled soaring service prices, including the catering trade, transportation, and financial business. Bureau economists say spiralling prices are being kept at bay in the 36 major cities, typically reflected by consumer expenditures on vegetables and services. But, they also warned that consumer prices in small cities, towns, and rural areas were still on the rise, particularly for grain, seafood, clothes, and services. The bureau suggested the government keep a firm grip on the economy to ensure a general balance between supply and demand of goods on the market--a crucial factor in stabilizing prices. While strengthening its controls on money supply to avoid runaway investment in fixed assets, creditors are expected to focus on key state projects, industrial firms, and agricultural production, the bureau added. Last month, fixed-assets investment by State units was 55.4 billion yuan ($6.4 billion), up 44.2 percent from the same period of last year. But this represented a fall in the growth rate. In April 1993 fixed-assets investment grew 66.1 percent compared to the year before. Since the clampdown on fixed assets began last year, the government has effectively cut the money supply to machine-building, textiles, and construction of villas and hotels. The development has helped bring a 22 percent increase to the state revenue this year. Strict control over the money supply, which severely hurt the state industries in the first quarter, brought a glimmer of hope for them to recover production strength last month. Backed by state financial support, the state-owned enterprises, considered the country's industrial pillar, generated 84.7 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) in profits and taxes during the first four months of this year. That's up 22.1 percent from the same period last year. In the first quarter, state-owned factories output grew only 2.2 percent. But in April, it went up to 5 percent. The bureau added that national industrial output nearly hit 171 billion yuan ($19.6 billion) in April, up 17.9 percent from the same period last year. After taking inflation into account, domestic retail sales increased 4 percent in April to reach 117 billion yuan ($13.4 billion).
