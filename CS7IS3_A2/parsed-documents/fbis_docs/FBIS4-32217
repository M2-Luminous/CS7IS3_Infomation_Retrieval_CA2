Following are some excerpts. Asked his opinion on the census, President Gligorov said that it was of an extreme importance, primarily as a chance to draw up a real map of Macedonia, the population count, its make-up, and what and how much of anything there is. In brief, he said that it was a chance to create a source for a lot of important data needed for a realistic examination of the present situation, which can be used in planning our future. "I think that we have created the necessary conditions for carrying out such an activity, and I do not think that any of the sides will have any objections," President Gligorov said, adding that the census will help free the agenda of an issue of a purely statistical nature that has tended to be given political meaning. "Therefore, in my opinion," President Gligorov said, "this is a goal of essential importance for our state, for the stability and peace of our country." Asked about the degree of politicization, in the sense of who needed the census and why, President Gligorov said that such politicization started being implemented right after the latest census in 1991, when some internal and international factors were involved, and most of all our neighbors. "That is not uncommon," Gligorov said, "if we look at the present situation in the Balkans, on the territories of former Yugoslavia, and the aspirations and historic ambitions of various countries toward Macedonia. Therefore, the census should put an end to such controversies and provide real arguments for discussions. Politicization, particularly the argument presented to the international public that far greater numbers of certain nationalities reside here than is actually true, conjures up an image where, if we add up all those pretentious numbers, Macedonia turns out to be a state of many millions, which everybody knows to be a notorious lie. After the census, everyone will have to face the truth." The next question was related to our standards and our Census Law compared with the same regulations in Europe and the world. "In this feverish atmosphere among and around us, we can understand the manipulations of the number of certain nationalities. However, it is beyond understanding when some claim that our census is below European standards, because it is the only census that will be carried out according to the standards of the Council of Europe. This is the only such case, and it is good, because after the census it will be hard to deny the results. The census can serve as an example of how things could be resolved in the boiling Balkans. It means discussing by presenting arguments, and not historic burdens and personal subjective evaluations." At the end, President Gligorov emphasized that the census was a possibility, as was the referendum, for our people to show their attitude to the state, to do their civil duties, and thus remove from the agenda an issue that can cause a lot of misunderstanding.
