Round-weight equivalents for groundfish products shall be calculated using the product codes and standard PRRs specified in Table 1 of this section. (2) Adjustments to Table 1 of this section. The Regional Director may adjust standard PRRs and product types specified in Table 1 of this section if he determines that existing standard PRRs are inaccurate or if new product types are developed. (3) Procedure. Adjustments to any standard PRR listed in Table 1 that are within and including 15 percent of that standard PRR may be made without providing notice and opportunity for prior public comment. Adjustments of any standard PRR during a calendar year, when aggregated with all other adjustments made during that year, may not exceed 15 percent of the standard PRR listed in Table 1 of this section at the beginning of that calendar year and no new product type may be announced until NMFS has published notice of the proposed adjustment and/or new product type in the Federal Register and provided the public with at least 30 days opportunity for public comment. Any adjustment of a PRR that acts to further restrict the fishery shall not be effective until 30 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register . If NMFS makes any adjustment or announcement without providing notice and opportunity for prior public comment, the Regional Director will receive public comments on the adjustment or announcement for a period of 15 days after its publication in the Federal Register .
