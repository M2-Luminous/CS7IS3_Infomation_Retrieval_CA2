Shares issued by these enterprises will be distributed among National Investment Funds. The latter are devised as strong blocs of Polish capital groups capable of competing effectively in the international arena. How many state enterprises have so far declared their readiness to join the PPP? [Dobrowolski] At the moment there are two groups of enterprises set up according to the relevant Council of Ministers act. Together they represent more than 360 state enterprises. Currently the Ownership Transformations Ministry is completing the list of a third group of joint-stock companies which also declare their willingness to take part in the privatization program. [Lewandowski] Shares issued by enterprises which want to join the PPP will be handed over to the National Investment Funds. What will happen then? [Dobrowolski] The National Investment Funds will be faced with the task of managing these shares and investing them profitably. The shares will be distributed so that one strategic investor will be allocated to each enterprise--or, rather, one joint venture. [Lewandowski] How many shares will one National Investment Fund receive? [Dobrowolski] Each National Investment Fund set up as a strategic investor will get 33 percent of enterprises' shares. The remaining funds will get 27 percent, and the rest, that is, 40 percent, will be allocated to joint ventures' employees and to the State Treasury. A strategic investor, that is, a National Investment Fund with 33 percent of shares in its allocated company, will be obliged to encourage the company to make profits that should be reflected in its shares. We should note here that the form of this encouragement must be in keeping with the regulations and provisions of the Commercial Code. This means that the investors' proposed operations must be approved by the company board. Strategic investors will also help draft restructuring programs for their companies and assist them in seeking credits in domestic and foreign markets. [Lewandowski] Will the state act as a guarantor when companies decide to apply for foreign credits? [Dobrowolski] Probably not, because the National Investment Funds will not be set up as state-owned funds. The reason for this is that our enterprises--even the best ones--quite often have no experience in handling complex operations in international financial markets. So we are hoping to encourage Western firms, which are perfectly familiar with the principles of playing the financial market, to participate in our National Investment Funds system. [Lewandowski] Who will select the firms to be entrusted with the task of managing their joint-stock companies? [Dobrowolski] These matters will be decided by the Selection Committee, which has already started its work. Those firms which would like to participate in the Mass Privatization Program have already submitted their applications, and the Commission has begun to examine their cases. [Lewandowski] Which firms from Gdansk and Elblag Voivodships have declared their accession to the PPP? [Dobrowolski] In Gdansk Voivodship we have the following: the Gdynia Industrial Construction Company, the Elbud Gdansk SA [joint-stock company] Power Engineering Construction Company, the Bacutil SA Animal Feed Company, Elmor SA, MEAT SA, the Lubiana SA China Tableware Products, and Metrix SA in Tczew. In Elblag Voivodship we have the Elzam SA Production and Services Company. [Lewandowski] So how many National Investment Funds will you create altogether? [Dobrowolski] We estimate that we will set up about 20 National Investment Funds. It is impossible to be more precise at this moment because the exact number will depend on the final number of enterprises willing to join the national privatization program. [Lewandowski] Let us look at the question of the transfer of enterprises' shares to the National Investment Funds. How can you avoid a situation whereby the first funds to be set up will select for themselves the best joint-stock companies, while the rest will have to be satisfied with economically weak firms? [Dobrowolski] That will not happen, because we are planning to introduce a "points system" whereby each fund will be able to "purchase" a given number of joint ventures with the set number of points allocated to it. Thus the order in which the available joint ventures will be chosen by individual funds will be determined by random selection. In addition, the selection of joint ventures will be carried out under the supervision of the Antimonopoly Office, which will ensure that no monopolies will be created in these circumstances. [Lewandowski] So it looks likely that by the end of this year every adult citizen of our country will be able to own shares in the National Investment Funds, does it not? Even though shareholders will not be given actual possession of their shares, but will only be issued with share certificates confirming that they are indeed shareholders. Will it be worth holding on to these certificates for any length of time? [Dobrowolski] I am convinced that it will. [Lewandowski] But it is inevitable that some shareholders--or, rather, certificate holders--will be forced by circumstances to sell them. [Dobrowolski] Certainly. The privatization program aims to achieve a situation where everybody has an equal chance. And that is what will happen. However, it will be difficult for us to interfere in individual people's decisions about what they want to do with their share certificates. In any case, the Stock Exchange experience to date shows that it is certainly worthwhile to own shares. [Lewandowski] So, one year after the launch of the National Investment Funds, our share certificates will be changed into actual shares of the relevant joint ventures and will then be eligible for Stock Exchange operations. Consequently, we will be able to buy and sell them, and generally to "play" the Stock Exchange with them, will we not? And, of course, the general public will come to experience capitalism at first hand. [Dobrowolski] That is precisely what we hope will happen. Perhaps it will not be possible to sort out the whole question smoothly in one go, but we can be sure that the public will receive a sound lesson in economic education--certainly much sounder than our present knowledge of the subject. [Lewandowski] Will we be able to make money by buying and selling those shares? After all, we know that quite a few of our enterprises cannot be counted among economic giants.... [Dobrowolski] Of course. However, it is worth stressing that access to the PPP will be open only to selected enterprises which can guarantee a return of good profit. That is one of the basic requirements of PPP membership. [Lewandowski] Let us now consider the following question: I have received, or else purchased, National Investment Fund share certificates to the value of 10 percent of the average national [monthly] wage. What should I do with them now? [Dobrowolski] You can keep them for a while, and then exchange them for shares in individual companies and wait until their value goes up. You can also sell your share certificates.... [Lewandowski] ...by trading outside the Stock Exchange? [Dobrowolski] Yes. [Lewandowski] But we do not have an established market in stocks and shares outside the Stock Exchange yet. So I can determine the price of my share certificate myself by selling it to a friend? [Dobrowolski] Yes, you can. Consequently, your certificate will represent an independent market value outside the Stock Exchange. [Lewandowski] What about the employees of the budget-funded sectors of the economy? Will they also receive share certificates? [Dobrowolski] There will be a certain difference there because the employees of the budget-funded sector will receive additional free share certificates--on top of the entitlement due to all citizens, and chosen from selected funds--within the terms of their compensatory pay uprating schemes. [Dobrowolski ends] The Mass Privatization Program [PPP] Timetable 1993--End of third and beginning of fourth quarter: Council of Ministers draws up the list of single-person State Treasury companies and state enterprises selected for participation in Mass Privatization Program. 1994--First quarter: Decision reached on results of international tender for companies administering National Investment Fund assets; competition for candidate National Investment Fund board members. 1994--First quarter: Creation of National Investment Funds and appointment of their board members. 1994--First quarter: National Investment Funds sign agreements with their administering companies. 1994--Second quarter: Company shares transferred to National Investment Funds; 1994--End of third and beginning of fourth quarter: Share certificates distributed. 1995--Second through third quarters: National Investment Fund Shares announced at Stock Exchange.
