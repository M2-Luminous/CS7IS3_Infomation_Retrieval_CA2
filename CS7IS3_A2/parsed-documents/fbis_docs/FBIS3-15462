Speaking to journalists, he noted that the document will take into account all recommendations of the presidential public chamber approved three weeks ago. These recommendations suggest extending election campaign in regions until June and not holding elections to local self-government bodies until the preparation of a corresponding legislative basis at the federal and regional levels. Filatov pointed out that "the elections should not stick to a certain date and the issue of fixing it can be submitted to local governments". Asked by IF's correspondent, the head of the administration said that the memorandum on civil accord, the need for which Boris Yeltsin stressed at an expanded meeting of the government last Friday can take a shape of a broad agreement between "the power, influential socio-political parties, entrepreneurs and trade unions". In Filatov's opinion, the agreement could include the government's commitment to fight inflation, entrepreneurs' pledge to control growth of prices and trade unions' obligation to control strikes. The head of the administration believes that such an agreement would considerably stabilize the situation by the beginning of the presidential election campaign in 1996. A working group for its preparation will be formed soon. Filatov explained that warning the coup plotters amnestied by the resolution of the State Duma about their arrest in case of a new attempt to destabilize the situation in the country, the president did not mean a ban on any political activities. According to Filatov, the amnestied have the full right to such activities in civilized forms, including the right to be elected to the State Duma. "If they start again to call for the ouster of the legitimate power at rallies, they will be punished", Filatov said.
