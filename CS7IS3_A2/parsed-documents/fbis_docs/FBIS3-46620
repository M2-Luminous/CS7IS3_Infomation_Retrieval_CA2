Clearly, every coup attempt would have been successful in their operations if the leaders controlled the First Army Region. For example, the successful case of the last coup staged by groups from the now-defunct National Peace-keeping Council (NPKC), led by former Armed Forces commander Gen Suchinda Khraprayun was a result of his being able to control the First Army Region. The First Army Region Commander, Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo, presenting an exclusive interview to THAILAND TIMES, said the overall view of its yearly operation was satisfactory. The most important thing, he said, was that they had fully met the policy of the Army Commander-in-Chief, Gen Wimon Wongwanit, both in man power and public assistance. This year, the Army Commander-in-Chief voiced concern mostly about the drought crisis, said Chettha, adding that the drought crisis will reach the critical stage next summer. "It was an urgent matter for the First Army Region to coordinate with the other three Army regions to map out assistant measures for those affected by the drought. The manforce and a variety of equipment are prepared to help the people." The First Army remains on alert for the coming drought situation, coordinating with three main agencies concerned, namely the Provincial Electricity Authority, the Department of Mineral Resource and the Army to mobilise equipment and funds for those adversely affected areas. "One agency alone can not tackle this serious problem, and the joint cooperation was a need to mostly benefit the people." Currently, the country is peaceful, without serious problems, only problems along the border which affect the nation, such as Khmer bandits and stolen car gangs smuggling cars to Cambodia. "The cars must run on the roads, and they will not be allowed to cross to Cambodia. War weapons and ammunition, such as were described to me, are the most serious problem, and serious preventive measures must be implemented as much as possible to prevent bringing them into the capital city and other cities. The violence and crime can not be eliminated if the problem of these fatal arms is not tackled first." The Army has tried to do its best to suppress the arms, Lt Gen Chettha said, adding that the Suranari Task Force has been successful in arresting countless numbers of them. The soldiers and the policemen also have tried to do their best to intercept those arms, he said. Lt [as published] Chettha also admitted that it was impossible to be 100 percent successful, and that 95 or 98 percent was satisfactory. As to the problem of drug smuggling along the border zone, Lt Gen Chettha said the problem still existed but has been greatly reduced. The area where culprits seek to smuggle drugs is along border points where the fighting still remains active, as the smugglers know the situation well, and know the correct time to smuggle drugs. However, smuggling is very rare at border points right now as soldiers have been alerted to the situation and can prevent the smuggling. Regarding the war weapons and ammunition found in Chanthaburi Province, Gen Wimon said the matter had been concluded without any problems. Every side understood one another, whether problems with soldiers or with police, or soldiers with the Khmer. He said the soldiers clearly explained the situation. There was no conflict or uncertainty on this matter. We have to help each other for the benefit of the nation as a whole, Wimon said. As for the incidents along the border zone, the Army has continuously trained border villagers to defend themselves from the enemy when facing a problem. The training courses go back to the period when Vietnam invaded Cambodia. The border needed to be trained to defend themselves or they would be affected by the fighting. Lt Gen Chettha said the Army has continuously and successfully trained the people living along the border zone regions to love the nation, and to defend themselves and their villages. It was not difficult for them to help society when they were well trained by government authorities, he said. Apart from this, he also expressed his ideas over the conflicts between permanent officials and politicians, saying that he did not consider it as a problem. It was normal to have conflict in a democracy where everyone has the right to express their ideas. Even opinions of three people on the same thing are not always the same, but rather definitely different. The thoughts and actions must not be against democracy, he said. "Every side must find the best resolution on matters of conflict, by discussion the issues with reason, but not emotions, for the benefit of the real happiness and prosperity of our nation." "I view everything as normal in a democracy. Nobody can force the idea to be the same thing or the same idea. We need excellent and clever ideas but they must be in the scope of democracy and responsibility," said Lt Gen Chettha. The First Army Commander said the people must be patient, even though they are bored with conflicting ideas expressed by the permanent officials and politicians. It was against democracy if people are blocked in their ideas. So every side has to be based on reason, listening to the truth. He said clear policies have been drafted for each agency, and that they should abide by the rules in order to implement the policy. Every society and group has done things for the benefit of the common people. It is normal to have a variety of ideas, he said. In a democratic society, a variety of ideas are considered a core factor in fostering democracy. Everyone must be a dedicated democrat and his actions has to be within the scope of democracy, said Chettha. Chettha said he himself was optimistic about the image of the soldiers, although many people were pessimistic, saying, that he was ready to listen to the voice of the majority. The people would judge it on an individual basis, not relating the mistake to the institute. Whoever was found violating the rule of the soldier must be punished without exception. "I was surprised by the criticism hurled at the image of soldiers claiming a soldier was nobody else but the one carrying out his duties to defend the nation. It is impossible for every soldier in the Army to be good since each comes from a different family." Everything must be based on fairness, and violators must be face the punishment, said Chettha, adding, everyone must follow their commanders. "Every soldier must act like a hero with a compromising mind, and keep calm when people when with many problems turn to them for help," Chettha added. National politics, with the soldiers in 1994, is very strong and stable. It is considered the best of all ages of the Army institute. He added that the military will not be involved in national politics. The Army was to follow all governmental policies. Even if political uncertainties exist, it must not affect the Army. In principle, government must work for prosperity, peace, and the well-being of the people. If it strictly follows the regulations, problems would not occur.
