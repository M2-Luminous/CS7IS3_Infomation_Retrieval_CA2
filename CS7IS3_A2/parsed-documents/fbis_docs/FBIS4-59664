Despite this, we succeeded in establishing telephone contact with 'Abd-al-Qadir Bajammal, former minister and deputy, and member of the general committee of the General People's Congress [GPC] under President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. Regrettably, the telephone contact was poor from the technical point of view. In this interview, Bajammal confirmed to us the fall of al-'Anad base. He also said that the Central Command in Sanaa has no intention to storm Aden militarily. We asked him about Sanaa's stand on Arab mediations after we asked him, of course, about why Sanaa has rejected the Yemeni Socialist Party's [YSP] recent proposal to immediately stop the fighting and resume dialogue. He said: [Begin recording] [Bajammal] First, about the talk that the YSP has submitted a proposal. In reality, the proposal should have been the basis for tackling the Yemeni crisis which the YSP has concocted. The YSP wants to destroy the constitutional and legitimate institutions through military rebellion, and through political rebellion. That's why those who ask such a thing should first of all respect constitutional legitimacy, the legitimacy of the elections, and the law. That's why this request cannot be accepted from one party which has destroyed legitimacy, has flouted legitimacy, and has undermined all the results of the democratic actions that have been scored over the past unionist years. [Salamah] There are Yemeni delegations from the north and the south that are currently visiting Arab countries, and Arab mediations, as yet, have not attained any tangible result on the ground in Yemen. Are you ready to deal with Arab mediations and calls to stop the fighting and resume dialogue? [Bajammal] First, the mediators, or those who are concerned over Yemen, its safety, and its security should primarily be concerned that safety and stability in Yemen consists of respect for its legitimacy, and the respect of the people's will in the elections. This is a basic rule. To respect the Yemenis, we must respect their will. This is the most important thing. If we want a any mediation to have any effect, this mediation first of all should not be biased to a specific viewpoint, and assess it as being a dispute outside thr framework of legitimacy. It is a dispute to entrench legitimacy and the Yemeni popular will. If any mediation does not respect this, the mediation, in my opinion, will become useless. In other words, it will be a mediation that proceeds from an erroneous understanding of the Yemeni state of affairs, a concept that is no longer valid because we possess a constitution, and a House of Representatives that came into existence as a result of general and democratic elections. What do we want after this? What is more important than this is that they address the forces within the YSP which rebelled against legitimacy and inform them that this is absolutely unacceptable. This is the real introduction to any mediation, and not to equate those who abide by legitimacy with those who undermine it and force Yemen to take a leap into the unknown. [end recording]
