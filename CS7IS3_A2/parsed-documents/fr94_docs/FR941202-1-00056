FR941202-1-00056 FR941202-1-00011 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 625 [Docket No. 941127&hyph;4327; I.D. No. 103194A] Summer Flounder Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed specifications for the 1995 summer flounder fishery; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS proposes specifications for the 1995 summer flounder fishery, which include commercial catch quotas and other restrictions. The implementing regulations for the fishery require NMFS to publish specifications for the upcoming fishing year and provide an opportunity for the public to comment. The intent of these measures is to prevent overfishing of the summer flounder resource. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the draft Environmental Assessment (EA) and supporting documents used by the Summer Flounder Monitoring Committee are available from: Executive Director, Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, Room 2115, Federal Building, 300 S. New Street, Dover, DE 19901&hyph;6790. Comments on the proposed specifications should be sent to: Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), One Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, MA 01930&hyph;2298. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Hannah Goodale, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9101. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 625.20 of the regulations implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery (FMP) specifies the process for setting annual management measures in order to achieve the fishing mortality rates of 0.53 for the years 1993&hyph;95, and 0.23 in 1996 and thereafter, to prevent overfishing of the resource. The regulations establish a Summer Flounder Monitoring Committee (Monitoring Committee) consisting of representatives from the Atlantic State Marine Fisheries Commission ASMFC, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) and the New England Fishery Management Council, and NMFS, which recommends an annual commercial catch quota and other restrictions to achieve the specified fishing mortality rate. The Monitoring Committee is required to review and base its recommendations of annual measures on: (1) Commercial and recreational catch data, (2) Estimates of fishing mortality, (3) Stock status, (4) Estimates of recruitment, (5) Virtual population analysis (VPA), (6) Levels of regulatory noncompliance by fishermen or individual states, (7) Impact of fish size and net mesh regulations, (8) Impact of gear other than otter trawls on the mortality of summer flounder, and (9) Other relevant information. After reviewing the required information, the Monitoring Committee may recommend, in addition to the coastwide quota, modifications to the commercial minimum fish size and minimum mesh size, modifications to the recreational minimum fish size, possession limit and season, and restrictions on gear other than otter trawls. The Council's Demersal Species Committee (Demersal Committee) considers the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee, as well as any public comments and, in turn, makes its recommendation to the full Council. Committee and Council Recommendations The annual management measures are based upon stock projections derived from VPA results. Overfishing has reduced the summer flounder age structure to primarily ages 0 through 2. Stock projections, therefore, rely heavily on estimated recruitment levels. Stock projections for 1995 were conducted using low, mean, and high estimates of recruitment. For each estimate, the coastwide harvest limit was calculated that would meet the 0.53 target mortality rate.
