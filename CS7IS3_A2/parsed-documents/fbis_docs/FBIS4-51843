This is because the organization is inclined to conduct political activities and is therefore against Law No. 3/1985 on political parties and the functional group. Speaking after chairing a coordinated meeting in Jakarta, Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security Affairs Susilo Sudarman said the three organizations legally allowed to conduct political activities are the United Development Party, the Functional Group, and the Indonesian Democratic Party. Therefore, the existence of PRD is against the above law.
