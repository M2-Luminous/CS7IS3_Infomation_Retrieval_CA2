Government's Future is in Question due to the Split Between SP-BSP"] [Text] Lucknow, 11 March. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) in Uttar Pradesh [U.P.] are drifting apart. The BSP leaders are openly criticizing the state government and their relationship is turning sour. The fate of the government could be in jeopardy because of the difference between the political cultures of the two parties. The increasing bitterness between the SP and BSP ministers and legislators is evident in the U.P. Vidhan Sabha. The problems of the three-months-old government have increased because of the tension between BSP leaders Kanshi Ram and SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav. Every few minutes, either Kanshi Ram or Mayavati is taking the government to task. Chief Minister Mulayam Singh, contrary to his nature, is forced to accept these insults quietly. Kanshi Ram's threat that he "will not hesitate in dismissing this government if it does not work according to [his] conditions," has angered the SP leadership. The fact is that the main problem for the SP-BSP coalition has been that there never was any atmosphere of cooperation among the SP and BSP ministers and legislators, although the leaders of the two parties may had some understanding. The statement issued by Mayavati, the BSP general secretary, proves this. Even SP leaders believe that Kanshi Ram's saying that the ministers from his party are treated like peons and Mayavati's argument that their legislators are not listened to are not considered to be sentiments that will go away. Kanshi Ram had aggravated this tension between the parties by telling his legislators and workers to agitate against the officials and ministers who do not listen to them. He told them to make public statements to this effect and bring the issue to the people. This tension between the two parties has made the government look pitiable in the Vidhan Sabha and the Vidhan Parishad. On 1 March, when Balram Yadav, a SP cabinet member, announced in the Vidhan Sabha that there was plenty of sugar and kerosene oil available in the state and that their prices were under control, it was Rajbali Yadav, a BSP member, and not the opposition, that screamed, "The minister is lying. Kerosene oil is being sold at 18 rupees a liter in the state." This attitude of the BSP legislators and cabinet members is lessening the feeling of joint responsibility. On 4 March, the state education minister, Dr. Massaud Ahmed (BSP), and Shardanand Anchal, the deputy minister in his own department (SP), continued to contradict each other. Similar situations took place several times during the current session. When Babu Ram Verma (BSP) made an objectionable statement against Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant in the vidhan sabha, Chief Minister Mulayam Singh apologized immediately and insisted to the chair to remove that comment from the vidhan sabha proceedings. The BSP did not like it. The BSP leader Mayavati condemned the chief minister's action. She told the reporters, "Our legislator was correct. He was subjected to unnecessary pressure to apologize. Our legislators will not apologize in the future." The BSP is acting like an opposition party because it is not being heard and is deprived of power despite its being in the government. To protest against the beating of its members while they were returning from Calcutta after participating in a rally there, the party legislators stopped several trains bound for West Bengal. After the caste-related confrontation in Jaunpur, the BSP took the city under its control for three days. The BSP leaders and workers also complain that only the SP leaders have the privileges associated with being in government. A SP worker was wounded in an attack in Gonda, and he was transported to a hospital in a helicopter. However, when Ramanchal Rajbhar, a BSP legislator, was beaten by the police in Akbarpur, the government did not take any action. He was transported from Akbarpur to Lucknow in a car. He was in very serious condition. The problem for the SP is that Mayavati of the BSP visits Lucknow every other week and, under the pretext of looking at the working of the government, makes some statements to put the government in a difficult position. The problems of the government increase and the discipline within the party and the government is adversely affected. Mayavati made major problems for the government by spewing poison against Mahatma Gandhi. The Congress (I) has decided to make this an issue. Mulayam Singh is neither owning up to nor giving up this issue. The comments made on Mahatma Gandhi and Pant have put the whole government on trial. Kanshi Ram and Mayavati's belligerent attitude towards Mulayam Singh started because of the daily complaints made by BSP ministers and legislators. The BSP ministers, Education Minister Dr. Massaud Ahmed, Social Welfare Minister Raj Bahadur, and Revenue Minister Vishwambhar Prasad Nishad, told their boss (Kanshi Ram) about their helplessness before the BSP-SP rally in Allahabad on 5 March. they said that they have to face a lot of embarrassment in their ministries because of their inability to do any work at government level. These ministers also raised the issue of one of their party leader's assassination in Karbi. They said that the district administration was apathetic in apprehending the criminals. They said that they had sent a written complain to the chief minister, but he had not taken any action. Kansi Ram became angry. He took the government to task in the very first SP-BSP rally. He Said, "My ministers are treated like peons. Mr. Chief Minister, this just will not work." Sone Lal Patel, the general secretary of the BSP, said that the government officials did not follow up on even the written orders of the BSP ministers. If pressured, they say that the chief minister had told them not to do that. If the government officials do not obey the ministers, what will happen to the common workers? A fuming Kanshi Ram said, "If Mulayam Singh has the command over the government, I have the command over Mulayam Singh. if someone does not listen to you, let me know." The warning by Kanshi Ram to uproot this government given in this rally was also the result of this anger. The tension between the SP and the BSP is also caused by their social bases. The caste-related confrontations that took place in Kanpur and Varanasi had resulted from the differences between the SP and the BSP. In most cases, Yadavs and Kurmis were agitating against the Harijans. In such a situation, the government acts to help the party in power [SP]. This is the reason why officials do not obey and the government has become helplessness. The tensions have risen from the village and community level to enter the government.
