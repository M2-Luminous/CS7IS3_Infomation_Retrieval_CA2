The meeting involved U.S. General George Joulwan, who is both NATO's supreme commander in Europe as well as commander of U.S. forces in Europe, special UN envoy Yasushi Akashi of Japan, French General Jean Cot, the commander of UN forces in former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR), and British General Charles Ritchie, the force's chief of staff. Questioned by journalists afterwards, Akashi said the alleged differences have "never existed, except in some media reports." "I gave to General Joulwan what our conception and definition of control is," he said. Joulwan backed this up, adding: "We are in agreement on the definition of control." Their meeting was called to define exactly what the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations consider acceptable concessions by the Bosnian Serbs on their weapons besieging the capital. The meeting came three days ahead of a NATO ultimatum to Bosnia's warring parties -- primarily the Serbs -- to withdraw their weapons from around Sarajevo or place them under UN control by midnight Sunday. Failing this, they will be bombed. In Brussels Wednesday, NATO and UN officials also moved to close ranks to dispel reports of differences over the definition of "control" and to warn there was nothing ambiguous about the ultimatum issued on February 9. Joulwan is also to meet U.S. Admiral Jeremy Boorda, the commander of allied forces for southern Europe (AFSOUTH), NATO headquarters in Brussels said. Boorda has been working closely with Cot for months, traveling to Zagreb three times in the last week. "All possible plans, mechanisms and scenarios have been ready for a while now" for any possible air strikes in Bosnia, a UN military source told AFP. The source said any mechanism to ensure no more shelling of Sarajevo -- and thus avoid air strikes -- was "very complicated, and even harder to implement since it must be accepted by all the parties," in a 22-month-old conflict where all attempts at resolving crises have broken down. In Sarajevo, UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman said there had been a "significant number" of Bosnian Serb weapons regrouped in UN-controlled zones, but said the Serbs appeared to be opting more for "withdrawal from the area" outside the 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone set by NATO. By Tuesday, Bosnian Serbs had regrouped 36 pieces in two of their barracks under the guard of unarmed UN military observers and on Wednesday placed 20 additional heavy weapons under UN control, but without moving them from their firing sites, according to a senior UNPROFOR officer. But he said these weapons had only been registered with the UN, and not dismantled, in a procedure which observers said was not exactly in line with UNPROFOR statements last Wednesday specifying they must be put under armed UN guard. UN spokesmen on the ground however expressed optimism, including Peter MacFarlane in Sarajevo who said Thursday the "process continues and at this stage those involved are satisfied." In Sarajevo, UNPROFOR commander for Bosnia General Sir Michael Rose on Thursday also told the press "both parties continue to cooperate in fulfilling the conditions of the agreement." He said the "essence" of UNPROFOR control over weapons was "that if either party wishes to get their weapons back, force will be used against them." In The Hague, an official spokesman said the Dutch, U.S. and British defense ministers would meet Sunday in Italy -- where NATO warplanes are based -- at the request of U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry to discuss Bosnia.
