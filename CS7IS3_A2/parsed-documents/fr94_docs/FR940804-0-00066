FR940804-0-00066 FR940804-0-00022 The EPA cannot determine whether the State has corrected the deficiency until it reviews the plan for adequacy. If the sanction clock were temporarily or permanently stopped upon mere submission of a plan following any section 179(a) disapproval (or finding of nonimplementation) and not started again until subsequent disapproval, mandatory sanctions would then take that much longer to have the effect of encouraging State compliance and protecting air quality in the area. Temporarily or permanently stopping the clock upon mere submission of a plan could result in abuse of the system by States knowingly submitting SIP's that EPA cannot approve in order to defer the application of sanctions. By allowing such abuses, such an approach would also be unfair to States which, despite a good faith effort at developing a corrective rule, are unable to avert sanctions following disapproval. In sum, under the revised policy, the underlying requirement for stopping the sanction clock is maintained: EPA must take final action to fully approve a submitted SIP revision or find that a State is implementing its SIP in order to permanently stop the sanctions clock and permanently lift any sanctions. As discussed above, EPA will defer and/or stay the application of sanctions when it proposes a positive finding that forms the basis for EPA to determine through an interim final action that the deficiency has been corrected; but in these cases EPA will not temporarily or permanently stop the underlying clock. The EPA also believes that its interpretation is legally supported under the Act. Generally, section 179 states that, ``*␣*␣* unless such deficiency has been corrected within 18 months after the finding, disapproval, or determination *␣*␣*'' one of the sanctions shall apply, as selected by the Administrator. Section 110(c)(1) of the Act requires EPA to promulgate a FIP at any time within 2 years after the Administrator finds that a State has not made a required submission or has made an incomplete submission, or disapproves a plan submission, ``unless the State corrects the deficiency, and the Administrator approves the plan or plan revision, before the Administrator promulgates such Federal implementation plan.'' The running of the sanctions clock is tied to the particular deficiency at issue. For example, if the clock was triggered by a finding of failure to submit or a finding of incompleteness, the clock will stop if EPA determines that the State submits a complete plan; it is not also necessary for the plan to be actually approved to stop the clock. If the complete submission is later disapproved, then a new 18-month clock will begin to run, as provided in section 179(a), and will continue to run until that deficiency is corrected with an EPA approved plan. For the FIP clock, in addition to the deficiency being corrected, section 110(c)(1) includes an additional criterion_EPA SIP approval_that must be satisfied for EPA not to have to promulgate a FIP within 2 years of a finding of nonsubmittal or incompleteness. The explicit reference to an approval as an added prerequisite_beyond ``correcting the deficiency''_ makes clear that, in the context of failures to submit or submission of incomplete plans, plan approval is quite distinct from ``correcting the deficiency.'' Therefore, the Administrator's approval is distinct from ``correcting the deficiency'' for failure to submit and incompleteness. Therefore, the fact that the ``SIP approval'' language is redundant for disapprovals, where SIP approval is part of correcting the deficiency, does not render that clause superfluous. This interpretation of the section 179 sanction clock does not ``read out'' the section 110(c) requirement, but rather merely illustrates that following disapprovals what is necessary to stop the sanction and FIP clocks is the same: EPA approval of the SIP. (See EPA's July 9, 1992 SIP processing guidance, page 10.) However, as discussed above, this is not the case for sanction clocks started by a finding of failure to submit or a finding of incompleteness. There, the State can correct the deficiency merely by submitting a SIP EPA finds complete. This would stop the sanctions clock. In these situations, the additional step of EPA approval is required to stop the FIP clock, under the plain language of section 110(c)(1). Therefore, EPA's interpretation of section 179(a) does not render the provisions of section 110(c)(1)(B) inconsistent, meaningless or superfluous. The Boise Cascade case cited by the commenter addressed a situation in which one word, ``promulgation,'' was argued by petitioners to have the same meaning as another, ``approval'' (942 F.2d at 1342). The court rejected that argument because failing to distinguish between the terms would have resulted either in a conflict between two subsections of the Clean Water Act or made superfluous the use of ``approval'' in another subsection (Id). Here, EPA's interpretation of what is required to correct a deficiency under section 179(a) does not conflict with the requirement for EPA approval to stop a FIP clock. It logically follows that approval is implicitly required to correct a deficiency based on a disapproval, since a State cannot be considered to have remedied the underlying flaw that led to a disapproval until EPA has determined that the State's attempt to do so is approvable. 29 The explicit language in section 110(c)(1)(B) is necessary because FIP clocks also may be started by a finding of failure to submit or SIP disapproval. Congress was explicitly providing that in both these instances EPA approval is required to stop a FIP clock. Therefore, the reference in section 110(c) to the need for EPA approval still has meaning when the initial failure was a failure to submit or an incompleteness finding. Thus, EPA's interpretation does not render superfluous the explicit language in section 110(c)(1)(B). 29 As discussed above, EPA believes it is appropriate at the point of proposed approval to contemporaneously issue an interim final determination that the State has corrected the deficiency for purposes of deferring or staying the application of any sanctions that are due. Again, this interim final determination would be subject to the condition that EPA grant final approval to the SIP, and would not have any final effect on the actual approval action. If the subsequent condition is not met (i.e., if EPA's proposed approval is reversed by a proposed or final disapproval), from that point on the interim final determination would have no effect and any sanctions required to be applied would be applied.
