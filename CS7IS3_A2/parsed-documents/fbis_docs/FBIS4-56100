FBIS4-56100 "dreeu103_d_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-103 Daily Report 27 May 1994 SLOVAKIA SDL Leaders Differ on Possible Meciar Coalition SDL Leaders Differ on Possible Meciar Coalition AU2605203094 AU2605203094 BFN [Editorial Report] Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 24 May on page 1 carries a 600-word interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left, SDL, signed "alg" and entitled "I Do Not See Any Prospects of Cooperation." The interview, the place and date of which are not given, deals with the possibility of the SDL's post-election cooperation with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia,HZDS. The same issue is also the subject of a 300-word interview with SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik by Robert Kotian in Bratislava SME in Slovak on 24 May on page 1. In the SLOVENSKY DENNIK interview, Weiss is asked to react to an interview with SDL Deputy Robert Fico, published in the 20 May issue of LUC (BEAM), a regional daily published in Kosice, in which Fico reportedly said that "it should not be a problem for the SDL to cooperate with the HZDS after the elections, if the HZDS comes up with a program such as it had in 1992." Weiss replies that the HZDS electoral program and its practical policy are two different things, and continues: "I said before that the HZDS has become an etatist [etatisticky] movement pursuing a vulgar right-wing policy, aimed at satisfying the interests of the party's top echelons. It was simply impossible to cooperate with this policy. Moreover, the HZDS chairman personally did everything he could to damage relations with other political parties and their representatives. He personally destroyed all prerequisites for effective political cooperation." In Weiss' opinion, the SDL's decision to support the motion of no-confidence in Meciar on 11 March 1994 was correct: "We came out against a demagogic populist policy that was increasingly resorting to the crutches of nationalism, was irrational, and did not contribute to the solution of independent Slovakia's problems. So far, we have not received any signals that the HZDS would like to change this policy. The opposite is true. The HZDS election campaign is based on pitting Slovaks against the Hungarians and the Czechs and one group of Slovaks against another group of Slovaks. It is based on the creation of the image of an enemy and we cannot agree with such policy." Asked whether the SDL could cooperate with a HZDS without Meciar, Weiss replies that "Mr. Meciar is the strongest current in the HZDS and I cannot imagine the HZDS without Meciar." Weiss also denies the existence of any pressure from the SDL rank-and-file to cooperate with the HZDS after the elections. In conclusion, he reiterates that "if the HZDS policy does not change -- and there is no indication of that -- I see no basis for post-election cooperation with the HZDS." In the SME interview, the place and date of which are not given, SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik refuses to give a definite reply to the question of possible HZDS-SDL cooperation, arguing that the party leadership has not yet discussed the issue. Confronted with the statement made by SDL Deputy Robert Fico to the daily LUC that "there should be no obstacles" to post-election cooperation between the SDL and the HZDS, as long as the HZDS observes its 1992 program, Ftacnik says: "I consider this to be Deputy Fico's personal view. We have not yet discussed this issue in substance within the SDL. We are now prepared to clarify it in a democratic manner, first within the party and, subsequently, with our coalition partners. This can no longer be only our decision. The coalition partners are to submit by 30 June the principles of post-election cooperation and our party bodies should clarify this issue in substance by then."
