The military chief has said the operation along the border consists of an inspection of each area, although the troops coincide only in certain points to coordinate actions against delinquents, rearmed groups, or drug traffickers. He added the war on drug trafficking, which has been intensified in recent days, is primarily a police task, but the military force is present to provide support whenever necessary. He explained it is inadvisable to report on the border patrol operations, because that would alert delinquents. Paredes has also said the ceremony marking the closing of the DNI [Department of National Investigation] was an appropriate recognition of those who devoted their lives to serving the fatherland. In addition, the ranking officer has said that the DNI had heroes who gave their lives in service of their country and that this was an indication of loyalty and devotion. Paredes has said the DNI closure is a historic event, because a civilian corps technical in nature will replace this institution. Modern times point to new paths, Paredes has said, but we must be careful whenever substantial changes are made in organizations that are in charge of public security, because an error of appreciation could generate problems in the near future. The DNI, he added, has to be replaced by a corps with greater professional outreach, capable of facing the high crime rate that has beset the Honduran nation.
