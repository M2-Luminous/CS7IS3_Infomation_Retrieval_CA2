A Defense Ministry source said on Wednesday that the main body of the Sangnoksu (Evergreen) Unit will be brought home in early April as earlier planned. "But, we plan to bring home an advance party of 250 men beginning mid-March depending on the conditions of Somalia," he said. To help arrange their withdrawal, Brig. Gen. Son Yong-che, deputy director of operations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and four other officers flew to Somalia on Monday, the source said. The transportation means and expenses for the withdrawal of the Korea troops and their equipment will be shouldered by the UN authorities. The expenses are estimated at about 1 million dollars. Meanwhile, the ministry decided to donate part of the equipment and supplies of the Sangnoksu Unit to the UN peacekeeping authorities in Somalia on its withdrawal. The items to be donated, worth about 500,000 dollars, will include seven jeeps, nine generators, two water supply trucks, 20 refrigerators, 50 air conditioners and some medical and other supplies, the source said.
