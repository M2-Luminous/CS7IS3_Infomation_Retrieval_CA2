First, being general prosecutor, Aleksey Kazannik has no right to oversee the legality of a legal act passed by the State Duma. Hence his unequivocal statement that the General Prosecutor's Office would immediately execute the Duma decree as soon as the document is on the general prosecutor's desk. As many people know, a package of Duma acts was delivered on the evening of 24 February at 15a Pushkinskaya Street, where A. Kazannik's agency is located. He, according to General Prosecutor's Office officials, is ill at the moment. Will this circumstance affect the date for making a decision? Second, there is also no knowing what the general prosecutor's reaction would be to the circumstance that a number of noted lawyers have serious doubts about the constitutionality of some of the provisions of the amnesty decree. Solving such differences is the prerogative of the Constitutional Court, but it is not functioning at present. What shall be done in this case? How is one to qualify the Duma decree in regard to acts of treason? -- precisely this article is invoked to charge a number of persons from among the organizers of the August 1991 and October 1993 events. Would it not be acting against logic and legal norms if the Duma amnesties Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and others, and leaves in jail those who fall under more merciful articles of the Criminal Code? Finally, one detail of no mean importance is the entering into force of the decree as soon as it becomes published. The State Duma has no press organ of its own that could be an official information source. The Duma is not known to have passed any normative act on this score. This means that the appearance of Duma decisions on the pages of some newspaper is no more than information. Thus, in addition to creating political tensions, the State Duma decision also creates a field for confrontation of a legal nature. Time will tell whether the legal community is going to have an impact on the Duma decision. At any rate, the controversial nature of this situation will affect the future of the Lefortovo inmates.
