FBIS3-34109 "drnes024_j_94006" FBIS-NES-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Signing of Accord Reportedly Postponed JN0402100894 Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic 4 Feb 94 pp 1, 25 JN0402100894 Amman AL-RA'Y Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] Sanaa, Amman, (News Agencies) -- A responsible Jordanian source yesterday said that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who had informed Jordan of their desire to sign their agreement in Amman on Sunday [6 February], have said that they now prefer to carry out a disengagement of their forces on the ground before signing the agreement. The source said that the two Yemeni leaders, in separate telephone contacts with Jordanian officials on 2 February, asked for Jordan's help in carrying out this disengagement. The source said that His Majesty King Husayn contacted the two Yemeni leaders on the phone last Tuesday, at which time they agreed to meet in Amman on Sunday to sign the accord on settling the crisis. The General People's Congress [GPC], headed by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has ruled out the possibility of an early signing of the national reconciliation agreement to end the political crisis, blaming its rival the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] for this delay. On 2 February, President Salih said that the agreement would be signed in the Jordanian capital on Saturday, but Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, a GPC member, ruled out the early signing of the agreement. Al-Iryani told a news conference that no arrangements have been made to sign the agreement either in Amman or in Yemen since the YSP, under Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, has come forth with new conditions. Al-Iryani said that the GPC was preparing to go to Amman on Saturday but that information became available indicating that new conditions have been set and that he could not now say if the GPC would go to Amman on Saturday. Al-Iryani added: The new conditions deal with constitutional, security, military, and legal affairs that were not mentioned in the agreement that the committee comprising representatives from all parties, including the GPC and YSP, reached in mid-January. The minister said: This is a new interpretation and this is strange and surprising. Al-Iryani did not elaborate further, but political sources say that it seems that the YSP is asking for guarantees from the security bodies that are run by President Salih's supporters concerning the safety of its officials, and insists that the agreement be implemented before all of its officials return to Sanaa. Al-Iryani said: The GPC has no reservations about the contents of the agreement. We are ready to sign everything that it contains. The GPC is even ready to sign it on board a vessel in high seas. He added: The GPC's stand is that the agreement should be signed as soon as possible without any obstacles. Those who set new conditions should be held responsible. The YSP yesterday said it seized antiaircraft missiles while its northern adversaries were moving them toward the south. This announcement highlights the crisis that threatens Yemen with fragmentation and takes place at a time when political leaders have ruled out the possibility of an early signing of the agreement. A YSP spokesman said that a southern brigade seized an army vehicle carrying 40 antiaircraft missiles from the north to the south.
