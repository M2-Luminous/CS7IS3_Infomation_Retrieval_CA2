The Yemeni official spoke to the radio about this visit, and said: [Begin al-'Arashi recording] I have come carrying a message from His Excellency Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council in the Republic of Yemen, to his brother His Majesty King Hassan II. As you know, Yemen is going through special circumstances, therefore it was necessary to brief his majesty on the development of the situation, particularly that the brother president attaches special interest to his majesty's point-of-view. We also certainly start from the premise that the Kingdom of Morocco, king, government, and people, stand beside Yemen and its national unity and the unity of its Yemeni territory, therefore it is necessary to put them in the picture for more consultations over the consultations that are currently taking place at the level of the Arab and Yemeni arenas. It is a good opportunity to know the view point and also clarify the stance directly. [end recording]
