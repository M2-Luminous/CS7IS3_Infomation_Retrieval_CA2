During times of crisis, the government is obliged to protect the fair distribution of material goods. Some citizens, however, illegally procure goods and raw materials from state-owned stores and later sell them on the black market at astronomical prices. As a result of theft, speculation, shady deals, and other practices common in an underground economy, a limited number of citizens have accumulated wealth and goods, which they have even ostentatiously displayed to most of their countrymen who, today, are forced to live in austerity. Other people, who also shun honest work, buy or make articles that they later sell to people at high prices, taking advantage of the needs of those suffering the effects of the economic crisis caused by external forces. This small group of citizens is rejected by most Cubans, who by making great sacrifices resist the attacks of the U.S. blockade and the devastating effects of the loss of the country's trading partners who belonged to the vanished socialist camp. At the 80,000 assemblies convoked by the unions early in the year, more than 3 million workers demanded that the state adopt strong measures to confiscate the goods and incomes of persons who enrich themselves illegally. During the recently concluded special session of the Cuban parliament, the deputies echoed the peoples' categorical rejection of the unscrupulous activities of those who unlawfully amass fortunes at the expense of the needs of the majority of Cubans. Because it is a national necessity and is of social interest and to the benefit of the public, the National Assembly of the People's Government entrusted the Council of State and the government with adopting measures, including extraordinary measures upheld by the Constitution, to eradicate the aforementioned aberrations. This week, Decree-Law No. 149, which involves the confiscation of goods and income obtained through illegal enrichment and supports energetic actions by the authorities, was disclosed. As it did at the beginning of the Revolution, the Cuban State is acting against a minority of citizens who have hoarded goods and money illegally, in brazen and demoralizing defiance of the principles of social justice that prevail in the country.
