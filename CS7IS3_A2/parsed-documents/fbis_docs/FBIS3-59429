And so, after those talks, everyone could say that was grist to their mill. Milosevic and Tudjman will be convincing their subjects that they made a "decisive" step toward peace, offering one-third of the Bosnian territory to the Muslims. It is so easy to offer something which does not belong to you! The official Bosnia-Herzegovina leadership, on the other hand, could try and convince their people that things are nevertheless going their (our?) way, for regardless of Boban's repeated rejection, Tudjman agreed that, in the transition period, Mostar and Neum be under the EC and UN administration. Or, as one can (not) guess from reports of the director of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Television that "the talks with the Serbian side aim toward the final and essentially righteous fulfillment of the territorial demands of the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation." However, how can we believe all that? The validity of the "pivotal" agreement, as West European diplomats call it -- on the Christmas cease-fire -- could best be attested to by the soldiers and citizens of Sarajevo, especially by those at Zuca and at the foot of Trebevic. But let us not be ironical, which is a common trait of every living inhabitant of Sarajevo and Bosnia, and even of yours truly. Let us also put aside all those stories about great strategies, interest zones, moral dilemmas.... We would all like to know the answer to the question whether the said agreements in Geneva and Brussels made any step toward peace. Using the language of the futile European diplomacy, the answer is in the affirmative. Greater Serbian and greater Croatian hegemonists are on the way to definitely grant the right to the Muslims-Bosnjaks to one-third of the territory (the right to the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina territory belongs to the Bosnians and not to the Bosnjaks). They were not forced to do that by the EC, as one might think, but by the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army. They would have signed for peace between the Serbs and the Croats a long time ago, perhaps in Geneva, and would be praised as peacemakers, had they succeeded in dividing Bosnia on the ground. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army would not let them do that, not the EC. The mystery about whether Tudjman and Milosevic reached an agreement on dividing Bosnia in Karadjordjevo has been all cleared up. Thanks to SKY's cameras, we saw Karadjordjevo in Geneva. Leaning over the map, Milosevic, assisted by Karadzic, was arranging the division of Bosnia together with Tudjman, Boban, and their other blind followers. The mystery is unraveled: Serbian and Croatian national leaders, deeply convinced that they fulfilled thousand-year-old yearning of their peoples, like common peasants haggling at the market, publicly established the bazaar around Bosnia, its villages and towns, which they never even heard of or visited, let alone felt for in their souls. That scene must haunt every normal Serb and Croat until the end of their existence, as a proof of the depths to which their nations have sunk. There is no bottom any more.
