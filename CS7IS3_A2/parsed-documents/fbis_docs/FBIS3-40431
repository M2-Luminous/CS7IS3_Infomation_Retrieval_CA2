The silicon carbide-based ceramic offers protection comparable to steel plate but is 50 percent lighter, the companies say. The ceramic was developed in response to the need for a material that could provide effective but lightweight protection against high velocity armour-piercing bullets without hindering mobility. TBA Industrial Products, a member of T&N's Industrial Products and Materials group, develops body armour and armour systems for the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, and the police and security organizations. The company approached T&N Technology, the research and development arm of T&N plc, for help in developing a material that gave the protection of armoured steel plate but not the weight. In response, T&N Technology set up a product development and testing programme to examine the potential of silicon carbide in this application. The Silicon carbide developed can withstand the impact of three 7.6 millimeter rounds travelling at 850 meter per second in the minus 1 power within a 100 square millimeter area. The ceramic offers a similar level of protection to steel plate but is 50 percent lighter. It is also 20 percent lighter than conventionally alumina, and substantially cheaper than boron carbide armour. In addition to personal body armour, TBA industrial Products expects a strong demand for silicon carbide armour in armoured vehicles, security vehicles and security doors.
