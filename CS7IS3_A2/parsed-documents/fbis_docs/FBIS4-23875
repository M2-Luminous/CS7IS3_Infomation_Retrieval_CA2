The calm we reported yesterday in fact only lasted for a few hours. Monique Mas asked Paul Kagame, the RPF's [Rwandan Patriotic Front's] chief of staff, why the cease- fire has been violated. [Begin Kagame recording, in English with superimposed French translation] The cease-fire that was discussed in Tunis was broken just a few hours after it was announced. This is because we had agreed to stop shooting on the condition that the killing stop and that the government forces stop holding the civilian population hostage. The cease-fire was therefore violated because it had been barely announced when government forces and militiamen abducted children from the Sainte Famille church and murdered them. I do not know what cease-fire we are now talking about. [end recording]
