The right claimed by the Tuareg rebellion to autonomous administration of the country's northern regions strongly opposed by opposition parties and black Tuaregs, who see Paris' hands in the separatist resolve of the Tuaregs. Jean de Dieu Ndong Ovono reports: [Begin Ovono recording] Public opinion in Niger is traditionally hostile to the Tuareg community, which represents only 10 percent of the country's population, and the Niamey press, of course, echoes this. The paper to cast the first stone was SAHEL DIMANCHE, the government daily, which accused France of wanting to relaunch its colonial dreams to create a common organization of Saharan regions. This was an old dream for Paris, which wanted to make the Sahara a single entity so as to gain control over a region it saw as part of its sphere of influence. The Saharan part of Niger has enormous mineral resources, especially uranium, the country's main source of revenue. Needless to say, what is being described in Niamey as the French plot is simply unacceptable. This is why the weekly DEMOCRATE urgently called on the Niger Government to seek a clear and unambiguous clarification from France on this affair. To crown it all, the weekly REPUBLICAIN, which is close to the Tuareg community, this week published an interview with Mano Dayak, president of the Coordination of the Armed Resistance, a coalition of four organizations of the Tuareg rebellion. This interview gave support to France's critics. Some Tuaregs even joined in the criticism. Thus a group of intellectuals, claiming to represent the black Tuareg community, issued a press release denouncing France's efforts to keep them in ignorance and servitude. France, they claim, is largely responsible for the trampling of our rights and liberties by deciding to put our community under the trusteeship of the white Tuareg minority. Representatives of the Niger Government and the rebellion are to resume their negotiations at the end of this month in Paris. France, Algeria, and Burkina Faso have been chosen as mediators by the two sides. The Tuareg rebellion has already claimed over 100 lives since it was launched at the end of 1991. It seeks the right to autonomous administration of certain northern regions and is also demanding quotas which guarantee its community's representation within the government, the National Assembly, and the Niger Army.
