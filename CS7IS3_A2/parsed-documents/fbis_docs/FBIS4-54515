Therefore, the most important question is will those turncoats, fronted by two presidents, of both the Chamber of Counties and Chamber of Representatives, cause a parliamentary crisis. There will be more and more people in suspense over the matter, for it is now President Franjo Tudjman's turn to make a move. Everybody is waiting to see what move he will make to prevent a major split in the party, but also major stirring in the Assembly. What steps will he take against those who "broke loose"? Is it more harmful for Croatian interests to eliminate two leading men from the Assembly than let them be and devote oneself to "being a mole"? Do Moles Remain? Although politicians have lately been very much involved in some vague procedural regulations of some laws, with regard to a possible parliamentary crisis, the procedure is clear. First of all, a deputy can change parties and remain a deputy, for that right is granted by the Constitution. Deputies in the Assembly have no binding mandate, they cannot be revoked because of their political views or because they decided to accept another party's program and leave the party that brought them into the Assembly. Judging by the list of the Constituent Circle of Croatian Independent Democrats, with regard to the Chamber of Representatives, 13 HDZ members and one member of the Croatian Party of Rights will join the new party. In the Chamber of Counties, three HDZ members will join the new party. At present, the HDZ has 83 mandates in the Chamber of Representatives, without Father Tomislav Duka, who asked to leave the party, and without deputy attorney general (Lovric of Osijek is the president of the Trade Court, and that function is incompatible with the function as a deputy, but he cannot be released from his function as a deputy, for the State Tribunal has not been formed yet). The "Duka" Case So, playing with numbers a little, we see that everything is possible, and that the outcome of the ballot is uncertain, although that does not necessarily mean that a parliamentary crisis is in the offing. It could just happen that, from now on, there will be more cases like the one at the last session when they could not make the decision to acquit Father Tomislav Duka of his membership in the Committee for Electing, Appointing, and Administrative Jobs. Let me remind you: On that occasion, out of 79 deputies who voted, only 45 were in favor of putting the subject back on the agenda of the committee, five deputies abstained from voting, and only 29 voted to acquit Father Duka of his position as a member of the committee. As far as we can remember, this is one of those very rare occasions when the HDZ majority did not vote "by command." There could be more such cases, even when voting for a single law, which means that the arguments of the opposition could also be the arguments of some members of the ruling party, now more than ever. A fierce battle is imminent, this time on the basis of quality, not quantity. We should not take lightly the disorder created in the Committee for Electing, Appointing, and Administrative Jobs. Formerly a member of that committee, Father Duka has now joined future Croatian Independent Democrats, and HDZ deputies Ante Karic and Davorin Popovic are also on the list of the Constituent Circle for the establishment of the HND. Consequently, for the first time since deputies were elected, the committee was left without the HDZ majority. For, the committee has 11 members, seven of which were members of the HDZ, while now there are only four of them, which means that the HDZ can practically make no decisions! That is not insignificant considering the fact that this Committee proposes all dismissals and appointments, even that of the president of the Assembly. Possibility of Secret Ballot And now we come to the most interesting question: Will the president of the country and the president of the ruling party dismiss Mesic and Manolic from their presidential functions and can he do that at all? The demand to replace the president of the Chamber can be made by 30 deputies, and it could also be done by the Committee for Electing, Appointing, and Administrative Jobs. Even if 30 deputies demanded the dismissal, the demand would have to be considered by the committee. The committee cannot stop the procedure of dismissing and appointing, for even in case of negative decision by the committee, there would have to be a ballot in the chamber. Certainly, neither Manolic nor Mesic will resign from their presidential functions. Therefore, if it should so be decided, with regard to Mesic, the matter would be decided by a ballot in the Chamber of Representatives. The matter of acquittal will be put to the vote as it is usually done with regard to appointments. However, there might be a secret ballot in case there are two or more candidates. At the proposal of 10 deputies, the Chamber can decide to put the matter to the vote if there is more than one candidate. If that should happen, we suppose that the "logistics" of the new party would be in favor of a secret ballot. It is quite probable that both Mesic and Manolic would run again, and the Standing Orders specify they can do that if Mesic gets 30 and Manolic 20 signatures. In the present ratio of powers, that would not be difficult. The HDZ would put up their own candidate. In that case, it would be almost impossible to predict who could be a candidate for the president of the Chamber of Representatives. Perhaps again Zarko Domljan, the first president of the Assembly, presently vice president of the Chamber of Representatives? Or Katarina Fucek, perhaps? Considering the fact that Katica Ivanisevic would run for president of the Chamber of Counties, this would make a very interesting female cast! Who will win? The candidate who will get the majority vote, provided that most deputies are present, i.e., at least 70, in which case 36 votes will give him or her victory. If the session will be attended by all deputies, then it would take 70 votes to win. All deputies of all parties will, obviously, not miss such an occasion and, in that case, the ruling party would, of course, have to put up a candidate whom the opposition would find acceptable as well. Conflicts in Working Bodies Still, the prevailing opinion is that the ruling party would get more if it left things the way they are than if it dismissed the presidents of both chambers. Clearly, the ruling party has an indisputable right to elect the president, i.e., presidents of both chambers, since it won the elections. However, it is very risky to eliminate both officials at once. It is debatable whether the two men would be more harmful as presidents or as two former key figures. Anyhow, we think there will not be a real parliamentary crisis, but there will definitely be some changes in the Assembly. There will first be some conflicts in working bodies. It is very much possible that the HDZ will no longer have a majority in many of them. Committee members were elected observing the election results of certain parties and the HDZ has hitherto had about 65 percent of the mandate in every working body. Considering that the new party will soon be formed, this percentage would be lower, at the expense of the HDZ. For the first time, the HDZ will be forced to look for partners and form a coalition on certain issues. Where will it find them? There could be some absurd situations, indeed: Should it look for them in Djukic's Serbian National Party or in Djapic's HSP? And the wheel seems to be turning backward. Let us remember a discussion held last year on 15 October, during a three-day session of the Assembly, about taking the mandate of some HSP members. Djuro Perica was then the only HDZ member who defended the HSP members, and Minister Tarnaj, who was then a deputy, voted against taking away their immunity. Will we witness another procedural competition, this time in the Chamber of Representatives? Can the procedure block the Assembly? At present, it seems that is all up to Mesic and Manolic and their will to convene sessions of those chambers. While in the Standing Orders According to the Standing Orders, the presidents of the chambers convene sessions two times a month, as a rule. The rule has not been obeyed yet, which is evident from the number of sessions that were held: 17 sessions in the past 18 months. What happens if presidents do not convene sessions at regular intervals? Our Standing Orders do not contain such regulations as are included, for example, in the Standing Orders of the Austrian parliament, i.e., that it is possible to convene parliament within five days of filing a demand at the request of at least one-fifth of the deputies. This regulation was deliberately excluded from our Standing Orders, for the opposition would have the one-fifth in both chambers without problems; in the Chamber of Counties the liberals alone make up the one-fifth, which means that the opposition could keep convening sessions, and some were obviously trying to avoid that. No one can convene a session but them and they practically have the possibility to block the work of the Assembly. However, supposing they do not opt for that, at least not for a very long time, if for no other reason than that they would not be true to the name of the party they are forming, i.e., that they are democrats and that they respect the procedure. They will probably be convening sessions and work in favor of their party, asking the opposition to help. Perhaps they will refer to the changed ratio of powers, which gives them the right to keep their leading positions in the Assembly, which would not mean much in the division of power since the Government is made up of members of just one party. Without "Fighting to the End" We can only hope that both turncoats and those who remain true to the ruling party are equally set to work for the prosperity of Croatia, and that they will not, in their political struggle, "fight to the end," but that they will try to act as true members of the Assembly, advocating the rule of the law and parliamentary ways of fighting. In the leadership of the Assembly, the ratio of powers is now 2:2, if we consider presidents and vice presidents. Let us hope the change in the ratio of powers will not influence the internal political stability of Croatia. That is not in the interest of international factors either, which Mate Granic made clear both at the meeting of the HDZ Club and at the session of the VONS [Council for Defense and National Security]. If it should, however, come to serious disturbance in balance, both sides are to blame, both those who stayed and the runaways. That will be an opportunity for the opposition, although it is questionable whether they will know how to make use of it. Here is a good side of this imbalance: There have been problems with a quorum for a while. But now it seems everybody will come to help "their side." If they do not get out of control, these could be very interesting sessions, although we can still not expect to have the British unwritten rule according to which some Labor Party members leave the session if too many members of the Conservative Party show up that day, thus disturbing the standard electoral ratio of powers.
