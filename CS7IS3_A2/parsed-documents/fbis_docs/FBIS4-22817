Poroshkov, V.S. Gurin, and N.I. Kuntsevich, Physicochemical Problems Scientific Research Institute, Byelarus University, Minsk; UDC 541.138.3] [Abstract] TiO[.sub]2[/] films were produced on a metallic titanium surface by hydrolysis of a solution of polybutyltitanate in air. The resultant amorphous films were heated at a temperature of 450 to 500ï¿½C for 1 hour. This resulted in the formation of an anatase modification of a polycrystalline TiO[.sub]2[/] film (i.e., Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/]). Next the electrochemical deposition of Cu, Pd, and Ag onto the surface of Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/] electrodes was studied. The deposition was performed from a solution containing nitrates of the respective metals with a concentration of 10[.sup]-5[/] to 10[.sup]-3[/] M. In some of the experiments, the deposition was conducted under continuous ultraviolet irradiation in an electrochemical cell. Preliminary electrochemical deposition of the metal particles onto the surface of the Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/] electrodes was accomplished by cathode deposition of a calculated amount of metal in a galvanostatic mode. Some of the electrodes were modified by adsorption of Pd[.sup]2+[/] ions from a 0.005 M PdCl[.sub]2[/] solution for 10 to 1,000 seconds under closed-circuit conditions. The electrochemical experiment was conducted in a conventional electrochemical cell with a P-5827M potentiostat. Saturated Ag chloride served as the normal electrode, and a platinum electrode served as the auxiliary electrode. The experiments established that the deposition of each of the aforementioned metals on TiO[.sub]2[/] electrodes occurred with a higher cathode overvoltage than on metallic electrodes in the respective solutions. Preliminary electrochemical deposition of Ag particles onto the electrodes at a surface concentration of 10[.sup]14[/] atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] or less resulted in a decrease in the Ag deposition overvoltage by more than 0.1 V. Modification of the electrode surface by Cu particles in amounts up to 10[.sup]15[/] to 10[.sup]16[/] atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] resulted in only a slight shift of the cathode arm of the potentiodynamic curve to the negative side. Nor did preliminary electrochemical modification by Pd particles with a concentration of 10[.sup]15[/] atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] have any significant effect on the position of the cathode arm when it was Pd that was being electrochemically deposited. Only when the amount of Pd deposited in advance was increased to 10[.sup]16[/] atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] did the deposition potential shift by 0.05-0.1 V. Preliminary modification of the electrode surface by Ag in the amount of 10[.sup]16[/] atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] resulted in a shift in the cathode arm of the potentiodynamic curve to the positive side, i.e., it resulted in a decrease in the cathode overvoltage of the metal's deposition as compared with that in the case of an unmodified electrode. Irradiation of the TiO[.sub]2[/] electrodes with ultraviolet radiation during the electrochemical process did alter the potential of the deposition of Cu or Pd. In the case of Ag, however, irradiation caused an decrease in the overvoltage of the metal's deposition by more than 0.1 V and a significant increase in process rate. When Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/] electrodes in contact with a 0.005 M AgNO[.sub]3[/] solution were subjected to ultraviolet irradiation (H = 0.1 J/cm[.sup]2[/]), photolytic silver particles ranging in size from 5 to 50 nm formed in a concentration of 10[.sup]8[/] to 10[.sup]9[/] cm[.sup]-2[/] (with a predominance of particles measuring 5-10 nm in size). As the electrodes' exposure increased (H = 1 J/cm[.sup]2[/]), the concentration increased (to 10[.sup]10[/] cm[.sup]-2[/]) with virtually no change in the particles' size distribution. Only at much higher exposures (to 10 J/cm[.sup]2[/]) did larger particles (50-100 nm) appear and smaller particles (5-10 nm) disappear. Cathode polarization of the Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/] electrode coupled with simultaneous ultraviolet irradiation resulted in particles that were an order of magnitude larger than those formed when the deposition process was conducted with no irradiation. The significant differences observed for the selectivity of the deposition of Cu, Ag, and Pd was attributed to the fact that the energy levels of the metal particles created did not in all cases correspond with the position of the Fermi level of TiO[.sub]2[/]. Kinetic factors involved in the growth of the particles of the metal phase were also implicated. Figures 3; references 4 (Russian).
