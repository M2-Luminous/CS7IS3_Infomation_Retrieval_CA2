FR941220-0-00029 FR941220-0-00005 Hospice Care Covered Services (§418.202) Comment: One commenter expressed concern that this section would increase a hospice's operating costs because the commenter believed it would require that homemaker services be furnished by home health aides. Response: The commenter misinterpreted the requirements of the paragraph. Although a home health aide can furnish homemaker services, Medicare does not require homemaker services furnished under the Medicare hospice benefit to be provided by home health aides. This section specifically distinguishes between home health aide services, which must be provided by an individual who meets the home health aide training and competency evaluation requirements of §484.36, and homemaker services, which can be provided by individuals who are not required to have completed any specific training or competency evaluation. Changes From the Proposed Rule Made by This Final Rule Following is a summary listing of provisions in this final rule that differ from those in the proposed rule. Additional minor clarifying or editorial changes have also been made. •We have revised proposed §409.43(b) to clarify the required content of physician orders. •We have revised proposed §409.43(c) to correct a printing error in the physician signature requirements. •We have revised proposed §409.43(d) to require the registered nurse or therapist who is responsible for furnishing or supervising the ordered services to sign verbal orders received by the HHA. •We have revised proposed §409.44 to include general requirements for coverage determinations. •We have revised proposed §409.42, §409.44, and §409.45 to replace the term ``speech therapist'' with ``speech-language pathologist'' and the term ``speech therapy'' with ``speech-language pathology services.'' •We have revised proposed §409.45(a) to clarify that no dependent services may be covered after the final qualifying service has been furnished. •We have revised proposed §409.45(c)(2) to allow the provision of medical social services on a short-term basis to a beneficiary's family member or caregiver. •We have revised proposed §409.45(g)(1) to replace ``Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association'' with ``Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.'' •We have revised proposed §409.47(b) to include the allowable home health outpatient settings specified in the Act. •We have added §409.49(c), which excludes Medicare home health coverage of services that would not be covered as inpatient services. This was inadvertently omitted from the proposed rule. •We have revised proposed §409.49(g) to exclude Medicare home health coverage of medical social services provided to family members except as provided in §409.45(c)(2). •We have revised §484.36(b)(2)(iii) to require a home health aide to receive at least 12 hours of in-service training during each 12-month period. •We are not including the proposed home health aide supervision requirements that had been located in proposed §§484.36(d)(2) (i) and (ii). •We have revised the introductory paragraph of proposed §484.48 to require the HHA to inform the attending physician of the availability of the discharge summary and to send it to him or her upon request. •We have added a new §413.125 to refer to the rules on allowability of certain costs in §§409.49(b) and 409.46. Regulatory Impact Statement We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all HHAs are considered to be small entities. Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. The provisions in this final rule clarify existing policy and represent minor changes to the proposed rule published September 27, 1991 (56 FR 49154). We have revised §409.45(a) to clarify that we do not cover dependent services after the final qualifying service has been furnished except under certain circumstances. Though we are not able to estimate the magnitude, we believe this change will result in Medicare program savings.
