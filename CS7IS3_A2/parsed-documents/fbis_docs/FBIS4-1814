After several days of argumentative negotiations, the two sides could not reach the expected agreement on three routine matters, including the "repatriation of personnel entering the opposite regions in violation of the relevant regulations and related issues." Under the pretext that no progress had been made in their consultations on the three routine matters, the SEF unilaterally canceled the prescheduled agenda reached between the ARATS and SEF leaders during their Beijing talks on exchanging opinions or holding consultations at the fourth round of consultations on three topics, including "making joint efforts to curb maritime smuggling and robberies and other crimes," as well as on several economic, scientific, and technological issues listed in the "Wang-Gu talks agreement." These consequences have arisen from many factors, but the most important one is whether or not the ARATS-SEF consultations should abide by the principle of keeping faith and should take this as the foundation and departure point for their consultations. As everyone is aware, after the "Xiamen consultations" and the "Taipei consultations," the leaders of the two organizations made breakthrough progress during their Beijing talks in February, and reached a high degree of common understanding on three topics, including "repatriation of personnel entering the opposite regions in violation of the relevant regulations." The two sides' ideas were tending toward a consensus on the "standard clauses" to be applied, on the "ships to be used by the two sides," and on "not repatriating Taiwanese hijackers to the mainland" proposed by the SEF. According to these ideas, the ARATS raised suggestions fully absorbing the SEF opinions during the ongoing consulations. We should say that the common understanding reached between the ARATS and SEF leaders during their Beijing talks created excellent conditions and laid a solid foundation for resolving the three routine matters. If the current consultations can make further progress on this basis according to this common understanding, the pending problems and differences will not be difficult to resolve, and reaching an agreement can be expected soon. Prior to the current consultations, the ARATS had made further efforts so that an agreement could be reached. On each side, concerning the formation of a fishing dispute coordination organization and enabling the results of mediation to have a binding force, the ARATS and the relevant mainland departments studied the existing law and regulations and worked out a practical method, whereby the results of mediation are to be changed into a financial claim document with a mandatory binding force entrusted by a notary office according to the law. At the current consultations, the SEF raised some opinions concerning the issues on which the ARATS and SEF leaders had reached a consensus during their Beijing talks. The ARATS expressed its willingness to discuss this problem and seek settlement methods acceptable to both sides. Comments from Taiwan press circles on the achievements of the Beijing talks were good, and Taiwan's "Mainland Affairs Committee" also issued a statement confirming these achievements. However, while when these acclaims were still resounding in the ear, in mid-March the "Mainland Affairs Committee" and the relevant departments in Taiwan partially renounced the consensus reached at the Beijing talks. A Taiwan press report said: "The special group panel decided that the agreement plan on the three topics, including the repatriation of hijackers, will abide by the Taiwan side's principle clarified at the `Taipei meeting'; in other words, our government and the relevant departments have renounced the high degree of common understanding reached at the `Chiao-Tang meeting.'" Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that no achievements have been made during the current consultations. Meetings between the ARATS and SEF leaders are important, high-level meetings held according to the "two organizations' meeting and relation system," and the opinions and consensus they express are solemn. Indiscreetly renouncing the consensus reached between the ARATS and SEF leaders is an act of disrespect to the leaders of the two organizations. These people's sincerity for routine consultations and development of relations between the two sides is doubtful. Recently, Mr. Li Tenghui has indicated repeatedly that this year "is one for both sides to form mutual trust." The most important point in forming mutual trust is keeping faith. If what is agreed today is renounced tomorrow, and if a consensus reached between the ARATS and SEF leaders can be denied or neglected, how can consultations proceed normally and achieve results? How can we talk about sincerity or forming mutual trust? Since their establishments, the two organizations have conducted many rounds of consultations on routine matters involving the interests of the people on both sides of the strait, and also have reached two agreements. A review of past experience enables us to easily understand that as long as both sides abide by the spirit of mutual respect, equal consultations, practicality, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and accumulating common understandings, it will not be difficult to achieve results and reach an agreement. Consultations on routine matters should proceed with the aim of resolving problems and gaining mutual benefit. Sensitive political issues absolutely can be avoided. The attitude of making simple problems complicated and politicizing routine matters is not commendable, and also runs counter to the fundamental interests and expectations of the people on both sides of the strait. The people hope that the leaders of the two organizations will take keeping faith as the foundation and departure point for their routine consultations, and on the basis of the agreements they have reached, will make further efforts for an early consensus and the happiness of the people on both sides.
