The policy, which was approved by the government last month, for the first time orients the auto industry toward the interests of everyday consumers. The policy document is kept confidential, but key points have been released by government officials. China's market of 300 million households, comprising 1.18 billion people, is potentially the world's largest. However, since the average worker earns only 4,000 yuan ($460) a year, most of the 1 million sedans now in use are owned by work units. Experts predict that competition will be intense among auto makers, Chinese and foreign, to develop affordable small cars. Business Weekly has learned that foreign companies such as America's General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co, France's Renault SA, Sweden's Volvo, South Korea's Daewoo Motor Co and Japan's Nissan Motor Co will launch components-manufacturing projects in China before long. Industry observers are paying close attention because such projects can be developed into car-assembly plants in a short time. China now has six assembly ventures with Germany's Volkswagen AG, France's Peugeot SA, America's Chrysler Corp and Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. These plants produced 230,000 sedans last year. "Don't worry about competition," a reform-minded official said. "Competition among auto makers benefits customers as well as the growing market economy." The new policy does try to promote the development of domestic manufacturers. For instance, it prohibits the approval of new assembly plants over the next two or three years. After that, approval will be withheld from projects that would assemble cars with complete knock-down components from overseas. In new ventures at least 40 percent of the parts used in assembling cars must be made in China. In three years that proportion must be 60 percent. Sources close to the negotiations with foreign auto makers say potential investors seem undeterred by the policy. The market is too big to ignore, and all foreign manufacturers planning to invest in China say they like competition. Aside from foreign auto makers quite a number of Chinese plants are developing low-priced cars. Some claim that in a couple of years mini cars selling for 20,000 yuan ($2,300) will be available. Experts point out that low-priced vehicles are not necessarily low quality and heavily polluting. Besides standards for safety, quality, fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, the experts say, manufacturers should also pay attention to road and repair conditions. In addition to the 230,000 sedans made in China, about 400,000 vehicles from overseas entered the country through various channels. Car smuggling was rampant in 1992 and last year but has now been stopped. Nevertheless, people still ask if Chinese-made sedans will be good enough to compete with imports. It is believed that China will have to cut tariffs on imported cars if, as expected, it rejoins the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) this year. A long-time industry observer pointed out that current situation shows the government has not yet made up its mind to give the industry free rein to develop. No official permission has been granted for large enterprise groups to raise urgently-needed development capital at home or abroad despite years of appeals.
