FR941205-0-00096 FR941205-0-00024 51. The Commission's must-carry requirements became effective on June 2, 1993, during a Copyright Office accounting period. 24 Prior to the implementation of the must-carry rules, carriage of any station was at the discretion of the cable operator. In such cases, the cable operator carried such a signal even though it incurred a copyright liability for the period ending June 30, 1993. That liability did not increase due to a change in our regulations for stations which had previously been carried, and therefore the liability had already been assumed. We do not believe it appropriate to require the broadcast station to reimburse for that liability, even if carriage became mandatory on June 2, 1993. However, with respect to a broadcast station which was not previously carried by the cable system and which immediately asserted its must-carry rights on June 2, 1993, we believe that such station should reimburse the cable operator for any increased copyright liability incurred as a result of adding that signal between June 2, 1993 and June 30, 1993. Therefore, in the case of a station that agreed to be added on June 2 and committed to indemnification, the station is responsible for the whole semiannual fee. In particular, the station had the opportunity to postpone satisfying the conditions of must-carry status until the first day of the next Copyright Office accounting period. 24 The Copyright Office divides the year into two accounting periods_January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31. 52. INTV seeks to establish a rebuttable presumption that all stations are significantly viewed throughout their ADIs. We recognize that there may be some merit in considering alternative procedures for addressing significant viewing showings and that there may be both policy and efficiency reasons for attempting to parallel ADI and significant viewing service area decisions. The INTV proposal, however, is in our view sufficiently novel that it is not appropriately considered in the context of this proceeding. This is particularly the case since the significant viewing process has ramifications in terms of other rules, such as the network nonduplication rules, that are not the subject of this proceeding. 2. Remedies 53. Section 615(d)(1) and Section 615(j) provide for the resolution of carriage and channel positioning disputes between a broadcast station and a cable operator. With respect to commercial stations, the 1992 Cable Act requires a local commercial station to notify the cable operator of an alleged violation, and requires the cable operator to respond to such a notice, prior to the station's filing a complaint with the Commission. However, with respect to NCE stations, the 1992 Cable Act permits a NCE station to file a complaint with the Commission prior to notifying the cable operator. In the Report and Order we discussed these provisions and adopted rules for their implementation. Upon review of those rules, we find it necessary to make some adjustments on our own motion, as they relate to the filing of a complaint by a NCE station. 54. As indicated above, a NCE station is not required to notify a cable operator prior to filing a complaint with the Commission. In the Report and Order, we stated that ``it is anticipated, though not required, that if there is any question relating to the carriage obligations of the cable system, the NCE station will make inquiries of the cable system prior to filing a complaint.'' We also stated that if a NCE station wanted to follow the procedures outlined for complaints filed by a commercial broadcasting station, it could do so as long as it notified the cable system of such intent. In establishing the time frames by which any broadcaster (commercial, noncommercial or LPTV) should file a complaint, we stated that such complaint should be filed within 60 days of an ``affirmative action'' by a cable operator which directly affects the carriage rights of a broadcast station. We then proceeded to define ``affirmative action'' as the denial by a cable operator of a request for either carriage or channel position, or the failure of a cable system to respond to such a demand within the required 30-day time frame. It appears that by establishing such a 60-day requirement based upon an ``affirmative action,'' we have made the complaint procedure for NCE stations more rigorous than was intended, either by our rule or the intent of the 1992 Cable Act. Therefore, for the purposes of a NCE station complaint, we are revising ยง76.7 to allow a NCE station to file a complaint at any time it determines that its carriage rights have been violated. We believe this better reflects the language of the 1992 Cable Act and will eliminate the possibility that a NCE complaint would be dismissed based solely on a failure to meet the 60-day time frame, prior to having the merits of the complaint considered.
