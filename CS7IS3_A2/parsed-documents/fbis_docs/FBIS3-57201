This was announced today at a news conference by Russian Federation Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin. Speaking about the nature of the Russian proposals, he singled out three main components of the new initiative. First, Russia is proposing "urgent and careful preparations for a meeting of the UN Security Council to be held in Geneva, to which representatives of the three Bosnian sides, as well as the leaders of Yugoslavia and Croatia, would be invited. The aim of such a meeting would be to finalize an agreement on peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to get this document signed. "Second, as part of the process of preparing the session, Russia will ask the UN Secretary General to draw up "a detailed report on all aspects of the situation in this region, as well as the position at the settlement talks." "Third, the Russian side believes that, without waiting for a meeting at foreign minister level, the UN Security Council should now proceed "to prepare a resolution on Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose main element would be a demand that a cease-fire be strictly observed, that the delivery of humanitarian aid should not be impeded, and that the operation of the well-known safe zones should be strengthened." Vitaliy Churkin noted that "in resolving the Bosnian crisis it is essential to observe priorities and not to let the world forget that without a political settlement it will be impossible to achieve an in any way satisfactory solution to numerous humanitarian issues". Russia's position on these problems, he stressed, is not "pro-Serbian, anti-Serbian, pro-Muslim, anti-Muslim or anything else of that kind." "Our position is objective and aimed at bringing about a political settlement as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina could escalate to the point where it would cast its shadow far beyond the Balkan region," Vitaliy Churkin declared.
