B. Karasin, director of the RF MFA [Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs] Information and Press Department, conducted by DIPLOMATICHESKIY VESTNIK correspondent: "A Subject of Particular Attention"] [Text] [Correspondent] Grigoriy Borisovich, the topic of cadre changes within the system of the MFA of Russia is once again becoming the subject of particular attention of our mass media. Practically every new appointment of a Russian ambassador abroad is perceived as a sensation. Journalists often ask you questions at briefings regarding such appointments. How can this be explained? [Karasin] The interest of the press, and also of Russian society as a whole, in the MFA cadre policy is quite understandable. We are speaking of those people who are entrusted with the task of ensuring the foreign policy of our state. We must remember that the MFA system is a living, moving organism which is in a state of permanent dynamics. Along with specialization by states and regions, high level diplomats develop a universality. This makes is possible to use them in any section of the diplomatic service. At the same time, work in the central apparatus in Moscow is alternated with long- and short-term assignments abroad. The rotation of cadres along the horizontal and the vertical refreshes the professional training of the diplomat and facilitates the development of a new, non-ordinary view of the problems and a creative approach to their solution. Therefore, when we speak of the appointment of deputy ministers or heads of certain departments as ambassadors, this is certainly not a cause for sensation, but rather, on the contrary--a confirmation of the established practice. I would like to emphasize one other delicate moment associated with the appointment of ambassadors. The fact is that after approval of one or another candidacy in Moscow, the leadership of the state where the envoy is being sent must give an agreement--official consent as to his appointment. Therefore, until the agreement is given we cannot say that the ambassador has been appointed. Today no one makes any secret of the appointment of new ambassadors, and as soon as this becomes a fact the information is publicized. [Correspondent] The mechanism of appointment of Russian ambassadors evokes interest, and primarily the criteria for selection of candidates to work in the highest diplomatic post abroad. Are there any standard documents regulating the activity and defining the rights and responsibilities of ambassadors? [Karasin] There are two main criteria for the selection of cadres for diplomatic work--devotion to the state interests of Russia, and a proper understanding and professional ability to defend these interests and to solve the problems posed by the leadership of the country. An Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation is a notable figure in many respects. He represents not the MFA, but the state, and it is the ambassador who largely determines the image of Russia. Moreover, the ambassador is the head of what is often a rather large collective of Russian representatives, and of the Russian colony in the country as a whole. For this reason, he must have special business and personal qualities, a high professional level, and an overall competency in area studies and international affairs. We must note that in our country, as in others, not only are career diplomats appointed as ambassadors, but quite often also state leaders, leading scientists and journalists. In their practical affairs such ambassadors rely on their life experience, as well as on professional diplomatic workers. Standard statutes regulating the activity of the diplomatic service, including that of ambassadors, to my knowledge, have been developed. However, as yet they have not been ratified, since the former Supreme Soviet did not adopt the law on state service. The question thus remains open for the present time. [Correspondent] What are the results of the reform of the MFA which began approximately two years ago? Has it been possible to create more effective and efficient structures of the Russian diplomatic service? What difficulties have been encountered along the way? [Karasin] Reform was not painless for us, since it touched upon human lives. However, it became necessary, since it was caused by the cardinal domestic political changes taking place in the country and by the need to give Russia a new image on the international arena. We are able to retain a core of experienced and promising diplomats. And they, I am sure, will be able to withstand various temptations to go over to the world of business. Today we are experiencing practically the same material difficulties which scientists, doctors, teachers and other workers in the budget sphere experience. However, we like our work and do not intend to leave it. Nothing in the world stands still, everything evolves. That is the case also in diplomacy. Therefore, the organizational modifications will continue. Thus, at a meeting of the MFA governing board held on 12 November, decisions were adopted regarding continued activization of work with the CIS countries and the introduction of appropriate changes into the structure of individual subdivisions. This, I might add, does not foresee any reductions. [Correspondent] Will the appearance of numerous parties and movements on the domestic political landscape of Russia influence its foreign policy? What effect will the existence of different viewpoints on current international problems have on the activity of the Russian representations abroad? [Karasin] The MFA and the Russian embassies abroad have been and will continue to be all-state institutions. Under conditions of political pluralism, we are interested in a constructive interaction with all political powers and parties. One of the most important tasks of the MFA under the new conditions is to explain the essence of Russian positions on the entire spectrum of international problems. Foreign policy must be understood and accepted by millions of Russians. And one more thing. As a result of the various domestic political processes and the struggle of ambitions, a stream of entirely unsubstantiated accusations has recently poured down upon the Russian diplomatic service. Diplomats in the center and in the embassies were in essence subjected to a constant moral-psychological pressure which, frankly speaking, did not facilitate a strengthening of the prestige of our Homeland and its representatives. After all, to discuss foreign political problems and to criticize individual actions does not mean to thoughtlessly defame our own diplomats. We must evidently realize that Russia has no alternative diplomatic service. The only structure for implementing foreign policy is the MFA of Russia. I believe that Russians do not doubt the ability of our diplomats to defend our country's interests.
