"Matchmaking" would be conducted for those enterprises in puberty [qing chun qi 7230 2504 2601] so that they might be "married" as early as possible, with "the market, interests and privileges as well as equity" boldly conceded to foreign businessmen. He indicated that Guangzhou would take major action in the transformation of enterprises in the share-holding system; a specialized trade center for property rights would be set up. Regarding those state-owned enterprises in poor condition, an asset evaluation would be conducted rationally by a state-owned asset management company; at the same time some enterprises would be founded to purchase those "perishing" enterprises, which would revive them through special packaging, transformation, repair and maintenance, then they will be sold at higher prices. In a nutshell, those "perishing" enterprises would no longer be salvaged through bank loans at discounted interest rates and assured power supplies to linger out a meager existence, but would implement a measure likened to "euthanasia." In addition, he stated that Guangzhou would complete the transformation of enterprises to companies within two or three years, with the shaping of an operational pattern of multiple economic factors. An enterprise might form a board comprising many aspects with several bosses. Should the shares of these enterprises be transferred, they could be sold to state-owned enterprises which were rich, or be listed by the company, while allowing share-holders to buy the shares. In addition, foreign businessmen could buy those shares, too. Today, Guangzhou boasts some 20,000 enterprises in various categories, of which some 4,000 are industrial enterprises. Take the large-type Zhujiang cement work for example. Earlier, it sold half of its equity to some foreign businessman, and managed to transfer its loans; consequently, the enterprise is developing "without any burden." Through defining enterprise property rights and asset evaluation, said Chen Kaizhi, from now on dynamic control would be implemented regarding state-owned assets, so that state-owned enterprises might appreciate in management. He believed that the reform of property rights would be an impetus to bring along the further deepening of enterprise reform in China.
