[Gaydar] Well, about the Russian economy next year. In principle it depends on the economic and political conclusions that are drawn from the 1993 events. In our economy 1993 was a year of the gradual formation of market relations structures, of very slow progress, of vacillations and inconsistency. In spite of the mild policy our opponents were not strong enough to decisively and consistently switch our economy onto a course, lets say, of restoration of traditional mechanisms, or even to the Ukrainian course of development. We did not have enough power and opportunities to consistently accomplish the policy of reforms. At present we are at the crossroads. Naturally, one can get scared once more, and, naturally, one can now choose a course of fueling inflation, masking it with words about the need to support industry structures, [words indistinct] and so on. Then in the spring inflation will gradually gain momentum and by summer it will once again reach an extremely high level. After that it will turn out that it is very hard to live in these conditions, that there is nothing nice in it, and there will be another budgetary crisis. In short, 1994 will develop approximately along the lines of 1993. We are at the turning point. Considering the first stage as mainly completed, it possible to bring to completion the part that remains -- that is the trajectory that we have consistently adopted from September when we started bringing down inflation from 29 percent to about 12 percent in December, and to continue along that line in the first six months, and on that basis gradually supplement the economic prerequisites for stable market growth. This means a new system of financing and stimulating investments, a gradual redistribution of budget allocations from the support of enterprises to the support of social programs, a gradual widening of the range of programs that can be supported up to the already planned reform of family benefits and the pension reform that is being prepared, and gradual preparation for the introduction of benefits for the poor that will replace a large number of badly coordinated benefits. At the same time it is increasing the efficiency of the system for encouraging small businesses which there is no sense in setting up with a monthly inflation of 25 percent. But when we are now already talking about inflation that is predicted to become less than 10 percent, those tax privileges that are, let's say, stipulated in the latest decree make sense. In short, we must try to develop a basis that will provide stable economic growth. Then 1994 will be a year of gradual reduction of the rate of inflation, well, at least by five to seven percent per month by the end of the year, and a year of gradual reduction of the slump in industry which could be stopped in the main by around the end of the year, by the fourth quarter. It will be a year of developing preconditions for stabilizing growth in 1995. It will also be a year for the gradual development of a more or less sensible social policy and the development of prerequisites for, strictly speaking, growth.
