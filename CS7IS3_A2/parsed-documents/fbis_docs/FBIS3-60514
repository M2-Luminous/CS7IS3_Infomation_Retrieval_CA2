The first two fatalities, for which no further data was provided, were confirmed while the local health authorities are already on the verge of desperation because the promised equipment and insecticides have not arrived from La Paz to carry out a new fumigation campaign against the mosquito that transmits the virus. Meanwhile, according to new reports collected by local radio stations, there are high rates of incidence of malaria in the communities of Puerto Rico, Nueva Esperanza, and Santa Rosa de Abuna, with the affected provinces being Manuripi, Abuna, Federico Roman, and Madre de Dios. Pando Health Unit Director Juan Cayoja reported that a commission from the National Health Secretariat is expected to arrive within the next few days, and will bring a new insecticide that the rural fumigation brigades will use. It is precisely the lack of that insecticide--to replace the old DDT which is no longer used because it damages the ecosystem--that was blamed in early October as the reason for the suspension of the fumigation activities, which resulted in the malaria outbreak. Now the insecticide INCON will be used, which does not damage the environment, Cayoja said. He added that in addition to the two deaths, approximately one thousand people throughout the department are infected with malaria, and more deaths are feared from lack of resources to assist them in a timely fashion. Cases of malaria have also appeared in the poorer neighborhoods of Cobija, inhabited primarily by farmers. According to Cayoja, the health alert will be in effect during the entire rainy season, which recently began.
