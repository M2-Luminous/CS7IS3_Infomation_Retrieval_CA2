"This agreement does provide over the life of three years, an overall reduction from what the 1993 agreement had been of approximately 700 million dollars," chief U.S. textile negotiator Jennifer Hillman told KYODO NEWS SERVICE after the signing of the agreement. This represents, "a 13 percent reduction over the time of the agreement from what the levels had been in 1993," she said. "The agreement is the product of the joint effort made by both sides, both sides have started from the principles of consultation and equality," Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Wu Yi said before the signing ceremony. According to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, China exported 7.3 billion dollars of textiles to the U.S. in 1993 and was in jeopardy of facing 25-35 percent reductions in import quotas if the agreement was not reached. Such reductions, which would have cost China up to 1.2 billion dollars, were the result of alleged illegal textile transshipments to the U.S. which circumvented 1993's existing quota by some 2 billion dollars, Kantor said. "Overall we reached an agreement that did include the language we had been seeking regarding what action we could take when we find repeated instances of transshipment," Hillman said. "The language would permit us to make a deduction of up to three times the actual amount of goods shipped. If China is a repeat offender in terms of transshipment, we felt that it was very important to have strong measures to address the problem of transshipment," she said. According to the present agreement, if in 1994 the U.S. can prove China is guilty of illegal transshipments worth 2 billion dollars, which the U.S. alleges took place in 1993, then they could effectively reduce China's import quota by up to 6 billion dollars. A high-level MOFTEC official who participated in the talks felt there was "too much pressure" in the talks, saying, "the Chinese-side gave in too much." The agreement, however, bodes well for the upcoming visit Wednesday of U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen to Beijing, the highest level visit by a U.S. official since the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen prodemocracy demonstrations, which soured relations between the two countries. In June, China also faces the loss of its most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status, with the U.S. demanding "significant overall progress" in human rights, before it can renew MFN.
