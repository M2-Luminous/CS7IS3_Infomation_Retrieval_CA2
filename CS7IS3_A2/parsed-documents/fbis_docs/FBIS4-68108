Jordanian sources had stated that the attempt was discovered hours before the arrival of 'Arafat's plane. Primitive missiles were placed near the runways of the military airfield (special section) in the "Marka" area in the Jordanian capital. That prompted the security authorities to change the landing area for 'Arafat's plane and the plane was diverted to the deserted civilian airport in the same area. The sources added that stringent security measures were taken upon 'Arafat's arrival and during his reception. Reporters were not allowed in the reception hall even though they had been invited to participate in the reception for the Palestinian president. Those who were there to receive him, including PLO leaders, were physically thoroughly searched and their cars were carefully searched. They included [Fatah] Central Committee Member 'Abbas Zaki. For the first time, their cars were not allowed in the reception area of the airport. Meanwhile, Palestinian Embassy sources in Amman have denied media reports of an attempt to assassinate 'Arafat in Johannesburg while he was attending President Nelson Mandela's inauguration last week.
