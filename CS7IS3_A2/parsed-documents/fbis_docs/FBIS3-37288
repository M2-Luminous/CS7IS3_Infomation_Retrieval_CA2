The president emphasized the importance of the formula arrived at during the drafting of the treaty. The treaty's preamble states that the Republic of Tatarstan is unified, as a state, with the RF by the constitution of the Russian Federation, by the constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, and by the treaty on delimitation of responsibilities and mutual delegation of powers. The Republic of Tatarstan takes part in international relations and foreign economic activity. "This formula," the president said, "also reflects the actual unity of the Russian state, as it exists now, and its new federal structure. It is developed on the basis of the constitution of the Russian Federation, backed up by treaty procedures, that is, by harmonization of interests." The head of state stressed that "treaties of this kind are, basically, the sole constitutional way of removing contradictions between the Russian Federation Constitution and republican constitutions in a civilized way, without twisting anyone's arm." "Everyone should see that this is not a conspiracy among bosses, another carve-up of powers, but a positive political and economic development," the president said.
