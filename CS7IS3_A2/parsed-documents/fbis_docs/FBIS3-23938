And some amazing things came to light. Despite the cutbacks in the volume of power engineering that brought its output to one-third of the 1992 level, industrial decline has been halted, and in some sectors--for instance, radioelectronics--there was even a perceptible upturn. VPK [Military-Industrial Complex] enterprises undergoing conversion did especially well; overall, 1 percent more of output was produced in 1993 than in 1992. The trend toward stabilization and growth continued in the current January as well. The government maintains that this success is the result of a correct economic policy, the beginning of structural restructuring, and the change of the import-export ratio in favor of the latter. And most importantly, in the opinion of the Council of Ministers, this is the result of calculated and judicious use of scarce fuel and power resources. Everybody in Armenia, however, also knows quite well that in most cases enterprises are able to operate because they have a priority with respect to power supply at the expense of cutting back the consumption for social and household needs. For instance, this winter electric power for household needs was available for no more than three hours a day, and lately even that has been cut down to one hour. This is why the government's intention to resume operations at the Armenian AES [nuclear electric power station], which was shut down immediately after the 1988 earthquake, today meet with practically no protestations. True, the AES has a lot of opposition outside the country. Both Tbilisi and Ankara are less than happy about the idea of its resurrection. The objections are mostly ecology-related. In Washington and other Western capitals there is less concern about the environmental health in the region; they, on the other hand, do not hide concerns that resumption of AES operations, which will produce spent nuclear fuel, may allow Armenia to start working on creating its own weapons of mass destruction. Moscow also has always entertained some suspicions of this kind. This may be the reason why all of Yerevan's pleas for credits for the station's restoration went unheeded. The issue was suddenly resolved in an unexpected way. While on an official visit to London last week, President Levon Ter-Petrosyan announced that Russia and Armenia will soon sign an agreement on creating a joint Armenian-Russian enterprise on the base of the AES. Thus, it was made clear to the West that it should not fear potential "nuclear ambitions" on the part of Yerevan: the station's operation will be under the control of one of the great powers which, of course, will never allow the AES to be used for military purposes. This already makes possible the prospect of receiving targeted credits from the West for development of the fuels and power sector. Meanwhile, Russia will undertake the main burden of financing AES restoration work. This should make it possible to restart one of the station's generators as early as the end of this year and to produce an additional 400 megawatts of electric power. One half, of course, will belong to the Russian side, and this factor will reinforce even more Yerevan's traditional economic and political dependence on Moscow, which literally will gain the ability to turn on and off the light in the Armenian population's apartments. In addition, transfer of electricity from Armenia to Russia is not economically effective because of the great distances. Therefore a piquant situation may arise whereby Russia will be selling electric power produced in Armenia to neighboring countries, with which Armenia at this point has strained relations, to put it mildly--to Turkey or even Azerbaijan. The upcoming restart of the station is in every respect a forced step. The AES is situated in a troublesome area and may at any moment become the subject of a military attack. Therefore, Armenia is working on a parallel track searching for alternative solutions in finding reliable sources of energy for the country. In April, prospecting drilling probably will finally begin in Ararat Valley, where there are assumed oil and gas deposits. A program of building a score of medium- and small-capacity hydroelectric stations is in the development stage. In the production sphere the priority is given to energy-saving technologies. Certain hopes are also pinned on the plans for building a new major gas pipeline between Iran and West Europe. In any event, implementation of even a part of these plans and projects will require considerable resources which Armenia today does not have. The restart of the AES will allow, however, achievement of a qualitative improvement in national industry operations and will seriously expand the republic's export potential. Another thing is clear as well: the soonest possible restoration of the AES, with all attendant costs, is necessary in order to create future conditions that will allow it to shut down again as soon as possible--this time, hopefully, for good.
