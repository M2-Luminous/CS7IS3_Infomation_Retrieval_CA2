It also stated it would approve an invasion to reestablish constitutional order. Grenadian Denneth Modeste, president of the OAS Permanent Council, said "no course of action against the de facto government led by General Raoul Cedras can be ruled out." The possible military operation would have the approval of all Caricom member countries, Modeste affirmed. Modeste is participating in the 24th General Assembly, which will continue until 10 June in Belem, the capital city of the northern Brazilian state of Para. He recalled the U.S. military invasion of Grenada in 1983 "helped democracy." Foreign ministers and representatives of 34 American nations rejected the Haitian military government's provisional president and announced a strengthening of economic sanctions against the Caribbean nation. The assembly approved a resolution presented by a special commission of OAS foreign ministers on 7 June. The ministers reaffirmed their decision "not to recognize the authority of any acts executed by the de facto regime, including the illegal appointment of a provisional president on 11 May 1994." The document calls for the organization's member nations to suspend all commercial flights to Haiti and comes one day after receiving approval from the United States for the measure. It also calls for the beginning of radio broadcasts in Creole beamed at the island. The sanctions approved by the international organization include a trade embargo, the freezing of the military regime's assets, and the end to international financial operations with Haiti. These measures are a response to a military coup that occurred on 30 September 1991, led by Gen. Cedras, that toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide from power.
