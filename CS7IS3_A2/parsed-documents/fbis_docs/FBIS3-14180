Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi, official in charge of the Ummah Party's external action, criticized the delegation's statements that he is in Nairobi for the sake of "sabotage and distortion" with a view to thwarting the negotiations sponsored by IGADD [Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development] members. He expects the negotiations to fail. In a statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received, Mubarak al-Mahdi stressed that contacts are continuing between the party and "our brothers in southern Sudan, first and foremost Colonel John Garang, leader of the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement [SPLM]. He also said: "We have always worked and called for stopping the devastating war in south and east Sudan and for stopping the massacres and ugly human rights violations committed in the name of the jihad by the Khartoum government throughout Sudan (...), and the government must stop the ongoing fighting immediately, instead of shedding crocodile tears over peace." He added: "We are not exploiting this dirty war in our struggle to topple the government of the Islamic Front and restore democracy in Sudan, because its fuel is our people on both sides and its victims are women and children (...). We are capable of settling our battle with the regime in Khartoum, as we have besieged it politically and socially. It is now besieged by failure and corruption." He accused the government and "its party, the Islamic Front party" of aborting the "peace plan achieved by al-Sadiq al-Mahdi's government in 1989," and of choosing the military solution and making millions homeless. He said that the government "has not achieved any significant victory," pointing out that the "SPLM still controls 90 percent of the southern territory. And the Islamic Front has reaped nothing except the demand for self-determination, which it planted and fed by its alliance with Lam Akol and its agreements with the al-Nasir group in Frankfurt and the Netherlands." He said that the Front decided to participate in the peace negotiations after "its summer military campaign failed." And it alone is responsible for the death of thousands of victims and for the soldiers, officers, and Popular Defense troops scattered in the southern territory, west of the Nile, and who are dying of starvation." He expects the Nairobi negotiations to fail, "because the National [Islamic] Front is offering Garang and southerners peace in return for symbolic participation in a dictatorial, tyrannical regime that is isolated and condemned internationally for committing the ugliest of human rights violations." He wondered: "What benefit will southerners gain from that?"
