He announced yesterday afternoon (0400 Asian time) the U.S. decision to extend China's Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status for another year, going against the statement he made the same time last year that he might completely rescind China's MFN trading status next year. In fact, Clinton almost made up his mind to "turn around" last fall. He made the first step toward this end by going to Seattle to preside over the Asian summit and by meeting with PRC Chairman Jiang Zemin for the first time since assuming office. By that time, the United States had developed a new outlook on the international situation. After the dramatic changes in eastern Europe, the relations between the United States and Western Europe were not as close as they had been immediately following World War II. This was most clearly seen in the fact that several U.S. proposals for settling conflicts in former Yugoslavia were rejected by western countries. After the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, the United States sought to improve its relations with Russia. However, Yeltsin's position in Russia has been shaky, and he was not even able to appoint his trusted follower Gaidar as prime minister. Therefore, the importance of Russia for U.S. politics is questionable in the future. Apart from political problems, there are economic problems. It is clear that Asia will grow further economically. President Clinton, who did not attach importance to Asia in the first part of his presidency, changed his outlook in the second half of the year. He felt it necessary to increase U.S. influence in Asia by establishing friendly ties with Asian countries anew so that the U.S. economy could draw new life from developing countries in this region, while China registered the greatest economic growth among Asian countries. Over the last six months, the United States has adopted a carrot-and-stick policy toward China. While sending Secretaries of the Treasury, Commerce, and Agriculture to China to improve bilateral relations, Clinton sent Secretary of State Warren Christopher to China to apply pressure. Christopher tried to accomplish his task by bringing China to her knees. The United States has actually been following the beaten path. In order to return to Asia, it has applied heavy pressure on Asian countries over the last six months. It has applied pressure on Malaysia and Indonesia over the trade union problem and on Singapore over the caning punishment inflicted on an American youth. It has also threatened to impose trade sanctions upon Japan under the Special 301 provision in connection with Japan's market barriers to U.S. goods and has threatened to use force against North Korea on the nuclear issue. However, these countries all rejected the U.S. demands. China's approach has been open and above-board. While expressing its willingness to improve relations with the United States and sending trade groups to the United States to place orders, China has opposed the high U.S. pressure. In the end, Clinton was forced to "turn around" on his own, correcting the mistake he made a year ago. To soothe different political factions at home, he played tricks in the wording of the decision and the measures concerned to cover up his embarrassment. He announced that he would extend China's MFN trading status for another year, rather than extending the status indefinitely, as favored by the majority of American people. While indicating that he will not link human rights with MFN trading status in the future, he insisted on imposing certain sanctions. But he will only impose sanctions on weapons valued at $200 million, while the Sino-U.S. trade volume will amount to $40 billion in the future. The problem concerning trade between China and the United States, about which the two sides have been haggling for a long time, has finally been solved because the United States has withdrawn from its original position, though not without "embarrassment."
