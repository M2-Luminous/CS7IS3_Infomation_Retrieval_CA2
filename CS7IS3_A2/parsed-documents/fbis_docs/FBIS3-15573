He chases them away unless they pay in hard cash -- one minute with him costs a newspaper $100, and a television station -- $1,000. However, the politician who is now in the limelight made an exception for 169 CHASA so as to show that he loves the Bulgarians, even though they have had no luck with their president. [Veselinova] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, has the episode with Zhelev cooled your warm feelings toward the Bulgarians? [Zhirinovskiy] What can you do? This is what the political struggle is like. Someone has whispered wrong things about me into your president's ear, and he immediately took such measures against me -- that is not nice! To expel the leader of the party that won the elections in friendly Russia! At one time in the past they expelled Georgi Dimitrov from Germany for alleged subversive activities, but to expel me from Bulgaria, which I love so much and which I was visiting as a private person.... This is how spies and smugglers are dealt with. I cannot comprehend how freedom of speech is being suppressed in a democratic country. They expel someone because he had allegedly said something that the president did not like. This is stupid. They say Prosecutor Nestor Nestorov wanted to take me to court because of my words. This again is something monstrous. Is it possible that Zhelev will expel everyone who has said something against him? Thousands of Bulgarians are dissatisfied with his rule! Will he banish all of them? Then he will be left in Sofia on his own, together with three police departments that will constantly repeat that he is a marvelous president. At home in Russia, people shout "Down with Yeltsin!" every day, yet he does not expel anyone, neither Russians nor foreigners. I appealed through our embassy in Bulgaria against the ultimatum ordering me out of Bulgaria within 24 hours that your Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov signed, but I have not yet been told how far the matter has gone. Everyone whom I told how the Bulgarian president treated me has reacted with disapproval. Not only I, but Todor Zhivkov and the Moscow Communists also said that Bulgaria will be a Transdanubian province and a 16th republic [of the Russian Federation]. Bulgaria and Russia should help each other and they should live together in harmony. [Veselinova] Why is your voice so hoarse? [Zhirinovskiy] You journalists are to blame, you have shattered me with your interviews. Instead of gratitude for this, you scare the world by saying I am a fascist. How can I be a fascist when they murdered my uncle?! (He puts on the dress uniform jacket of a captain that he wore on Soviet Army Day.) See, now I am in the uniform of an officer of the Soviet Army that fought against fascism. (He chases away some BBC journalists.) Why should I talk to you? You do not pay anything. I will allow some time for German journalists, because they paid me $30,000 in cash. (Yeltsin rings him on the telephone.) Russia has always been hedged round with enemies. (Vladimir Zhirinovskiy roams over a map of the world using a pen light. This is a miniature version of the terrible "Elipton" weapon with which the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party is frightening the world. The ballpoint-pen-like instrument has three buttons. If you press the first button, the laser beam acts as a pointer. If you point the second, the other person will collapse unconscious on the floor within three seconds. If you press the third button, you can remove your target from the land of the living.) Our enemies are everywhere, all around us there are enemies, enemies.... We have been at war for 90 years. Our nation's self-confidence is due to our strong army. We have states around us that lay claim to parts of our territory. Finland wants Karelia, the Germans want Kaliningrad, the Poles dream about Lviv, the Romanians want Chisinau, China -- our Far East, Japan -- the Kuril Islands.... As for our friends the Arabs -- Iraq, Syria, the Turks are the most impudent -- they insist on taking the whole of the Caucasus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and all the land as far as the Altay. You see what impudence this is? Look where Kazakhstan is. What is the result? It is that I was born abroad. Perestroyka ruined everything. [Veselinova] According to Nostradamus, world war III is supposed to start any moment. [Zhirinovskiy] There will be no war, never fear. However, the West must take heed of our desires, and we will allow them to keep their existing borders. We have no intention of moving toward the West. The south is what concerns us; here is where the war is. We are only interested in Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan. The Germans should not oppose us, because they too are troubled by the Turks. If a different situation is created in the south regarding Turkey, this will be to Germany's benefit as well. We are ready to improve our relations with the Germans. Why not restore the Berlin-Warsaw-Minsk-Moscow axis? The Poles already have specific proposals in this context. Then, later on, we can extend this axis to the Far East. The Japanese would approve of this idea, they would even invest money in it. How do they transport their goods now? They make a circuit of the globe. (He draws a circle on the map with his pen light.) It will be more beneficial for them if there is a route to the Far East across our territory, and Russia will receive money from the route passing through its territory. [Veselinova] Are you afraid that NATO will stand behind Turkey? [Zhirinovskiy] You are mistaken if you believe that the Turks are invulnerable because they are members of NATO. NATO is a weak bloc. The states that are members of NATO have never fought a war, except for Germany, and it does not want to fight. Who will fight if they have to? The Danes? The Norwegians? The French? The Italians? We, on the other hand, have fought the Turks 30 times and beaten them every time. We have no worthy opponents anywhere in the world. NATO is an insignificant bloc, and it should be eliminated. The same goes for the United Nations. However, Russia is a peaceful country. We will not attack, but we will defend ourselves if necessary. We prefer to win by economic means instead of military ones. Anyone who imagines that Russia is economically weak is making a serious mistake. Russia has always been strong. Now it is simply sick -- states fall sick just like people. However, Russia got over its illness on 12 December 1993. Now we intend to pull ourselves upwards by our bootstraps. In two or three years everything will be OK with us, whereas in Germany, for example, the situation will worsen. The rabble that has flooded in -- Turks, Arabs, Gypsies, Romanians, the whole mafia of Eastern Europe -- will all settle there. If the Germans ask for help when things get really bad for them, then we will come running. The wars will continue in the world without us. We will sit and wait; we will not meddle in the conflicts. Russia issues no orders to anyone. We merely state our position. However, we do not permit anyone to interfere in our own affairs, as we do not interfere in the affairs of Spain, let us say. They have their Basques and Catalans -- let the Spaniards themselves decide what to do with them. Nor do we stick our noses in Britain's troubles, despite the fact that Ireland has been drowning in blood for 25 years now. Why, then, should they interfere in the Slavs' problems? [Veselinova] How did you scare NATO into not dropping bombs on Sarajevo? [Zhirinovskiy] It is true that the people in NATO were very frightened. Russia's intervention happened mainly because of the influence of our faction in parliament. When I was in Bulgaria and Serbia, I told the journalists that if the NATO pilots dare to bomb Serbian towns, this will mean a declaration of war on Russia. If French pilots drop bombs, this will mean war between France and Russia, and if German pilots do so, it will mean war between Germany and Russia. My words had a sobering effect on NATO. You saw that no war started. This means I am right that NATO should dissolve itself. The United Nations has also become outdated. We must form a new organization -- a League of European States. Why do we Europeans need an international organization like the United Nations? It is a collection of states from the age of the ox cart. Africa, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia -- why should I be interested in their problems? They are at the other end of the earth. The League should be formed between Western and Eastern Europe. Let us solve our own problems and leave them to solve theirs! The Bosnian conflict is an example of the effectiveness of the old principle of divide and rule. In three years, Yugoslavia has been brought to its knees. The foreign businessmen -- the Italians, French, and Germans -- have an interest in ruining Yugoslavia's economy, just as they have in ruining Bulgaria's. Then their goods will be bought up, because no others will be available, and the enterprises of Serbia and Bulgaria will go bankrupt. This is a war of the markets. [Veselinova] Why is the world supporting the Muslims in this conflict? [Zhirinovskiy] This is the nub of the problem, that the Muslim card is being played again. They allege that the Orthodox Serbs are terrorizing the Catholics and the Muslims. The Serbs are the most numerous. If they are destroyed or scattered over the Balkans, there will be no one left to resist. For five centuries the Ottoman Empire oppressed the Balkan Slavs. Now the Turks are not only living on Bulgarian territory, engaging in trade, and owning Turkish enterprises, but on top of everything they are even creeping into parliament. It is to the West's benefit to let the Slavs and Turks squabble among themselves. It is high time the Slavs ceased being the object of attacks. To save the Bulgarians from the Turks, they should form an alliance with Russia. We are ready to send a division to the Bulgarian-Turkish border. Bulgaria should not sell its land to the Turks. It is better for Russian enterprises to purchase this land, in return for settlement of debts. Southern Bulgaria is a vacation zone. The miners of the Donbass will like it. [Veselinova] Demirel is not very fond of you. [Zhirinovskiy] I do not burn with love for him either, but what is to be done? It is impossible for all the leaders of parties and states to feel sympathy for one another. [Veselinova] Why did the Austrian prostitute publish such disgusting lies about you? [Zhirinovskiy] I saw the article, it was published in a German journal. Now I will sue this woman. I demand damages of $100,000. The whole thing is a pack of lies. The lawsuit is in progress in Germany. The aim was to undermine my reputation, to blacken my name. Look, I spent two days in Sveti Vrach, and the Bulgarian newspapers printed nothing compromising about me. The Bulgarians are my friends. We only spent one evening in Vienna. However, their intelligence service is powerful and still operates. They certainly forced this girl to give an interview, even though I have never set eyes on her. There is nothing strange in the fact that they bribed her. In Bulgaria the intelligence service has been abolished -- there is no one to organize provocations against me, although no one in your country is trying to throw any dirt at me. I found out that some party gave 20 German marks each to the Turks who catcalled me at the Memorial to the Tsar Liberator. However, we are well practiced in using camcords and cameras, and now we have photographs of all the participants in this paid demonstration. [Veselinova] How is your party financed? [Zhirinovskiy] The electors finance it. If each of our voters donates 1,000 rubles -- the price of two packs of cigarettes -- we will receive 12 billion. Our party has already bought many buildings in Moscow. These will house the offices and clubs of the Liberal Democratic Party. [Veselinova] You are more interesting to the world than any Hollywood star. Are you paid for your performance? [Zhirinovskiy] I have introduced a tariff so that people leave me in peace -- I am already extremely tired. If anyone cannot pay to talk to me, let him go on his way! A minute's conversation with me costs a newspaper $100, while a television station has to pay $1,000. [Veselinova] How does your wife react to the fact that you are always busy? [Zhirinovskiy] Badly. I very seldom show up at home. She is naturally unhappy about it. We quarrel. I see my son once a week. [Veselinova] Is Yeltsin afraid of you? [Zhirinovskiy] I do not insist that he should vacate the president's office immediately. There is still time before the elections. Yeltsin loves to give orders. Maybe he sometimes makes mistakes -- that is only human. However, he is what he is. Gorbachev, on the other hand, promised to improve life, and look at what a mess he made of the country. He ruined everything and then ran away, the coward. He is now counting the dollars that he has been given for a job well done. [Veselinova] Why did you not meet Clinton when he was in Moscow? [Zhirinovskiy] He asked for a meeting, but I refused, because the invitation was addressed to the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. It should have been addressed to me personally -- to Liberal Democratic Party Chairman Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. If I were to send him an invitation, I would address it "to U.S. President Bill Clinton," not to the party that nominated him. However, the chance of Clinton and me meeting has not been lost. My adviser will soon fly to the United States and arrange this in March or April. We will play golf and go to a ranch. We will have a rest and get to know each other better. After the United States I will probably visit Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. [Veselinova] What is this "Elipton" weapon? [Zhirinovskiy] It is my personal weapon. I completely destroys buildings and people, not by fire, but with a laser beam that destroys all targets. [Veselinova] Can you destroy the world with this weapon? [Zhirinovskiy] Of course I can, but I do not want to. It is important that we possess such a weapon. If any danger threatens us, in the case of extreme necessity there is nothing strange about us using it in certain regions -- for defense.
