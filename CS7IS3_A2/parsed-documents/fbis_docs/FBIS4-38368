The Russian minister told the ITAR-TASS correspondents today that the sides exchanged views on the prospects for an end to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and analyzed the work of the Contact Group working on a Bosnian settlement, which has been meeting representatives of the warring sides in the French town of Talloires over the past few days. "The work of the Contact Group is coming up against great difficulties, but everything is turning out reasonably well: Gratifyingly, we managed to get the Serb side to take part in the group's session," the minister pointed out. "Our western colleagues have also fulfilled the promises they made in Geneva in mid-May, and have got the Bosnian Muslims and Croats to the negotiating table." Andrey Kozyrev said he had information that the Muslim and Croat sides are virtually ready to accept the plan proposed for the territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This plan allots 51 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina to a Croat-Muslim federation, and 49 percent to the Bosnian Serbs.
