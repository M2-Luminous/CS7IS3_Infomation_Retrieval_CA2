This June 28 will be the 40th anniversary of the introduction of the five principles -- mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty; non-aggression; non-interference in each other's internal affairs; equal and mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence. With the end of the Second World War, movements of national independence and liberation flourished in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Newly independent nations demanded the establishment of new patterns of international relations based on equality to maintain their national sovereignty and develop their economies. The five principles of peaceful co-existence were produced precisely in response to this strong and common demand of newly independent nations. After their rebirths, China and India, two giants in Asia, established diplomatic relations on April 1, 1950. On April 29, 1954, the two countries signed an agreement on trade and communications between the Chinese region of Tibet and India, introducing for the first time the five principles of peaceful co-existence into the preface of the agreement. In June 1954, former Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai visited india and Burma at the invitation of the two countries and held talks with his then Indian and Burmese counterparts, Jawaharlal Nehru and U Nu. Consequently, in the "joint declaration of Chinese and Indian premiers" issued on June 28 and the "joint declaration of Chinese and Burmese premiers" issued on the following day, the five principles of peaceful co-existence were officially announced as the basic norms guiding the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese relations. The Sino-Indian Joint Declaration proposed that "these principles not only be applicable to relations between nations, but also to the general international relationship," while the Sino-Burmese Joint Declaration expressed the hope that "these principles will be observed by all nations." In April 1955 -- one year after China, India and Burma initiated the five principles of peaceful co-existence, a total of 29 newly independent nations from Asia and Africa held the historic "Asian- African conference" in Bandung, Indonesia. As a result of the common efforts of the participants, the conference adopted the "declaration on promotion of world peace and cooperation" and formulated the 10 principles of Bandung Conference. These 10 principles, which contained all points in the five principles of peaceful co-existence, represented an extension and development of the latter. Since then, the five principles of peaceful co-existence have been recognized and accepted by more and more nations, international organizations and international meetings; and have been incorporated into a series of major international documents, including declarations adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. The five principles were also reaffirmed in the documents on China's establishment of diplomatic relations with more than 100 nations, including Western countries like the United States, and in treaties as well as communiques China has signed with other countries. The world today is characterized by diversities. There are about 1,000 ethnic nationalities and more than 200 countries, including more than 180 independent, sovereign nations. They differ not only in social system and development level, but also in ideology, cultural heritage, national character and religious belief. The past decades have proved that whenever a few countries in disregard of the said differences, tried stubbornly to impose their concepts of value on "democracy" and "human rights" as well as their social systems on other countries, there would invariably be unrest and chaos, making such practice utterly futile. Similarly, contradictions would be exacerbated and international tensions heightened if the modes of "big family," "bloc politics," "sphere of influence" and "world leadership" were applied in handling international relations. With the end of the Cold War, there is no more bloc confrontation characterized by the contention for hegemony between the two superpowers. However, manifestations of power politics still exist in international relations, marked by the big suppressing the small, the strong bullying the weak, interference in others' internal affairs under various excuses, and frequent threats to apply sanctions and even to use force. Therefore, it is still a matter of paramount and realistic significance to firmly uphold and apply the five principles of peaceful co-existence in international relations. These five principles have generalized the most basic norms that govern international relations transcending the limits of social system and ideology. Only when international relations are completely based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence; the differences between nations are duly recognized and respected; all nations, big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are recognized as equals in the international community with the right to choose their own ideology, social system and the mode of development suitable for them; and mutual exchange, seeking of common grounds and keeping of differences as well as mutual complementation are encouraged, can the nations co-exist peacefully and enjoy genuine international peace, stability and development. In order to promote peace and development, a peaceful, stable, just and equitable new international political and economic order should be established on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence and on the premise of recognizing the diversity of the world and differences between nations. Under such a new order, mutual respect, equality and cooperation between nations will take the place of hegemonism and power politics; negotiations and dialogues will replace the use and the threat of the use of force; and mutual benefit and mutual supplementation will substitute for trade protectionism and unequal exchanges. To realize the goals of the five principles of peaceful co-existence, the international community needs to cooperate extensively and make long-term and unremitting efforts.
