The government "aims to avoid economic recovery without more employment," explained Premier Silvio Berlusconi as ministers emerged to present the measures approved today. "For the first time in at least a decade," he told journalists, "we have set ourselves goals which can be reached without adding to the state deficit; for the first time fiscal policy is not aimed at hiking revenue but at development; for the first time measures are tailored for all sectors of the economy, and not only for large-scale industry and for employees, but also for small and medium industry and self-employed workers." The premier outlined a three-stage attack, with economyic and employment-boosting initiatives in the first 100 days of the new administration to exploit recovery which is already on its way, then the 1995 finance bill, followed by a sweeping reorganisation of Italy's byzantine tax system. Berlusconi promised no new taxes or higher tax brackets in the finance bill, and said that the third stage would include major steps toward "fiscal federalism," or decentralisation of the tax system. He also pledged a shift from direct to indirect taxes, "gradually shifting the onus of levies onto luxury and non-essential goods and services." Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti was given the job of providing a point-by-point explanation of the measures in the six-paragraph law decree approved by the cabinet today. A law decree goes into effect immediately, but must receive approval from both houses of parliament within 90 days, after which it becomes null and void, or has to be reapproved by the cabinet and presented to parliament once again. According to a note from the Finance Ministry, the measures approved today will generate 450,000 new jobs by the end of 1996. Presenting what he described as a decree with "a human face," Tremonti explained that young people under 32 years of age, unemployed people, the handicapped and those laid off from their jobs under government-sponsored schemes will be given tax incentives for setting up their own companies: in the first year of activity all forms of taxes and levies would be waived and replaced by a two million lire (1,250 dollar) all-inclusive payment, rising to three million lire for the second year and four million lire for the third. Private companies, those in the catering field and self-employed professionals for the next three years will be allowed tax "credits" equal to 25 percent of the income paid to employees hired over and above the number employed at the time when the decree goes into force. Companies reinvesting more than the average ploughed back for development over the past five years will enjoy tax breaks of 50 percent of this extra sum in 1994 and 1995. Stock market investors can now opt for a one-off all-inclusive tax on dividends of 12.5 percent, or else continue to add dividend earnings to other revenue which must be declared in yearly tax returns. Under the current system, all dividends have ten percent withdrawn at source, and are then declared on tax forms where the source payment can be deducted from the total amount of taxes owed. In what Tremonti said was an effort to encourage greater transparency amongst companies, smaller firms are being prompted to seek stock market quotation in a measure offering a 16 point reduction of company taxes for the next three years. The law decree approved today, Tremonti added, also does away with a number of levies described as "useless" by Premier Berlusconi. These include such taxes as the one on each refrigeration unit owned by catering sector companies, which bring a negligible amount into state coffers and provide bureaucratic nightmares for those who have to pay them. Tremonti told journalists that the new law decree also marked a breakthrough in the way legislation is drawn up, with great care being taken to make the measures comprehensible to the uninitiated. The decree states explicitly that any contradictory norms on the law books are superseded. Ministers were at pains to stress that the new measures would have no negative effects on revenue and the public sector borrowing requirement. Discussed but not approved in today's cabinet meeting, which ended slightly after 2100 (1900 GMT) this evening, was a decree introducing changes to enhance flexibility in Italy's labour market. The decree will be "approved in the next few days," said Tremonti. The cabinet is scheduled to meet next Tuesday [14 June]. This legislation will include measures to increase part-time work, encourage professional training, and introduce lower-paid contracts for employees taken on for training purposes. Approval of these initiatives, said Premier Berlusconi, has been suspended until after a meeting requested by unions. Mooted initiatives to boost car sales, including a suspension of road tax for owners of new vehicles, which have received much coverage in the press recently, did not even come up for discussion in today's meeting, one cabinet member said.
