"The United Nations has sought the request for additional troops. The United States was among the group of countries approached by the United Nations," State Department Spokeswoman Christine Shelly said. The United States has all the way insisted that it will not send ground troops to Bosnia unless the three warring sides reach a peace settlement in good faith. Shelly refused to give more details on the request, but said "The U.S. position on troops remains unchanged." A senior State Department official was quoted as saying that the administration was looking at the request at the "highest levels." The United Nations protection force in Bosnia is asking for 2,500 to 3,000 more troops to demilitarize Sarajevo to consolidate a ceasefire. France, Britain and The Netherlands have all refused to dispatch more troops. Russia has also dismissed a request for its paratroops to be transferred from Croatia to Bosnia. France, Britain and The Netherlands are the major contributors of troops to Bosnia under the U.N., with 6,000, 2,500, and 2,400 troops respectively.
