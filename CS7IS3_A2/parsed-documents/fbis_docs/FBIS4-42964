A majority 54 percent of the population believe that Nordic cooperation will be strengthened with the entry of the three Nordic neighbors into the EU. Only 15 percent think that cooperation will be weakened inside the EU, while 25 percent -- or one in four -- expect no change. In view of the many initiatives over the past four decades in Nordic cooperation -- including the Nordic Council -- it is quite interesting that a majority of Danes think that the EU can become a catalyst further promoting Nordic cooperation. As many as 62 percent of yes voters in the 18 May [1993 referendum] think that cooperation will be strengthened, while only 8 percent see it becoming weaker. Among the no voters there are somewhat fewer, specifically 43 percent -- who see a strengthening of Nordic cooperation, while more, namely 28 percent, think it will be weakened. Accordingly, among both yes and no voters there are more who believe in a strengthening than in a weakening. This positive attitude toward a peculiar "Nordic dimension" is also seen in that a large majority think it good that the Nordic countries become members in the EU. Sixty-eight percent are happy with a Swedish membership, 69 percent with a Norwegian membership, and 63 percent with a Finnish membership. At the same time, few -- namely around 12-13 percent -- think these countries' membership in the EU is a bad prospect. The fourth applicant country, Austria, is welcomed by 62 percent. Regarding Iceland, a Nordic nonapplicant, two out of three Danes (66 percent) say they would welcome that country if it wanted to apply for EU membership. If Danes are asked what they think the results will be in the EU-entry referendums, it appears that a majority does not think Norway will follow the other three applicants into the EU. Fifty-five percent of Danes believe that the Norwegian referendum will end with a no, while 34 percent -- or one in three -- believe in a Norwegian yes. On the other hand, most Danes think that referendums in the three other applicant countries will end in a yes vote for membership in the EU. The Gallup survey was conducted 19-25 May 1994. A representative sample of 1,004 Danes over age 18 were interviewed by phone.
