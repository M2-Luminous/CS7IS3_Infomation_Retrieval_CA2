He also described the operation of the new financial and taxation system in the same period as "basically normal." In the first three months of this year, Wang Xingyi said, the nation witnessed revenue fulfill 18.7 percent of the budget, up 21.4 percent from the same period last year; and expenditure fulfill 14.9 percent of the budget, an increase of 23.8 percent over the corresponding period last year. Although expenditure growth outstripped revenue, the growth rate was still normal. After balancing the nation's revenue and expenditures, it showed that revenue exceeded expenditure by 7.765 billion yuan, which was better than the same period last year. He said the operation of the new financial and taxation system was also normal. Most regions in the nation have implemented and put into operation the tax-sharing sysem, which is the framework for the financial system, down to the prefectural and county levels. The operation of the new financial and taxation system in the last three months has ensured growth in revenue; it did not cause big commodity price fluctuations; and it did not adversely affect commodity production and distribution. Although the overall situation in the execution of the state budget and the operation of the new financial and taxation system far has so far been good, he said some contradictions and budding signs of future problems were exposed in the course of executing the state budget. Among them are: low production output and poor efficiency at industrial enterprises under the budget; financial difficulties at county-level governments; and administrative units in some regions fail to pay employees' wages on time. Wang Xingyu called on all levels of financial departments to pay close attention to executing the state budget, to the operation of the new financial and taxation system, and to doing a solid job in all spheres of work. First, it is necessary to continuously attach importance to improving the performance of state-owned enterprises, to promptly study and work out ways to solve problems which emerge during production and operation, and to raise enterprises' economic efficiency. Second, we should strive to maintain the good momentum in the sale of treasury bonds and help ensure the successful fulfilment of the task of selling treasury bonds. Third, there is a need to impose strict control on the growth of expenditures, to refrain from spending money unless it is absolute necessary, to postone starting up projects if it is possible, and to exercise strict control over supplementary expenditures. Fourth, proper measures should be worked out to help counties solve financial difficulties.
