Today, a day of work, the deputies finished forming the parliamentary committees. [passage omitted] They also discussed resuming televising of the Parliamentary Hour program. Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the Committee on Information Policy and Communications, stated that the campaign against the State Duma in the mass media is an echo of the war which was waged between the fourth estate and the former Russian Federation parliament. In order to break this tendency, a number of measures must be carried out, the chairman said. In particular, a State Duma press center must be set up through which objective information could be fed to newspapers, radio, and television. As for the Parliamentary Hour television broadcast, the committee thinks it would be pointless to have this in the form in which it emerged under the former Supreme Soviet. Many deputies disputed this stance, however, and as a result they made no decision on the matter. [passage omitted]
