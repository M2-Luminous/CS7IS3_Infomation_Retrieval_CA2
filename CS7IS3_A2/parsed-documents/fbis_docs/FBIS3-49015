Via a satellite telephone link to his official residence in the Bosnian capital, we asked him first of all how the people of Sarajevo experienced the New Year. [Silajdzic] Here in Sarajevo it was the same as it has been over the last year. Five people died and 35 were injured on New Year's Eve. [passage indistinct] First, we have to come to a negotiated settlement, something that is unlikely because of the Serb position. The second possibility is that the international community should finally do its duty and intervene to end the aggression and the genocide directed against Bosnia- Herzegovina. The third possibility also involves the intervention of the international community, but for the victim, whose state and people are a member of the United Nations. In imposing an embargo against us, the international community has intervened for the first time in favor of the aggressor. Our hands are now tied and we have been suffering this aggression for two years now. There is no doubt that genocide is being committed in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the international community will not let us defend ourselves. We have taken part in negotiations, we have tried our best. Because the international community is not prepared to use force, the Serb negotiators are practically ignoring it. [Correspondent] Mr. Silajdzic, you are demanding that the international community intervene. What should be the aim of foreign intervention -- merely a military victory over the Serbs, or the complete reestablishment of the former territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the control of the Bosnian Government? [Silajdzic] The aim is clearly defined in the UN Charter as well as in the resolutions of the UN Security Council, the CSCE, the World Human Rights Conference, etc. The aim would be to end the genocide and to restore order in this region on the basis of the UN Charter of international law. This is to stop the aggression directed against Bosnia-Herzegovina if the aggressor does not want to conclude a real peace. Unfortunately, we cannot make peace -- we have not made war. Neither do we have the means to (?conclude) peace. One thing is important -- lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is argued, would only add fuel to the fire in Bosnia. But we all know that our postwar peace rested on a balance of power and that principle worked for 50 years. Precisely this principle, alongside many others, has been abandoned in Bosnia-Herzegovina. You have said that we will not give you weapons, but we cannot help you either. The outcome is very clear and it is that the Serb aggressors have conquered Bosnian territory and are naturally refusing to withdraw because no force is used against them. They are dealing with a defenseless population with very few arms. This imbalance is leading to yet more war. If there is a balance of forces there is no war. That is the problem we have. We hope the time has come to take action, either by restoring this balance so that we can make peace ourselves through the balance of forces, or by the international community either putting pressure on the Serbs or intervening itself. [Correspondent] Does this mean that you will not return to the Geneva negotiating table to discuss the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which foresees the division of your country into three parts, a Muslim, a Croatian and a Serb part? [Silajdzic] I think it was very explicit from the statement that I gave you that we are looking for a negotiated solution. We have taken part in all negotiating processes and are still prepared to do so. But our people are dying every day while we travel from one meeting to the next. Civilians are dying every day in our towns, in Sarajevo, in Mostar, in Tuzla, in Zenica, and in other towns. It is like a medieval siege of Bosnia-Herzegovina, an aggression and, without any doubt, genocide. The international community therefore has an obligation, and if negotiations fail, then other measures have to be taken. Otherwise, the Bosnians must assume that they have been condemned to death by the international community. Many people in Bosnia already believe that by its attitude, by its wish not to get involved, the international community has intervened on the part of the aggressor, has facilitated the position of the aggressor by disarming us and has thus condemned us to death.
