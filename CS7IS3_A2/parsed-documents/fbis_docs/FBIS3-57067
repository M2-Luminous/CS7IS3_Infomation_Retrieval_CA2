Their Arrest Has Provided Cause To Revise the `Tragic January' in Vilnius"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The most independent of Lithuania's independent newspapers, RESPUBLIKA, in one of its recent issues cited K. Gashki, a member of the Seimas National Security Committee, as saying that such an action [the Belarusian authorities' arrest of Lithuanian Communists in Minsk] may threaten Lithuania with an undesirable political scandal for two reasons: First, Lithuanian armed officials have crossed the Lithuanian- Belarusian border; and second, the capacity in which Lithuanian General Prosecutor Arturas Paulauskas visited Minsk to hold talks about the possibility of arresting Mikolas Burokyavicius and Yuozas Yermolavicius. According to Gashki and another member of the Seimas National Security Committee, A. Ivashkyavicius (who, it will be noted, has no sympathy for either communism or communists), the operation to detain these persons, who have long been on the wanted list of Lithuanian law enforcement bodies, could have been carried out only by Belarus officials, whereupon they were handed over to the Lithuanian side on the border of the two states. Incidentally, the above mentioned members of the Lithuanian Seimas National Security Committee suggest that the arrest of Burokyavicius and Yermolavicius became possible only because they were "sold out." "We would never have gotten Mikolas Burokyavicius or Yuozas Yermolavicius if it was not beneficial to Moscow," K. Gashki told RESPUBLIKA's correspondent. "They were transferred to Lithuania so that in the course of a judicial process in Vilnius some tasks confronting a `third party' could be resolved; in other words, Moscow is imposing its own rules of the game on Lithuania." According to the National Security Committee members, it would be a mistake to think that Burokyavichus and Yermolavichus were the organizers and perpetrators of the coup attempted in January 1991. The Lithuanian communist leaders could not have played a role greater than stage director assistants because "they had no way of calling in a paratroopers division from Pskov or summoning V. Sakalauskas, former chairman of the Lithuanian Council of Ministers, who at the time was a staff member at the Soviet Embassy in Mozambique and was allegedly tasked with composing a new Lithuanian government. Also, it certainly took more than the desire or will of the Lithuanian communists to get Soviet armored cars into the streets of Vilnius. [passage omitted] Time will tell whether the ongoing trial of the communist leaders in Vilnius will be used to strip some veils of secrecy from the January and subsequent events. On one hand, it would be very attractive for Lithuania to reveal the role of a third state. But on the other, there is the danger of also exposing some internal mechanisms and levers about which the Lithuanian social democratic weekly LETUVOS ZHINES wrote recently. According to the paper, the leaders of Sajudis, which was in power in 1990-1991, came to the conclusion that Moscow could be forced to abandon its plans of preserving Lithuania as part of the USSR precisely by aggravating the situation because it feared bloodshed. Sajudis members, the paper writes, deliberately insulted and provoked the army, and calls for armed resistance were coming from all quarters. In chess, a victory appears the more brilliant the more pawns and other pieces have been sacrificed. On the evening of 12 January 1991 the radio and TV were urging the people to congregate around the TV tower in Vilnius, assuring them that Soviet soldiers would be using only blanks. As a result, 13 people were killed and hundreds wounded or injured. According to LETUVOS ZHINES, it was the persistent sadistic propaganda about armed defense that gave the attackers cause for using firearms against peaceful, unarmed civilians. Gunmen from the Alfa group, the paper writes, accepted the offered chess sacrifice: It was the final response from the USSR leadership -- a personal punishment for Vytautas Landsbergis.
