Upon leaving the Gloria Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, President Itamar Franco said national congressmen demonstrated maturity by approving Provisional Measure No. 482, which creates the URV, on 18 May. According to the president, it was an important step forward for the Brazilian economy's stabilization. Itamar Franco said this economic plan has not been imposed from top to bottom but was debated by the whole society, especially with the national Congress, which suggested almost 50 amendments. This is why the provisional measure will yield what we all want: curbing inflation. [Begin Franco recording] It would be very easy for my administration, or the end of my administration, to abandon our efforts to curb inflation. It would be very easy to let the next president carry out this work. We still want to combat inflation during this administration. Congress' approval, last night, was very important and very significant. [end recording] The president did not want to comment on Congress' dismissal of Deputy Ibsen Pinheiro during the same Congress session that approved Provisional Measure No. 482. According to the president, this subject pertains only to Congress.
