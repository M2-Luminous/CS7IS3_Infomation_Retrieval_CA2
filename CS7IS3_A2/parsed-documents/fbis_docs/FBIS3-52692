A Qol Yisra'el reporter says advances were made in the areas of agriculture and taxation; however, the Palestinians presented new requests in the area of banking. The Palestinians continue to demand their own currency and a central bank, and are opposed to Israeli representation at customs at border crossing points. The two sides say the talks are due to resume in 10 days.
