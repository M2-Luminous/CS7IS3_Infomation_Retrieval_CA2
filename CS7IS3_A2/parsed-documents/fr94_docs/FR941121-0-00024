FR941121-0-00024 FR941121-0-00001 In witness whereof, this is my signature and the date on which I signed this Resolution. Signature Date [Attach list of accounts with prospective dividend rates for each type of account.] 5. Referencing. Except where specifically stated otherwise, use of the term ``share'' in part 707, as in ``share account,'' also refers to ``deposit,'' as in ``deposit account,'' where appropriate (for interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing deposit accounts at some state-chartered credit unions). (j) Dividend Declaration Date 1. General. The importance of the dividend declaration date is to tie the last paid dividend to a certain period of time to place members and potential members on notice that the last paid dividend is different from the next dividend to be paid. In order to achieve this purpose, a credit union may use any of the following methods: i. ``As of 3/15/95'' (the date the board of directors last met and declared the last paid dividend). ii. ``As of 3/31/95'' (the last day of the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid). iii. ``For the period 1/1/95 to 3/31/95'' (the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid). iv. ``For the first quarter of 1995'' (the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid). v. ``For April 1995'' (the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid). (k) Dividend Period 1. General. The dividend period is to be set by a credit union's board of directors for each account type, e.g., regular share, share draft, money market share, and term share. The most common dividend periods are weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. Dividend periods need not agree with calendar months, e.g., a monthly dividend period could begin March 15 and end April 14. (l) Dividend Rate 1. General. The dividend rate does not reflect compounding. Compounding is reflected in the ``annual percentage yield'' definition. 2. Referencing. Except where specifically stated otherwise, use of the term ``dividend rate'' in part 707 also refers to ``interest rate,'' where appropriate (for interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposit accounts at some state-chartered credit unions). (m) Extraordinary Dividends 1. General. The definition encompasses all irregularly scheduled and declared dividends, and as dividends, extraordinary dividends are exempt from the ``bonus'' disclosure requirements. Extraordinary dividends do not have to be disclosed on account disclosures, but the dollar amount of an extraordinary dividend credited to the account during the statement period does have to be separately disclosed on the periodic statement for the dividend period during which the extraordinary dividends are earned. Extraordinary dividends, like ordinary dividends, do not include the payment of a bonus or other consideration worth $10 or less given during a year, the waiver or reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses or non-dividend membership benefits. See comments 2(f) 1 through 7 and 2(i) 1 through 4. Extraordinary dividends may be calculated by any means determined by the board of directors of a credit union and may not be used in the annual percentage yield earned calculation. 2. Use of synonym. Extraordinary dividends may be described as ``bonus dividends.'' (n) Fixed-Rate Account
