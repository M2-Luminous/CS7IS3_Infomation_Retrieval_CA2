Such a chance will appear thanks to several measures taken by the Russian Government to step up investment activities, Russian Deputy Economics Minister Andrey Shapovalyants said here on Thursday. The deputy minister spoke at the international conference on oil and gas in Moscow, which was organised in connection with the international Neftegaz-94 exhibition. As a result of these measures, the government plans to retain the volume of investments in 1994 at least at the level of last year. However, the share of federal investments will drop by 15-20 per cent. Shapovalyants called the emerging transition from state to project financing of all investment programmes a key measure capable of stepping up sharply investment processes. According to the deputy minister, this means the state's departure from monopoly participation in these programmes and transition to share investments. The practice of funds' distribution which took place in the past, will be replaced with enlistment of various resources, apart from state funds, from local budgets as well as participation of private and foreign investments. Priority will be given to projects whose share of non-federal funds will total at least 50 per cent. In the deputy minister's opinion, the decision to re-assess fixed industrial assets and their regular indexation will also help to boost the volume of investments. Apart from this, tax privileges will be given to any form of investments, including acquisition of securities and creation of authorised capital. The purpose-oriented enlistment of credits for investment will be also stimulated with tax privileges. In 1994, Shapovalyants continued, the government will preserve easy-term investment crediting for projects launched in 1992. The government is now reviewing the procedure of forming extra-budgetary funds. In future, they will be converted into insurance funds to protect investments from all types of risks. It is planned to establish such a fund at first in the gas industry and then to start their creation in other fuel and energy industries.
