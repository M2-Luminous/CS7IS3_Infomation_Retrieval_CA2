This was conveyed by the Indian Prime Minister to US Senators, according to a report to the Senate by Republican Senators Tad Cochran, Larry Pressler and Hank Brown, who visited India recently and met Mr. Rao. Rao and several other Indian leaders the Senators met deplored the harm done to Indo-American relations by the statements of Assistant Secretary of State, Ms. Robin Raphel, on Kashmir, questioning the State's permanent accession to India. When the US Charge D'Affaires, Mr. Kenneth Brill, tried to find an excuse for her by saying that Raphel's statement was casual and "off the record" (which was not true, her briefing to correspondents from South Asia was on "background", i.e., attributable to a senior administration official), Rao reported: "The statement was nevertheless appalling. Wherever it came from and whatever the motivation, it hurts." Though the Senators visited India in December last year, Mr. Rao's statement on Pressler amendment acquires significance in the wake of reports of Clinton administration's proposal to seek a one-time waiver to the amendment to allow Pakistan acquire the deadly F-16S. The Senators quoted Rao as saying: "The Prime Minister moved immediately to the Indo-Pakistan relationship, especially the Kashmir situation and the destabilising impact of any change in the Pressler amendment's restrictions on US aid to Pakistan because of its nuclear programme." It was in this context he said that any move to change Pressler and resume aid to Pakistan "would force India to reassess its defence policy." Rao told the Senators that statements on Kashmir by officials like Robin Raphel would not improve Indo-US relations. When Senator Brown said that India's economic reforms were significant but relatively unknown in the US and that a visit by the Prime Minister would be well-received especially by the US financial community, Rao said his Ambassador in Washington (Siddhartha Shankar Ray) had also been urging him to visit the US. The F-16 aircraft had been on order with Lockheed Corporation, but deliveries had been barred under Pressler amendment restrictions, although Islamabad had paid an advance of 658 million dollars. The stymied aircraft deal has been a sore point in Pak-US relations and Islamabad has left no stone unturned in its lobbying efforts with the administration and members of Congress to clear the deal. Mr. Frank Wisner, Under Secretary for Defense, informed Senator Pressler of the administration's intention to consider a one-time lifting of the Pressler amendment in order to accommodate the aircraft deal. Senator Pressler told reporters that he was concerned at the move, which was likely to be made at the House-Senate Conference committee on the State Department's Appropriations Bill, since a one-time exception would practically amount to repealing the amendment. "It is the only piece of non-proliferation legislation on the books, and I think we should be building on it," the Senator said. "Bringing F-16's into the region would trigger another arms race," he added. As soon as he was informed about the move, Sen. Pressler wrote to President Bill Clinton yesterday, seeking "five minutes at your earliest convenience to discuss nuclear non-proliferation policy." To stress the urgency of the situation, the Senator offered to meet "in your office, or during a morning run." The letter makes clear Sen. Pressler's deep concerns over the issue: "Should such a meeting prove impossible to schedule, I will raise this issue the next time I am at the White House, or if you should visit the Senate. While I would rather not raise this issue in such a public setting, I think it is critical for the administration, to send a consistent signal about the importance of nuclear non-proliferation. "Copies of the letter to the President have been sent to Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Defence Secretary William Perry, which suggests, that Sen. Pressler intends to take up the issue with the two officials. Sen. Pressler pointed out that the Clinton administration last November had proposed draft foreign aid legislation that would leave out country-specific language, in effect putting an end to the Pakistan-specific Pressler amendment. But in the face of determined opposition from Sen. Pressler, Senator John Glenn of Ohio and others, the administration beat a hasty retreat, claiming that even if the Pressler amendment had been repealed, aid to Pakistan would not have been provided as long as Pakistan retained its nuclear weapons capability. "I want the people to know what is being proposed," Sen. Pressler said. What the defence department was proposing was inconsistent with the position of the State department. He called on all concerned citizens to write to their legislators to take up the matter with members of the House-Senate Conference Committee. Sen. Pressler said he believed that part of the reason for the new move was, pressure on the Defence Department by Lockheed Corporation.
