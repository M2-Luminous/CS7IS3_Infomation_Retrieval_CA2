The ordnance industry, due to such factors as its poor compatibility with civil production in the areas of equipment and technical conditions, has much difficulty "switching production of military products to civil products." Several hundred thousands of staff members and workers in the ordnance industry, however, were not afraid of the difficulties. They worked hard to develop export products and helped the industry bring about a more than 30 percent surge in the growth of civil product exports in recent years. China North Industries Group, which is a major exporting company, doubled its export of civil products three years in a row. Last year, its exports of civil products accounted for more than half of the entire industry total. At present the ordnance industry exports some 500 lines of civil products including sporting guns, construction machinery, automobiles, and motorcycles to over 100 countries. In promoting civil product exports, the ordnance industry pursues a longterm policy and gives priority to building up an export base. Since the 1980's, it has aggressively attracted foreign capital and managed some 100 types of enterprises with exports as the main goal. Enterprises which switched from military to civil production, and enterprises which lately turned to civil product lines persist in starting out from the high ground, setting their sights on occupying domestic and international markets, and striving to produce name-brand and excellent quality products.
