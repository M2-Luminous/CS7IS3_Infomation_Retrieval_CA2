ACTION: Addendum to General Preamble for future proposed rulemakings. SUMMARY: This addendum to the General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 principally describes EPA's preliminary views on how the Agency should interpret various provisions of title I with regard to requirements for PM&hyph;10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) serious nonattainment area State implementation plans (SIP's). This document also addresses policy and guidance on attainment date waivers potentially applicable to all areas that have been designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10, waivers of certain requirements applicable to PM&hyph;10 serious nonattainment areas, and requirements for international border areas in PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas. Although the guidance includes various statements that States must take certain actions, these statements are made pursuant to EPA's preliminary interpretations, and thus do not bind States and the public as a matter of law. This addendum is an advance notice of how EPA generally intends to take action on SIP submissions and to interpret various PM&hyph;10 related title I provisions.
