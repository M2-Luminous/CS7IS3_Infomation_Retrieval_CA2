"Despite our desire for peace and readiness to make a sacrifice, we will not allow the Western world to destroy our brothers in Serbia and Montenegro," Karadzic said. Assessing the current policy by the great powers toward the republic of Srpska, he said that despite the horrific pressure the West's policy was more favorable than last year. According to Karadzic, the Western powers have finally realized that the fate of "the great former Yugoslavia" must be experienced by former Bosnia-Herzegovina which was always singled out as "little Yugoslavia." This means that a unitary Bosnia is out of the question. Speaking about a possible exchange of territories with the Muslim-Croat side, Karadzic said that this was possible and that perhaps it was inevitable, but the people's assembly of the republic of Srpska and the whole nation if necessary would have the final say on this matter. According to Karadzic, representatives of the "contact group" for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina were clearly told that the Serbian side did not have a great deal of faith in them, but that the Serbian opinion would depend on the final solutions they offered. If rumors coming from the contact group can be trusted, it offers to create a fragmented republic of Srpska with no firm border on the Sava, Drina, or Una Rivers or around Sarajevo, which is completely unacceptable. "If the Muslims want to enlarge their territory around Sarajevo, they must make some concessions to us in eastern Bosnia, namely Gorazde, Srebrenica, and Zepa. It is completely clear to us at the moment that America is dictating conditions that we cannot accept, which automatically means the continuation of the war." "America and Germany have openly sided with the Muslim-Croat side, while Russia is openly neutral. It is precisely this that is encouraging the Muslims, who are now launching fierce offensives on Mount Ozren and toward the Serb-held town of Doboj, while we are defending ourselves. If this continues, we will switch to an active defense and push them back from the current lines of separation," Karadzic said in conclusion. In addition to Banja Luka businessmen, the talks were attended by Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the republic of Srpska, and Velibor Ostojic, chairman of the Serb Democratic Party of Serb Lands.
