The results of the operation of the ministry last year were discussed at the meeting and the main directions for work in 1994 set forth. After the proceedings of the collegium, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov invited several Russian journalists to a meeting, in which he shared his considerations concerning the status of Russia's foreign trade and answered numerous questions. We offer our readers a brief report on this meeting. Exports Have Stabilized In 1993 the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations structured its work on the basis of the program of the Government of Russia "Development of Reforms and Stabilization of the Russian Economy." It was particularly important for us to actually carry out the first stage of this program scheduled for 1993-1995. The ministry concentrated its efforts on this. We continued work to shape a mechanism for the regulation of foreign economic activities in the period of transition. It is based on further liberalization through cutting back measures of nontariff regulation and switching to mostly economic methods, at the same time streamlining the system of export and currency control. The stabilization of exports and the growth of foreign exchange proceeds testify that the measures being taken are effective. At the same time, major problems have yet to be solved in the area of foreign exchange regulation; there have been instances of violations of legislation in the foreign economic sector. Despite the overall worsening of conditions for trade, Russian exports (volume in terms of value) stabilized in 1993, coming to $43 billion. A considerable positive balance was achieved in trade with distant foreign countries in the amount of $16 billion. This was ensured primarily by increasing the physical volume of deliveries of raw and other materials. Changes in the geographical breakdown of exports caused the share of industrialized countries to increase from 58 percent in 1992 to 60 percent in 1993, and that of developing countries--from 11 to 14 percent, respectively. The share of the former member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance fell from 19 to 17 percent. Germany, China, Great Britain, Japan, France, the United States, Hungary, and Finland hold leading positions in Russian exports. Exports to the countries of Southeast Asia--Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea--have developed at a high rate. In the opinion of the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the slump in industrial production in Russia, worsening trends on the world market, and failure to solve the problems of state support for exports, including funding and insurance for them, have affected the volume, breakdown, and rate of growth of exports. Besides, exports experienced powerful pressure from industrialized countries, which have taken discriminatory measures against Russian trade. The interest of exporters in making deliveries of a number of types of products fell sharply. This happened as a result of the growth of domestic prices, transportation outlays, and high interest rates on bank credit. Nonetheless, proceeds in foreign exchange from the exports of goods went up in 1993, reaching $16 billion. In the opinion of the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, this testifies to the gradual assertion of export and foreign exchange control, especially over the deliveries of strategically important raw material products. We Have Begun To Import Less Compared to 1992, Russian imports fell last year by almost 30 percent and came to $27 billion, which is mainly associated with the pursued policy of reducing state expenditures, including those for centralized imports; the latter declined by a factor of two. We also began to purchase less abroad due to restricting foreign borrowing, implementing a policy of containing credit extension, gradually abolishing subsidization of imports from the budget, and introducing the value-added tax on imported goods. Industrialized countries accounted for 54 percent of the total volume of imports (62 percent in 1992), developing countries for 18 percent (14 percent), and former member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance for 11 percent (15 percent). The greatest volume of import purchases was generated in Germany, China, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Great Britain, and Hungary. To be sure, we cannot fail to note that the existing methodology of registering statistical data in the area of foreign trade with which the State Committee on Statistics and, consequently, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations operate is far from perfect. This methodology was developed with the quite recently existing monopoly of the state in the area of foreign economic relations factored in; in many cases, it is simply not functional. For example, numbers indicate that trade between Russia and Sweden is declining; but according to Swedish estimates it is increasing, and at a quite confident rate. In Stockholm they believe that Russia has moved from 32d to 28th place in Swedish exports. The explanation is quite simple: Unlike Russian statistics, Swedish statistics are based on registration of the volume of commodity flows crossing the border of the country; for this reason, they also register things exported by private persons. Given our current Russian reality, whereby customs duties have increased sharply, a majority of importing companies, for example, importers of automobiles, perform their operations precisely through private persons. In the opinion of Oleg Davydov, the latest changes in the leadership of the State Committee on Statistics should ensure a change for the better in this area. In his words, so far it has been virtually impossible in some cases to obtain accurate data; he personally encountered this in his numerous attempts to learn about the volume of trade with Baltic countries. Great Changes Are Forthcoming In the near future, by all signs from next year on, the approach to Russia as a country with state foreign trade will hardly be applicable. As Oleg Davydov stated, the state is planning to fully withdraw from this sphere of activities in 1995. All indications are that this will occasion major changes in the structure of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations itself. As far as changes directly in the area of export and import operations are concerned, the determination to discontinue grain purchases abroad beginning next year is noteworthy. In general, Russian foreign trade will to a considerable degree depend on the domestic economic situation, what paths the reforms take, and what the next steps of the Russian Government in the economic area turn out to be. The main avenues for the operation of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations in 1994 are: --perfecting the regulatory and legal base for regulating foreign economic activities (VED); --cutting back administrative methods and perfecting economic methods for the regulation of foreign economic activities; --reinforcing export and foreign exchange control; --creating a favorable regimen of trade in relations with foreign countries; --ensuring the accomplishment of tasks in export and import operations to meet federal state needs; --ensuring support for Russian exports; --stimulating the attraction of foreign investment to Russia; --settling the issue of the repayment of the debt of foreign states to Russia; --coordinating and facilitating the development of foreign economic activities of the regions of Russia; --improving informational and cadre support for foreign economic activities. All the above avenues appear important. However, it makes sense to focus in particular on problems associated with the operation of the currency market in Russia. The point is that, in the environment of a high rate of inflation, the exchange rate of the ruble on the currency market has recently been maintained at an artificially high level. As a result, a paradoxical situation developed in January--even the export of oil and refinery products from Russia ended up unprofitable at the maintained ratio of 1,160 rubles [R] to the dollar. Oleg Davydov believes that had the exchange rate of the ruble not fallen below the line of R1,500 to the dollar, export shipments could have simply stopped. Consequently, foreign exchange proceeds from exports, which come to $3-3.5 billion, would have ceased. Therefore, the sphere of foreign economic activities develops in a close interrelationship with domestic economic development. When particular measures are implemented in the economic sphere, it is necessary to soberly evaluate the entire range of possible side effects which, in terms of consequences, may prove far more serious than temporary advantages, even if they set the noble goal of ensuring stability of the national currency.
