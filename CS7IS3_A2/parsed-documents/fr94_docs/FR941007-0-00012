FR941007-0-00012 FR941007-0-00003 Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 50 handlers of Florida tomatoes subject to regulation under the marketing order and approximately 250 producers in the production area. Small agricultural service firms, including tomato handlers, are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the tomato handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. On May 31, 1994, the committee met to discuss the difficulty it has experienced in collecting assessments from a few handlers and in receiving complete, up-to-date packout information from some handlers. The committee recommended several modifications to the order's existing rules and regulations to improve these situations. Handler Certification Currently, pursuant to §966.323 Handling regulation, fresh market shipments of tomatoes by handlers to points outside the regulated area must meet grade, size, inspection, and container requirements. Fresh market shipments within the regulated area are not subject to such requirements. Fresh market shipments within and outside the regulated area are subject to assessments. The regulated area is defined as the portion of the State of Florida which is bounded by the Suwannee River, the Georgia Border, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Gulf of Mexico. Basically, it is the entire State of Florida, except the Panhandle. The production area is part of the regulated area. Under §966.113 Registered handler, and for the purpose of this order, registered handlers are persons who have adequate facilities for grading tomatoes for market and who assume initial responsibility for compliance with inspection, assessment, reporting, and other regulatory requirements concerning tomatoes grown in the production area. Any person who wishes to become a registered handler is required to make an application for registration with the committee on forms prescribed by, and available at the principle office of, the committee. If the applicant has facilities which are determined by the committee as adequate for grading tomatoes, the applicant may be approved as a registered handler. ``Adequate facilities'' are currently defined as those being in a permanent location with nonportable equipment for the proper grading, sizing and packing of tomatoes. The committee recommended two minor additions to the definition: (1) The term ``washing'' should be added to the definition, as that activity is an integral part of the handling process; and (2) the phrase ``grown in the production area'' be added at the end of the definition to further identify the tomatoes being handled. Most tomatoes produced in Florida are shipped fresh to markets outside the regulated area. The committee's goal is to avoid marketing problems associated with poor quality tomato shipments. The industry has spent substantial sums of money to promote Florida tomatoes to the trade and consumers. Such expenditures are predicated on the shipment by handlers of good quality tomatoes, which buyers have come to expect from Florida. The committee reported that it has been difficult to collect assessments from some handlers in the past. One handler indicates no intention of paying assessments this year. Because of these compliance difficulties, and to foster shipments of good quality tomatoes, the committee recommended changes in the rules and regulations to strengthen the registered handler procedures, clarify handler responsibilities under the order, and enhance the committee's compliance capabilities. The committee recommended amending §966.113 and adopting new provisions which would: (1) Establish that registered handlers must be certified by the committee; (2) provide the committee with the authority, criteria, and procedures for approving registered handler certifications and for cancelling such certifications for failure to pay assessments or provide reports to the committee; and (3) allow only registered handlers to lawfully ship tomatoes outside of the regulated area. After considering the committee's recommendations, the Department has determined that the changes in this interim rule are necessary to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. New §966.113 contains an introductory statement explaining the criteria that a handler must meet to be registered under the order. These provisions include having adequate facilities and being certified by the committee as a registered handler, handling tomatoes in compliance with order requirements, obtaining inspection, submitting required reports, and paying applicable assessments. Four of these provisions are currently specified in §966.113. The provisions for certification as a registered handler and submission of reports are added in this rule to help the committee with its compliance responsibilities and improve marketing assistance provided to handlers under the order.
