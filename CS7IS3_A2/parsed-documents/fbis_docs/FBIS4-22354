Serov, deputy chief of Track Service for the Transbaykal Railroad, by V. Pakulin, GUDOK correspondent: "The Transsiberian Is in Danger: the Mainline's Engineering Structures and Roadbed Are in Urgent Need of Restoration"; Chita, date not given] [Text] On 8 October of last year, GUDOK published an article by P. Lugovoy, head of the Laboratory of the Tynda Frost Station, "Transsib v ozhidanii rekonstruktsii" [The Transsiberian Awaits Rebuilding]. With facts and figures in hand, he convinced the readers that the Transsiberian mainline was seriously ill and needed radical treatment. Four months passed, though, and another article on this subject appeared in the newspaper -- "Transsib ne bolen, on moguch i zhdet bolshoy raboty" [The Transsib is Not Sick, It Is Powerful and Awaits a Great Deal of Work], by G. Teterskiy, lecturer at the Irkutsk Transport Engineers Institute. Its author states, in particular, that "there is not and cannot be any question of the life and death of the supermainline. The Transsiberian is healthy, and possesses unused transport capacity. It is capable of transporting several times more than it does now, and ensuring high-speed movement of `East-West' container trains." The problem is a major one. Opinion is divided, and I directed the attention of V. Serov, deputy chief of Track Service, to this matter. He is the one who well knows the state of the engineering structures on the mainline. [Serov] The one-sidedness of the conception of technical policy on improving the railroad transport process shows through many publications and articles by scientists and directors of the MPS [Ministry of Railways] and railroads. Most often it is a question of the administrative system for transport, the efficiency of the locomotive and railcar operation, optimization of operating expenses, the capacity of the permanent way and, naturally, train traffic safety. Beyond all these undeniably important problems, however, they seem to have forgotten the foundation of the railroad: the man-made structures and roadbed. Meanwhile, the proportion of engineering structures in the fixed capital of the roads constitutes from 17 to 29 percent, depending on the geographical and other conditions. On the Transbaykal, it is over 26 percent. The transport process depends directly on the state of this equipment. It is like a truism. Most unfortunately, however, the engineering structures and roadbed, as before, are regarded as simply part of the track equipment. Suffice to say that, by some strange coincidence, there is no mention of the engineering structures of the track installations in the "Program for Re-Equipment and Modernization of MPS Railroads up to the Year 2000." As for the polemics on the pages of GUDOK, I think that Petr Nikolayevich Lugovoy probably estimates the situation on the Transbaykal as one of the most vulnerable sections of the Transsiberian. I remind you that physical wear on man-made structures and the roadbed here was over 60 percent, and the level of defects and deformations of the engineering structures -- 40 percent. Repair of the fixed capital is doubly overdue, but this is not all, the number of objects subjected to varying degrees of wash-out has reached 892. Of them, 328 must be completely rebuilt. According to the reliability indicator, train traffic speeds must be restricted to 5 kilometers an hour on 516 bridges. Another thing: recent calculations of the load capacity of the reinforced concrete superstructures showed that 167 of them (on half the road) need to have speed restriction conditions introduced. This is where our potential failures and sites of possible accidents lie. [Pakulin] The figures are impressive, but, after all, inspection of the engineering structures has not yet been finally completed. What are the possible results of this? [Serov] Next year we will finish the inspection of four more track sections. Even today, though, it is clear that the predictions are not consoling: the road's engineering structures are in critical condition and are deteriorating every day. Rebuilding requires 40-60 "windows," lasting from 6 to 12 hours, every month. This creates tremendous difficulties for traffic organizers. In general, repair of the engineering structures must not be regarded as just a whim of the track workers -- it is in the interests of the entire road. [Pakulin] What are the scales of rebuilding which should increase the reliability of the roads with increased loads? We know that engineering structures were designed and built at the turn of the century, practically 100 years ago, and were not at all calculated for today's heavy trains and speeds.... [Serov] Rebuilding bridges, tunnels, ducts, retaining walls and the roadbed on our scale and significance is more difficult than the automatic blocking and electrification programs mentioned, which we carried out in previous decades. These programs, however, swallowed up tremendous funds, pulled away from rebuilding, and in some cases, urgent work to maintain man-made structures in at least working condition. Built back in tsarist days, they are completely obsolete. We must now recognize the priority significance of rebuilding bridges, ducts and the roadbed in the next 10-15 years. Noting the serious situation of the industry and the results of the inspections, we determined the concept of rebuilding the Transbaykal. We must concentrate our main efforts on the Mogocha and Skovorodino divisions. The situation is very strained there. The Chita division also needs more attention and will be completely worked over, as well. The approach to action on the Borzya Division is different. Considering the increase in freight turnover with the development of foreign economic relations, it is likely that accelerated work will have to be done there on some lines, sections and facilities which impose a restriction on the throughput capacity, and the state of which is simply the limit. The special feature of this division is that the Manchurian branch line has only one rail. There are studies on second tracks, but so far no funds. This problem must be solved, however, before the contractors leave. The "maneuvers" here, in my opinion, can be like this: at first, in parallel with the rebuilding of existing structures -- construction of new engineering structures, and at the second stage -- laying the tracks. The Mogocha Division, however, is unquestionably in first place with respect to difficulty and importance. [Pakulin] Even the general picture of the state of the man-made structures and the prospects for rebuilding which you have outlined give an idea of what major resources will have to be concentrated on the road.... [Serov] We cannot manage this, of course, with our own subdivisions. Just imagine, a total of 480 people are engaged in the maintenance and repair of the engineering structures on the road. This is on the total 3,640 kilometer length of the main route. A special team is required for planned-preventive repair. Nor is there any help from the brigades involved in maintaining the permanent way -- they got out of routine maintenance of the roadbed and other engineering structures. Worse than that, in capital repair, the track machine stations are intensifying the already serious situation of the bridges and the roadbed. Why? Well because they are ignoring the planning and technological norms, rules and instructions, and no one bears the responsibility for this. [Pakulin] Nevertheless, the rates of repairing the structures are increasing: in 1992, as compared with 1968, they succeeded in increasing the work volume by a factor of six. At the expense of what? [Serov] The subdivisions of the Transstroy Corporation (former Ministry of Transport Construction), with which we continue to cooperate, have contributed to this. Last year, 16 construction organizations worked on the Transbaykal, and of them, 12 had been brought in. [Pakulin] Last year, however, the plan was scarcely 40-percent fulfilled. Of course, the unsatisfactory financing made it impossible for the road to do a great deal of what had been outlined. It seemed that the forces concentrated on capital repair of the engineering structures were solid. But without settling with the contractors for doing the work, and without issuing them an advance to acquire material resources, it is hard to count on having normal work continue. [Serov] I do not agree with the assertion, that the reason for the cut in the rates of rebuilding lies in the road's insolvency. I know the situation, and not by hearsay, and I note that they had money. It could have been redistributed. But priority was given to the permanent way, because of which the complex of work on planned preventive repair was considerably overfulfilled. The Transbaykal Railroad is now "at the top of the list" for the road network with respect to the reliability level of the permanent way. I could be happy for my colleagues if the foundation of the railroad --the engineering structures -- had not suffered because of the shortage of funds. The plants of the construction industry, having supplied the bridge structures, broke off relations with us because of non-payment. We owed the builders, the designers and the scientific institutes 11 billion rubles [R], counting loans, fines and indexing. The situation has become so exacerbated that some of the subdivisions, recruited for the road with such difficulty, are refusing to cooperate with us. Having lost the reputation of a solid partner, we may be deprived of them, and this will cost us dearly. [Pakulin] What do you see as the way out of the situation that has been created? [Serov] First and foremost, in purposeful dividing up of funds and changing priorities in favor of engineering structures, and on the other hand, the need to reorganize the administrative structure of the engineering structures has become urgent. This was the topic five years ago at the road's technical-economic council. No positive decision was reached at that time, though. What do I have in mind? Our capital repair, having exceeded all the parameters, grew into rebuilding. The unusual nature of the situation lies above all in the fact that to carry it out we were forced "under the wheels." This is very difficult: there are no analogies in practical work, so far no normative documents, technological decisions or experience in organizing traffic in this sort of development. We cannot do without a change in administrative structure here. Or take our department. There are six specialists in it. This is enough under normal conditions for our operations. But we not only have to form our own ideas (operational, technical, construction), we have to embody them: plan the operations work, keep track of the planning and financing, coordinate the actions of the executors, accept what has been done.... In short, perform the functions of the capital construction department. As you can see, this situation is far from a standard one. We discussed it at a council on complete rebuilding of the engineering structures, and came to the conclusion that we could not manage without creating a special board of directors, which would deal fully with operations and rebuilding. [Pakulin] Nevertheless, without waiting for the board of directors to be set up, you are already dealing with the rebuilding yourself, and everything involved in it? [Serov] It would, of course, have been stupid, in the extraordinary situation which had formed, to wait for a special signal for large-scale operations to begin. Procrastination is fraught with many unpleasant things, and the main one -- we are risking human lives. The opinion that one should wait for a more tolerable economic and financial situation, and should amass material resources is an erroneous opinion. The road's condition no longer requires just therapeutic treatment, it needs surgical intervention. As I have been saying, the rebuilding of engineering structures and the roadbed -- priority work, let us call it -- is estimated at 10-15 years. By the end of this period, the second stage of rebuilding -- structures built in the 1930's -- will also "be done." We are also faced with fairly large expenses: we need new technology, new base settlements and new resources. We are already taking this into consideration, and in rebuilding one of the tracks, we are doing some preventive work, if not complete repair, on the adjacent track. Moreover, the situation will in general become catastrophic, if we break off at stage one. It would not appear difficult to understand one simple thing: by increasing expenditures for capital repair, we will many times reduce operating expenses, through increased reliability. [Pakulin] Just what will it take to develop work in accordance with the complete rebuilding program? [Serov] It will take R55-60 billion a year at today's prices in the next decade. But we cannot leave operations, rebuilding and all the construction unaccompanied by science. There is nothing to dream of unless we develop a construction industry based on full-scale work. Furthermore, our subdivisions need re-equipping. The mechanization level of our routine maintenance and capital repair of engineering structures is not over 20 percent. For comparison: routine maintenance of the permanent way is 46.7 percent mechanized, and capital repair, using PMS [track machine station] resources -- 87 percent. An inadmissible disproportion has formed in the economy of one service. Unless we equip the brigades of bridge workers and roadbed workers (including the subdivisions called in) with modern technical devices, we are faced with failing to achieve the task. All this also requires expenditures. We calculated that we will need R1 trillion in the first ten years. The last thing. There will be no rebuilding "under the wheels" unless, in organizing and confirming the train traffic schedule in the MPS, the technical condition of the engineering structures, the need for "windows" and single-track temporary rails, and the need to grant a special "window" day for the most labor-intensive repair work are taken into consideration. In general, I feel that rebuilding the engineering structures and track installations must be given the status of a target program on the state level.
