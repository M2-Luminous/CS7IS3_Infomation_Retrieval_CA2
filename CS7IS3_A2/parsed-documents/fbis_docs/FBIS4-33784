This was announced by Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso, who added that the letter also expressed the Cuban Government's willingness to send doctors and specialists to Colombia if needed. Alfonso said the Foreign Ministry is pleased with recent statements by the Latin American Economic System -- SELA -- and the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] rejecting the 30-year-old U.S. Government blockade of Cuba. Alfonso pointed out that SELA's 3 June decision marked the first time that this organization had made a statement against the blockade. Alfonso explained that the NAM statement was much stronger than on previous occasions in that it specifically advocated the UN General Assembly resolutions against the blockade. Alfonso also mentioned the rallies several U.S. organizations held in Washington and other U.S. cities on 9 June in support of the bill to lift the U.S. blockade which legislator Charles Rangel presented before Congress and other U.S. political and federal entities.
