This is what the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] repeatedly explains to interested parties whenever it has a chance regarding an emergency meeting on the semiconductor issue held in January. MITI is saying this because admittance of the meeting as an emergency meeting is tantamount to accepting U.S. claims that "no progress has been made regarding the issue of improving Japanese semiconductor market access." Drop of Market Share According to U.S. Calculation The share of semiconductors in the Japanese market by foreign countries, including the United States, exceeded 20 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992, which was the goal of the United States. But the market share is shrinking, according to a calculation by the United States. However, MITI is not ready to alter its stand, saying "the amount we spent for purchasing foreign semiconductors is steadily growing." The United States is proud that the "20 percent" figure, which was incorporated in a Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord, expanded Japan's semiconductor imports. Many interested people in Japan admit this was one of the U.S. motives in demanding Japan accept numerical targets in other fields as well. It is likely the United States will stress the effectiveness of numerical targets should Japanese semiconductor users introduce "emergency measures" by accepting the U.S. demand. Because of this, it is said MITI unofficially instructed the industrial world to "keep quiet for a while." Immediately prior to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, A. Prokashini [name as published], managing director of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), warned that the "Japanese and American semiconductor industrial worlds are moving toward an era of confrontation and criticism." He explained his understanding that the "honeymoon period," which interested people in Japan began to talk about a year ago, was about to end due to the Japanese Government's clumsy handling of the situation. American Companies in Japan Show Good Business Performances However, there is no sign that Japanese users are taking this remark seriously, which can be understood as a threat. They are not paying serious attention to the remark because major American semiconductor manufacturers in Japan achieved good business results in 1993, and because supply is not catching up with demand. Sales figures for Intel Japan (located in Tsukuba in Ibaraki Prefecture) increased to 87.7 billion yen, a 36 percent increase from the previous year. Its net profit was 9.4 billion yen, which was a 74 percent increase from the previous year. Both figures were the highest in the company's history. Japan Texas Instruments' (Japan TI located in Minatoku) semiconductor sales also increased by 20 percent from the previous year, totaling 100 billion yen. Not only major semiconductors but U.S. semiconductor manufacturers in general have no intention to use the U.S. Government to open up semiconductor markets in Japan. R. Dickinson, president of Cirrus Logic [name as published], says: "We do not see any problems regarding market access." T. Rogers, president of Cyprus Semiconductors, also points out that "the Japanese electronics market is open." He coolly adds: "The job of the USTR is to make a racket, so they merely say various things." Regarding the semiconductor issue, Motorola, which is complaining about the closed nature of the mobile telephone market in Japan, is also remaining quiet. Integrated circuits (IC's) for cars and telecommunications are selling well. Japan Motorola says that "we do not have enough memory chips or microcontrollers (MCU's) to sell to our Japanese customers." Some Japanese semiconductor users are saying that "since the U.S. semiconductor makers are not capable of supplying enough semiconductors, they will be at a loss if we ask them to sell us more semiconductors," (according to a major electric machine maker). Because of this, a growing number of people are of the view that the SIA will not ask Japan to introduce special measures linked to the expansion of semiconductor purchases. Pressure May Be Applied as a Result of Excessive Supply However, with the help of their good business results, major American manufacturers are making huge investments in plants and equipment. South Korean makers are also rapidly expanding their production capabilities. Some people predict that since new factories will start to operate, "some of the goods will be in excessive supply around the second half of this year," (according to a major domestic user). If that is the case, there is a possibility that the United States may strengthen its pressure again on Japan for an expansion of market share. However, major Japanese users are already using a considerable quantity of foreign semiconductors. More than 30 percent of semiconductors Toshiba Corporation and Hitachi Ltd. use are foreign made. It is more than 20 percent for Matsushita Electric Industrial Corporation. The reality is that "Japanese users' efforts are reaching the limit because they are forcing themselves to realize the 20 percent share." Some people think that foreign semiconductor makers's market share in Japan is unable to move upward "because of the unreasonable efforts" made during the second half of 1992 to expand market share. Japan should listen to the United States regarding such matters as clarifying standards for selecting semiconductor suppliers. However, Japan has already suffered the boomerang effect of temporary measures for expansion of market share. Some people feel a sense of security, saying that "nobody will benefit from recurrence of the Japan-U.S. friction over the semiconductor issue," (according to MITI). The general trend is that Japan should not introduce rough-and-ready measures to deal with the situation.
