The Americans are moving intensely and are the main participants in events behind the scenes. Informed diplomatic sources say this policy was adopted during one of the frequent meetings between U.S. and British diplomats at the Foreign Office last fall. The diplomats were coordinating their actions to promote the CBM's after the "election" in the pseudostate. With their stance, the U.S. and British diplomats, along UN envoys, are proving the accuracy of this information. During their recent meetings in Cyprus, the UN envoys avoided meeting the country's political leaders and only held talks with the two communities' leaders. There was talk in the past of "secret negotiations" but the issue resurfaced with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' remarks after his latest meeting with the UN secretary general's representatives Joe Clark and Gustave Feissel. Following the official talks, Denktas seems to have told the Greek Cypriot reporters who went to the occupied areas to cover the meeting: "Secret diplomacy will follow." Bearing all this in mind, you cannot help but link the optimism expressed by Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, immediately after he arrived in the Greek capital, the second stop on his tour. Based on official statements and President Glavkos Kliridhis' briefing of National Council members, there was talk in Cyprus of a deadlock. According to the government spokesman: "The procedure has ended for now." In his statement, Clark said: "There could be progress in the effort toward a Cyprus solution." The UN official's statement surprised the common view. Those who are familiar with behind-the-scenes events link the statement with one of Denktas' references. Asked about the prospects for an agreement with Kliridhis, Clark said in his statement that they may disagree but in the end they will agree. There is another fact, reported and not denied, that strengthens all of the above information. Before their meeting with the five UN Security Council permanent representatives at the Russian Embassy last Wednesday [26 January], Clark and Feissel reportedly "secretly met" U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher at the U.S. Embassy. The U.S. ambassador recently adopted intense activity to persuade politicians, economists, and other elements to support the confidence-building measures. But he cynically told them there is no margin for improvement because Denktas would not accept such a thing (the package of CBM's).
