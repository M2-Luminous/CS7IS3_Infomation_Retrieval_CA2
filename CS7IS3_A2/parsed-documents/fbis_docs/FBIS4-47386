It is shown that photocurrent strength fluctuations of a coherent lidar arise when there is a high spatial resolution of a single-mode heterodyne detector. The level of these fluctuations is proportional to the level of the turbulent fluctuations of the intensity of the sounding radiation. The proportionality factor is dependent on the angle of the detector field of view and it decreases with its increase. Applying these findings, the objective was the development of a coherent lidar with a high spatial resolution. This is possible only with single-mode detection. In comparison with methods for sounding the parameters of atmospheric turbulence based on measurement of intensity fluctuations of the scattered field, but using incoherent detection, a coherent lidar is more promising. Already with an entrance aperture of the receiving telescope R = 2.8 cm the spatial resolution of the lidar already is adequate for registering the intensity of random photocurrent modulation by about 50% on a path 1.06 km. A further increase in the sounding range is possible by increasing entrance aperture size. Without a considerable decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio this is possible to R = 7.5 for coherent lidar systems which are oriented on surface paths and up to R = 50 cm when sounding is from space. These and other results obtained in the study can be used in solving problems arising in practical use of coherent lidar systems. Figures 2; references 7: 4 Russian, 3 Western.
