FR940324-0-00022 FR940324-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Bureau of Export Administration 15 CFR Part 799 [Docket No. 930775&hyph;4082] RIN 0694&hyph;AA96 Removal of National Security-Based Validated License Requirements for Exports to Proscribed Destinations of Oil Well Perforators AGENCY: Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule amends ECCN 1C18A to remove national security-based validated license requirements for exports to Country Groups Q, W, Y, and Z and the People's Republic of China of certain oil well perforators. This action is a result of a determination that foreign availability exists for certain oil well perforators within the meaning of section 5(f) of the Export Administration Act (EAA), as amended, and part 791 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) published an interim rule in the Federal Register on November 23, 1993 (58 FR 61806), that included the foreign availability determination and removed national security-based validated license requirements for exports of these oil well perforators to Country Groups T and V, except the People's Republic of China. A validated export license continues to be required for exports to Iran, Syria, Country Groups S and Z, and the South African military and police, for foreign policy reasons. This rule will eliminate export license applications for these oil well perforators for all but a few countries, thereby reducing the paperwork burden on exporters. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective March 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For questions of a technical nature, contact Jeffrey Tripp, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, Telephone: (202) 482&hyph;1309. For questions on the foreign availability assessment, contact Ronald Rolfe, Foreign Industrial Analyst, Office of Foreign Availability, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, Telephone: (202) 482&hyph;0074. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 5(f)(3) of the EAA and part 791 of the EAR set forth the procedures and criteria for determining the foreign availability of items controlled for national security reasons. The Secretary of Commerce, or the Secretary's designee, is authorized to determine whether foreign availability exists. With limited exceptions, the Department of Commerce may not maintain national security controls on exports of an item when the Department determines that items of comparable quality are available, in fact, to countries from foreign sources in quantities sufficient to render the controls ineffective in achieving their purpose. On June 21, 1993, the Office of Foreign Availability (OFA) initiated a foreign availability assessment of oil well perforators controlled by ECCN 1C18A in response to a claim filed pursuant to Part 791 of the EAR. The Department published a notice of the initiation of the assessment in the Federal Register on July 28, 1993 (58 FR 40407). On October 18, 1993, the Acting Assistant Secretary, having considered the assessment and other relevant information provided by OFA, determined that foreign availability of certain oil well perforators exists within the meaning of section 5(f) of the EAA and part 791 of the EAR. The Department provided all interested agencies an opportunity to review and comment on the assessment and determination. On November 8, 1993, based on discussions with other agencies, the Acting Assistant Secretary clarified the scope of oil well perforators covered by the foreign availability determination, as provided for in the EAA.
