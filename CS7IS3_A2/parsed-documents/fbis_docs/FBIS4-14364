The sources said that, as the United States supplied Israel with weapons and offered nothing to serve the peace process, Syria has begun to look once again for allies to supply it with spare parts and weapons and work again to achieve the military and strategic parity it had started, that is within new Arab alliances that could surprise the Arab world. The sources pointed out that Syria will overturn the equation in its relations, which will center on its interests that secures power for it in the Middle East region. And that it is currently making secret contacts with Arab parties with which it has had strained relations in the past. The sources said that what justifies this is that Syria has begun to be subjected to great pressures to accept concessions in its demands vis-a-vis Israel's withdrawal from the Golan and the occupied Arab territories. And Damascus has begun to urge the elimination of Arab differences and the restoration of cohesion among the Arab states.
