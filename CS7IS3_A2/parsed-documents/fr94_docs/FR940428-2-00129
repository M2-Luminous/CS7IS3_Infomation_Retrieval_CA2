FR940428-2-00129 FR940428-2-00060 Because of the additional non-member constituencies that will be able to view all broadcast orders, the NASD is also proposing to modify its order-entry procedure for SelectNet to ensure that broadcast orders are entered into and displayed through SelectNet anonymously. This feature is proposed for two reasons: To preserve incentives for dealers to continue to make markets that add liquidity to the market and to avoid conditioning the market in one direction or another by orders identified with particular market makers or order entry firms. First, the NASD believes that it is very important to retain incentives for market makers to participate in the market. Market makers put quotes in the Nasdaq system as a form of advertisement that they stand ready and willing to transact business at their quoted prices and sizes. There are obligations that accrue to those market makers, however, the NASD and the SEC require market makers to be firm for their quotes and to participate in order execution systems. Enabling order entry firms to advertise buy and sell interest freely, with no concomitant market maker obligations, by attaching their names to SelectNet orders so that anyone with a Workstation would be able to contact the entity directly by telephone, would eviscerate the positive attributes of being a market maker with a quote in the Nasdaq system. Second, allowing market makers (or order entry firms) to put their names on broadcast orders might condition or influence the market in a security by advertising the buying or selling power of the member firm. For example, if a broker/dealer that is considered a lead market maker or a major institutional block positioner in a security was interested in buying shares in the stock, it might broadcast a sell order in SelectNet, identify its name on the order, and cause the market to react to the sell interest and the power of the firm's name. Accordingly, other market makers in the stock might react to the sell interest by dropping their bids and the lead market maker would be able to buy stock at a lower price than would otherwise have been the case, simply because it was advertising its name, or conditioning the market. Indeed, similar conditioning effects might be caused by an firm, order entry firm or market maker, by entering orders that are quickly canceled without actual trading interest by the entry firm. Accordingly, the NASD proposes that member firms enter all broadcast orders anonymously. Although orders must be entered on an anonymous basis, once two firms are in negotiation over the terms of the broadcast order, the order entry firm may of course identify itself to the contra side. 10 The information on SelectNet broadcast orders will be made available to members and non-member subscribers in the Nasdaq Workstation Level 2 service. This proposal is intended to avoid conditioning the market with orders that might be canceled at any time without actual trading interest by the order entry firm. 10 Presently, SelectNet provides members the option of identifying themselves on broadcast orders through their market maker identification symbol, although this alternative is seldom used. Accordingly, the Nasdaq Stock Market is proposing modifications to SelectNet to permit non-member, viewing access, to all SelectNet broadcast orders immediately as the orders are entered into the system; and to require all broadcast orders to be entered and disseminated on an anonymous basis. The NASD believes the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 15A(b)(6) and 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act and is a particularly timely and germane response to the recommendations contained in the Market 2000 study. Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest. Section 11A(a)(1)(C) finds that it is in the public interest to, among other things, assure the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities and economically efficient execution of securities transactions. The SelectNet service has served as an alternative to the telephone in times of market stress and as a system to broadcast orders to market makers for economically efficient negotiations and executions. By permitting non-members to view those broadcast orders, the NASD is removing impediments to transparency of market information and is facilitating transactions for those non-members who will now be able to see all broadcast orders in the service and timely arrange for the execution of such orders by a member. Although the orders in SelectNet do not represent quotations or trades reports, which are customarily disseminated to the public by Nasdaq, the NASD believes that the information is valuable to investors and market participants and should be transparent and disseminated to non-members. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of purposed of the Act. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others The issue of non-member access to SelectNet has been the topic of careful, in depth discussion of many different committees of the NASD and its subsidiaries for the past two years. Discussions have fully aired the concerns of members with permitting disclosure to non-members of order information in an NASD-operated order negotiation system. While the constituencies agreed to open up SelectNet to non-members, differing degrees of non-member access were considered and debated. Some members recommended allowing non-member access to SelectNet following a short interval for market makers to interact with orders in the system. Non-members advocated immediate dissemination of SelectNet broadcast orders. All concurred that the original functionality of SelectNet as an alternative to the telephone should be preserved. After extensive venting of germane issues in numerous committees of members and non-members, a consensus position was achieved recommending Board approval of immediate non-member access to SelectNet broadcast orders. The Board received two comment letters on the proposal, one from the Investment Company Institute (``ICI'') advocating approval of the proposal and another from the Security Traders Association (``STA'') recommending disapproval. The ICI argued that in order for mutual funds and other institutions to be able to fulfill their fiduciary obligations it was vital that they be given access to all relevant market information. The STA took the opposite position and stated that since SelectNet was developed as a private means for market makers to communicate with each other and negotiate orders, it was not appropriate to make these private business communications available to customers. The STA also argued that the vocal institutional proponents of access to SelectNet are customers of NASD member firms and that there must be a separation between members, non-members and their customers without jeopardizing the customers' entitlement to best execution. The STA also predicted that non-member access to SelectNet might result in greater volatility, wider spreads and less liquidity because non-members may not demonstrate the same ethical standards with which members are required to abide. The NASD Board considered these arguments carefully. The SelectNet service retains its capacity for private communication between members in that the preferencing functions have not been modified or opened up to non-member access. In addition, the NASD Board concluded that displaying SelectNet orders to all investors who subscribe to Nasdaq Level II service would increase the efficiency of the market and enhance their ability to monitor the quality of executions they receive. Moreover, the Board concluded that there is no basis to assume that greater transparency of order information to investors will result in wider spreads or less liquidity; indeed, historically the opposite has proven to be the case. Accordingly, the Board approved non-member access to SelectNet broadcast orders in the interests of enhanced transparency of order information and more open market operations. III.
