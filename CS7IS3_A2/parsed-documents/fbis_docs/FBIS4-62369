M. Gorbachev is in Venice, where he was invited to attend a seminar on security policy problems organized by UNESCO and the European Institute for Cooperation between East and West. Asked by journalists to comment on the international community's initiative on the Yugoslav crisis, M. Gorbachev opined that the recognition by the West of the sovereignty of former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia was too hasty. As for the possibility of the use of force by Western powers to settle the conflict in former Yugoslavia, in his view the threats that force would be used testify to the weakness of international diplomacy. Having stressed in his conversation with journalists that the communist model has become obsolete, M. Gorbachev noted that the liberal model, currently widespread in Europe, was also in crisis. That is why new ideas and new parties are needed, he stressed.
