Bulger] [Text] Pretoria April 21 SAPA -- The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] will appoint two executive directors in the self-governing territory of Lebowa, it decided on Thursday [21 April]. African National Congress Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa said the executive directors would oversee the finances, services and rationalisation of the Lebowa administration. The executive council said tension and lawlessness were mounting in Lebowa and there had been several deaths. Mr Ramaphosa said the directors would interact with the government of Lebowa Chief Minister Mr Nelson Ramodike. They would take over financial control from the Department of Regional and Land affairs, he said. The department has been running Lebowa's finances since irregularities were uncovered in October last year. Mr Ramaphosa said the administrations of the self-governing territories would lapse on April 27. The Executive Council's action would assist the re-integration of Lebowa and its administration with the Northern Transvaal region. He rejected criticism that Mr Ramodike was receiving better treatment than homeland leaders opposed to the ANC. The Executive Council resolution was backed by the government.
