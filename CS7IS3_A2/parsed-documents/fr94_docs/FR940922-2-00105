FR940922-2-00105 FR940922-2-00071 Public Workshop on the Seismic Revisit of the Individual Plant Examination of External Events (IPEEE) for Severe Accident Vulnerabilities AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Notice of workshop and availability of Draft NRC report on Seismic Revisit of Individual Plant Examination of External Events (IPEEE). SUMMARY: The NRC plans to conduct a workshop to discuss the results of the seismic IPEEE revisit and solicit questions and comments. A draft report on the staff position is being prepared and will be available on October 7, 1994 at the NRC Public Document Room (PDR), Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC. DATES: October 21, 1994; 9:00&hyph;5:00. ADDRESSES: The NRC Auditorium, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852&hyph;2738. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John T. Chen, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555. Telephone (301) 415&hyph;6549. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 28, 1991 the NRC issued Generic Letter 88&hyph;20, Supplement 4, Individual Plant Examination of External Events (IPEEE) for Severe Accident Vulnerabilities, and NUREG&hyph;1407, Procedural and Submittal Guidance for IPEEE. The Generic Letter requested all licensees to perform an IPEEE to identify plant-specific vulnerabilities to severe accidents due to external events and report the results to the NRC. NUREG&hyph;1407 provides guidance for conducting the IPEEE. Key elements of the development of the IPEEE guidance included assigning earthquake review level and review scope for the seismic events. In this development, for central and eastern U.S. plants, the process of assigning plants to appropriate review categories has relied largely on the use of available seismic hazard results: those developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1989 and Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in 1989. However, grouping of the plants relied heavily on a grouping technique with a number of attributes using seismic hazard on a relative basis. In 1993, based on a re-elicitation of LLNL ground-motion and seismicity experts, revised seismic hazard results were issued in NUREG&hyph;1488. The revised mean hazard results are significantly lower than the 1989 LLNL results, and are much closer to the 1989 EPRI hazard results. These results prompted the NRC to revisit the seismic IPEEE program and consider the potential impact of the revised LLNL results. The Draft Report will be discussed during the workshop. A detailed agenda will be available on October 14, 1994 at the PDR. Members of licensees' staff who are involved in seismic IPEEE performance are encouraged to attend, along with other interested members of the public. Those persons who wish to make a brief presentation at the workshop, should indicate their desire to the contact listed above, so that they can be added to the agenda. Early notification is recommended since requests will be processed as they are received. Written comments will also be accepted up to 4 weeks following the workshop. Dated in Rockville, Maryland this 15th day of September 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Joseph Murphy, Acting Director, Division of Safety Issue Resolution, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23459 Filed 9&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
