The initiative group adopted an "Appeal to the Nation," which states that during the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party's (LDDP) one and a half years in power, production has experienced a catastrophic decline and privatization has satisfied only the interests of the former nomenklatura and of the criminal structures. The document also says that "the hopes for a spiritual rebirth of the nation are being frustrated, the society is drowning in alcohol, morals are declining, science, culture and education are being ignored." In the opinion of the authors of the appeal, "the only way to stop the disastrous LDDP rule is by holding the elections to the Seimas ahead of schedule. Such elections would establish a new relationship of political forces in the Lithuanian government and would invite conscientious, competent and determined representatives of the nation to the rudder of state." At a press conference that was held in the Seimas palace yesterday, the chairman of the Nationalist Association, R. Smetona, said that the other parties of the opposition are also talking about the harm caused by the LDDP administration, but until now nobody had decided to start a signature gathering action. In R. Smetona's opinion, it was possible to start collecting signatures on premature elections to the Seimas together with the action to collect signatures on the compensation of the people for their deposits, which was initiated by the Fatherland Association. According to the leader of the Nationalist Association, premature elections to the Seimas could take place simultaneously with the elections to the local administrative organs -- in February-March 1995. One of the participants at the press conference, the deputy chairman of the Democratic Party and member of Seimas, J. Tartilas, said that one hears representatives of the other opposition parties expressing their views that the Nationalist Association and the Democratic Party would allegedly lose the referendum, but, in his opinion, "when you are trying to save a drowning person, you cannot be guided by cheap considerations." When asked by LIETUVOS RYTAS to comment on the position of the Christian Democratic Party and of the Fatherland Association on the early elections (the KDP leaders having stated that they would not launch any action to collect signatures on the introduction of a referendum concerning the premature elections to the Seimas; and the Fatherland Association having made no such statement, but also making no plans so far to gather signatures), J. Tartilas said that "some imagine that one can be merely an observer, others are trying to latch on to something, are preparing programs." "However, I don't think that the cold status of an observer for the United Nations Organization is the best solution in this case," asserted the deputy chairman of the Democratic Party, J. Tartilas. R. Smetona said he did not think that one should comment on the principles of the other opposition parties. He expressed his conviction that the active part of the society would actively join in the signature collection action. Speaking about the results of the sociological polls, the leader of the Nationalist Association said that they did not predispose one for passivity or doing nothing. "The greatest crime and stupidity in this case is to do nothing, and such a position is absolutely unacceptable to us. The saying that 'we should wait until the idea of the early elections will ripen in the nation's depths and then we, politicians, will do something,' seems to lack seriousness for us. What will be the indication that the society has sufficiently matured already? We don't want this government to be swept away by force," R. Smetona said. In J. Tartilas' opinion, the structure of the electorate has not changed: 40 percent have supported the rightist opposition, and the same percentage --the LDDP. The outcome of the election was decided by the remaining 20 percent. We are hopeful that those 20 percent -- they are mostly from the rural areas, and I would call them soviet kolkhoz serfs, have regained some of their eyesight and have started thinking. A reminder: a proposal on early elections to the Seimas by 26 members of the Seimas representing the parliamentary opposition of the right was registered at the Seimas secretariat on April 15 (meanwhile, there are 6 members of the Seimas in the Democratic Party and the Fatherland Association factions). But so far nobody has suggested that this proposal be put on the agenda of the Seimas sessions. When asked to comment on this new initiative of the Democratic Party and the Nationalist Association, the chairman of the LDDP faction at the Seimas, Justinas Karosas, said that these parties are thus trying to draw attention to themselves, but that will help neither the state nor themselves. "I don't see what's so bad to require an early election," Justinas Karosas said.
