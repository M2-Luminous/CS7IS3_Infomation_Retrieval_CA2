This year, the Agency has over DM53 billion at its disposal for this purpose, said General Director Jan-Baldem Mennicken at the International Air and Space Exhibition in Berlin. The task of the Agency, which cooperates closely with the German Air and Space Travel Research Institute, is to preserve and coordinate space travel-related activity in the former GDR. Apart from Jena-Optronic GmbH, which used to be a part of the Zeiss Jena complex and now belongs to German Aerospace, the Agency also supports an entire range of medium and small east German enterprises that are engaged primarily in the manfacture of smaller satellites, measuring equipment, and geophysical research. One of these enterprises is FMP Space Sensor GmbH in Freiberg, Saxony, which produces small satellites. The Neubrandenburg firm GTA, which is engaged in measurement and geophysics, was founded by scientists from the former GDR Space Research Institute in 1991. With the German Space Agency's help, these enterprises should also be permitted access to large European space projects.
