But unlike Thailand and Indonesia, Vietnam does not want that country's exceptionally fragile natural environment to pay the price for it. They want tight supervision of the rapidly dwindling forests. Logging permits are restricted and scientists have recently found promising new ways of halting the rapid advance of erosion. The size of Norway, mountainous Vietnam is losing over 160,000 hectares a year of virgin forest. While the forests are being threatened more and more with commercial logging, forest use by ordinary people is a basic problem, according to Vo Quyn, professor of forestry at Hanoi University. Eighty percent of Vietnam's 70 million inhabitants still live in rural areas. Arable fields are in short supply. As the population grows, the slash-and-burn agriculture employed especially by the ethnic minorities that live in the mountain regions is becoming a problem. Whereas after farming it for a few years, a cleared and burned field used to be left for at least 10 years to revert to forestland, now new farmers come to clear the land again within as little as 3-5 years because there is no other unoccupied land. When forestland does not have time enough to properly reforest itself, erosion sets in. According to Prof. Quyn, 13 million of Vietnam's total of 32 million hectares are already devastated because of erosion. Pond in Center of Ecological Village Vo Quyn, who heads the Faculty of Natural Resources and Environmental Affairs at the University of Hanoi, is Vietnam's ecology veteran. After the Vietnam War, the country's forests were caught up in an ecological catastrophe. Seventy million liters of environmental toxins had been scattered over the land. In the 1970's Prof. Vo Quyn set out in earnest to look for a village model that would get the aborigines, who were used to moving on [after exhausting a piece of land], to remain in their areas and work the forests and fields of the mountainous areas in an enduring manner. After years of experiments and errors, Vo found the ideal village model. Fruit trees are planted near the house and fast-growing trees from which people get their firewood on the upper slopes. Villagers can cultivate their own crops, tea, rice, and vegetables, between the forest stands. In the center of the village is the heart of the idea, a pond that produces water for both people and plants and guarantees fish for the villagers' tables. ``The only way to get people to protect the environment they live in is to make it useful to them. People need food and money,'' Vo said. Vo's model is now being applied in many provinces. Nearly as much new forest is being planted in these areas as is being logged. In January the Vietnam National Assembly passed the country's first package of environmental laws. It contains strict rules according to which business firms are obligated to assess the impact of their operations on the environment and their use of natural resources. Prof. Vo, who participated in the drafting of these laws, is particularly pleased. ``Now we have a foundation on which to base ourselves. While the new laws are not yet very detailed, they afford government officials the possibility of monitoring the use of natural resources better than they could before.'' The laws are also of help in connection with Vietnam's latest environmental problem, the dumping of waste. At the start of the year, a Vietnamese food company asked customs officials for permission to import ``a 61-container lot of miscellaneous assorted plastic products'' into the country. However, the shipment vanished and after only a few weeks the cargo was found in a suburban development near Ho Chi Minh: 1,114 tons of dirty, used plastic bags. They had planned to burn the plastic waste or bury it. The officials, however, ordered the shipment to be sent back to its country of origin -- Germany.
