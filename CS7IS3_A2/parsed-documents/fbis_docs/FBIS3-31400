Vasile Chirculescu, deputy director-general of the Targu-Jiu Autonomous Public corporation told a ROMPRES coresspondent that in each of the three days of strike 100,000 tonnes of lignite and brown coal were extracted in each of the three coal field whose miners are on strike. The quantities sent to power stations during the strike stood at more than 90 percent of those supplied before the strike started. "The strike is not legal," said Chirculescu, "that's why we filed a lawsuit against the strikers' leaders and asked that the case be considered an emergency. The public corporation does not have enough money to solve the strikers' claims." Coal power stations had around 2.4 million tonnes of coal in store Wednesday, February 16. The situation was critical at the stations Oradea 1 and 2, Suceava, Iasi and Arad, to which additional amounts of coal were sent.
