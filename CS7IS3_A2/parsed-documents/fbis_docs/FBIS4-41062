The resolution was supported by 246 deputies and opposed by 6, with 9 abstentions. It is expected to be adopted in the evening. The draft resolution says that the decree seriously limits the constitutional rights and liberties of Russian citizens without due reasons, and is at variance with the Constitution and a number of articles of the Criminal Code. It also says that the Constitution and the federal laws have supreme status in the entire territory of the Russian Federation and that the Supreme Court must be guided by the Constitution and the current laws in handling specific cases. The vote followed a report by head of the security committee Viktor Ilyukhin of the Communist faction who said the presidential decree was in breach of as many as eight articles in the federal Constitution. He said the measure derailed criminal legislation and suspended the existing Criminal Code. For his part, head of the administration's human rights commission Sergey Kovalyev said that "we have once again run into a situation where government departments write laws for themselves." He spoke of having evidence that the decree was initialled by heads of the Interior Ministry and Federal Counterintelligence Service (FSK). First Deputy Interior Minister Mikhail Yegorov admitted to being one of the decree's authors and pledged to be personally responsible for carrying it out. He called for approving the paper and gave reassurances that any police action would be monitored by prosecuting bodies. Presidential representative in the Federal Assembly Aleksandr Yakovlev also called to approve the decree. He said President Yeltsin was seeking to do his best to crack down on gangsters and ensure guarantees against police tyranny. The president plans to send a bill on amendments to the Criminal Code next week, Yakovlev said. He said the decree would not be workable unless the law enforcement agencies came up with rules on how to implement it, and offered deputies to join a working group on this matter.
