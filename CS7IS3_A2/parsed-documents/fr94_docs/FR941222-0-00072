(a) It shall be the duty of the administrative law judge to inquire fully into the facts as to whether the respondent has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice affecting commerce as set forth in the complaint or amended complaint. The administrative law judge shall have authority, with respect to cases assigned to him, between the time he is designated and transfer of the case to the Board, subject to the Rules and Regulations of the Board and within its powers: (1) To administer oaths and affirmations; (2) To grant applications for subpoenas; (3) To rule upon petitions to revoke subpoenas; (4) To rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant evidence; (5) To take or cause depositions to be taken whenever the ends of justice would be served thereby; (6) To regulate the course of the hearing and, if appropriate or necessary, to exclude persons or counsel from the hearing for contemptuous conduct and to strike all related testimony of witnesses refusing to answer any proper question; (7) To hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of the issues by consent of the parties, but not to adjust cases; (8) To dispose of procedural requests, motions, or similar matters, including motions referred to the administrative law judge by the Regional Director and motions for summary judgment or to amend pleadings; also to dismiss complaints or portions thereof; to order hearings reopened; and upon motion order proceedings consolidated or severed prior to issuance of administrative law judge decisions; (9) To approve a stipulation voluntarily entered into by all parties to the case which will dispense with a verbatim written transcript of record of the oral testimony adduced at the hearing, and which will also provide for the waiver by the respective parties of their right to file with the Board exceptions to the findings of fact (but not to conclusions of law or recommended orders) which the administrative law judge shall make in his decisions; (10) To make and file decisions, including bench decisions delivered within 72 hours after conclusion of oral argument, in conformity with Public Law 89&hyph;554, 5 U.S.C. 557; (11) To call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses and to introduce into the record documentary or other evidence; (12) To request the parties at any time during the hearing to state their respective positions concerning any issue in the case or theory in support thereof; (13) To take any other action necessary under the foregoing and authorized by the published Rules and Regulations of the Board. (b) Upon the request of any party or the judge assigned to hear a case, or on his or her own motion, the chief administrative law judge in Washington, DC, the deputy chief judge in San Francisco, the associate chief judge in Atlanta, or the associate chief judge in New York may assign a judge who shall be other than the trial judge to conduct settlement negotiations. In exercising his or her discretion, the chief, deputy chief, or associate chief judge making the assignment will consider, among other factors, whether there is reason to believe that resolution of the dispute is likely, the request for assignment of a settlement judge is made in good faith, and the assignment is otherwise feasible. Provided, however, that no such assignment shall be made absent the agreement of all parties to the use of this procedure. (1) The settlement judge shall convene and preside over conferences and settlement negotiations between the parties, assess the practicalities of a potential settlement, and report to the chief, deputy, or associate the status of settlement negotiations, recommending continuation or termination of the settlement negotiations. Where feasible, settlement conferences shall be held in person. (2) The settlement judge may require that the attorney or other representative for each party be present at settlement conferences and that the parties or agents with full settlement authority also be present or available by telephone. (3) Participation of the settlement judge shall terminate upon the order of the chief, deputy, or associates issued after consultation with the settlement judge. The conduct of settlement negotiations shall not unduly delay the hearing. (4) All discussions between the parties and the settlement judge shall be confidential. The settlement judge shall not discuss any aspect of the case with the trial judge, and no evidence regarding statements, conduct, offers of settlement, and concessions of the parties made in proceedings before the settlement judge shall be admissible in any proceeding before the Board, except by stipulation of the parties. Documents disclosed in the settlement process may not be used in litigation unless voluntarily produced or obtained pursuant to subpoena. (5) No decision of a chief, deputy, or associate concerning the assignment of a settlement judge or the termination of a settlement judge's assignment shall be appealable to the Board.
