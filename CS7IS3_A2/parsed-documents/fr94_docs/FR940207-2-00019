The Commission reserves the right to require a further showing that neither public or private interests will be adversely affected by continued approval of Howell Power's issuances of securities or assumptions of liability. Notice is hereby given that the deadline for filing motions to intervene or protests, as set forth above, is February 14, 1994.
