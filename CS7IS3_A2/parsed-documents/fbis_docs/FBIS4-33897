"The main objectives were achieved," Mexican Ambassador Carlos Tello Macias told NOTIMEX this Monday, shortly after the Mexican Air Force airplane carrying Salinas to the fourth Ibero-American Summit in Colombia took off. Castro saw off the Mexican president at the foot of the stairs of the presidential plane, which left at 1720 (2120 GMT) after a brief drizzle. Salinas raised his arms from the top of the stairs to say goodbye to the high-ranking officials who saw him off at the Jose Marti Airport. "Two sister peoples underscored their friendship and their deep and close relations," Tello said regarding the less than six-hour stay by the fourth Mexican president to visit Cuba since 1975. "The two presidents discussed various topics of common interest and addressed broader aspects of international affairs. In addition to the talks, the visit achieved concrete results," the diplomat added. Tello said Mexico and Cuba achieved progress in the project for joint investments and joint enterprises (such as the agreement on telecommunications), adding "all of this always helps to strengthen bilateral ties." Despite the brevity of the visit, Salinas carried out the scheduled agenda, which included an official lunch with Castro, talks between the two statesmen, a news conference, and a reception at the Mexican Embassy in Havana. Most of his visit centered on talks with President Castro, with whom he discussed the broad range of bilateral relations in the political, economic, trade, cultural, and scientific-technical cooperation fields.
