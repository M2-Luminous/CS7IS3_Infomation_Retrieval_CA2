She said that the last four governments agreed fully on this issue, and that all were united on it. She also asked the United States to review its decision on the use of the Pressler Amendment against Pakistan, and the unfair treatment that was practiced over the last several years. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto made this announcement at a time when her statement, in which she had earlier admitted that Pakistan's nuclear program was frozen at the July 1990 level, was being discussed in political, journalistic, and intellectual circles. This happened during her previous administration. Later, however, even after an explanation by a federal spokesperson, Benazir Bhutto's comment became a subject of criticism and analysis. Now that she has very loudly and clearly told editors from around the country that the nuclear program will be continued, popular opinion will definitely be positively affected, and it will also help in correcting the records. Still, the opposition insists (actually accuses) that Madam Bhutto's earlier statement was not just a statement, but an admission. Still, this question is very important, and it requires an explanation: who committed the condemnable act of freezing the peaceful nuclear program, which symbolizes our nation's security and pride, at the July 1990 level? We do not have to elaborate on the fact that the United States of America and European nations openly provide technology, advice, equipment, and other things to nuclear programs all over the world, earning billions of dollars in doing so. The nuclear programs of Israel, India, Japan, Argentina, and South Africa come under this category. But they do not object to these programs. If there are any objections in this context, they are limited to opposition to the Islamic world, and Pakistan is a chosen target, because Iraq's military and nuclear capabilities were destroyed in the Gulf war. The U.S. opposition to Pakistan has reached the point where it does not give permission to Pakistani students in the United States to register for classes in nuclear technology and related subjects. Military and economic aid to Pakistan was stopped three years ago under the notorious Pressler Amendment. The F-16 planes, which were already paid for according to the agreement, were not supplied to us, and even some U.S. circles have admitted that Washington's unfair treatment of Pakistan has now reached extremes. Soon after Benazir Bhutto's statements in July 1990 about freezing the nuclear program, we received news from Washington which clearly and simply indicated that the Pressler Amendment will end now. Michael McCurry, a U.S. State Department spokesman, went as far as implying that aid to Pakistan would be reinstated. Benazir herself has said, "We cannot get rid of the Pressler Amendment without rolling back our program." Against this background, a worrisome question emerges. How can the Pressler Amendment, which was very effective until a few days ago, suddenly become useless? Why has the White House decided to take it back? What are the circumstances that have forced the United States, even after seeing the Kahuta plant in operation, to reinstate aid to Pakistan? In this context, the concern of our fellow citizens that there is something suspicious about the present nuclear policy is valid (to an extent). We believe that Madam Benazir Bhutto should complete her five-year term in the Prime Minister's house, because this is necessary to encourage democratic institutions and stability. We cannot help any effort to shake up her government without any reason. But it is the duty of Benazir Bhutto to remove all the doubts and skepticism about the present government's intention to make some agreement with the United States over the nuclear program, which has resulted in good will messages from Washington. We want to tell Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in loud, clear, and direct words that if she rolls back our nuclear program, she herself will be rolled back!
