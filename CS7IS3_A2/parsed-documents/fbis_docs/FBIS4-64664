[Martino] I received a telephone call from one of my teachers in Chicago, who told me: "People will say that you belong to the `Chicago boy's' government, but you must be realistic and acknowledge that you are now, by virtue of your age, a `Chicago man.'" [Statera] That is amusing, Mr. Martino, but there is also a real problem: You formulated an election program based on extreme economic liberalism, but now the prime minister-designate is engaging in consultations for all he is worth. What is your opinion of his meetings with the so-called social partners? [Martino] Bad, very bad: How could I deny it? I cannot approve of consultations with the social partners. An advocate of economic liberalism such as myself cannot accept the very idea of pay trends being determined from the top. That would be an abandonment of my principles. [Statera] And so? [Martino] So I am reassured by the fact that consultations of this kind will make no difference, insofar as pay trends will violate any ceiling. Pay trends do not honor agreements. [Statera] What do you man? [Martino] That if a firm is doing well, nobody can prevent it from increasing wages above the set ceilings. [Statera] What would your friends in Chicago say about Berlusconi's consultations? [Martino] That whatever does no harm is tolerable. In this specific instance, it is an old ritual of give and take that is tolerable if we succeed in achieving the harmony essential for creating the conditions for development. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a free lunch. [Statera] As Friedman said? [Martino] No, the attribution to Friedman is a common one, but mistaken. Do you know who said it? An Italian emigre in the United States. What he said was more or less this: "This is a great country but it does not give any free lunches." [Statera] If that is so, does it mean that there are no free lunches for Mr. Berlusconi, either? [Martino] Precisely. There are no free lunches for anyone. [Statera] Has the lunch been paid for? [Martino] It is my opinion that pledges must be honored. But then there must be no more consultations, with the rationale of the grand three-way agreements. The government is not an arbiter between the social partners; it simply establishes the rules. Then employers and trade unions can reach their own agreements. [Statera] Pardon me, Mr. Martino, you will be a minister in a government whose likely prime minister is already following ideological guidelines with which you do not agree. Do you consider that normal? [Martino] It seems to me that in this instance it is an acceptable compromise, and the word "compromise" applies more to me than to Berlusconi, because he has always spoken to me about his desire to engage in dialogue with the social partners. However, I am of course talking personally; I am stating my opinions, and I reaffirm that not everything can be negotiated with the social partners. [Statera] If you continue to say one thing and your colleagues another, does this not pose a danger to the prime minister? [Martino] Mr. Berlusconi has asked me to make it clear when I am talking in a personal capacity and illustrating my own opinions, which is what I am doing now. Many of us are new to politics, but for this very reason I foresee an attitude of great cooperation. [Statera] Berlusconi too is new to active politics, but he is displaying wonderful qualities as a Doroteo. Do you remember the Santa Dorotea convent at which that Christian Democratic faction was formed? [Martino] I think it is not Doroteism, but an inevitable compromise, the price to be paid for the first lunch. Berlusconi has been infected by the political virus more severely than you can imagine. He would even be willing to sell everything as long as he could engage in politics. [Statera] Pardon me, Mr. Martino, but we have an even worse suspicion -- namely, that you have been diverted from economics to foreign policy because the government's line will not actually be so committed to economic liberalism, because your policies will be set aside somewhat, because -- if I may be permitted to say so -- some people perhaps believe that less harm can be done at the Foreign Ministry. [Martino] Do you mean that I will be given the Foreign Ministry as a way of rendering me harmless? [Statera] More or less. [Martino] Well, I deny that absolutely: I willingly agreed to the suggestion of the Foreign Ministry, and I consider it a very prominent position. [Martino] Will the Berlusconi government not align with the economic policy of the Amato and Ciampi governments, more out of necessity than out of conviction? [Statera] I really hope that this does not happen, and indeed I am certain of it: You cannot increase revenue without working on the decisionmaking rules affecting expenditure. [Martino] Be that as it may, you will be at the Foreign Ministry. [Martino] Yes, and very gladly. At present I am doing my homework, examining the unresolved issues. They are alarmingly numerous and difficult.
