Rong made the remarks at a meeting with visiting Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva here today. Developing a closer Sino-Portuguese relationship conforms to the aspirations and interests of the two peoples, Rong said. "It is our hope that the two countries will make concerted efforts to open up new areas for cooperation," he added. Rong noted that at present China enjoys political stability and fast economic growth while the legal system and the investment environment are being further improved. More Portuguese entrepreneurs are welcome to China to do business or invest, he said. Silva said that as soon as he arrived in China he was accorded a warm reception by the Chinese Government and people. He described his talks with Chinese Premier Li Peng as "fruitful", which he said had boosted his confidence in expanding trade and bilateral economic ties. Silva expressed the belief that the two sides will continue their good cooperation in implementing the Sino-Portuguese joint declaration on the question of Macao. He said Portuguese entrepreneurs have shown great interest in China's market, hoping that bilateral economic ties and trade will be as good as the political ties.
