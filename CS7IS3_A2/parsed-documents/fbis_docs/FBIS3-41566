Under the 10-year basic plan for environmental conservation, prepared by the Environment Ministry, the ministry will designate more than 40 percent of the virgin forest, woods and grassy plains in Korea ``green track of land conservation areas'' and more than 20 places rich in indigenous flora and fauna will be named ``natural ecosystem protection areas.'' Under the plan, the ministry will put forth an optimum ``per capita ratio of urban green areas'' and will, based thereon, work out area-by-area master plans for the expansion of green areas. The plan also calls for the creation of a national pavilion for preservation of biological resources at 40 billion won (44 million U.S. dollars) to house about 10 million specimens, and to set up a biological variety research institute. The plan also includes a project to study and manage the natural environment of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) jointly with North Korea.
