The group has convened in Addis Ababa for the past three days and has decided to intensify the armed struggle to, I quote, overthrow the dictatorship. This latest move represents a shift in strategy since these opponents had advocated a dialogue with the authorities during their last meetings. Ghislaine Dupont asked Mohamed Ahmed Issa, president of the Opposition Front, the reasons for this shift. [Begin Issa recording] All of the proposals we made to Hassan Gouled's government led to nothing. We, and our FRUD [Front for the Restoration of Unity and Decocracy] allies, have come here to discuss the new strategy to be adopted. Since Hassan Gouled's will not understand and rejects all proposals and solutions for a dialogue, we have decided to spread the struggle throughout the entire national territory. We have decided to adopt this solution. Therefore, the intensification of the armed struggle will be carried out by the [word indistinct] wing, that is by (?FRUD) and the (?FFD). As far as we are concerned, we are the political wing; we will join the other opposition to carry out our political action within the country, so we did not come here to take refuge in (?Addis Ababa).
