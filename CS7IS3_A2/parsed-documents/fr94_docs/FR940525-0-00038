FR940525-0-00038 FR940525-0-00021 II. Legislation Concerning Electronic Reporting On December 22, 1987, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;203, was enacted. Section 4007 of Public Law 100&hyph;203, which was subsequently amended by section 411(b)(6) of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;360, added section 1886(f)(1)(B) of the Act, which sets forth several provisions concerning the reporting of hospital information under the Medicare program. Section 1886(f)(1)(B) of the Act applies to hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1989. Section 1886(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Act provides that the Secretary will place into effect a standardized electronic cost reporting format for hospitals under Medicare. This standardized electronic cost reporting format does not require any additional data from hospitals. Section 1886(f)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act provides that the Secretary may delay or waive the implementation of the electronic format in instances where such implementation would result in financial hardship for a hospital. As an example of a financial hardship situation, this section of the Act specifically mentions hospitals with a small percentage of inpatients entitled to Medicare benefits. III. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations On August 19, 1991, we published a proposed rule (56 FR 41110) to implement sections 1886(f)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of the Act. We proposed that cost reports be submitted in a standardized electronic format. The hospital's cost report software must be able to produce a standardized output file in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format. All intermediaries have the ability to read this standardized file and produce an accurate cost report. The proposed rule did not require the reporting of any additional information. If a hospital refuses to submit the cost reports electronically, Medicare payments to that hospital may be suspended under the provisions of sections 1815(a) and 1833(e) of the Act. As explained above, sections 1815(a) and 1833(e) of the Act provide that no Medicare payments will be made to a hospital unless it has furnished the information, requested by the Secretary, needed to determine the amount of payments due the hospital under the Medicare program. Section 405.371(d) provides for suspension of Medicare payments to a hospital by the intermediary if the hospital has failed to submit information requested by the intermediary that is needed to determine the amount due the hospital under Medicare. The general procedures that are followed when Medicare payment to a hospital is suspended for failure to submit information that is needed by the intermediary to determine Medicare payment (that is, when a hospital fails to furnish a cost report, furnishes an incomplete cost report, fails to furnish other needed information, or fails to submit a cost report electronically) are located in section 2231 of the Intermediary Manual (HCFA Pub. 13). These procedures include timeframes for ``demand letters'' to hospitals, which in addition to reminding hospitals to file timely and complete cost reports, explain possible adjustments of Medicare payments to a hospital and the right to request a 30-day extension of the due date. If a hospital believes that implementation of the electronic submission requirement would cause a financial hardship, the hospital should submit a written request for a waiver or a delay of these requirements, with supporting documentation, to the hospital's intermediary. IV. Discussion of Public Comments In response to the proposed rule, we received six timely items of correspondence. We have summarized the comments and are presenting them below with our responses.
