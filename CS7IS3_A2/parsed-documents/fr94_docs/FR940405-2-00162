FR940405-2-00162 FR940405-2-00068 20. The Companies may deduct any applicable premium tax from gross purchase payments. The Companies reserve the right, however, to deduct any applicable aggregate premium taxes paid on behalf of a particular Contract from the Contract value upon full or partial surrender or on the Annuity Date. 21. The Companies assess no charge for the first twelve transfers in each Contract Year, and will assess a $25 charge for each subsequent transfer request made by the Contract owner during a single Contract Year. The Companies do not count transfers made in connection with dollar cost averaging in determining whether to impose the $25 transfer charge. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an exemption from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts. 2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, as herein pertinent, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales loads) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services. 3. Applicants submit that the Companies are entitled to reasonable compensation for their assumption of mortality and expense risks. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% assessed under the Contracts is consistent with the protection of investors because they are reasonable and proper insurance charges. In this regard, Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is reasonable to compensate the Companies for the risks that: (i) annuitants under the Contracts will live longer as a group than has been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts; (ii) the Contract value will be less than the death benefit; and (iii) administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the administrative charges. 4. The Companies represent that the charges for mortality and expense risks assumed by them are within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. This representation is based upon the Companies' analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. The Companies will maintain at their respective administrative offices, available to the Commission, memoranda setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, their comparative surveys. 5. Applicants acknowledge that the surrender charges may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts. Applicants also acknowledge that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charges, all or a portion of such profit may be viewed by the Commission as being offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the sales charge. The Companies have concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Accounts and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusions are set forth in memoranda which will be maintained by the Companies at their respective administrative offices and will be available to the Commission. 6. The Companies also represent that the Accounts will only invest in management investment companies which undertake, in the event such an investment company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, to have a board of directors (or trustees), a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, formulate and approve any such plan under Rule 12b-1. Conclusion Applicants assert that, for the reasons set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts meet the standards of Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest, and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
