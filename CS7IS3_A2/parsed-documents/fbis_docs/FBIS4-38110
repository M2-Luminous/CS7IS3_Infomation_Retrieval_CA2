Was this an ideological or merely political alliance? [Al-Hudaybi] We first raised the slogan "Islam is the solution" during the 1984 election, which some Muslim Brotherhood members contested. Since then we have committed ourselves to this slogan as a concise declaration of the basic principle or ideology in which we believe. As for the alliance involving the Brotherhood, the SLP, and the Liberal Party in the 1987 election, we all raised the same slogan and formulated a platform of 10 basic points, which were more elaborately explained in leaflets later. The SLP, the Liberal Party, and the Brotherhood contested the election as a triple alliance and on the basis of the platform just mentioned. We raised the slogan "Islam is the solution." From this you can see that our alliance with the SLP was both ideological and political. In our Islamic faith there is no distinction between religion and politics. Islam is both a religion and a state. [Raghib] Does the SLP-Muslim Brotherhood alliance still exist or has it been dissolved? [Al-Hudaybi] The Brotherhood is still allied with the SLP. We are working, coordinating, and consulting with them. Brotherhood members feel that the SLP's commitment to the alliance continues. We welcome the alliance because it is actually a form of dialogue, consultation, and exchange of views over various political, economic, and social issues of interest to the public. The dialogue depends on circumstances and the needs of the parties. It is not limited to specific dates or times. [Raghib] A Brotherhood faction is reportedly operating within the SLP rank and file. How true is this? [Al-Hudaybi] This is a point we always stress; the Brotherhood has its own independent organization and has never joined the organizations of other political parties except in extraordinary circumstances. I will not speak of these now. At the same time the SLP has its own structures and organizations as a political party. It is not my business to discuss them here. I have already explained that we and the SLP have an alliance that we seek to preserve. We are joined under one banner--"Islam is the solution." [Raghib] The society "Young Egypt," which operated before the [1952] revolution and later became the SLP, had relations with the Brotherhood, which involved agreements and disagreements. What are the parameters of the SLP and the Brotherhood relationship today? [Al-Hudaybi] "Young Egypt's" relations with the Brotherhood in those days fluctuated between extreme closeness and extreme disagreement. This issue belongs to history. Current political, economic, and social conditions are very different. This change in circumstances has been fundamental and many of the SLP and our own positions have changed. The saying has it that everything happens in its own good time. [Raghib] A few months ago there was an uproar in connection with the SLP's plan to represent the Brotherhood at the National Dialogue Congress. What was the result? [Al-Hudaybi] The SLP never intended to represent the Brotherhood or speak on its behalf at the National Dialogue Congress. SLP leader Ibrahim Shukri made this clear during an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM. He said: "The SLP will never represent the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood has the right to have its own representatives." The Brotherhood has its own status and can represent itself anywhere anytime. But we welcome any consultations or meetings with the SLP. I must make it clear that it is out of the question for the SLP to represent the Brotherhood at the National Dialogue Congress or any other forum. [Raghib] Will there be some form of coordination or alliance between the SLP and the Brotherhood in the next parliamentary election? [Al-Hudaybi] No one knows what form the next election will take. We have heard rumors that it will be held in accordance with the list system. Then we heard denials. We also heard that it would adopt a mixed list-and-independent-candidate system. When the election draws near things will become clearer. Then the existing security, political, and economic conditions can be evaluated. We can decide then whether we want to coordinate or forge an alliance with the SLP or do something else. Likewise the SLP can decide on these issues. It is difficult for Brotherhood and SLP leaders to make decisions on this affair right now. [Raghib] You joined the Muslim Brotherhood in raising the slogan "Islam is the solution" during the 1987 People's Assembly election campaign. Was this an ideological or merely political alliance? [Murad] Our alliance with the Brotherhood is merely political and its purpose was to participate jointly in the election battle. But this alliance continued--it still does--even after joint participation in the election to the People's Assembly ended. This does not mean the programs of the SLP and the Brotherhood are identical. The alliance is based on specific published points but the detailed programs of the SLP and the Brotherhood are not identical. Otherwise the agreement would had been a merger, not an alliance, which would have required a word-for-word and detailed agreement on every aspect of the practical application of the two sides' views and their understanding of the application of Islamic teaching in every aspect of life. We cannot say this exists or has been achieved. Thus it becomes clear that our alliance with the Brotherhood is, as I said, political, not ideological. [Raghib] Does the SLP-Muslim Brotherhood alliance still exist or has it been dissolved? [Murad] Nothing has happened to warrant dissolving the alliance with the Brotherhood, that is, nothing has happened to our respect for the clauses of our political accord with the Brotherhood to warrant such action. Thus the alliance between the SLP and the Brotherhood still exists, but on the basis of political cooperation only. This alliance is proceeding within the framework of the points of the declared alliance; the SLP's internal affairs are not bound by it. As long as no disagreements occur over the application of any of the agreement's clauses, as long as there are no clashes over declared public stances, and as long as the stances do not change, then the alliance as I described it still exists. [Raghib] A Brotherhood faction is reportedly operating within the SLP rank and file. How true is this? [Murad] This allegation is made for a malicious purpose, which seeks to claim that there is a full merger between the SLP and the Brotherhood. The truth of the issue is that each one of us is keen to respect the independent identity of the other. As proof of this, when Brotherhood candidates won in the 1987 election on the SLP list they had the right to attend the SLP's higher committee meetings in their capacity as members of the SLP's parliamentary caucus. But they did not attend these meetings so as not to create any ambiguity. They restricted themselves to attending the parliamentary caucus meetings in the People's Assembly. We have no thought of including Brotherhood members in the SLP's organizations. Both parties have their own political views and the desire to maintain independence. No party should be responsible for the other party's behavior. [Raghib] The society "Young Egypt," which operated before the [1952] revolution and later became the SLP, had relations with the Brotherhood, which involved agreements and disagreements. What are the parameters of the SLP and the Brotherhood relationship today? [Murad] The SLP and the Brotherhood were bound together by the Islamic tendency and the belief that abiding by correct Islamic teaching would achieve whatever is best for Egypt and all its sects. It is the same tendency now. Occasional disagreements or the absence of an identity of views and policies do not spoil the general trend and do not justify clashes or divisions in the circumstances. The same situation existed before the revolution between "Young Egypt" and the Brotherhood and fierce clashes took place between the two as a result of their different attitudes and ideas. But such disagreements--today and in the past--are not so grave or vital as to lead to hostility and clashes. [Raghib] A few months ago there was an uproar in connection with the SLP's plan to represent the Brotherhood at the National Dialogue Congress. What was the result? [Murad] It was never said that the SLP could represent the "Brotherhood." It is known that both the SLP and the Brotherhood have their own independence and political identity. To avoid official objection to the Brotherhood being represented in the dialogue as a recognized group, the SLP proposed letting this trend be represented by "Muslim Brothers" in their capacity as public figures who have their own views and ideas about society. It was merely a suggestion aimed at removing the embarrassment in which the various parties found themselves. There was a misunderstanding of the aims behind the SLP's proposal. There was no indication that the SLP intended to represent the Brotherhood. [Raghib] Will there be some form of coordination or alliance between the SLP and the Brotherhood in the next parliamentary election? [Murad] We have not discussed this before, neither inside the SLP nor with the Brotherhood. It is too early for that. There must first be an understanding on fighting the next election before the issue of coordination and alliance is studied, because it is known that the opposition parties -- with the exception of the National Progressive Unionist Grouping Party -- and the Brotherhood boycotted the last election. The issue depends on ensuring the honesty of the election so that participation will be serious. If this does happen then we are open to the possibility of coordination and an alliance with the Brotherhood if they ask for it. We might also ask them to do so if we believe that coordination and an alliance with them will serve the national interest and public objectives. This applies to any other political party, not just the Brotherhood.
