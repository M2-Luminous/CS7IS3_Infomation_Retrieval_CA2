All news agencies have been informed that Russian military units, which are due to take up positions between the warring sides' armed formations in the next two-three days, have started moving into Abkhazia. Reports on the specific timing of the introduction of peacemakers started circulating after the Federation Council, at its 21 June sitting behind closed doors, adopted a decision on the use of Russian troops in peacekeeping operations in Abkhazia and ratified the relevant presidential edict. According to Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, the military perceived this decision as an order to act. In fact, the Russian military have been in action in Abkhazia since August 1992. On the eve of the official introduction of peacemakers in the conflict zone, it would be apt to recall that military pilots from Russian Air Force subunits based at Gudauta airfield and servicemen from the 345th Airborne Assault Regiment transferred from Ganja to Gudauta have been inside this zone since the very start of the Georgian-Abkhazian war. For almost two years they have performed the functions of peacemakers: Transporting people out of the fire zone, helping thousands of refugees, and -- mainly -- restraining the adversaries by their presence and preventing them from applying scorched-earth tactics. At present the soldiers and officers of the 345th Airborne Assault Regiment, together with paratroopers from the Volga and Leningrad Military Districts, are preparing to take up positions along the Inguri River. Incidentally, the movement of paratroopers, military construction personnel, sappers, communications specialists, and their equipment to Gudauta had already started by the end of May (TRUD reported this in its 2 June 1994 issue). The first subunits arrived in Abkhazia at that time for the purpose of carrying out serious preparatory work -- deploying the staff of the peacemaking forces and their control and command posts, organizing communications, defusing tens of thousands of mines and demolition charges, repairing eight bridges.... All the signs indicated that the Russian peacemakers intend to deploy in Abkhazia and the border region of western Georgia in depth and for a long time. Even a press center has been set up for the Russian peacemaking forces. Its staffers said that preparatory work has been almost completed and checkpoints will soon start operating on the highway bridge across the Inguri River along which the Georgian-Abkhazian border runs and which, until very recently, has been the dividing line between the adversaries. There are plans to set up a total of 50 permanent Army checkpoints in the conflict zone. The total number of Russian "blue helmets" in Abkhazia will reach 3,000 men. If truth be said, the Federation Council's decision to use Russian troops in peacekeeping operations was accepted as a necessary formality in Sukhumi. Nobody here had any doubt that the decision would be positive, seeing that the plan for the separation of the sides and the introduction of "blue helmets" was already being practically implemented by 21 June. In accordance with this plan, elaborated and agreed by the Abkhazian and Georgian military with mediation from Russian Defense Ministry officers, the region along the Inguri River is declared a security zone. The zone is 24 km wide (12 km on each side of the river). All armed formations, together with their combat equipment of course, will be completely withdrawn from the zone. The Georgian and Abkhazian positions will come under the peacemaking forces' control. The plan provides that areas adjacent to the security zone will be restricted armaments zones -- areas where the adversaries' military units may be stationed but without heavy combat equipment. Thus, once the "blue helmets" have been introduced, the warring sides will find themselves at a distance in excess of the maximum fire range of the most powerful artillery systems at their disposal. The problem of the Kodor Gorge, the scene of heavy fighting on several occasions this year, has been resolved and, hopefully, permanently: Under the plan for the separation of the sides, all Georgian formations in the gorge will be withdrawn outside Abkhazia, while regular patrols by peacemakers and UN military observers will operate in population centers along the banks of the Kodor River. What will the Russian paratroopers be doing in Abkhazia? Major General Vasiliy Yakushev, commander of peacemaking operations in the conflict zone, explained that the tasks facing the peacemakers stem from the Agreement on Cease-Fire and Separation of the Sides, which was signed by representatives of Georgia, Abkhazia, Russia, and the United Nations in Moscow 14 June. The document clearly states that the peacemakers' task is to monitor the unconditional observance of the cease-fire. In the event of threatened attack against peacemaking subunits, and especially in the event of direct attack, they have the right to take appropriate self-defense measures. Of course, one of the main purposes of the introduction of peacemaking forces in Abkhazia is to create conditions for the return of refugees and displaced persons to the republic. So far, however, the refugees who are impatiently awaiting permission to return home, have no cause to rejoice: The finer details of the procedure for registration and repatriation of people have yet to be worked out. In my view, the commission whose task it is to tackle the problems of the refugees' repatriation will encounter serious complications: I saw no vacant homes during my visit to Galskiy Rayon. They are occupied by people whose homes have been destroyed. Where will they be housed if the homes have to be vacated for their former occupants? On the whole, however, the introduction of Russian peacemaking forces in the Inguri River region is accepted in Abkhazia calmly, without any fuss. Or, to put it more accurately, with less fuss than in Russia. People here realize that the peacemakers will not eliminate the causes which made the war flare out. According to Abkhazian politicians, the unrecognized republic will have to live for a long time to come in conditions of frozen conflict and uncertain political status. But this is of course better than existing on the brink of death.
