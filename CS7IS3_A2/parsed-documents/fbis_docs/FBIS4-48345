He confirmed all the information we obtained today from Rui Mingas, Angolan ambassador in Lisbon, and spoke about the great news for the Angolan people: [Begin recording] [Valentim, on the telephone] Yes, we are negotiating, we resumed the talks today and, of course, the theme we have on the table is national reconciliation. We feel optimistic about reaching a positive result. [Correspondent Salema] Can that result be reached by the beginning of June? [Valentim] Without getting into precise chronology, we can say yes. We are even hoping to get it over very, very soon, we have that sort of political will, we have very good communications going on with the government and hope we will reach the end of the journey within the same spirit of understanding and open democratic debate. [Salema] Will peace then arrive in Angola in June? [Valentim] We hope so, this is great news for the people of our country. Not only the news of peace but also that of national reconciliation that will allow all Angolans to live together, regardless of political conviction, racial, and ethnic origins. [end recording] That was UNITA's Jorge Valentim confirming to Madelena Salema that the Summer of 1994 may bring peace back to Angola.
