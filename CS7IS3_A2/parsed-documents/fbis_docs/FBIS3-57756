Our correspondent Aleksandr Knyazev reports. [Knyazev] The three ministers have signed a protocol on the results of their meeting, which states that full mutual understanding on all issues discussed was achieved. Among these issues are the joint use of the installations and facilities inherited by the sovereign armies from the USSR Armed Forces. In particular, Lieutenant General Akhmedov, the Uzbek defense minister, reported that a decision has finally been found on the use of two training grounds. The training ground of the Airborne Assault Forces deployed in Andizhan Oblast of Uzbekistan is situated on the territory of Osh Oblast in Kyrgyzstan, and the training center of the Osh-based Motorized Mountain Rifle Division is situated near Andizhan. The regularly-held training exercises of the Uzbek airborne assault forces were often causing serious problems in the relations between the two neighboring republics. Similar problems exist with Kazakhstan. The ministers have also discussed mutual interaction in the field of arms and equipment supplies, the training of officers and specialists, military transport, and other issues. It was noted that military cooperation between the three countries is not aimed at creating a separate military alliance, but will be carried out within the framework of the CIS Collective Security Treaty of which these three republics are members.
