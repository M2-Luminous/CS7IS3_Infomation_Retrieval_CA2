Using these and other results of joint work, we intend in the immediate future to broaden the themes and to increase the effectiveness of the installments of ``Our Exchange.'' In recent years the steady tendency for associates to leave scientific research organizations (NTOs) has emerged. Young people, maintenance personnel, scientific workers of high skills, and middle-level specialists are leaving. Official statistics do not make it possible to establish promptly the scale, directions, and structure of this phenomenon. The work performed by the Istina Center to the order of the department of social problems of science of the Russian Federation Ministry of Science and Technical Policy will make it possible to clarify the situation. During it 42 scientific and technical organizations of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Moscow Oblast with a total of about 16,000 workers were examined. Academic, sectorial, and plant science, which both is and is not (four organizations) state property, is represented at them. The number of personnel at the NTO ranged from 60 to 3,600. The survey was conducted in two stages. At the first stage the overall change of the number of personnel during January-May 1993, the sex, age, position, and skills of the scientists and specialists, who quit during this period, were determined through the personnel departments of the NTOs. At the second stage of the survey in a telephone survey of these workers the directions of the departure of personnel from science (emigration, a change of the type of activity, transfer to the private sector of the economy, and so forth) were ascertained. The data of this survey, which were obtained from more than 400 people, made it possible to gain original statistical material that is making it possible to analyze thoroughly the problem of the migration of scientific personnel on the basis of real factual data, and not various kinds of hypotheses. It turned out that during the first five months of this year the number of personnel at the surveyed NTOs decreased by 7.2 percent. What does this mean? According to the data of the Russian Federation State Committee for Statistics, the annual decrease of the number of employees at NTOs came in 1990 to 12 percent and in 1991 to 16 percent. So far there are no official data for 1992, but the forecasting figure was specified at the level of 20-30 percent. Our survey confirmed the fact that the trend toward the decrease of the number of employees in science also remains during the current year, 1993, although its pace has become somewhat less. The results of the analysis of the reasons, for which associates quit NTOs, are interesting. Of those surveyed 86 percent did this at their own request or in connection with being transferred to another job (that is, again at their own request). For Moscow this indicator came to nearly 91 percent. Thus, the departure of personnel from NTOs for the present is not connected with organized reductions. Incidentally, last year, in 1992, when at Russian scientific research institutes and design bureaus two or three reductions of personnel were carried out, they were responsible for only 25 percent of the departure of personnel from science. The analysis of the problem of who is leaving NTOs provides even more food for thought. For this purpose the personal data of 675 scientists and specialists who had quit were studied. The results were somewhat unexpected. Approximately an identical number of men and women quit. However, if you consider that the share of women in science comes to more than 55 percent, it is possible to conclude that men "are being flushed" from NTOs more intensively. Nearly half of those who quit held earlier the positions of engineers, designers, and so forth, about 30 percent held junior scientific positions from trainee to scientific associate. The number of people who quit after the age of 40 exceeds slightly the number of people who quit not having reached this age. Here, however, it is necessary to take into account that the share of the younger age groups at NTOs at present is small, therefore, a high intensity of the "flushing" of young people from science still lies behind the smaller absolute figure. Of the 675 people who quit during the first five months of this year 18 went abroad (to live or to work under contract for a period of more than one year). All of them are workers of well-known academic scientific research institutes. Thus, not external, but internal migration, that is, the transfer of scientists to other sectors and spheres of the national economy, is playing a far greater role in the dynamics of scientific personnel. From the telephone survey of those who had quit it became clear that 85-90 percent of them already had an understanding on a new job. In those cases, when a person left "for nowhere," it was quite difficult for him to find a job (the chance of getting a job came to one in five). Only 40 percent of the respondents again went to work in state structures, 52 percent left for private organizations, cooperatives, and joint-stock companies, 6 percent left for joint ventures, about 0.5 percent left for foreign firms, and a little more than 1 percent engaged in individual labor activity. Among the people who left for state enterprises the share of women, people 40 to 60 years old, and those people, who earlier held the positions of senior scientific associates and higher, is large. Primarily men, people up to the age of 40, as well as people who held junior scientific positions and positions of specialists, are getting jobs at organizations of the alternative sector of the economy. Seventy five percent of the doctors of sciences and 56 percent of the candidates of sciences, who quit scientific research institutes, also transferred to a job at nonstate organizations. Representatives of the physical mathematical and technical sciences, as well as the people, who engaged earlier in scientific and technical development and services and in introduction, prefer them. Responding to the question of the type of basic activity of the organization, to which they transferred, 23 percent of the telephone respondents named research and development, 22 percent named scientific and technical services and introduction, 25 percent named the making of a product, 19 percent named intermediary activity, 8 percent named commercial and purchasing activity, and 15 percent named services and consulting. The total of the above-cited percentages does not equal 100, inasmuch as the same respondent could indicate several directions of activity of the organization. The survey also showed that for the most part women and people over the age of 40 are remaining in science or ``near it.'' Young people up to the age of 30 are leaving mainly for the sphere of intermediary activity. Comparatively many candidates and doctors of sciences, as well as people, who held earlier scientific positions from senior scientific associate and higher, are transferring to organizations of the scientific and technical type. In order to supplement and at the same time to verify the responses to the preceding question, the respondents were asked to assign their new place of work to one of the sectors of the national economy. Twenty six percent of the respondents named the sector ``Science and Scientific Service,'' 30 percent named ``Industry,'' 18 percent named ``Trade, Public Dining, Procurement, and Marketing,'' 6 percent named ``Finance, Credit, and Insurance,'' and 0.6 percent named ``Education.''Among young people 19 percent went to work again at NTOs, 21 percent left for industry, 28 percent left for trade, and 9 percent left for the sphere of finance. Among those who had quit 37 percent of the candidates and doctors of sciences, 33 percent of those people who had held scientific positions, and only 11 percent of the engineers, economists, and other representatives of nonscientific specialties, who worked at NTOs, remained in science. For physicists and mathematicians science, education, and finance proved to be most appealing. Representatives of the technical sciences and chemists transferred mainly to industry. About 25 percent of the economics scholars remained in science, 22 percent of the latter left for trade and 19 percent left for financial organizations. Of the surveyed representatives of the humanities 41 percent began to work again at NTOs, 18 percent left for a teaching job, and 18 percent left for administrative bodies. As a whole the obtained data testified that 55 percent of those who left NTOs had changed drastically the sphere of their activity. This is especially typical of young people. In what did those who quit NTOs engage at their new place of work? Twenty six percent of the respondents replied that they engaged in research and development, 28 percent--in scientific research services and introduction, 18 percent--in entrepreneurial activity, 22 percent--in administration, and 11 percent--in physical labor. It would be interesting to learn precisely who of the former workers of science began to engage in enterprise? For the most part these are men (there are threefold more of them than women), people up to the age of 30 (33 percent) and from 30 to 40 years old (29 percent). In this group there are practically no scientists and specialists over the age of 40. It also turned out that among the new entrepreneurs there are many people, who had held at NTOs positions that were not connected with research activity, and, however strange this is, scientists who had worked on basic problems. And another somewhat paradoxical result that was obtained during our survey is that mainly those people who are over 50 had begun to engage in physical labor. It is no secret that one of the basic reasons for the departure of personnel from science is the low level of the remuneration of labor in this sector. About 92 percent of the scientific workers and specialists of NTOs consider their income at their main place of work to be lower than average. At the new place they, it seems, are finding what they sought. Nearly 33 percent of the associates, who left NTOs this year, are satisfied with the present remuneration, 34 percent--``more yes than no,'' 18 percent--``more no than yes,'' 8 percent are not satisfied, and 7 percent found it hard to answer this question. Thus, 67 percent of the respondents rated favorably their new wage. The degree of satisfaction with the content of the new job is also high--for nearly 71 percent of the respondents. The highest level of dissatisfaction is observed among the people who engaged earlier in basic research. And, finally, the last question that was addressed to the respondents during our survey: ``To what degree is your new job connected with the previous one?'' The responses are broken down as follows. Ten percent of the respondents replied "It is a direct continuation," 28 percent believe ``It is connected,'' for the remaining 62 percent of the scientists and specialists the previous and present jobs are not connected in any way. Among young people this indicator is even higher--nearly 74 percent. Those people, who engaged earlier in basic research and the humanities, proved to be most devoted to their old jobs. What tentative conclusions is it possible to draw from the results of the conducted survey? First, the tendency for the number of employees in science to decrease remains. Second, the overwhelming majority of associates of NTOs are quitting because they are finding a more appealing (based mainly on material criteria) place of work, and not due to reductions of personnel, which have been organized ``from above.'' Another important conclusion is that only 40 percent of the scientists and specialists of NTOs, who quit, go to work at state structures. About 45 percent of the respondents are now working again at NTOs or at organizations that are connected with science and technology. It is very important that the satisfaction with the wage and the nature of the work at the new place is nearly ninefold higher than on the average among workers of the sector ``Science and Scientific Service.'' Scientists and specialists up to the age of 40, that is, the most promising and able-bodied group, are transferring most actively to other sectors of the national economy and are beginning to engage in new types of labor activity. And this latter fact is, perhaps, the most unpleasant and alarming conclusion among those that were obtained during the conducted survey.
