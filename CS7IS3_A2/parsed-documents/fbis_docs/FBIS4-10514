Jaime Ford, the Panamanian ambassador in Washington, D.C., met yesterday with Foreign Minister Jose Mulino to draft the protest note. Government sources told LA PRENSA that the president is carefully analyzing the draft note before signing it. Officials from the Clinton Administration recently affirmed that Panama has become a major center for laundering drug money. Endara and Foreign Minister Mulino later rejected the accusation. Jaime Ford stated that there has been no major reaction from the United States since the report was released. The ambassador explained that "we are working very hard to draft this protest note. That is the reason for my visit to the Foreign Ministry." Last week Endara said that Panama is helping in the fight against drug trafficking and money laundering. Ford added that the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency are drafting the protest note together and "will deliver it as soon as it is ready." The diplomat also said that the world, as it faces the invasion of drugs, must create an organization that can combine efforts, with proper respect for the sovereignty of each nation, to fight drug trafficking and its effects. U.S. Government sources have also said that there is more money being laundered in Panama now than during the days of drug dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega. The Endara administration has rejected the charges, arguing that this is a campaign to tarnish the country's image.
