The latest crime was the ugly one that took place in Sarajevo's market on 5 February, which claimed the lives of 68 people and wounded 200 others. Hence, there was nothing odd in seeing Egypt support a policy that is the opposite of its firm stance on international armaments and the arms race. Egypt's firm policy on this issue is based on the need to stop the arms race, to remove chemical and nuclear weapons, and to establish peace and stability in parts of the world where conditions allow. This policy underlines the credibility of international legitimacy, which has raised the slogan of security, stability, and human rights, and has decided to confront any aggression against peoples. International legitimacy succeeded very effectively after the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. Reaction to this aggression showed the backing and support for what was termed international legitimacy and the hopes of many peoples, particularly the Third World peoples. But the Serbian aggression against human rights in Bosnia, which has continued for more than two years without appropriate action on the part of international legitimacy, has been a lethal blow to this legitimacy, especially as the television networks are conveying truthfully and without exaggeration what is happening on Bosnian territory and the barbaric crimes that humanity can only be ashamed of. This has prompted Europeans and Americans to stage dozens of demonstrations demanding that their governments take effective action to stop these aggressions that have distorted the image of Western civilization and underlined the imbalance of the human rights slogans raised by Western governments whose criteria differ noticeably from one country to another. President Mubarak touched on the Bosnian tragedy when he met the Armed Forces officers and soldiers. He very clearly held the European countries responsible for what is happening there and reiterated that the international community has to uphold its full commitments to this problem in support of the credibility of international legitimacy and in order to save the principle of peaceful coexistence, which this legitimacy affirms. Egypt's request to the Security Council to lift the embargo on arming the Bosnian people has met with some international welcome. Egypt stresses that its request falls within the context of the UN resolutions and charters, which stress the right of every country to self-defense against any outside aggression. The meetings that Egypt's UN permanent envoy has held with the heads of the five permanent member delegations in the Security Council on adopting appropriate deterrent measures against the aggressor Serbian forces represent a new action for Egyptian diplomacy. Egypt, while moving in all directions to stop this tragedy, is certainly expressing the stifled cries in the hearts of Arab and Muslim peoples. It should be recalled that these peoples supported international legitimacy in repelling the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait even though Iraq was an Arab League member. All this underlines the credibility of the Arab people in dealing with issues without any double standards.
