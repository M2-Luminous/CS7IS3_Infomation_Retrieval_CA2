FR940405-2-00189 FR940405-2-00081 V. Other Matters (A) Environmental Impact A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332), at the time of development of the HOPE for Elderly Independence NOFA that was published on September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50769). That Finding remains applicable to this NOFA, and is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. (B) Federalism Impact The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that this NOFA, and the accompanying Project Guidelines do not have substantial, direct effects on the States, on their political subdivisions, or on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power or responsibilities among the various levels of government. Neither this NOFA nor the accompanying Guidelines would substantially alter the established roles of HUD, the States and local governments, including HAs. (C) Impact on the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this NOFA and the accompanying Project Guidelines, may have a significant impact on the maintenance and general well-being of some families. This NOFA provides FY 1993 funding for, and the accompanying Guidelines provide guidance for the operation of, the HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration, the purpose of which is to provide decent and sanitary housing, and supportive services to frail elderly persons and near-frail elderly persons in a selected multifamily housing project. The supportive services provided by this demonstration are expected to prevent or postpone unnecessary or premature institutionalization, and reduce unnecessary stress and financial burden on participants' families. Since the impact on the family is considered beneficial, no further review is necessary. (D) Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance Section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act) contains a number of provisions that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance administered by HUD. The regulations implementing section 102 are codified at 24 CFR part 12. On January 16, 1992, HUD published at 57 FR 1942, additional information that gave the public (including applicants for, and recipients of, HUD assistance) further information on the implementation of section 102. The documentation, public access, and disclosure requirements of section 102 are applicable to assistance awarded under this NOFA as follows: (1) Documentation and Public Access HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipient of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly Federal Register notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) (2) Disclosures HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR part 12, subpart C, and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.) (E) Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities: The Byrd Amendment The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319 of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000, and applicants for Federal commitments exceeding $150,000 must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from the statute's coverage.
