The PRD Political Commission will meet tonight to debate the actions to be taken regarding the charges of alleged fraud in the electoral process. This organization asserts that through the manipulation of the electoral lists, thousands of their followers were not allowed to exert their right to vote. Meanwhile, the capital city of Dominican Republic remains militarized and surveillance has been increased at key points. The police and soldiers search vehicles that move close to the JCE headquarters and that arrive in Santo Domingo from cities in the interior. The search, it has been reported, is for weapons, which will be confiscated if found. The situation continues to be one of tense tranquility and people await the final results of the electoral process.
