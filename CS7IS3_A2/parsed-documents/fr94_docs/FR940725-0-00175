FR940725-0-00175 FR940725-0-00019 V. Effective Date In developing the final rule, OSHA has considered whether a delayed effective date is necessary for any of the provisions of the standard. Employers will need time to integrate their procedures for complying with the provisions in this standard as applied to land-side confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres. Although the record indicates that the new provisions (training, rescue, and duties to other employers) being used on board vessels and vessel sections are current industry practice, under this standard they also have been expanded to include land-side operations. OSHA believes that a period of 90 days will be adequate for this purpose, since most of the requirements in the final rule do not require extensive training or major modifications of existing work practices. This amount of time will be adequate for employers to ensure that their work practices conform to the requirements of the revised standard. VI. Information Collection Requirements 5 CFR part 1320 sets forth procedures for agencies to follow in obtaining OMB clearance for information collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The final Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres standard requires the employer to allow OSHA access to the competent person roster, testing and inspection results, and training records. In accordance with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, OSHA certifies that it has submitted the information collection to OMB for review under section 3504(b) of that Act. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average five minutes per response to allow OSHA compliance officers access to the employer's records. Send comments regarding this burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Office of Information Management, Department of Labor, room N&hyph;1301, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (Confined and Enclosed Spaces and Other Dangerous Atmospheres). Washington, DC 20503. VII. Federalism This final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987), regarding Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting state policy options, consult with states before taking any actions which would restrict state policy options, and take such actions only if there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides for preemption of state law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for the Agency to do so. Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent possible. Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt state laws relating to issues on which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety and health standards. Under the OSH Act, a state can avoid preemption only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan-States must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment as the Federal standards. Where such standards are applicable to products distributed or used in interstate commerce, they may not unduly burden commerce and must be justified by compelling local conditions. (See section 18(c)(2) of the OSH Act.) The Federal standards on confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres address hazards which are not unique to any one state or region of the country. Nonetheless, states with occupational safety and health plans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act will be able to develop their own state standards to deal with any special problems which might be encountered in a particular state. Moreover, because these standards are written in general, performance-oriented terms, there is considerable flexibility for state plans to require, and for affected employers to use, methods of compliance which are appropriate to the working conditions covered by the standard. In brief, this final rule addresses a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health in shipyard employment. States which have elected to participate under section 18 of the OSH Act are not preempted by this standard and will be able to address any special conditions within the framework of the Federal Act, while ensuring that the state standards are at least as effective as this standard. VIII. State Plan Standards The 23 states and 2 territories with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans must adopt a comparable standard within 6 months of the publication date of the final standard. These states and territories are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, 4 Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, 5 North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming. Until such time as a state standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate, in these states. 4 Plan covers only State and local government employees. 5 Plan covers only State and local government employees. IX. Authority This document was prepared under the direction of Joseph A. Dear, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20210.
