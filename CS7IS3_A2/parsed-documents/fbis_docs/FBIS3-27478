An official at the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) in Beijing said that lower costs and national pride were key factors behind the move. However, Western aviation analysts have raised questions about the quality of the CAAC's Chengdu Flying College, especially if it is expanded too rapidly. The official said a recent contract with Northwest Airlines to train 250 mainland pilots in the United States this year would not be affected as it mainly involved refresher courses for pilots of five Chinese airlines rather than basic training.
