This was stated by Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the republic of Srpska's national assembly, in a statement for today's edition of GLAS SRPSKI of Banja Luka. He said that the republic of Srpska delegation pointed to the shortcomings of their demand to cede 51 percent of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Muslim-Croat federation if the quality and quantity of the territory is not taken into account. "We explained that the tendency to expand Muslim and Croatian territories at the expense of the Serbs is unacceptable and in poor taste," Krajisnik said, adding that the Serbs cannot possibly renounce lands that represent a vital interest of the Serbian nation, as is the case with Posavina. "They envisage only a narrow corridor for the republic of Srpska, although this territory is the only link the western Serb lands have with Serbia proper," Krajisnik said in his statement for "GLAS SRPSKI." "In any case, this territory is of much greater importance to the Serbs than it could be to the Croats or Muslims."
