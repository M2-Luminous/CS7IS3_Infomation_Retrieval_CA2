Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Defense Agency Chief Kazuo Aichi will meet U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner for a discussion of bilateral and regional security issues. Coming as concerns grow over Japan-U.S. trade relations, the talks are intended to promote understanding between Tokyo and Washington in order to prevent trade frictions from affecting political and security affairs, the sources said. The talks are expected to focus on North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program and the strengthening of the military in China as well as touching upon the issue of U.S. military bases in Okinawa. The meeting is also likely to consider revisions to Japanese defense plans in the post-Cold War world and military reductions by the United States, the sources suggested. Until December 1990, the security talks had been attended by the U.S. Ambassador to Japan and the commander of the U.S. forces in the Pacific with the foreign minister and the Defense Agency director general. It was agreed to upgrade the talks, but the higher level talks have yet to be held because of the changes in the international situation. Wisner is accompanying Christopher on his three-nation tour of the Asia-Pacific region and will attend the talks for Secretary of Defense William Perry who did not make the trip.
