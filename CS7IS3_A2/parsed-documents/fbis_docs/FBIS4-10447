The president of the lower chamber, Frantz Robert Monde, has some serious reservations on the resolution. According to Monde, this resolution does not have much chance of being ratified by the deputies' assembly. [Begin recording] [Monde] "The reactions that I gathered from some deputies proved that they felt humiliated and indignant, frustrated with the behavior of some senators who treat them as children. They do not agree at all, and they even ask this morning, [word indistinct] of the Senate, saying that this building, which was built by Duvalier for the Chamber of Deputies, is a building that was lent to them to hold the sessions, and that the vile show that they offered us does not accommodate the good relations that should exist between senators and deputies. The wise ones did not give this example, but asked that we take the building back to be used as a committee room. [Francois] "Do you think that it is a realistic plan? [Monde] "In my humble opinion, what is the objective of these men?" These gentlemen want to have a new government, a new Dessalines; I do not even say a new Toussaint Louverture -- Toussaint was a very flexible man who played with the great powers; Dessalines said this is my country, and I am leading it. Do those men have the will to do it? Will they find this new Dessalines? Because my experience taught me that there is more than one trend [word indistinct]. There is a greater tendency to have ministers as friends. It is to occupy the realm of power. Thus, I have a big question mark. In any case, we are going to begin talking and see as soon as possible what to do so we can endow the country with a government. [end recording]
