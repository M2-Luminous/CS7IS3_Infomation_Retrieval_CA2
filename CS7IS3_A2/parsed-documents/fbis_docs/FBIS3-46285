In addition to Taiwan investment, a number of Southeast Asian nations poured money into Vietnam last year, including Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, who invested US$346 million, US$209 million and US$131 million respectively, the IDIC statistics showed. From 1988 to November, 1993, Taiwan's accumulated investment in Vietnam hit US$1.275 billion with Taiwan Sugar Corp. and Chinese Petroleum Corp. as leading investors. Hong Kong ranked second in accumulated investment, with US$1.064 billion during the period. South Korea came in third with US$473 million, followed by Australia's US$415 million and Japan's US$414 million. In recent years, foreign capital has continuously poured into Vietnam due to its cheap labor and the legislation of an investment law in 1987 as well as the free market reform policy adopted by the Vietnamese Government at the end of the 1980s. The market reform policy, although coming later than similar policies in other Southeast Asian countries, still fueled an outstanding average economic growth of 7.1 percent over the past three years. Total approved foreign investment in Vietnam in 1991 reached US$1.146 billion, and the figure jumped to US$2.863 billion in 1993, the statistics showed. Although Taiwan topped other investors in 1993, its US$430 million was a decline of 17.8 percent from 1992, the IDIC statistics showed. Taiwan manufacturers focused their investments in the hotel, tourism, service, petroleum and natural gas industries.
