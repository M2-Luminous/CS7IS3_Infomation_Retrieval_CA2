FR940610-2-00018 FR940610-2-00014 Procurement List; Additions AGENCY: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled. ACTION: Additions to the procurement list. SUMMARY: This action adds to the Procurement List shipping boxes to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Crystal Square 3, suite 403, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3461. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 11, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 FR 11579) of proposed addition to the Procurement List. Comments were received from the current contractor for the boxes in response to a request for sales data. The contractor indicated that addition of the boxes to the Procurement List would cause one or more of four events to occur: Loss of sales for the contractor, loss of jobs, loss of profit for the contractor because of an inability to purchase raw materials in volume, and increased cost to the Government on future procurements conducted under the Committee's program. The contractor did not furnish any information to support its claims about loss of profit and increased cost to the Government. Nonprofit agencies participating in the Committee's program are required to sell to the Government at a fair market price set by the Committee, so there is little possibility of a substantial increase in price to the Government when an item is added to the Procurement List. The contract value for the boxes is such that loss of sales will represent only a very small percentage of the contractor's sales. The Committee does not believe that a sales loss of this size constitutes severe adverse impact on the contractor. The contractor provided a range of numbers of jobs which might be lost if the boxes are added to the Procurement List and did not indicate specifically whether any jobs would be lost because of the Committee's action. However, addition of the boxes to the Procurement List will definitely create jobs for blind people, who traditionally have unemployment rates far above those of people without severe disabilities. Consequently, the Committee believes that this definite creation of jobs for blind people outweighs the possible loss of jobs by the contractor's employees. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the commodities, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the commodities listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46 - 48c) in connection with the commodities proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following commodities are hereby added to the Procurement List: Box, Shipping 8115&hyph;00&hyph;134&hyph;3655 8115&hyph;00&hyph;134&hyph;3656 8115&hyph;01&hyph;006&hyph;7257 8115&hyph;01&hyph;010&hyph;8956 8115&hyph;00&hyph;516&hyph;0251 This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised under those contracts.
