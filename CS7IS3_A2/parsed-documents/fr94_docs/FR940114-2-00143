FR940114-2-00143 FR940114-2-00086 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket No. 50&hyph;443; License No. NPF&hyph;86] North Atlantic Energy Service Corp.; Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1; Order Approving Transfer of License I Vermont Electric Generation and Transmission Cooperative, Inc., (Vermont) is the holder of a 0.41259-percent ownership share in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1. Vermont's interest in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, is governed by License No. NPF&hyph;86 issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the NRC) pursuant to 10 CFR part 50 on March 15, 1990, in Docket No. 50&hyph;443. Under this license, only North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation (North Atlantic), acting as agent and representative of 12 joint owners listed in the license, has the authority to operate Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1. Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, is located in Rockingham County, New Hampshire. II By letter dated August 27, 1993, North Atlantic proposed an amendment to License No. NPF&hyph;86 which would change the license to reflect the transfer of Vermont's 0.41259-percent ownership share in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, to North Atlantic Energy Corporation (NAEC). In 1990, Vermont filed a claim against Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) with the United States Bankruptcy Court which was then hearing a petition from PSNH for reorganization under Chapter II of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Vermont's claim sought redress for damages that were alleged to have been incurred while PSNH had been the managing agent for the Seabrook Station. In November 1990, the two parties reached a settlement which included an agreement by PSNH or its designee to purchase Vermont's share of the Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, subject to obtaining the necessary approvals from all regulatory agencies. In December 1990, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order approving the stipulation that PSNH and Vermont had filed describing the settlement. In June 1992, in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization for PSNH that was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, Northeast Utilities (NU) acquired PSNH in merger transactions and, after receipt of NRC approval, NAEC (a weekly formed and wholly owned subsidiary of NU) acquired PSNH's interest in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1. The transfer of Vermont's ownership share in Seabrook to NAEC will consummate the settlement entered into by Vermont and PSNH. The transfer of rights under License No. NPF&hyph;86 is subject to the NRC's approval under 10 CFR 50.80(a). After reviewing information submitted in the August 27, 1993, letter and other information before the Commission, the NRC staff has determined that the transfer of Vermont's interest in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1 to NAEC (which is already a licensee) does not affect NAEC's technical or financial qualifications to be a holder of License No. NPF&hyph;86, and the license transfer is otherwise consistent with applicable provisions of law, regulations, and orders issued by the Commission. III Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.21, 51.32, and 51.35, an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact was published in the Federal Register on January 5, 1994 (59 FR 605). Accordingly, based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission has determined that issuance of this order will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 161b and 161i of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as amended), 42 U.S.C. 2201, and 10 CFR 50.80, it is hereby ordered that the transfer of control of Vermont Electric Generation and Transmission Cooperative, Inc.'s 0.41259-percent undivided ownership interest in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, to North Atlantic Energy Corporation is approved subject to the following: (1) Should the transfer not be completed by May 30, 1994, this Order will be null and void and (2) on application and for good cause shown, this Order may be extended for a short period beyond May 30, 1994. Dated at Rockville, MD, this 7th day of January 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thomas E. Murley, Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
