The troops were landed in two groups at the Belbek and Cape Khersones airfields, whereupon they were assigned to Ukraine Navy units. The officer advised that in Kherson Oblast, in the village of Chernobayevka, a Ukraine military field hospital has been set up. whose personnel are making no secret that they are getting ready to receive casualties with bullet and fragmentation wounds. Furthermore, Ukrainian troops are being concentrated around the city of Izmail where a Black Sea Fleet brigade of combat boats is located. According to unconfirmed reports, the storming of the unit has been set for 25 May. From 18 to 22 May the Black Sea Fleet command is holding "scheduled" -- the word the Navy Press Center makes a point of emphasizing -- exercises. They involve more than 20 battleships and submarines, aircraft, helicopters, and fleet coast installations. On Thursday a session of the Crimean parliament heard Acting Internal Affairs Minister Maj.-Gen. Valeriy Kuznetsov announce that on the morning of 19 May a detachment of the Ukraine Special Forces, under the command of Ukrainian First Deputy Interior Minister Nidrigaylo, attacked the Interior Ministry headquarters in Simpferopol. Crimean militia forces managed to repulse the attack. Prior to that President Kravchuk issued an order transforming the Crimean Interior Ministry into a regional directorate of Ukraine's Interior Ministry, including a new post: "deputy minister -- chief of the Crimea Directorate." Local parliament deputies believe that military preparations in Sevastopol, Izmail, and Simferopol are elements of an overall plan to destabilize the situation on the peninsula. Political observers suppose that an armed confrontation on the peninsula could become a pretext for postponing or cancelling presidential elections in Ukraine which bode no good to its present leadership. According to some reports, Thursday's closed session of the Crimean parliament considered the question of introducing a state of emergency on the peninsula. Sources in the Defense Ministry in Moscow confirmed to SEGODNYA's correspondent that the 1st Ukrainian Mobile Air Brigade, created on the basis of the 98th Paratroopers Brigade, part of which was evacuated to Russia, is, according to intelligence reports, "making preparations" for a possible seizure of a river vessel (craft) brigade in Izmail. Mobile Air Brigade servicemen earlier took part in the seizure of a ship division in Odessa. The Ukrainian Mobile Air Brigade is located in Bolgrad and could be moved to Izmail within several hours. The command of the river vessel brigade has been "warned about a coming provocation" and, if necessary, could obviously offer resistance.
