After the initial appearance by Marjan Podobnik, who spoke in the name of the proposers of the session, and the representatives of the monetary and financial authorities, who called for the continuation of negotiations with the foreign debtors, the parliamentary debate followed. During the debate, the finance minister, the governor of the National Bank of Slovenia, and other representatives of the legal organs took the floor on several occasions. The session was interrupted half an hour ago and it will continue behind closed doors. In the closed part of the session the deputies are to discuss the negotiating positions in the talks with the consortium of commercial banks, which have not ended yet. The last one to speak before the interruption was Finance Minister Gaspari, who explained that the purchase of debts prior to their falling due would be nonsensical, as we would not receive confirmation that we had actually purchased them. Here is a report by Vesna Burnik: [Begin recording] [Burnik] [passage omitted] The debate proceeded in the well-known direction -- retorts and mutual accusations followed each other that the opposition was politicizing the public debt for its own purposes and vice-versa, that the ruling parties were pretending to be smart and the exclusive experts on the public debt. The stumbling block was evidently the question as to when and how Slovenia actually agreed to the payment of at least a portion of the former SFRY debt and what the basis for it is. Governor Franc Arhar replied: [Arhar] For the time being the declarative document, if I may say so, is the Constitutional Law that was passed in June. The law provides for the willingness and undertaking. At that time, everybody, the government and the parliament, whenever the issue surfaced and, of course, also last January, if you recall, when the parliament was passing the law about the membership in the International Monetary Fund [IMF] [sentence as heard]. When the IMF initiated the procedure regarding Slovenia, in establishing its share, it, of course, departed from the stipulation, from that very clear article of the Constitutional Law. [Burnik] In the debate Marjan Poljsak demanded to know why Slovenia was not purchasing its portion of the debt if it really was so cheap at this moment. Minister Gaspari replied that the debts would not disappear with their purchase, because since the disintegration of Yugoslavia the creditors have not recognized the transactions, and the National Bank of Yugoslavia, of course, would not sign them off. The Ljubljana Bank used to do that, too, until the disintegration of the country. A more detailed debate on the topic will continue in the closed part of the session. [end recording]
