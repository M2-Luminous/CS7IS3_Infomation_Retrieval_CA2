It should be pointed out that Senator Bernard Sansaricq has publicly refused an invitation by Ambassador William Lacy Swing to participate in the 29 March reception. The parliamentarian, who has reproached the U.S. Embassy for its interference in Haitian internal affairs, has declared that he is in solidarity with the contested 18 January 1993 senators. [Begin Sansaric recording] It is with good grace and with an immense pleasure that we, senators of the Republic, are able to answer this nice invitation. Unfortunately, today everything regarding the schemes of the U.S. Government's representatives in Haiti seems to reveal their firm determination to work toward destroying cohesion between the authentic sons of the Haitian homeland. Insofar as a foreign diplomatic representation supposedly persists in encouraging us (?to move toward) the path of discord on particular and international questions regarding the sovereignty of our institutions, we remain sorry to be compelled to refuse the honor of this invitation, even though it is nice.
