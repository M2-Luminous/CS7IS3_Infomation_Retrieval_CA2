Birri adds: "It is no coincidence that only 50 hours separated the two crimes committed against peace in both Lebanon and the region. One of these crimes targeted faithful people and the church in Lebanon and the other targeted faithful people and the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron." Birri adds: "The blood bath witnessed in the holy lands of Palestine and Lebanon are the best evidence that Israel is incapable of making peace." He then criticizes world reaction to these two incidents, noting that "Despite this bloody Israeli record, we still feel that Israel is granted immunity by the international community. It is allowed to act as it wishes, depending on the right of veto, which is preventing the passage of firm international resolutions and the implementation of the provisions enshrined in Chapter 7 of the UN Charter against it. This renders the killing of our peoples, as is happening at present, a condonable crime, and the killing of a single Israeli settler or soldier on our occupied territories an unforgivable crime. Their occupation of our territories is justified, whereas our resistance on our own national soil is deemed terrorism."
