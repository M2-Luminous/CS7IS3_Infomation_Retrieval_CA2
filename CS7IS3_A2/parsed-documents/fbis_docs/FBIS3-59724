Introduction The characteristic of recent demand for electric power is that while demand for the maximum level of power is increasing, the amount of electricity in demand is not increasing proportionately (Fig. 1). For instance, the demand for the maximum power in the area supplied by Tokyo Electric Power for 1991 was 1.9 million kW, an increase of approximately 5.3%. while an increase in the amount of electricity used was no more than 3.5%. This is reflected in the load factor expressed in terms of facility use efficiency, which was reduced to 5.5% in 1991. Fig. 1. Growth in Maximum Electric Power and Amount of As for the maximum electric power, in spite of the recessionary time brought about by the collapse of Japan's bubble economy, demands still are climbing, recording 4.1 million kW (a 4.2% increase over the previous year's figure). This is translated into an increase investment costs, putting pressure on management; in addition, it creates problems from the standpoint of efficient use of energy, as it reduces the efficiency of power generating facilities used to adjust loads for thermal and other forms of power generation. Given this situation, in order to operate power generating plant and electric supply facilities efficiently, utility companies must level electric power load as much as possible. Since the only method of storing power currently in use is by pumping, the industry is hoping for a new storage technology to emerge. With this as a background, since 1984, Tokyo Electric Power and NGK Insulator jointly have been developing a power storage system, utilizing a sodium-sulfur battery. Since the NaS battery has a higher energy density compared with those of traditional batteries, it can be produced in compact size and installed in metropolitan suburbs. In terms of its capabilities, our R&D effort was able to produce satisfactory results. Based on this new technology, we developed a 50kW battery for the practical prototype equipment and began its validation test in November of last year. This report, then, will deal with the 50kW NaS battery, focusing on its properties. 2. Summary of NaS battery Fig. Structure of Single NaS Cell As shown in Fig. 2, the NaS battery largely consists of three parts, viz., active sodium and sulfur materials and an electrolyte and a separator, &bgr;'' alumina. &bgr;'' alumina is a fine ceramic through which only NaS ions can pass, and unlike ordinary batteries, it is made of a solid electrolyte; hence it does not discharge by itself. Moreover, sodium and sulfur used as active materials have a high Clark number and are available in abundance. as resource. Since they normally must operate at high temperature of 300-350°C, they are collected in an insulated container and used in a module form. Temperature control inside the container is performed by an electric heater. Since open voltage near the charge end is 2.08 v., during discharge, sodium ions move through the solid electrolyte to the positive electrode, and during discharge, the reverse process takes place. At that time, it is possible to convert 96% of change in entropy into electric energy. The remaining 4% is taken out or taken in in the form of heat. Heat generation takes place during the course of discharge and heat absorption during the course of recharge. The theoretical energy density expressed in weight is 786Wh/k.g. and in mass, 1008Wh/l. Compared with traditional batteries, it has much higher energy density. Table 1.

Present State of NaS Battery Development 3.1. Development Goals and What Thus Far Have Been Achieved Our present goal is to achieve in the battery the level of electric storage capability equal to that achieved by a pumping method, and toward this end, we have developed the necessary specifications. Criteria used for index are durability, efficiency, cost, and safety. (Table 2). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

Validation Test Schedule The field test of the NaS battery began in March 1990 at Kawasaki Electric Power's storage-linked-system-test station. The test was conducted in 3 stages (Table 3). During the first stage (10kW/80kW/h), a battery grouping technology, designed to group a large number of small batteries into one module, was examined; during the second stage (100kW/400kWh), basic technologies involved in systematization, designed to combine 25 modules to construct a system, were studied. Testing of the 50kW battery, covered by this report, was conducted as a validation test. Our purpose is to validate the capabilities of the 50kW battery which will become a commercialized prototype equipment using 300Wh-class large cells. Table 3.

Performance Evaluation of 50kW/400kWh NaS Battery 4.1. Characteristics of 50kW Battery The characteristics of the battery are as follows: (1) A 50kW module will provide a basic structural unit of transportation and construction in the future in constructing a MW-class power storage system; and (2) By considering a simplified system when put into practical use, we opted for a simple construction involving only a few pieces of equipment. 4.2. Summary of 50-kW Battery System (1) Battery Specifications We constructed the battery with the rated output of 50kW and storage volume of 400kWh by combining four 12.5kW submodules in line. As shown in Fig. 3, it has a four-layer submodule structure, achieving a high-energy density through the combination of a mass energy density of 73kWh/m<sup> 4</sup> , weight energy density of 51kWh/t, and area energy density of 185kWh/m<sup> 2</sup> . Fig. 3. Structure of 50kW NaS Battery One submodule houses 324 300Wh-class large single cells, which are linked as follows: 6 in series x 6 in parallel x 9 in series. Each string has a fuse attached, a structure designed to limit a damage, such as short circuit, to a minimum. As has been explained previously, since the NaS battery operates only at high temperature, the submodule is insulated by a vacuum heat insulation container, with internal temperature controlled by a heater at 310°C. In order to measure temperature and to provide thermal control, 10 voltmetric wires and 4 thermocouples are [toridashite] from the battery. A 1-cycle per day design, with 8 hours each allotted to recharging and discharging of the battery, resulted in a discharge/charge efficiency of 8.8% when a loss resulting from the use of a heater is included, the efficiency rate is 8%. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4. 50kW NaS Battery Specifications | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Category |Specifications | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rated output |50 kW | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rated voltage |410 v | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rated current |122 A | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hour rate |8-hour recharge, 8-hour discharge | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Amount of rated electric power |400 kWh | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Amount of rated electricity |976 Ah | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Charge-discharge efficiency |88% | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Same as above (includes heater loss) |85% | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight |7.8 t | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Volume energy density |73 kWh/m<sup> 3</sup> | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight energy density |51 kWh/t | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Area energy density |185 kWh/m<sup> 2</sup> | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (2) Summary of Test System The structure of the 50kWNaS Battery's validation test is shown in Fig. 4. Since the battery is DC (direct current), in order to link with AC (alternating current) commercial systems, it will be necessary to have a DC-AC converter designed to convert DC and AC currents in both directions. The battery is connected to AC 210V through the AC-DC convertor and to a rear distribution cubicle bus whose pressure is raised to 6.6kV using a transformer. Since the test system is an industry-owned electric utility facility, its link to the power system is implemented in accordance with the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy's ``Guideline for System Linkage,'' and because the condition includes reverse power flows, we used a dedicated line to link the test system to the distribution cubicle so that the test system cannot be operated when the power system is without voltage. We used an FA computer to manage the total test facility. In order to control battery temperatures and voltage, we installed control equipment separately. The 50kW battery systems arranged in parallel, on 9 November 1992, passed a pre-operational inspection on December 10 and currently is in operation without any problems. Fig. 4. Block Diagram of Test System 4.3. Contents of Test The validation test is designed to evaluate the basic characteristics and long-range performance of the 50kW NaS battery as a prototype machine at the time of its practical implementation. Also examined will be its effects and a method of efficient operations as well as appropriate maintenance method. The contents of the test are summarized as follows: (1) Evaluation of Basic Characteristics *Rising temperature characteristics, falling temperature properties *Constant current charge and discharge characteristics *Constant power charge and discharge characteristics *Self-discharge and stand-by loss characteristics (2) Evaluation of Long-term Operational Characteristics *Evaluation of change in volume, efficiency, internal resistance, etc., which will occur when the battery is operated for a long period of time (3) Evaluation of Characteristics of Malfunctioning Battery *An external diagnostic method when internal battery malfunction develops *Evaluation of battery behavior when trouble occurs 4.4 Basic Characteristics of 50kW Battery Fig. 5. 50kW Battery Constant Power Characteristics (1) Characteristics of Constant Power Operation Fig. 5 shows electric properties of the 50kW battery when it undergoes one cycle of charge and discharge at the rated output of 50kW (January 19, 1993, 56 cycles), as well as temperature characteristics inside a representative submodule (C submodule). We used the pattern of operations involving the cycle of 8-hour discharge, a 5-hour rest period, recharge until the battery had been fully charged (approximately 9 hours), and a 2-hour rest period. Regarding the electric properties, when pure sulfur at the positive electrode is depleted, a decrease in the battery voltage from the certain level maintained at the time of initial discharge begins to occur uniformly for the most part. Since it is constant power operations, electric current increases when the maximum level is reached at the end of discharge. The range of voltage shift was between 382V and 471V, and that of current shift between 116A and 131A at the time of discharge and between 118A and 105A at the time of recharge. Although internal parts of the submodule are uniformly controlled at 310°C plus or minus 2°C during a standby period, the temperature begins to climb as a result of heat generated by internal resistance and by discharge reactions. The highest temperature registered at the center of the module is 328°C, while the lowest was 319°C on the plug side where insulation performance was at its poorest, creating a difference of approximately 10°C inside the submodule. As soon as discharge has been completed, temperature began to fall gradually, especially in places where this was easily done, the temperature fell below 310°C, making it necessary to use a heater. Ultimately, temperatures of all places inside the submodule fell down to 310°C. It was verified that before the next cycle of discharge began, the unit will return to a standby state, thereby achieving good result insofar as achieving good temperature equilibrium is concerned. Since the module is constructed by layering four submodules, we were able to obtain the identical temperature characteristics in all submodules. (Table 5) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 5. Temperature Distribution Inside Submodules (at the time when the | |maximum temperature has been reached | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |A |B |C |D | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Highest Tempe-|328.1 |328.2 |327.7 |328.0 | |rature | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lowest Temper-|319.4 |320.1 |319.2 |319.1 | |ature | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- We were able to obtain a 90% battery efficiency in 1-cycle-a-day operations; even when a heater loss is taken into account, we were able to obtain a high battery efficiency of 87%, much better than expected. (2) Characteristics Observed during Continuous One-Week Operations We evaluated the characteristics based on the basic operational pattern used in actual operations, viz., 1-cycle-a-day recharge-discharge operations on weekdays, resting on Saturdays and Sundays. The operations followed a set pattern of 8-hour recharging with the rated current of 122A, a 3-hour rest period, 8-hour discharging and 5-hour rest period (Dec. 14-20). We obtained the battery efficiency of 90%, and, when a heater was taken into account, the efficiency was 83%. (3) Stand-by Loss During the 10-day period, 26 December 1992-4 January 1993, we continued to stop battery operations from time to time to measure energy loss brought about by the use of a heater in the standby unit. The total amount of electricity consumed by a heater during the ten-day period was 549.5kWh, an average of 55kW (average electricity of the heater 2.3 kW) on a per-day basis. Fig. 6 shows relationship between the highest external temperature and the amount of electricity consumed by a heater. Effects of temperature, however, were not observed. Fig. 6. Loss Caused by Heater in Stand-by Unit and Outside 5. Summary and Future Issues Since the performance evaluation of the 50kW NaS battery has just begun, all we have only been able to accomplish thus far is to cover the battery's initial basic characteristics. Our plan is to continue with our validation test, evaluating the characteristics of the battery's long-range performance. The main problem associated with the NaS battery which must be dealt with is that of cost. The materials used in this validation test are for the purpose of research only and not the kind of materials generally used in industrial production. Our plan is to work on cost reduction through lower material costs and the automation of mass production process.
