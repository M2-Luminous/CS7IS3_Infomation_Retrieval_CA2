According to a FIPI communique made public in this capital, "members of the municipal police" last Sunday attacked Indian leaders Juan Rojas, Higinio Roman, Felipe Bolanos, Ezequiel Valdez, and Paula Sanchez in front of a public office in the town of Temascal, Oaxaca, some 370 km from Mexico City. The policemen "beat and fired high-caliber weapons" at the Indian leaders, who are members of the Directorate of the Chinanteco, Mazateco, and Cuicateco Regional Council, a branch of FIPI, the report added. The communique continued that two Indians "were injured" by policemen Ramon Coria, Domingo Vasquez, and Enrique Lara, who is the commander of the municipal police in Temascal. These policemen were "accompanied by nine other police agents armed with machine guns, pistols, and tear gas." According to FIPI, the attack was perpetrated "in retaliation" for the occupation of the local municipal office, which was taken over last Saturday by residents who demanded that the government reinstate the mayor and revise land expropriation cases. The State of Oaxaca borders Chiapas, where today a dialogue began between the government and the guerrillas to end the armed conflict that started 1 January with an Indian rebellion led by the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN).
