Talking to APP [Associated Press of Pakistan] in London before his departure for the United States, he denied that relations between Pakistan and America have suffered any setback. He said some people viewed relations only in the context of nuclear nonproliferation. Pakistan, in this context, has made it clear that it supported the principle of ban on nuclear proliferation in the entire world, including the South Asian region. To say that only Pakistan should do it and India should not do it, is not acceptable to Pakistan. Referring to his visit to the United States, he said he would hold talks at various levels covering foreign affairs, economy, and national security. He said he would also hold talks with officials of the IMF, exchange views with Congress House and Senate Committees, and a think tank on foreign affairs, besides meeting media organizations. The president was seen off at the Heathrow Airport by a representative of the queen; the acting Pakistan high commissioner, Mr. Moeen Jan Nayim; officials at the High Commission; and members of Pakistan community.
