Povilas Vaisnis, chief of the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Energy Safety, has indirectly confirmed the persistent rumors of Lithuania as a transit country for nuclear radiation. He did not refute or confirm the opinion of the German police that Vilnius and Kaunas are centers of nuclear smuggling, although the two largest Lithuanian cities can hardly aspire to such an "honorary" title. There is no doubt that, following the breakup of the USSR, Lithuania became a kind of transshipment base for various firms, groups, and clans engaged in transporting and selling dangerous freight to the West. But what of Lithuania itself, which, thanks to the presence of the Ignalina Nuclear Electric Power Station [AES] on its territory, possesses nuclear fuel and materials? Is it not the source of the nuclear exports? Lithuanian nuclear specialists unanimously deny this. Povilas Vaisnis believes that, despite the lack of juridical regulation of the control and accounting system at the Ignalina AES, nuclear fuel is kept under reliable guard in special storehouses. And yet the optimism is clearly exaggerated. Everybody remembers last year's sensational business when a nuclear fuel cassette went missing from the Ignalina AES and has still not been found. AES engineers estimate that one such cassette containing fuel is worth approximately $60,000 on the world market. If it had not been for stocktaking, even now nobody would have learned of the disappearance of that cassette. The investigative group never arrived at an unequivocal conclusion -- had it been removed from the territory of the AES, or had it simply "gotten lost" in the maze of nuclear bookkeeping? Lithuania signed the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and pledged to keep nuclear materials safe. A special inspectorate is also keeping a careful eye on this. A significant leak of nuclear fuel or radioactive waste is ruled out here. But the transportation of nuclear materials across Lithuania is something really real. "We are trying to close the route for the export of nuclear fuel," Povilas Vaisnis said, "but it is difficult for us. Not only do we not have the necessary equipment and apparatus, we also don't have specialists in the border and customs services or such work skills in exposing smuggling." Incidentally, local smugglers, for whom nuclear transit is a reliable means of making a fast buck, are perfectly well aware of these difficulties. Many have maintained links with the Russian market, and people in the know maintain that things go on at a very high level. Entry to this sphere of business is prohibited to ordinary businessmen engaged, for example, in the "copper business" or unscrewing nuts from railroad tracks. As a rule, failures and unpleasantness await those who attempt to engage in amateur activities. This, for example, was what happened to one R. Urbonas, a resident of Panevezys, who decided to make money out of selling several kilograms of uranium conveyed from beyond the Urals. He was caught and arrested by the police but, when asked where the uranium was, he replied that he had thrown it into the Nevezis River. At the insistence of the city's residents the frightened police dug up the whole riverbed but never found anything. Either the nuclear businessman had managed to sell the uranium in time, or the police failed to display sufficient zeal. Genuine nuclear slick operators do everything legally. They fall victim only to unforeseen circumstances. A graphic example is provided by the matter of a load of beryllium in containers given to the Lithuanian Joint-Stock Innovation Bank in Vilnius to store. The police stumbled across it by chance when checking a telephone report that a bomb had been planted. It is, however, possible that the call, far from being accidental, was a ploy [navodka] by rivals for the dangerous freight. It is curious that, according to documents, there was no contraband: The freight weighing four tonnes and worth approximately $123 million had a certificate, an official import permit to Lithuania, a customs note....
