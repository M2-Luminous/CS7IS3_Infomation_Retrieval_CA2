The move came in an order announced by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai which was carried in the March 7 edition of SAIGON GIAI PHONG. The order cautioned the MOI against allowing private businesses to act "in the names of police enterprises". It called on the MOI to "check the activities" of companies under its wing, and to dismiss managers found to be incompetent. The order also indicated that subsidies would only be forthcoming to business activities of the police force that are deemed to meet its needs. The MOI owns the Pacific Company, which operates a chain of hotels in major cities such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Vung Tau. In Hanoi, it owns the Boss Hotel which was among the first establishments in the capital to offer a discotheque and pool table. "The MOI has to report to the Prime Minister on the effectiveness of the hotel operations...and convert loss-making hotels into joint ventures with foreign partners in order to ensure effective use of capital," the order said. The Government further instructed the MOI to make optimum use of prison land, calling among other things for a "reorganisation" of the plantation of industrial crops. It also urged maximisation of prison labour "except for (that of) the old, ailing and political criminals." The order called on the MOI to turn over products made by prison labour and resources to the Government. It said proceeds from the products would be shared out as reward to worthy "cadres" and prisoners, and reinvested for expanded production. The order affirmed that the State Planning Committee had been assigned to work out a capital allocation plan for companies run by the MOI. It also made clear that none of these companies would be "equitised" -- in other words, be open to shareholdings by the general public. The State Planning Committee organises subsidies given to companies run by the MOI and the Ministry of Defence.
