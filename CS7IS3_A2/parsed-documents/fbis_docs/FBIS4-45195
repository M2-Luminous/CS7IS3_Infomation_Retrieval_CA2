He added that there is an atmosphere of confidence in the institutions and the force of law in Mexico. He also declared that the drug traffickers "are acting intensely," but claimed: "Our capacity for work, and our sense of organization and responsibility, will make it possible to achieve good results." On a working tour of Sinaloa State, accompanied by the state governor, he emphasized that the department headed by him "has nothing to hide" regarding its policy for fighting the drug traffic. Calling it "the policy set by the Federal Executive Branch," he said that "there is also a commitment to inform the citizens with absolute clarity." He expressed the view that the amendments to Articles 16, 19, 20, and 119 of the General Constitution of the Republic would make it possible to consolidate the prosecution of justice for the benefit of the citizens, adding that they expand the guarantees for those governed to a considerable extent. During his visit to Sinaloa, the attorney general opened the first regional branch office of the National Institute To Combat Drugs, headed by commissioner Raul Campos Rabago. There, he made an assessment of the battle against the drug trade, claiming Sinaloa to be one of the states in which this social cancer is being fought with the most intensity. He said that this is proven by the fact that, during the past four months of effort, as many drugs have been seized as during all of last year: 11 tons of marijuana. He cited the need not only to observe some negative aspects of the battle against this illicit activity, but also to consider the positive side, such as the search for and procurement of sufficient material resources and human personnel to fight these criminals. He remarked: "Thanks to the action that has been taken to counteract the drug traffic, the achievements have been positive from the standpoint of seizing drugs, as well as seizing both land and air transport vehicles."
