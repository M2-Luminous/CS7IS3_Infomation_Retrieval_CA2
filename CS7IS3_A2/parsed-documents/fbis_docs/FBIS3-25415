Bulger] [Text] Johannesburg Feb 16 SAPA -- The African National Congress [ANC] has given the go-ahead for a special sitting of Parliament to amend the constitution to provide for greater regional powers and a constitutional principle that could be the first step to an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland]. Annoucing sweeping concessions at Jan Smuts Airport near Johannesburg before embarking on a trip to Holland, ANC President Nelson Mandela said the ANC would call for a meeting of the multiparty forum leading to a special parliamentary sitting within days. Mr Mandela announced the ANC had also agreed to a double-ballot, virtual entrenchment of regional constitutions and greater regional taxation powers. He said the ANC had accepted the Natal Province could be renamed kwaZulu/Natal. Mr Mandela added the ANC agreed to another constitutional principle on the right to self-determination. The concessions appear at face value to meet the demands of the Afrikaner right-wing and the Inkatha Freedom Party.
