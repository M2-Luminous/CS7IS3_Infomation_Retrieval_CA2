FR941205-2-00120 FR941205-2-00066 Tariff Classification of Water Resistant Garments With Non-Water Resistant Hood AGENCY: U.S. Customs Service, Department of Treasury. ACTION: Proposed change of practice; solicitation of comments. SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 177.10(c)(1) of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.10(c)(1)), this notice advises the public that Customs proposes a change of practice regarding the classification of imported merchandise consisting of water resistant jackets with non-water resistant hoods, under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Customs has rules in the past that water resistant garments with non-water resistant hoods were classified as water resistant garments as per the terms of Chapter 62, HTSUS. After a thorough review of the issue, it is Customs opinion that the permanently attached hood of a garment is an integral part of the garment as a whole. As such, if the hood is not similarly coated (in the same manner as the jacket), the garment is precluded from classification as a water resistant garment. The result of this proposed change of practice would be an increase in the rate of duty on the subject merchandise. By this action, those rulings which are inconsistent with our current practice would be revoked. Before adopting this proposed change, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted in response to publication of this document. DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 3, 1995. ADDRESSES: Written comments (preferably in triplicate) may be addressed to U.S. Customs Service, Office of Regulations and Rulings, Attention: Regulations Branch, 1301 Constitution Avenue, N.W., (Franklin Court), Washington, D.C., 20229. Comments submitted may be inspected at the Regulations Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings, located at Franklin Court, 1099 14th St., NW., Suite 4000, Washington, D.C. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Josephine Baiamonte, Textile Classification Branch, (202) 482&hyph;7050. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Classification of merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) is in accordance with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI). GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative chapter notes. Chapter 62, HTSUS, provides for articles of apparel and clothing accessories not knitted or crocheted. Additional U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 62, HTSUS, in addressing the term ``water resistant'', refers to garments classified within certain subheadings of the chapter. On separate occasions, Customs determined that the hood was a peripheral aspect of the garment. Accordingly, when a water resistant analysis was conducted, no consideration was given to the hood, i.e., whether it was or was not water resistant. Several rulings were issued following this rationale. See DD 888234, DD884731, NY 887628 and NY 874163. This list may not be exhaustive. There may be others issued by Customs in the various Customs districts. Proposed Change of Practice As a result of our reexamination of the issue we find that Additional U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 62, HTSUS, has not been applied to its proper effect. There is nothing in the language of that Note which suggests that only a portion of a garment be made water resistant in order for the entire garment to be classifiable as water resistant. The test, as it is written, applies to the complete garment. On water resistant garments, the hood contributes materially to the garment's usefulness and, essentially, is an integral part of the garment itself. The hood adds significant additional protection to the wearer in times of inclement weather. This change in practice only relates to water resistant garments with non-water resistant hoods that are an integral part of the garment (i.e. permanently attached to the garment). Authority This notice is published in accordance with section 177.10, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.10). Comments Before adopting this proposed change in practice, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted to Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), section 1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Office of Regulations and Rulings, Franklin Court, 1099 14th Street, N.W., Suite 4000, Washington, D.C. George J. Weise, Commissioner of Customs. Approved: November 16, 1994. Dennis M. O'Connell, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.
