Thus, the chuche character and independence of our industry have been consistently strengthened and production is going up at a fast speed. Through the efforts to implement the idea and theory and policies set forth in the work, the party's economic policy propaganda and economic agitation have been activated and various forms of mass movements and socialist emulation drives have been dynamically conducted by the trade union organizations to powerfully encourage the working class and union members to the socialist economic construction.
