FR941116-0-00054 FR941116-0-00011 The commenters supporting the use of page 700 recommended that the pipeline be required to report its cost of service on each separate system operated by the pipeline. 34 Moreover, some commenters recommended that substantial additional information be required on page 700, setting forth in detail additional information and the assumptions used in the calculations. 35 Alberta recommended that the cost-of-service reporting requirements be implemented for Form No. 6 expense and income statements to streamline shipper review of the individual cost components, thereby making the information contained in page 700 consistent, from an accounting standpoint, with the other information contained in Form No. 6. 36 34 Total, pp. 1&hyph;2, Alaska, p. 2, Chevron, pp. 3&hyph;5. 35 Chevron, p. 5, Alaska, pp. 1&hyph;2, Alberta, pp. 2&hyph;3. 36 Alberta, p. 2. The pipelines, on the other hand, strenuously objected to the use of page 700 as a rate review tool and as a monitoring tool, asserting that it is misleading, burdensome, and duplicative. 37 37 AOPL, pp. 8&hyph;15, ARCO, pp. 9&hyph;14, Marathon, pp. 1&hyph;4. Contrary to what appears to be the assumption by most commenters, page 700 is designed to be a preliminary screening tool for pipeline rate filings. It is not intended to be the information which, in itself, either forms the basis of a Commission decision on the merits of a pipeline filing, or demonstrates that the pipeline's proposed or existing rates are just and reasonable. Rather, it should provide a means whereby a shipper can determine whether a pipeline's cost of service or per-barrel/mile cost is so substantially divergent from the revenues produced by its rates to warrant a challenge that requires the pipeline to justify its rates. Therefore, the additional information suggested by the commenters_e.g., specifying the achieved rate of return, rate of return assumptions, and the debt and equity components_will not be required. Moreover, the Commission is not here attempting to require a pipeline to demonstrate with precision its cost-of-service attributable to each individual pipeline system it operates. If the pipeline seeks a cost-of-service rate for some or all of its rates, it will be required at that time to demonstrate that its properly allocated costs justify such rate treatment. This, however, will be left to individual cost-of-service rate filings, not required as a part of Form No. 6, which is and shall remain primarily a financial report. Requests that the pipelines be required to file separate cost-of-service information for each individual system are denied. Likewise, the recommendations of the pipelines that page 700 be discarded will be denied. The Commission finds that the information contained in a single place in Form No. 6 will be useful in its monitoring of the performance of the index, and that the information may indeed be useful as a ``substantial divergence'' screen, as suggested by TE Products Pipeline. 38 Any additional burden should be minimal on the pipelines in deriving an Opinion No. 154&hyph;B cost of service on an annual basis, since much of the basic information is available in its Form No. 6. As explained above, the use of the page 700 should be limited and should not be misleading. As Marathon and AOPL point out, some of the information is already included in other schedules in Form No. 6. However, the Commission finds that having the information displayed on a single page 700 will make it easier for the Commission and other interested parties to analyze. 38 TE Products, p. 1. Davis 39 suggests that the Commission define ``substantial divergence as being a percentage [variation] *␣*␣*.'' The Commission will not adopt this suggestion, inasmuch as what constitutes a ``substantial divergence'' may depend on factors other than a simple percentage variation in costs and revenues. Therefore, the Commission concludes that whether a substantial divergence exists should be determined on the facts of individual cases, not generically. 39 Davis, p. 2. Chevron suggests that use of page 700 is likely to be meaningless as a monitoring tool, since the Commission is likely to get numerous interpretations of how the Opinion No. 154&hyph;B methodology should be implemented, thereby resulting in a compilation that does not reflect actual changes in costs on an industry-wide basis. 40 As previously stated, the Commission will require that any change in application of the Opinion No. 154&hyph;B methodology from one year to the next be described and reflected in the total cost of service calculations appearing on page 700. Moreover, the compilation of data from page 700 will be only a part of the evidence used by the Commission for monitoring how the index tracks industry cost changes. 40 Chevron, p. 5. Upon consideration of the comments, the Commission has determined that Form No. 6 should contain information that will permit its use for a number of purposes: Reviewing changes in rates made by use of the index, monitoring existing rates, and analyzing and auditing finances. At present, the primary focus of Form No. 6 is on financial accounting information that is gathered based on accounting principles which are different in some respects from the ratemaking principles used to establish rates for oil pipelines. To serve as a tool to evaluate the performance of the index and future changes in oil pipeline rates using the index methodology, Form No. 6 will be revised to include additional information. Revisions to Form No. 6 are needed to provide at least a preliminary basis for shipper assessments of filed rate changes under Order No. 561. Form No. 6 data should be complete enough to enable an evaluation of whether a proposed rate change under indexing substantially exceeds the pipeline's changes in costs. As currently structured, Form No. 6 does not provide sufficient information to do this.
