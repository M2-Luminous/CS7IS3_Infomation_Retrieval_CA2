Casimir Oye-Mba appointed 38 persons to this government [words indistinct] because those who think this government is too large are the very same people who felt that some of the country's nine provinces were underrepresented. Regarding the refusal of two appointees to join the government, the Gabonese prime minister stressed that such refusals are normal in a system that has renounced the one-party system and which guarantees freedom of action and expression. Listen to Casimir Oye- Mba interviewed by Jean Valere Mbinamanza: [Begin recording] [Oye-Mba] Your question assumes people are bound to the rules of the one-party system. Previously, people were not consulted before being asked to join the government. They heard on the radio that they were made ministers. In the same way, they heard on the radio that they ceased to be ministers. People did not resign, or if they did there was little discussion about it. Gabonese must know that we are now in a pluralist system. If someone is asked to join the government, he is free to accept or refuse. [Mbinamanza] What we do not understand very well in this case which has already marked the beginning of this government from which much is expected, is that these persons were supposed to have been consulted first and then to have later declined the offer to join the government. [Oye-Mba] This can be attributed to the behavior of politicians! [Mbinamanza] In that case do you feel somehow trapped? [Oye-Mba] Not at all! I am not bothered. I am prime minister today and as long as I remain so, I will continue to do my work with those who are willing. Tomorrow, when I cease to be prime minister I will do something else and someone else will come to continue. [end recording] I recall that former Minister of State Jean-Francois Ntoutoume and Jean-Pierre Bayena, two of the 38 persons called upon to join the new Gabonese Government, declined this offer with the argument that there was nothing coherent in the portfolios they were offered. Finally, Casimir Oye-Mba said he would ask for a vote of confidence by the National Assembly at the right time and that he did not fear in any way a vote of no confidence.
