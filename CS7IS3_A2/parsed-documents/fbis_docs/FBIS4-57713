FBIS4-57713 "drlat100_t_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-100 Daily Report 22 May 1994 Venezuela AD Deputy Requests Dismissal of Alfaro AD Deputy Requests Dismissal of Alfaro PA2405043794 Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 22 May 94 PA2405043794 Caracas Union Radio Network Spanish BFN [Report by Cecilia Cayone from the "Union Radio News"] [Text] Democratic Action [AD] Deputy Hector Alonso Lopez today requested that Luis Alfaro Ucero be dismissed from the secretary generalship. Here is Cecilia Cayone with a report: [Begin recording] [Cayone] AD leader Alonso Lopez made the announcement during a news conference he called to explain the reasons for his request. [Alonso Lopez, in progress]...so internal party elections are convened to elect Claudio Fermin as new AD secretary general. I see the Carlos Andres Perez case as the lethal weapon Alfaro Ucero is wielding to dash Fermin's hopes of becoming the new AD leader [words indistinct]. The real problem here is that Alfaro Ucero wants to perpetuate himself as leader and does not want to give Claudio Fermin an opportunity. Alfaro Ucero is spreading rumors that Claudio Fermin is the candidate of Carlos Andres Perez, thus seeking to divide AD between Perez supporters and opponents, between corrupt and honest people. This is unacceptable. [Cayone] Deputy Alonso Lopez also underscored that, according to reports available to him, there is a plan brewing in AD to expel him, Claudio Fermin, Luis Emilio Rondon, and Antonio Ledezma. Asked about the possibility that Alfaro Ucero may refuse to resign, Alonso Lopez replied: [Alonso Lopez] Some day it will be written that Luis Alfaro Ucero founded AD and ended up burying it. [Cayone] Alonso Lopez added that he will make a formal request to dismiss Luis Alfaro Ucero from the secretary generalship during the National Directors Committee. [end recording]
