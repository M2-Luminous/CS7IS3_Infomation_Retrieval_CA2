Despite diplomatic efforts by Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus to secure the post for Central America, Niehaus obtained only 14 votes, including one from Panama. For our country, however, this was a very difficult decision, because both candidates hailed from neighboring countries with which we maintain good relations -- Colombia and Costa Rica. In statements to RPC Radio, Panamanian President Guillermo Endara voiced his belief that Gaviria will do a good job and that the OAS will assume a new role under his leadership. [Begin recording] [Endara] Although we were committed to Costa Rica, I am certain President Gaviria will prove to be a historic OAS secretary general. I think the time during which the OAS was a dormant, inactive organization has ended. We will now see a new OAS with Gaviria as secretary general. We will see a dynamic OAS -- an OAS that will promote democracy in the hemisphere, one that will promote liberty. [Reporter] Mr. President, as for Panama, what expectations does the Panamanian Government have in the wake of the Colombian President's election? [Endara] President Gaviria reiterated to me -- in fact, he has told me repeatedly since he began his bid for the post of secretary general -- that regardless of how Panama voted, he wanted to have Panama's support, much like Panama would want to have his support. I told him that if he was indeed elected, Panama would support him not only during my presidency, but that I am certain any and all of the seven presidential candidates will also support him. I told him I could guarantee this support, because we will have a four-month transition period during which I hope to maintain good relations with the winner of the Panamanian elections. I also told him I am sure we will agree that the new president should support Gaviria at the OAS. [Reporter] Mr. President, do you think the support the United States gave the Colombian president's candidacy was the decisive factor in today's vote? [Endara] No, no, no. I honestly do not think so. Our vote is an example. Although the United States lobbied strongly through diplomatic channels, I think President Gaviria has merits of his own and qualities that make him an excellent candidate. Gaviria, in my opinion, would have won even without U.S. backing. [end recording] Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, 47, will probably assume the post of OAS secretary general in August.
