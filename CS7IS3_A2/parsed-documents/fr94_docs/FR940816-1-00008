FR940816-1-00008 FR940816-1-00003 Inapplicability of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and Executive Order 12866 Since the regulation proposed seeks to alleviate regulatory burdens rather than impose new ones, it does not constitute a ``major rule'' for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq ., and is, therefore, not subject to its provisions. Further, this document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in E.O. 12866. Drafting Information The principal author of this document was Gregory R. Vilders, Office of Regulations and Rulings, Regulations Branch. However, personnel from other offices participated in its development.

Section 101.3 and 101.4 also issued under 19 U.S.C. 1 and 58b; Section 101.9 also issued under 19 U.S.C. 1411&hyph;1414. 2. It is proposed to amend part 101 by adding a new ยง101.9 to read as follows: ยง101.9 Test programs or procedures; alternate requirements. (a) General testing. For purposes of conducting a test program or procedure designed to evaluate the effectiveness of new technology or operational procedures regarding the processing of passengers, vessels, or merchandise, the Commissioner of Customs may impose requirements different from those specified in the Customs Regulations, but only to the extent that such different requirements do not affect the collection of the revenue, public health, safety, or law enforcement. The imposition of any such different requirements shall be subject to the following conditions: (1) Defined purpose. The test is limited in scope, time, and application to such relief as may be necessary to facilitate the conduct of a specified program or procedure; (2) Prior publication requirement. For tests affecting the entry of merchandise, whenever practicable, notice shall be published in the Federal Register not less than thirty days prior to implementing such test, followed by publication in the Customs Bulletin. The notice shall invite public comments concerning the methodology of the test program or procedure, and inform interested members of the public of the eligibility criteria for voluntary participation in the test and the basis for selecting participants. For tests affecting the entry of passengers or carriers, no public notice is required. (b) NCAP testing. For purposes of conducting an approved test program or procedure designed to evaluate planned components of the National Customs Automation Program (NCAP), as described in section 411(a)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 411), the Commissioner of Customs may impose requirements different from those specified in the Customs Regulations, but only to the extent that such different requirements do not affect the collection of the revenue, public health, safety, or law enforcement. In addition to the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the imposition of any such different requirements shall be subject to the following conditions: (1) Prior publication requirement. For tests affecting the NCAP, notice shall be published in the Federal Register not less than thirty days prior to implementing such test, followed by publication in the Customs Bulletin. The notice shall invite public comments concerning any aspect of the test program or procedure, and inform interested members of the public of the eligibility criteria for voluntary participation in the test and the basis for selecting participants; and, (2) Post publication requirement. Within a reasonable time period following the completion of the test, a complete description of the results shall be published in both the Federal Register and the Customs Bulletin. George J. Weise, Commissioner of Customs. Approved: August 5, 1994. John P. Simpson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.
