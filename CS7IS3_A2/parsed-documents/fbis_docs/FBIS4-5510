The joint meeting discussed practical measures to implement the "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country" personally worked out by the great leader President Kim Il-song, on the occasion of the first anniversary of its publication. In his report at the meeting Yang Hyong-sop, alternate Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, proposed to hold a national conference whereby the seventy million Koreans in the North and the South and abroad can find the way of achieving the great unity of the whole nation transcending ideology and system as the same fellow countrymen. In this regard he said: "The national conference may be held in the form of a roundtable conference in which the authorities and representatives of political parties and public organizations and individual personages in the North and the South and representatives of Koreans overseas participate on an equal footing. "The meeting may open-heartedly discuss concerns of the whole nation, including practical measures to attain the great unity of the whole nation and common tasks of the nation raised as indispensable requisites to achieving the national reunification at an early date in the '90s. "We consider it necessary to form a preparatory committee for the national conference consisting of five delegates each from the North and the South and abroad in order to successfully hold the national conference. "We think it advisable to have the first session either in Pyongyang or in Seoul toward mid-May in order to run the preparatory committee for the national conference. "Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we hold that the South Korean authorities should discontinue nuclear war exercises and abandon the (international cooperation system) from the stand of national independence for the sake of the great unity of the whole nation and thus create a favourable atmosphere for the convocation of the national conference." The joint meeting adopted a letter addressed to the South Korean authorities, political parties, public organizations and individual personages and Koreans overseas containing the proposal of holding a national conference.
