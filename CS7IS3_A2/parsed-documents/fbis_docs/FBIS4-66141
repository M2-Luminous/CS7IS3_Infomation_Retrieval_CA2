The poll indicated that 68 percent of the sample see a "significant" risk of a growth in neo-fascism in Europe, and only 26 percent believe there is no such risk. Italy's National Alliance, which has five ministers in the Berlusconi government, was known until earlier this year as the Italian Social Movement, the post-war heir to Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party. According to the LA VIE poll, only 28 percent of the sample believe the EU should impose no boycott on the Alliance ministers and 18 percent had no opinion, just as many as denied that Berlusconi is a "populist demagogue." But even if many French are critical of Berlusconi's political style, as many as 37 percent believe he may have the qualities to get Italy back on the rails. Thirty percent disagreed with this suggestion. The poll suggested that 36 percent of the sample believe the Berlusconi phenomenon would be impossible in France, while 16 percent didn't know.
