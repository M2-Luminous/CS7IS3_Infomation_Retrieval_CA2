Of those interviewed (between the two cantonal election rounds), 40 percent have confidence in Edouard Balladur's capacity "to cope efficiently with the main problems the country is facing," while 45 percent think otherwise. Meanwhile, Francois Mitterrand's rating indicates an opposite trend, with 45 percent of those responding with positive appraisals against 39 percent negative. This is the first time since March 1993 that the head of state leads his prime minister in a poll.
