The letter stresses that it would be illogical and inadequate for the Republic of Croatia, which is proposing and advocating a peace solution, to undertake a military offensive in the most critical phase of the peace negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina, let alone to engage in open military intervention. Minister Granic recalls that the Croat areas in central Bosnia, and around Zepce in particular, have been exposed to constant, relentless attacks by the Muslim army which did not even observe a tripartite Christmas truce. He also recalls that UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] reports did not confirm Bosnian government accusations of military intervention by the Croatian Army and that the UNPROFOR report said there was no proof of a significant deployment of the Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Taking these objective facts into consideration, Prime Minister Silajdzic's accusations ought to be treated as unfounded, Minister Granic said. According to him, the form, sharpness, and timing of Silajdzic's obviously unfounded accusations against my government make me believe that the Muslim side is neither ready nor willing to accept peace negotiations in good faith at the moment. In his letter to the Security Council chairman, Minister Granic reiterated his invitation to Silajdzic to return to the negotiating table, even before the new round of the Geneva negotiations to be held on 10 February, and to get involved in fresh efforts in order to find a tenable political solution based on already accepted principles and solutions for an alliance of the three equal constituent nations. In conclusion, the minister recalls that Croatian President Dr Franjo Tudjman has twice so far asked for complete international supervision of all borders of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. He has also on several occasions asked for the complete demilitarization of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This has been and will be the policy of my government, Granic's letter says.
