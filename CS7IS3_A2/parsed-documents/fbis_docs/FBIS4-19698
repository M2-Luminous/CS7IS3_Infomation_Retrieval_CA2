He added that agreement with the IMF is like sharing the state's economic sovereignty with an international corporation. At his party's assembly meeting, Yilmaz said that the information communicated to the public regarding Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's visit to the United States is unsatisfactory. Indicating that the public is being given the impression that the visit was very successful, Yilmaz added that the contents of this success are not clarified. Asserting that the real aim of this visit was to procure foreign financial support for the stability measures, Yilmaz claimed that there can be no mention of a basic feasibility package and added that there is an attempt to camouflage the package with an IMF cloak. Yilmaz indicated that Turkey faces a heavy price because the coalition government did not take the necessary measures in time. Indicating that Turkey had $7 billion worth of foreign currency in the Central Bank in November 1993, Yilmaz said that today there are no foreign currencies Turkey can make use of in the Central Bank. [Begin Yilmaz recording] The election wasted $7 billion in six months. Now, the total credit the prime minister with her large delegation and with her numerous meetings obtained is $640 million. $640 million is the amount allocated to Turkey and we cannot obtain this amount at one time. We can only withdraw the money as long as we implement the measures and the IMF approves of them step by step. [end recording] Yilmaz stressed that the United Nations and NATO are incapacitated regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina. Yilmaz stated that UN secretary general should immediately resign in case Gorazde, which is under the protection of the United Nations, is captured by the Serbs. Recalling the announcement that compulsory savings will be refunded, Yilmaz said that it is not right that a small amount will be paid to those that have contributed continually for six years. Explaining that the tax bill is not just, Yilmaz said that 6 million people are outside the tax bracket and 3 million people are overtaxed. Yilmaz noted that the results of all the measures is 200 trillion Turkish lira [TL] and added that the state lost much more than TL200 trillion with the devaluation and the rise in the rate of interest. Expressing their worries that all the sacrifices will be in vain, Yilmaz said that without controlling the rate of interest and foreign currency, public debt will not be reduced.
