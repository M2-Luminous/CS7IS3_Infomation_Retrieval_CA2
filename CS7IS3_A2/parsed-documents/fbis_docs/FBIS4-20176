Can you comment on the consequences of the effort to impose a solution on Cyprus? [Denktas] My will depends on how I can successfully represent the Turkish Cypriot people. I am trying to conclude an agreement that will be acceptable to my people. The Republican Assembly will endorse the agreement that is made. Meanwhile, we will have to hold a referendum in accordance with our Constitution. That is because the matter concerns the question of territory. So, what do those who put pressure on me to say yes to this or that stand to gain from something that is imposed on me in one way or another if I fail to have it endorsed by the Republican Assembly and if I lose in the referendum? In that case, I will have to disappear. Therefore, those who are convinced that they can conclude an agreement that conflicts with the Turkish Cypriot people's will are mistaken. That cannot be done. [Akpinar] What do you mean by saying that you will have to disappear? [Denktas] I would have to withdraw. If my people do not support the agreement I conclude, then I would be forced to disappear from the scene. That would mean that I have been unsuccessful in representing their will. That is why I wish to inform the people that that is what I have given, this is what we have gotten in return, it is substantial, and it belongs to us. However, they [UN officials] have failed to give a tangible form to what will be given to us until now. They have failed to include what we will receive in the package. They have said: "Sign and then we will see what can be done." They have made a promise that they "will give." How can that be? [Akpinar] Statements have been made to the effect that Turkey is the country that has suffered most from the no-solution situation. Can you comment on them? [Denktas] That is a matter of how one looks at the problem. It is a fact that the Cyprus problem has constantly gotten in the way Turkey's contacts with foreign countries. That is why Turkey sincerely wants to have the problem solved, that is, in an honorable way. It wants the security of the Turkish Cypriots to be guaranteed. It also wants the concessions to be reciprocal. We have moved together with Turkey on those matters so far. I believe that there has not been a change in that regard. [Akpinar] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said: "We are determined to have the Cyprus problem solved and we stand to gain most from the solution of that problem." Would a hasty solution on the basis of territorial concessions, that is, as in the case of Maras, create a problem that will force the Turkish Cypriots to make additional concessions on the territorial issue in the future? [Denktas] Naturally, it will. We have to foil the designs that are against us in the talks. For example, I wish to recall a design related to the documents and maps that were submitted as non-documents and non-maps. We were asked to agree to discuss them. Later, however, they were suddenly changed against us and described as the "UN secretary general's proposals." They were then submitted to the UN Security Council to be approved. That is the trick that has to be blocked. The Turkish Cypriot people must not be a part in it. Nor should Turkey be involved in such an approach. Otherwise, we do not stand to gain anything. [Akpinar] How would you define an honorable, just, and durable solution to the problem? [Denktas] An honorable, just, and durable solution must provide for a bizonal agreement. It must definitely be a balanced solution, which will provide for political equality and sovereignty rights for the two sides. We can build upon those principles, provided they are accepted. If any one of the concepts of equality, right to sovereignty, balance, and the maintenance of Turkey's effective guarantee is put aside or weakened, then the matter will end right there and then. The Greek Cypriot side's objective is to either remove or effectively weaken all those concepts by quickly joining the European Union. They are clearly moving to achieve that plan. We have to say something against that. We have to declare that we will break off the talks if the Greek Cypriots pursue that plan and if the inclination to allow Cyprus to become a member of the European Union in the light of the conviction that the Greek Cypriots represent the Cyprus Government is maintained. That is the point we have arrived at. The pressure that has been directed at us is forcing us to take further steps. It is time to show that we will not yield to pressure.
