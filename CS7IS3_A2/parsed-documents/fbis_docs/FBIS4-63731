"Considering the present conditions, we should have laid off at least 30,000 Southern Railroads employees. Railroad workers have not been paid since January. The railroad used to get its main profit from freight which accounted for 90 percent of the entire workload. But now freight makes up only 21 percent of the business, with 79 percent taken up by passenger and commuter travel and overall traffic constantly declining. The situation is the same on Ukraine's five other railroad networks."
