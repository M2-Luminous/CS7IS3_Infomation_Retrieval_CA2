FR940527-0-00012 FR940527-0-00004 (4) The name and title of the person or persons responsible for denying the request; and (5) An explanation of the right to appeal the denial and of the procedures for submitting an appeal, including the address of the official to whom appeals should be submitted. (6) Whenever the Corporation makes a record available subject to the deletion of a portion of the record, such action shall be deemed a denial of a record for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section. §1102.9 Appeals of denials. (a) Any person whose written request has been denied is entitled to appeal the denial within thirty calendar days of issuance thereof by writing to the CEO of the Corporation at its headquarters. The envelope and letter should be clearly marked: ``Freedom of Information Appeal.'' An appeal need not be in any particular form, but should adequately identify the denial, if possible, by describing the requested record, identifying the official who issued the denial, and providing the date on which the denial was issued. (b) No personal appearance, oral argument, or hearing will ordinarily be permitted on appeal of a denial. Upon request and a showing of special circumstances, however, this limitation may be waived and an informal conference may be arranged with the Corporation CEO, or the CEO's designated representative, for this purpose. (c) The appeal decision of the CEO, or the CEO's designated representative, shall be in writing and, in the event the denial is in whole or in part upheld, shall contain an explanation responsive to the arguments advanced by the requester, the matters described in §1102.8(a) (1) through (4), and the provisions for judicial review of such decision under section 552(a)(4) of the FOIA. The appeal decision shall be dispatched to the requester within twenty working days after receipt of the appeal, unless an additional period is justified pursuant to §1102.5(c). The appeal decision shall constitute the final action of the Corporation. All such decisions shall be treated as final opinions under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). §1102.10 Fees. (a) Records provided routinely in the normal course of doing business will be provided at no charge. (b) Fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search, duplication, and review, when records are for a commercial use request; (c) Fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for duplication when records are not sought through a commercial use request and the request is made by an educational institution or non-commercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research, or a representative of the news media; and (d) For any request not described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for search, review and duplication. (e) The schedule of charges for services regarding the production or disclosure of the Corporation's records is as follows: (1) Whenever feasible, for manual searches and reviews: The basic rate(s) of pay of the employee(s) making the search and review plus 16 percent of the rate(s) to cover benefits. (2) Computer time: Because of the diversity in the types of configurations of computers which may be required in responding to requests for records maintained in whole or part in computerized form, it is not feasible to establish a uniform schedule of fees for search and printout of such records. The charge for personnel time shall be the basic rate(s) of pay of the employee(s) involved plus 16 percent of the rate(s) to cover benefits. The charge for the computer time involved and for any special supplies or materials used shall not exceed the direct cost to the Corporation. (3) Duplication of records: A per-page charge for paper copy reproduction of documents. At present, the charge is $0.10 per page. (4) Duplication of microform: Actual charges as incurred. (5) Certification of true copies: $1.00 each. (6) Packing and mailing records: Actual charges as incurred. (7) Special delivery or express mail: Actual charges as incurred. (f) A record shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees established under paragraph (e) of this section if disclosure of the record is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. (1) In order to determine whether disclosure of the record ``is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government,'' the Corporation will consider the following four criteria: (i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government''; (ii) The informative value of the record to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding of government operations or activities; (iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested record will contribute to ``public understanding''; and (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to public understanding of government operations or activities. (2) In order to determine whether disclosure of a record ``is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,'' the Corporation will consider the following two factors: (i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so, (ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.'' (3) A denial of a request for a waiver or reduction of fees will be subject to appeal in the same manner as appeals from denial of a request for information under §1102.9.
