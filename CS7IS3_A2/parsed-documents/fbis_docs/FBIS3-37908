He declared this in his interview with Interfax in the Kremlin on Thursday. He believes that a civil war "has been going on in Russia for a long time already," thousands of killed, millions of refugees, more than 15 Mn people with incomes far below the subsistence minimum are victims of this war. In connection with this, Zyuganov pointed to the following historical parallel -- after the civil war of 1917-1920, national reconciliation in Russia took place only in 1941 when "the people willy-nilly had to struggle for their survival." Zyuganov believes that "today the situation is reminiscent of this historical parallel." Zyuganov pointed out that the president and government should express their point of view regarding the amnesty. "This is not an issue about which only press secretaries can speak," he noted. Zyuganov believes that liberation of the participants of the August 1991 and October 1993 events "will not bring any sharp destabilization into the nation's political life." "As a matter of fact, such people as Lukyanov, Kryuchkov, that is, people who enjoy a great political reputation, and are quite experienced, have been freed and they are productively working in Russia's favor," he said. "We rule out the notion of "revenge" as a political term," noted Zyuganov. A State Duma deputy Aleksandr Nevzorov, a prominent TV journalist, who was nearby, declared: "We have granted amnesty not only to those who participated in the 1991 and 1993 events on both sides but by means of this act we have granted amnesty to Yeltsin himself."
