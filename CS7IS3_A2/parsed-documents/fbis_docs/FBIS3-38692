Dockers immediately called a sympathy strike with workers of the Sud-Marine ship repair yard, vowing not to return to work until police were withdrawn. A total of 615 Sud-Marine workers welded up the port gates last Wednesday occupying it round-the-clock. Freight handling was paralysed and some ferry traffic was diverted to the nearby port of Toulon. A court ordered the bankrupt Sud-Marine into liquidation on January 6, setting a February 15 deadline for it to sell off its assets and fire the 615. The dockers' strike paralysed the whole of the port on Monday, including the oil and chemicals terminal at Fos-sur-Mer in the west. The Sud-Marine action had affected only the eastern part of the port.
