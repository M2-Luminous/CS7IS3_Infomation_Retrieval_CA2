It says: U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher returned for a new tour of the Middle East after this region witnessed disgraceful events between his current and previous tour. We also believe he has no plan to end the region's grievances and sufferings, as well as Israel's terrorism and tyranny. As an example, we would like to mention the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the killing of innocent worshipers in the mosque by Israeli settlers, as well as the continued killing of the sons of the Palestinian people. The United Nations has condemned that terrorism and crime and stressed the need to find international protection for the Palestinians, but the United States voiced its biased reservations about some of the provisions. [passage omitted] We also demand that the unjust blockade, which the United States has imposed on Iraq's people in order to plunder the oil wealth in the region, undeterred by law or conscience, be lifted. Regarding Jordan, we can say that despite the statements the U.S. secretary of states made on several occasions that Jordan is a friendly country and maintains cordial relations with his country, the United States is still exercising, under UN cover, these cordial relations with a blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba, in order to maintain the interests of its servants in the Arab world and Israel and to harm Jordan's economic status. As some media organizations say, the United States is dissatisfied with democracy in Jordan because any attempt by neighboring Arab countries to follow suit will threaten its servants' regimes. Despite all this, the United States urges Jordan to continue peace talks with Israel under the usual U.S. sponsorship of peace conferences.
