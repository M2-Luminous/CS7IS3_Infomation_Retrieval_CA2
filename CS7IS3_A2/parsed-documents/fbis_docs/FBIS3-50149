I have the feeling that the people who argue this way base their criticism on a misunderstanding of the first post-November period and a somewhat superficial observation of the present stage of the historical regeneration of our country, and since this is a serious matter, it merits a few words of explanation. If we take as the first example the economic basis of our transformation program, the intensity with which I fought in the spring of 1990 for the price liberalization, balanced budget, macroeconomic stability, and particularly privatization is being compared with my present alleged leniency in the matter of the rent and transport tariffs regulation, in the disputes over supplementing the state budget from the National Property Fund or the postponement of the beginning of the second wave of coupon privatization. These critics here note a contradiction that is beyond my comprehension. My original fight for freedom of enterprise and the abolition of all forms of state interventionism is being compared with my present endeavors to regulate the super-fast development in wages. Another sin! Today, the fundamentally negative stand I assumed against the gradualist project of the economic reform (represented particularly by V. Komarek, M. Zeman, and F. Vlasak) is contrasted with my own gradualism in the matters of the state administration reform, for instance, or the education reform. Again, an alleged inconsistency! While in the past I have been often described as the chief engineer of the "shock therapy," a Friedmanite, and an ultra-right character, I am being attacked today, from the side of the so-called authentic right wing, for my -- according to them -- unwarranted social regards and hesitance in adopting more severe and risky economic and social solutions. Almost a state paternalism! My merciless criticism of the so-called third way is presently being compared with my endeavors to explain to the Western governments where their real mistake lies. My consistently negative stand towards the communist past is being contrasted with my willingness to cooperate with the widest possible circle of able people who are ready to act. My calls for freedom of the press and speech are being contrasted with my alleged efforts to place the radio and television under the direct control of the government. I could go on like this for quite a while longer. First of all, I must point out that I listen to these criticisms very carefully, and that from each of them I am trying to reach some conclusions for myself. Nevertheless, I believe that they are based on false assumptions, which are the idea of the inconsistency of my present and former views, on the one hand, and the idea of the equivalence of the tasks of January 1990 and those of January 1994, on the other hand! The ensuing misunderstanding (I cannot rid myself of this so frequently reminded and caricatured word of mine) troubles me nonetheless, and therefore I keep trying to explain the reasons for it in the press, at political talks, or at meetings with citizens. Even in this brief text, I would like to make at least two general comments on this. The first problem that causes complications is the communication between a politician and the public by means of the deceptive transmission mechanism of media. Politics is -- among other things -- the art of the correct usage of the words, which are ordinarily at the politician's disposal only in the degenerate form of slogans, signs, certain cliches, and especially dangerous simplifications. A politician unfortunately does not have the opportunity to express his ideas and views in extensive essays or even novels, or rather, if he does, he does not do so as a politician. The situation forces him to express himself in a condensed manner, therefore necessarily imprecisely, and -- let us not be afraid to admit it -- often dogmatically and schematically. I will give a small example. If the Czech, or more correctly "Prague" economic school (which is a daring exaggeration) had at least a small comparative advantage in anything at all in the present economy, it would be, for instance, in its understanding that the term "central planning" represents only a hypothetic model concept, and that nothing like that has actually existed in the real socialism of the past decades. Although -- as opposed to standard economics -- I am well aware of this, in the every-day political abbreviation, I defend the free market against central planning because I cannot do anything else. (Nevertheless, it could have been noticed that I avoid the cheap condemnation of various institutions and mechanisms of the past, and instead always try for a positive program). I would like to emphasize that I feel awkward using such and similar thought abridgements and slogans and, in particular, I am concerned that I could discombobulate someone and elicit false expectations of a similar brevity of the practical solutions. I am afraid that some of our somewhat tardy revolutionaries of the turn of the years 1993/1994 would, still today, like to see changes that would be just as fast in actual life as they are in the words used. Some of these people perceive our temporarily lower rate of unemployment as a betrayal of the ideas of Milton Friedman, others compare the present "oppression" of businessmen with the period of the government of Klement Gottwald, yet others interpret the search for a complex transformation of the budget-funded and subsidized organizations into non-profit organizations and the optimum relations between sponsors and the tax system as a denial of the foundations of the civic society and Michael Novak's concept of "mediating structures." Of course, this is completely false, but all that remains is to be careful with the condensed slogans, and keep explaining patiently what is concealed behind them. The other important element is that our society and the economy -- without us realizing this sufficiently well because of the tremendous speed of the changes -- are no longer reminiscent of almost anything of the political and economic structures of the period immediately after the November. The problems that we are dealing with today are miles from the problems of spring 1990, i.e. from the period immediately after the fall of communism. Some of us insist on underestimating this factor. They forget the difference between demolishing and building, the difference between the spectacular pivotal measures (there are several of them) and the assiduous every-day work, and the disparity of the fast system-forming steps and the slow post-transformation tasks, they forget the one-dimensional character of the political, social, and economic reality then, and the vigor and wealth of life today, they forget the greater possibilities for adopting rapid measures then, and the complex system of our political life now. Moreover, our oversensitivity to the excesses of the past very logically puts our government in a much weaker position than that of an ordinary Western European government. All this fundamentally affects, and to a great degree complicates, our life today, but we have to take it as a given circumstance. This also applies to our critics. It is my deepest conviction that the practical politics of the present are completely consistent with the stands we have proclaimed incessantly since November 1989. The dissatisfaction and impatience of some of us is not a result of the errors of the present, but rather stem from a misunderstanding of the essence of the present system and, for that matter, also of the past one.
