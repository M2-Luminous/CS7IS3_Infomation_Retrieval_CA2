In a statement to AL-DUSTUR, 'Abbas Zaki, member of the Fatah Central Committee, said that Palestinian citizens purchase weapons under the slogan of self-defense, not under militant slogans. He said that the purchases are not carried out at central instructions, adding that this situation would create uncontrollable chaos. 'Abbas Zaki added: We discovered an Israeli plan to sow sedition among citizens in the occupied territory. He warned the fighters, particularly the Fatah Hawks, against carrying their weapons and shooting in the streets. He said: The Israeli enemy is encouraging such manifestations within the framework of its preparation for a civil war. Zaki disclosed that the Israelis are propagating a particular type of weapon which is also a detector. This weapon, he added, transmits signals which will help the Israeli soldiers, who carry electronic devices, locate this weapon and arrest its carrier. He added that one of the Fatah cadres was arrested by this method although he was in a safe place. Meanwhile, he said, the Israeli Army was unable to arrest this cadre's colleague who lost his weapon in a fedayeen operation. 'Abbas Zaki said: The Israeli Army can collect these weapons if they are used against it anytime it wants. [passage omitted]
