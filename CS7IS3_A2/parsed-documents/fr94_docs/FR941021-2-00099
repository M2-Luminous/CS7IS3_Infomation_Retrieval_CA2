T. 5 N., R. 27 E., I.M., Sec. 16, N1/2SE1/4NE1/4, SW1/4, S1/2NE1/4SE1/4, N1/2NW1/4SE1/4; and SW1/4NW1/4SE1/4; Sec. 19, NE1/4NE1/4, SW1/4,NW1/4, and W1/2SE1/4NW1/4; Sec. 20, N1/2NE1/4; Sec. 21, NW1/4NW1/4. The coal seams present in the application area are the Lower Hartshorne Coal (in places, the Upper Hartshorne Coal may be recoverable). The application area contains about 9 miles of cropline. USGS CRO&hyph;CDP reports cover the Western 5.5 miles of the application area. These reports show that there are four slope mines along the Lower Hartshorne cropline. No information on coal quantity and quality, or the areal extent of mining is available. The Eastern seven miles of the application area has been strip mined. Thirty two drill holes have been identified in or near the application area. These holes provide adequate coal quantity data for about one-third of the application area. Coal thickness of the Lower Hartshorne is 5.6 feet. Total disturbance would be about 1,910.00 acres. Total recoverable coal reserves are estimated to be 18,290,200 tons. There are 16 quality analysis points in or near the application area. The following analysis for the Lower Hartshorne Coal provide adequate coal quality data for about one-third of the application area: Moisture_unknown; Volatile Matter_20.4 percent; Fixed Carbon_68.3 percent; Ash_10.5 percent; Sulfur_1.2 percent; and BTU/lb_13,850.
