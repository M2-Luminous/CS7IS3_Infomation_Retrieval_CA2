It should be added right away, however, that the military was simply doing its job in the skies above Banja Luka yesterday: The intercepted aircraft were returning from an offensive mission in violation of the UN resolutions; air patrols had been in operation above Bosnia for many months within the context of Operation Deny Flight; before firing their missiles the American pilots observed all the rules of engagement, including a double warning. But precisely because the attack did faithfully follow established procedures, precisely because its official legitimacy is beyond question, this sudden baptism of fire for NATO 45 years after its foundation raises an issue which it is not for the military to resolve: Is it right, is it opportune, at this time of a delicate search for peace in Bosnia, for the alliance's air forces to open fire on the basis of an automatic decision entirely independent of any ratification in terms of political will? According to news reports, NATO's decisionmaking chain worked well. But Bill Clinton heard about the incident after the event, it does not seem that any of the allied governments were consulted before the patrolling "top guns" were given the go-ahead, and even the blue helmets' commander, General Rose, was informed after the event. In normal operational conditions, all this would be obligatory: When the military is backed up by a political decision (in our case the UN resolution), its duty is solely to be rapid and effective in implementing it. But the point is that in Bosnia today the operational conditions are not normal. For the past few days a precarious truce achieved by means of the deterrent force of the allied ultimatum has been in force in Sarajevo. An attempt is being made to extend the same peace-making formula to other tormented cities. There is an approximate date for the reopening of Tuzla airport, which is indispensable for the distribution of aid. Crucial negotiations are under way in Washington between Muslims and Croats. Despite the controversies, it is hoped that the Russians will bring sufficient pressure to bear on the Serbian side, and Boris Yeltsin's difficult domestic situation must not be forgotten. After two years of failures, the past few weeks have offered the peace-makers some timid grounds for hope, leaving a weak glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. So is this really the most suitable time to give free rein to the automatic intransigence of a military force? Should priority not be given, rather, to political assessment, especially in the Balkans, which have always been a source of provocation, and especially at a stage of the war that grants scope for the strategy of sabotage and that threatens to drag the Atlantic Alliance into an escalation with no way out? It may be replied -- as the Western governments, and to some extent even Russia, did yesterday -- that in order to avert the punishment it would have been enough to observe the rules. That, sooner or later, after hundreds of unpunished violations, Deny Flight had to bang its fist on the table. That yesterday's attack is the result of the weakness of the past two years, that it stems from the need for NATO to enhance its credibility precisely in order to increase the effectiveness of the pressure to negotiate begun with the 21 February ultimatum. It would certainly be disastrous -- and not only for peace in Bosnia -- if NATO were to return to the policy of empty threats, of words not matched by deeds. This cannot be the way to go. But in a situation of absolute military predominance, who could prevent the alliance from taking time to analyze and assess the situation and then if necessary from issuing a strike virtually with no threat of response? Faced with the incursion by the Serbs' jalopies, would it not have been possible yesterday to await a political ratification and then perhaps to destroy all the fighter bombers on the ground at Banja Luka as a punishment? NATO's credibility would certainly not have been diminished. In Bosnia there are already the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims who live permanently with their fingers on the trigger. We must not imitate them if we want to escape their logic of death.
