RUIE President Arkadiy Volskiy: "This document opens up extensive prospects for mutually beneficial cooperation. The economic crisis which none of the former Union's republics has succeeded in avoiding was largely due to the disruption and severing of traditional economic ties. Therefore establishing these ties will enable industrial enterprises to autonomously resolve any arising problems without politicians interfering. All this should undoubtedly help stabilize the situation and extricate real manufacturers from the protracted crisis most speedily." Kh. Gulyamov, head of the Association of Machine Building Enterprises of Uzbekistan: "We have fully felt the breakdown of traditional ties. Therefore there is only one correct route today -- to actively cooperate with associated plants and create joint enterprises oriented to the production of finished output. "We are now actively engaged in this. Several dozen joint enterprises have already been set up, or are in the making, with enterprises in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The current meeting has enabled us to formulate a mechanism for cooperation. "We have defined certain priority areas for ourselves and Russian industrialists. These include developing and setting up an agricultural equipment complex in Ukraine, in particular mini sugar refineries."
