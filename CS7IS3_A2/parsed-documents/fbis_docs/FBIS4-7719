The announcement came from Andreas Kuhn of the International Committee of the Red Cross after a meeting with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo. "I am not sure whether we will go back to negotiation or we'll take other measures" to protect the Moslems of Prijedor in western Bosnia, Kuhn said. "This is to be decided in Geneva." Asked if the Red Cross continued with preparations for the evacuation, Kuhn said, "We are ready and we remain ready." The Red Cross and the United Nations had planned to begin the evacuation of about 6,000 people from Prijedor on Tuesday. Moslems there fear for their lives following a massacre last week in which 17 Moslems and three Croats were killed, UN officials say.
