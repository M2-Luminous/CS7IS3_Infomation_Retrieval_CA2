FR941128-2-00121 FR941128-2-00070 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Employment and Training Administration [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,935] American Microsystems, Inc., Testing Division, Pocatello, Idaho; Notice of Revised Determination on Reopening On November 9, 1994, the Department, at the request of the company reopened its investigation for the workers and former workers of the subject firm in Pocatello, Idaho. The initial investigation resulted in a negative determination July 7, 1994 because the workers who produce semiconductors did not meet the decreased sales or production criterion of the Trade Act. The negative determination was published in the Federal Register on July 26, 1994 (59 FR 37996). Findings on reopening show that an appropriate subdivision of the subject firm was adversely affected by increased imports. The Testing Division has decreased production and employment in 1994. Other findings show that the testing operation is gradually being transferred offshore and the tested products (chips and wafers) are imported back to the company. The shutdown process is expected to be completed by March 1995. Conclusion After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reopening, it is concluded that increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with the chips and wafers tested by the Testing Division of American Microsystems, Inc., contributed importantly to the decline in sales or production and to the total or partial separation of workers at the Testing Division of the subject facility. In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I make the following revised determination: All workers and former workers of the Testing Division of American Microsystems, Inc., Pocatello, Idaho who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after May 25, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974. Signed at Washington, DC, this 14th day of November 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
