FBIS4-5487 "dreas070_a_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Controversy Over Successor to Hosokawa Continues Controversy Over Successor to Hosokawa Continues Ouchi: Watanabe `Unlikely' Choice OW1204074094 Tokyo KYODO in English 0646 GMT 12 Apr 94 OW1204074094 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The leader of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), a group in the ruling coalition, said Tuesday [12 April] that former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is unlikely to be chosen as a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi said, "Mr. Watanabe is outside the framework of the coalition. I have heard there is considerable criticism and rejection from opposition and ruling parties (against Watanabe's premiership). It's not so easy." "Even if Mr. Watanabe would join the current ruling parties, how many people can he bring (from the LDP)? I doubt the number reaches as high as rumored. In that case, it would be quite difficult for the ruling parties to secure the majority (in the 511-seat House of Representatives)," said Ouchi, the health and welfare minister. A senior official of the LDP's Watanabe faction said Monday that Watanabe plans to form a new parliamentary group in the lower house in a bid to form a coalition government with three ruling parties -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito and the Japan New Party (JNP). As the combined parliamentary strength of Watanabe's 46-member faction, Shinseito, Komeito and the JNP stands at 161, Watanabe will need to win support from more than 95 LDP legislators who belong to other LDP factions in order to hold the majority seats. Since last February, Watanabe has repeatedly held meetings with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is regarded as the chief coalition strategist. Shinseito and Komeito -- key forces within the ruling coalition -- are widely deemed as willing to name Watanabe the next leader of a new coalition government in an attempt to oust the Social Democratic Party and new party Sakigake [Harbinger] from the coalition.
