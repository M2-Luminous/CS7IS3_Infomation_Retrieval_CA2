This is the position which Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov expressed in an interview to LE MONDE on Monday 4 April in which he reported Greek "troop movements" on the common border. "The negotiations (with Greece) can resume immediately, but the embargo must first be lifted because it is very difficult to have discussions in such imbalanced circumstances," Mr. Gligorov stressed, emphasizing the fact that "no country would negotiate under such constraints." And the Macedonian president confirmed that his country is "prepared to negotiate on all issues" remaining between Skopje and Athens. These are, first, the very name of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), a temporary name accepted by the United Nations exactly one year ago because Greece refuses to allow this country, which has a little more than 2 million inhabitants, to bear a name -- Macedonia -- which Athens thinks belongs exclusively to Greek heritage. Loss of Identity Among the other disputes between the two states is the Macedonian flag, with the Greeks demanding a change to the emblem it carries (on a red background) -- a so-called Vergina sun, named after a city in Greek Macedonia in which such an emblem was found in the tomb of King Philip II. Athens is also demanding that Skopje change some articles of its Constitution, seeing them as evidence of "irredentism." But although everything is open to negotiation, not everything is necessarily acceptable in the eyes of President Gligorov, a 77-year-old lawyer and economist with great political experience and skill who has a long federal career behind him (in particular he was a member of the Yugoslav presidency and was speaker of the Federal Assembly from 1974 to 1978). Hitherto, and since the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991, he has been the only leader of the six federated republics to keep his fellow citizens out of the war, despite a highly explosive environment. For him "it is possible to discuss everything; nothing can be excluded (from discussion), but it is clear that a people cannot be asked to change its identity. Changing its name represents a loss of identity." Troop Movements In return, "any negotiation, any agreement implies a compromise by both sides." As for the flag, "if there is agreement, even this question can be settled." At all events, "there cannot be negotiation as long as the embargo continues." To make Macedonia bend, to ensure that it abandons its name and symbols to avoid asphyxiation, Greece is imposing a blockade on Macedonia in violation of all European Union [EU] rules. This policy means that Athens is completely isolated within the EU, its 11 partners protesting this measure, but without securing its lifting. The EU Commission has expressed the intention of referring the matter to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to force the Greek authorities to abandon their position. This embargo "is causing great damage to the people and economy of Macedonia" and it is "in the interests of the EU for it to be lifted, because it does not just affect Macedonia, it violates the Maastricht Treaty. Europe must find a way out of this situation," Mr. Gligorov stressed. He has so far received no signal indicating an easing of the Greek positions, which instead are "hardening." "Some Greek troop movements" have been noted on the border, according to the Macedonian president, who does not believe that "Greece will attack Macedonia now" and does not "think that a NATO and EU member country could behave like that." Referring to the lessons which should be learned from the war in Bosnia, Kiro Gligorov reaffirmed that independent Macedonia "is a democratic country, a rule-of-law state, oriented toward a market economy, which wants economically open borders with all its neighbors" and that "such a Macedonia is a precondition for stability in the Balkans." "Our existence is in the interest of our neighbors, who must abandon some ambitions resulting from History, because those ambitions have always led to war." No neighbor of Macedonia -- an enclave between Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Albania, and which has a very large Albanian minority -- is apparently exempt from "ambitions" in one form or another. Among them, Albania is clearly not the last to engage in attentive and insistent scrutiny of Macedonian affairs. In particular, the Skopje press has pointed out the active participation of Tirana's ambassador in meetings of the leadership of the main Albanian movement in Macedonia, the Party of Democratic Prosperity, which split after fierce internal struggles. "There is a difference between each country's legitimate right to take care of its minority, and interference in another country's internal affairs. This legitimate right means following the implementation of international norms with regard to your minorities; but interference in the life of political parties in unacceptable," President Gligorov said with regard to Albania and its practices, about which the Macedonian Government has expressed its annoyance. Macedonia is at present outside the conflict which has brought bloodshed to most of the former Yugoslavia. The satisfaction which Kiro Gligorov derives from this is, however, undermined by the fact that there is a "risk (for his country) as long as the war continues alongside it and as long as the crisis with Greece continues."
