The strains were selected on the basis of the following criteria: the thermophilic property of the bacteria, the ability to generate endospores, and the possibility of using conventional and easily available nutrient media, such as RPA and RPB, for cultivating microorganisms. The experimental procedure is described. As a result, 26 feasible products of restriction endonucleases were isolated; recognition sequences were identified for all 26 products and cleavage sites--for 15 of them. It is demonstrated that the enzymes are isoschizomers of the following known endonucleases: BstNI, EarI, HaeIII, HpaII, Cfr10I, BsiYI, BclI, BbvII, BbvI, BstEII, BsaBI, BsrI, FspI, ClaI, and SfeI. The findings make it possible to assert that thermophilic bacteria of the Bacillus genus are a promising source of restriction endonucleases. Tables 1; references 5: 4 Russian, 1 Western.
