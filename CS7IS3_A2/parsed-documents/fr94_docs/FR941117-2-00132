FR941117-2-00132 FR941117-2-00091 The CBOE's proposal establishes a series of priority principles for solicited transactions. Priority is accorded depending on whether the original order is disclosed throughout the solicitation period; whether the solicited order improves the best bid or offer in the crowd; and whether the solicited order matches the original order's limit. Thus, when the original order is disclosed in advance of the solicitation and the solicited order both matches the disclosed original order's limit and improves the market, the solicited order has priority over other orders in the crowd and may trade with the original order at the improved bid or offered price, subject to the customer limit order book priorities set forth in Rule 6.45. When a solicited order does not match the original order's limit and does not improve the market, however, it does not have priority over other bids and offers represented in the crowd even if the original order was disclosed to the crowd for the full solicitation period. Under the proposal, if an original order is not disclosed to the crowd, a responsive solicited order will not have priority to trade with the original order even if the solicited order improves the market; instead, in that instance, others in the crowd may trade ahead of the solicited person at the improved price, subject to the customer limit order priorities in CBOE Rule 6.45. In addition to requiring disclosure of original orders and clarifying the priority principles applicable to solicited transactions, proposed Rule 6.9(e) clarifies that it is inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade for any member or associated person, who has knowledge of all the material terms of an original order and a solicited order that matches the original order's price, to enter an order to buy or sell an option of the same class as any option that is the subject of the solicitation prior to the time the original order's terms are disclosed to the crowd or the execution of the solicited transaction can no longer reasonably be considered imminent. This prohibition would extend to orders to buy or sell the underlying security or any ``related instrument,'' as that term is defined in the Rule. 8 The CBOE has stated that the purpose of these measures is to prevent members and associated persons from using undisclosed information about imminent solicited option transactions to trade the relevant option or any closely-related instrument in advance of persons represented in the relevant options crowd. Moreover, the CBOE believes that proposed Rule 6.9 improves the CBOE's auction by clarifying the requirements applicable to solicited transactions and by enabling the CBOE to initiate enforcement proceedings in appropriate cases under specific rules. 8 An order to buy or sell a ``related instrument'' means, in reference to an index option, an order to buy or sell securities comprising ten percent or more of the component securities in the index or an order to buy or sell a futures contract on any economically equivalent index. In addition, with respect to an option of the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, an option on the Standard & Poor's 100 Stock Index is a related instrument, and vice versa. See Proposed CBOE Rule 6.9(e). III. Comment Letter The Comment Letter 9 concerning the proposed rule change addressed two areas of concern. First, the letter questions whether the proposed rule applies to those market makers who are continuously present in a trading crowd. Second, the commenter claims that the terminology used in the proposed rule is vague and undefined. 9 See supra note 5. The commenter claims that the CBOE's proposed rule is silent with respect to its applicability to market makers continuously present in the trading crowd. Instead, the commenter claims that the proposal only specifically addresses those situations where a market maker decides to participate in a solicitation either by order or by appearing in person in the trading crowd, and believes the proposal should make this clear.
