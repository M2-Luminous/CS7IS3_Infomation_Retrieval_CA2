The commission's denial has come after investigations, field visits, and laboratory tests in London, Paris, and Washington have disproved these claims, which were lodged in a UN complaint earlier. Although we knew the aims and motives of these lies right from the start and said they were cheap lies intended to disturb Iraq, justify the continuation of the blockade, and find an excuse for further interference in Iraq's internal affairs in the name of human rights, the UNSCOM statement has confirmed how false and malicious were the reports submitted by Max Van der Stoel [UN human rights official for Iraq]. The reports were packed with lies and made unwarranted proposals about appointing observers and setting up committees to protect what was termed human rights in the marshlands. This Dutchman, who made endless accusations and held news conferences everywhere to create an uproar about alleged terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, was certified to be reckless and nonobjective by his own classmate, UN Secretary General Butrus Ghali, even before we issued our own testimony on him. In fact, the statement released by UNSCOM, which sponsored the allegations and set up committees that spent a great deal of time on them, has come at this time to put an end to this cheap lie and to serve as a lesson for Van der Stoel and his backers. [passage omitted] The UNSCOM statement is testimony for Iraq and a slap in the face for its enemies. It has exposed their slander. This statement has come to reveal the truth and to expose those who spread false allegations. It now behooves the commission to also go deep into the flood of lies that preceded this one, whose aims have now been exposed. Yes, the main problem now hampering the actions that must be taken by the UN Security Council are the lies and allegations by certain regional quarters and aggressor states. They release them from time to time, and sometimes deny them almost overnight, despited the fact that Iraq has affirmed its commitment to and cooperation with implementing UN Security Council Resolution 687, especially since the motives of those quarters are not secret to anyone. What we want to say is that the objective efforts to do justice to Iraq, must now find their true course toward common positive action to remove the injustices done to Iraq.
