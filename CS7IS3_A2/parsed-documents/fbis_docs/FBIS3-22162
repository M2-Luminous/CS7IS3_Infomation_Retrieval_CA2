But civic groups are critical of the inclusion of an industry association -- the Japan Industrial Conference for Ozone Layer Protection, a group set up by automakers and electrical appliance manufacturers -- as a recipient of the subsidies. Among the recipents are 23 NGOs which will receive such subsidies for the first time from the Japan Environment Corp. The amount of subsidies to the 23 organizations will total 112 million yen, the officials said. The subsidies will be disbursed out of a 2 billion yen fund set up with joint financing from the government and public gambling proceeds, the officials said. Projects covered by the subsidies will include one for planting seedlings of a mangrove whose existence in the Philippines is threatened by industrial pollution, they said. A spokesman for the Consumers Union of Japan said, ``it is outrageous for the JEC to help finance the activities of the industry association. They should uphold the principle of having polluters pay for the cost of environmental preservation.'' An official of another civic group, the Peoples' Forum 2001, Japan, said, ``government ministries in positions to supervise business corporations and their industry bodies should not link up with those business organizations. Rather, they should focus their assistance on the NGOs led by citizens.''
