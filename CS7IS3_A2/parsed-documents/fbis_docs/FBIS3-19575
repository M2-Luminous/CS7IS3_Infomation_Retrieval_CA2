Anders Munkesjoe reports: [Munkesjoe] It has been known for quite some time that OK Petroleum is for sale. The previous owners, KF [Cooperative Association] with 52 percent, the Swedish state, and Neste of Finland with 24 percent each, have all for different reasons wanted to dispose of the company. The buyer now is a Saudi shaykh by the name of Muhammad al-Amudi. [passage omitted] From the past, Shaykh al-Amudi has well developed contacts with Swedish industry. He has cooperated with AGEVE of Sweden for several decades. Under its new owner, OK Petroleum will now focus its sights on northern Europe, above all. There is an intention to buy retail networks for oil products in Poland and East Germany, markets which are judged to be very expansive. OK Petroleum is the biggest refinery enterprise in the Nordic countries. With subsidiaries, the company has a staff of about 2,000. Sixty percent of production is exported; the rest is mainly delivered to OK's gas stations which are not affected by this deal. Shaykh al-Amudi's voiced intent is to develop OK Petroleum in line with the strategy already existing in the company. No immediate changes in employment and production are therefore to be expected, the head of the concern, Sven-Erik Zachrisson promises. [passage omitted]
