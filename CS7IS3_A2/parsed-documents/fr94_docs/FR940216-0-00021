FR940216-0-00021 FR940216-0-00008 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Parts 611, 672, and 676 [Docket No. 940242&hyph;4042; I.D. 110193B] Foreign Fishing; Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Limited Access Management of Federal Fisheries In and Off of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final 1994 specifications of groundfish and associated management measures; closures; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS announces final 1994 harvest specifications for Gulf of Alaska (GOA) groundfish and associated management measures. This action is necessary to establish harvest limits and associated management measures for groundfish during the 1994 fishing year. NMFS is also closing specified fisheries consistent with the final 1994 groundfish specifications. These measures are intended to carry out management objectives contained in the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the GOA. DATES: Effective February 10, 1994 through 24:00 Alaska local time (A.l.t.), December 31, 1994. All closures to directed fishing are effective through 24:00 A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Comments are invited on the apportionments of reserves on or before February 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802&hyph;1668. Copies of the Environmental Assessment (EA) for 1994 Total Allowable Catch Specifications for the GOA, dated February 1994, may be obtained from the above address. The Final Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation Report (SAFE report), dated November 1993, is available from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, Alaska 99510. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kaja Brix, NMFS, (907) 586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background NMFS announces for the 1994 fishing year: (1) Total allowable catches (TAC) for each groundfish target species category in the GOA and apportionments thereof among domestic annual processing (DAP), joint venture processing (JVP), total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF), and reserves; (2) apportionments of reserves to DAP; (3) assignments of the sablefish TAC to authorized fishing gear users; (4) apportionments of pollock TAC among regulatory areas, seasons, and between inshore and offshore components; (5) apportionment of Pacific cod TAC between inshore and offshore components; (6) ``other species'' TAC; (7) prohibited species catch (PSC) limits relevant to fully utilized groundfish species; (8) closures to directed fishing; (9) Pacific halibut PSC mortality limits; and, (10) seasonal apportionments of the halibut PSC limits. A discussion of each of these measures follows. The process of determining TACs for groundfish species in the GOA is established in regulations implementing the FMP, which was prepared by the Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The FMP is implemented by regulations for the foreign fishery at 50 CFR part 611 and for the U.S. fishery at 50 CFR parts 672 and 676. General regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620. Pursuant to §672.20(a)(2)(ii), the sum of the TACs for all species must fall within the combined optimum yield (OY) range of 116,000&hyph;800,000 metric tons (mt) established for these species in §672.20(a)(1). Under §§611.92(c)(1) and 672.20(a)(2)(i), TACs are apportioned initially among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserves. The DAP amounts are intended for harvest by U.S. fishermen for delivery and sale to U.S. processors. JVP amounts are intended for joint ventures in which U.S. fishermen typically deliver their catches to foreign processors at sea. TALFF amounts are intended for harvest by foreign fishermen. Regulations at §672.20(a)(2)(ii) establish initial reserves equal to 20 percent of the TACs for pollock, Pacific cod, flounder target species categories, and ``other species.'' Reserve amounts are set aside for possible reapportionment to DAP and/or JVP if the initial apportionments prove inadequate. Reserves that are not reapportioned to DAP or JVP may be reapportioned to TALFF according to §672.20(d)(2). The Council met on September 21&hyph;26, 1993, and developed recommendations for proposed 1994 TAC specifications for each target species category of groundfish on the basis of the best available scientific information. The Council also recommended other management measures pertaining to the 1994 fishing year. Under §672.20(c)(1)(ii), 1994 specifications were proposed in the Federal Register (58 FR 60575, November 17, 1993). No JVP or TALFF amounts were specified because GOA groundfish are fully utilized by the DAP fisheries. Under §672.20(c)(1)(ii), one-fourth of the preliminary specifications and gear apportionments and one-fourth of the Pacific halibut PSC amounts were effective January 1 on an interim basis and are now superseded by the final 1994 specifications.
