After the government daily CAMEROON TRIBUNE denounced Nigeria's "ambitions" yesterday, the national television in the evening devoted a special program to the tense situation on the Bakassi Peninsula, stating that Cameroon was within its right. The television bases its stand on the communique issued at the weekend in which Cameroon announced that Nigerian units had attacked some Cameroonian positions on islands belonging to it. For their part, two independent weeklies, LE MESSAGER and LA NOUVELLE EXPRESSION, close to the opposition, denounced "Nigerian expansionistic bids." In an editorial published yesterday and headed "The duty of solidarity," LE MESSAGER, referring to "the illegal occupation of a part of the Cameroonian territory," stated that Nigerians "were not naive." "The 18 February attack shows to what extent they are determined to snatch from us this part of our territory, but our Armed Forces' reaction further demonstrated that the search for dialogue, which we have always supported, did not rule out the use of force to react to force," the newspaper continues, writing straightforwardly: "War has started." For its part, LA NOUVELLE EXPRESSION, today devoted to the event its editorial headed: "To the front" in which it calls on Cameroonian President Paul Biya to summon "all the Cameroonian political leaders worthy of this name to discuss this issue with all of them, now that the troops need high morale to resist the Nigerian aggressor."
