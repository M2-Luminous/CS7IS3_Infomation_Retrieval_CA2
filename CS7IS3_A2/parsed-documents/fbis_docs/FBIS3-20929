It could change the future of Olivetti over the coming years and partially contribute to resolving the serious employment problem that is currently affecting the Ivrea-based company. For the time being talks with the trade unions concerning surplus employees have been suspended. According to recent unconfirmed statements this surplus is estimated to be 2,000 people. The attention now moves to what the Ivrea management is doing to give the general development trends for the immediate future. Olivetti like all the other major and medium-sized companies in the computer sector is currently experiencing a crisis. [passage omitted] How is it possible to get out of this situation which appears to be one of no return. There are many answers: widening the consumer market, moving toward software, increasing consulting services, increasing services... One of the winning routes is surely that of integrating the computer and telecommunications sectors. Today, TV, computers, and consumer electronics converge at a single point: the possibility of providing each of us with the information he needs (Stock Exchange quotations, soccer results, telephone conversations, client databases etc.) wherever we find ourselves and wherever there are archives containing this information. For the computer world combining computers with telecommunications is not an extra opportunity: it is the opportunity. For this reason the formation of Olivetti Telecom and Multimedia is strategic: It is a real sign that Ivrea is well aware that this marriage cannot be avoided. OTM is divided into four operational areas supervised by Olivetti Vice President Elserino Piol and led by Francesco Caio, formerly De Benedetti's assistant and director of company projects. The first area, Omnitel, is dedicated to mobile telephony. Omintel is the consortium led by Olivetti which is candidating itself to manage the European GSM mobile telephone system, a 1.5 trillion-lire business that could employ more than 2,000 people and which the trade union has paid a great deal of attention to over recent days. The second area, Telecommunications Systems, comprises companies that have been operating in the data transmission networks and payment systems fields for years now: Sixtel and Sixcom. The Cambridge laboratories fall under this area, it is an extremely dynamic task force that in one way or another has been behind all of Olivetti's announcements in the telecommunications sector. The third area, that of telecommunications services, includes Seva, which offers value-added services, and the Geonet network, a property network that can represent the basic infrastructure for the supply of outsourcing services to clients. The last area includes the Radiocor press agency and the newborn Opera Multimedia for CD-ROM development.
