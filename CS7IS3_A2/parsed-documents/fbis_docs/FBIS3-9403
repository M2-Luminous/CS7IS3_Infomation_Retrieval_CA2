Mutual multilateral relations in connection with the Czech Republic's effort aimed at joining the European Union were also discussed. Klara Stejskalova reports: [Stejskalova] All of the representatives jointly praised the good and intensive relations between the two countries, evidence of which is the unusual interest of Belgian entrepreneurs in our country, Josef Zieleniec said. Over the past year alone, the Belgians have invested more than $150 million in our country. Thus, they rank fourth among foreign investors. Regarding Czech membership in the European Union, Claes expressed complete support for the Czech Republic. At the same time, he praised the democratization of politics in our country and the path toward a very strong economy that we have embarked upon. In conclusion, he said that those West Europeans who think they live on an isolated island are naive. He said that support for the process of integration is in the interest of the European Union. Integration should take place gradually and not in blocks. It should be based solely on the fulfillment of the necessary conditions by individual countries. It cannot be expected, however, that European Union enlargement could take place before the intergovernmental conference of the European Union states, scheduled to take place in 1996.
