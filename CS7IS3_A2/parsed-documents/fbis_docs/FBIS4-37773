Bank Cities TA2406100894 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew 24 Jun 94 pp 1, 11 TA2406100894 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT Hebrew BFN [Report by Ron Ben-Yishay] [Excerpts] PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat is insisting that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdraw from major Judaea and Samaria population centers in the near future, even before autonomy is applied to these areas. The demand, which was officially relayed to the prime minister's bureau about two weeks ago, is based on what Palestinian sources term "an oral understanding and the spirit of the Oslo agreement." A senior government element has confirmed that the PLO did indeed present such a demand to Israel, although he denied that "either an oral or written pledge was given to 'Arafat on this matter." Senior IDF commanders advised the prime minister to reject the demand on the grounds that the IDF troops' exit from major Judaea and Samaria cities before comprehensive security arrangements for Palestinian self-rule are established would jeopardize the lives of Israeli civilians. Those in danger will be mainly residents of settlements in the vicinity of Ramallah, Nabulus, Hebron, Qalqilyah, and Tulkarm, some of whom have to drive through these cities' centers on their way to the settlements. 'Arafat relayed this new demand to Jerusalem via his adviser Nabil Sha'th, who handed it to Major General Amnon Shahaq during a meeting at Erez checkpoint last week. [passage omitted] Palestinian sources claim that a high-ranking Israeli element, whose identity they refused to disclose, promised 'Arafat that rather than wait for sweeping redeployment in the West Bank on the eve of the autonomy council elections, the IDF would withdraw from city centers shortly after the completion of the evacuation from Gaza and the Jericho enclave. 'Arafat is now demanding that the IDF evacuate the centers of major cities and hand over control in the evacuated areas to the Palestinian police force in the framework of the next stage of the establishment of Palestinian self-rule -- the stage of early empowerment, during which the Civil Administration's powers in the territories are to be handed over to the PLO, as agreed in Oslo. Senior defense establishment elements recently advised the prime minister not to hurry to implement the next stages stipulated in the Oslo Declaration of Principles before he is certain the Palestinians have adhered to their Cairo agreement commitments with regard to Gaza and Jericho. That was the reason they recommended he reject 'Arafat's demand for early IDF withdrawal from city centers. [passage omitted] Defense establishment elements also recommended that the IDF redeployment be put off until negotiations on comprehensive security arrangements in the Palestinian self-rule in Judaea and Samaria are completed. The IDF also has reservations about the early transfer of Civil Administration powers to the Palestinians. Senior elements argue that early empowerment will only create confusion and undesirable friction between the still active Civil Administration and the Palestinian authorities due to take over from the Civil Administration.
