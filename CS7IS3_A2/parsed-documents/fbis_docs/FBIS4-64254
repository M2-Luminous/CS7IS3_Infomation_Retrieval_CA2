The proposal is the most radical to emerge from a series of studies aimed at making a 1 billion pound cut in the 24 billion pound defence budget, according to THE OBSERVER which says it has seen a confidential six-page report. If the Cabinet approves, nearly 80 fighter aircraft and 6,000 personnel would pull out of Germany by April 1996 as part of the latest round of defence cuts, the paper says. It would end an RAF presence in Germany stretching back nearly half a century. The paper quotes a senior RAF source saying: "In terms of the international situation, things have come on a long way since the reunification of Germany and there is a feeling that if we did need to go back it would not be that difficult."
