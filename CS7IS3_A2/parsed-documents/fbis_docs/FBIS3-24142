But this problem exists in more than just one city. Recently, "persons without definite employment and residence" can be seen practically at every railroad station of any city. Why have they become so numerous? Is anyone involved with the destinies of these people, or has our society turned its back on them? "Yes, this has become a real catastrophe for Russia," says Yelena Yulikova, head of the administration of social service nonmobile institutions under the Russian Federation Ministry for Social Protection of the Population. "People are moved or forced to become homeless for the most various reasons. Due to the production drop, some people have lost their jobs and, together with them, they have lost their beds in the dorms. Others have come here because of interethnic conflicts. Still others get `thrown out' into the streets by their relatives...." [Vasilkova] Are all these people now doomed to wander from place to place and beg? Our people cannot find employment if they do not have permanent residence registration, can they? [Yulikova] Yes, they can find it. True, it is hard and nonprestigious jobs, if they are healthy and, what is most important, willing to get out of this situation. But imagine, many of the homeless do not want any changes in their lives. Not so long ago, we conducted a small sociological study at several Moscow railroad terminals, and we offered the following to the homeless: We would put the old people in boarding houses and find jobs for those who can work. Here is the result: Out of the 180 people we talked to, nobody wanted to have anything to do with the federal organs. Some of them even expressed their indignation: This, they said, is a violation of personal freedoms and an infringement on human rights, which cannot be allowed in our present democratic society. Here is another example: A man was showing off his artificial limbs in the underground passage right next to our Ministry. Passersby were dropping money into his hat, and I came up to him, introduced myself, and invited him to come to our Ministry for help. Do you think he was happy? Quite the contrary! It turned out that he had a family, an apartment, and a pension. He was simply "moonlighting" in the passage there. There are so many such people now! [Vasilkova] But there are other people also, feeble old men and women who, through some tricks or sometimes threats, have been forced to sell their apartments, and now they have to wander around without a place to live. [Yulikova] But why does this happen? Nothing of the kind could have happened before, for the simple reason that there was a rule: If someone went to sign out, prior to his departure from a residence, he had to produce a document stating where he was going. We do not have such a rule any more. You can sell your apartment, sign out, and go wherever you wish. Is this normal? Scoundrels jumped at this opportunity right away--they found a loophole for fooling old people and taking away their legitimate residences. [Vasilkova] What can the victims do in such cases? They are lucky if they have relatives who can give them shelter. But most often this happens to lonely people. [Yulikova] We try to help such people if they come to us. [Vasilkova] But many of them do not know about you, they do not know how to find you. As far as I know, in the old days the militia used to detain vagrants, but now, for some reason, the militiamen just pass them by with indifference. [Yulikova] The problem is that, rather recently, we repealed Article 209 of the Criminal Code, which specified types of punishment for vagrancy. Apart from detaining transients, the militia used to send them to special reception and distribution centers, where their identities were established, necessary medical assistance given, and their future fate decided. It often happened that wanted criminals were hiding among the "tramps." [Vasilkova] Yelena Pavlovna, for some reason you are using the past tense when you talk about all this. Have special reception and distribution centers been closed, due to our fight for human rights? [Yulikova] Not yet. They are still run by the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD], but there are plans to replace them with rehabilitation centers. Now we are the only agency that has been entrusted with the problem of the homeless. [Vasilkova] In other words, it is your service and not the militia that is going to round up the homeless at railroad terminals and on the streets and place them in those centers? [Yulikova] We are not going to force anyone to go anywhere. Ours is a social institution which, I want to repeat, adheres to the principle of free will. [Vasilkova] What kind of extremes we have in our country: We used to exile people to the 101st kilometer for not working; now you can idle all you want and nobody cares! But you yourself said that vagrancy has become a profession for some people; it is doubtful that any of them will come to you to "surrender" of their own free will. Which means that it is you and I now who are destined to look at hordes of ragged and dirty people filling our railroad stations and underground crossings. But what about the recent edict of our president "On Measures for the Prevention of Vagrancy and Begging"? What are those measures? [Yulikova] The complexity of this document lies in the fact that it does not define the status of either a vagrant or a beggar. Incidentally, the same problem exists in many other countries. Even though some of them have laws restricting even begging to certain places only: You cannot stay at a transportation terminal if you do not have a ticket for a train or a bus. But you are right in saying that our railroad stations have become filthy night shelters. I agree that it is unpleasant and even dangerous to be there, next to dirty people who are often sick or covered with lice. There are quite a few hoodlums and thieves among the homeless, too. This is the reason that I think that it was a rash step to shift from the militia to us such an important, urgent, and crime-conducive problem. We ought to defend those who need it, but not the people who we need to be protected against. [Vasilkova] Would it be better for you to deal with the problem in cooperation with the militia? [Yulikova] We successfully cooperated with them before, also. The most reasonable decision would be for us to continue cooperation and reorganize the reception and distribution centers instead of closing them down. But to destroy all this with a single blow all of a sudden and to make us start it from the very beginning? [Vasilkova] So what did you start with? [Yulikova] So far, we have been operating by trial and error. Certain things we borrowed from our foreign colleagues, others we invented ourselves. We settled on three types of social assistance: the overnight shelter, the social hostel, and the adaptation center. We have made the designs for them and sent them to various regions. Any person, even one with no documents, can go to an overnight shelter. There he is given, free of charge, a bed and bedding, and medical assistance. We are planning to have counseling services in those places in future. A social hostel will provide shelter for a term from one day to a month. During this time, every person will be given a free meal ticket daily. An adaptation or rehabilitation center will accommodate people for six months; they will work there and receive treatment. They will have addiction treatment and legal services, and medical and labor centers. One such center has already been opened in Makhachkala. An overnight shelter and a social hostel have opened in Lipetsk. [Vasilkova] And in Moscow? As far as I know, there is just one flophouse, an overnight shelter, excuse me, for the entire huge city. Do you think it sufficient? [Yulikova] Who can think this! But if you only knew what it cost us to open even this one! It is not even a house: We just secured part of a boarding home for the elderly who had to settle for less space for this. The Moscow government could not find any accommodation for this charitable institution. They manage to find buildings for all kinds of firms and joint ventures, but here--alas! [Vasilkova] Here are your market relations, Yelena Pavlovna! Firms pay big money. [Yulikova] We, our society, will have to pay a lot more if we do not resolve the homeless problem in time. Believe me, this problem is very far from being a simple one, and we should not hush it up, unload it on someone else, or let it run its own course. We need to take urgent measures including some legislative ones. If we want to live in peace.
