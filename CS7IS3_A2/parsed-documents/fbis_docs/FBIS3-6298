"We are very much interested in the question" of China's human rights, Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said, confirming that the issue will be on the agenda in Hosokawa's meetings with President and Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng between March 19 and 21. "We are in a position to offer the Chinese Government friendly advice" on the human rights problems, the spokesman said. He did not elaborate on what this "advice" would be, but government sources have suggested Japan is likely to call on Beijing to urgently tackle the problem "in an internationally understandable way," without mentioning specific cases such as the recent detainment of prodemocracy activists. Following the intense exchanges on human rights during Christopher's trip to Beijing last weekend, the Japanese Government is in a quandary over the extent to which Hosokawa should refer to the problem. Japan, which has traditionally taken a different approach on human rights issues from Western countries, is torn between the United States and China. Hosokawa agreed to Christopher's request to bring up the human rights issue in his talks with Chinese leaders. Christopher told Japanese leaders last week the U.S. considers improvement in the human rights area as an important condition to extend most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status to Beijing and called for Japanese support in pushing China's leadership to improve its human rights records. Meanwhile, Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Ronghi told Hosokawa in Tokyo last month he does not think it appropriate to link China's human rights record to the renewal of MFN status. China's MFN status, which must be extended every year under U.S. law, ends in June. Washington has linked further extension this year to a "significant overall improvement" in China's human rights record. Japan, whose ties with Washington have soured during the past month over trade disputes, does not want to upset the U.S. further in either the political or security arenas -- the other two main areas of bilateral relations -- and thus wants to avoid seeming too restrained in persuading China on human rights improvement. But Japan also does not want to upset Beijing, which insists that human rights are an internal affair, by pushing the issue too hard lest it damage Sino-Japanese relations. Tadashi Ikeda, the incumbent deputy foreign minister and former director general of the Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau, explained the nature of Japan's approach on human rights in the February issue of "GAIKO FORUM," a monthly magazine on diplomacy. Japan considers "confrontational approaches" on human rights problems ineffective, and regards an approach which takes account of a country's social, economic and political situations as more realistic, Ikeda wrote. Since Western countries have themselves developed in those areas over a long period, Japan thinks it unrealistic to urge developing nations to ensure human rights immediately or put pressure on them, he wrote. It was this policy which led Japan to break with its Group of Seven (G-7) partners and resume official loans to China in 1990 after the G-7 had announced sanctions against Beijing at the Paris summit in July 1989 following the military crackdown on the prodemocracy movement at Tiananmen Square the previous month. In August 1991, then Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was also the first leader among major developed countries to visit China since the Tiananmen Square incident. Foreign Ministry officials said the expression Hosokawa is to use in calling on China to improve its human rights record is not yet decided. Hosokawa told his aides he wants to say what he "ought to say" concerning the matter, suggesting that he would speak out on the issue more frankly than the previous prime ministers from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), according to government sources. Since assuming the premiership last August, Hosokawa has been trying to break away from nearly four decades of LDP traditions and develop more originality -- in everything from the way he gives news conferences to expressing apologies for Japanese actions during World War II, which was something of a taboo for his predecessors. Using strong expressions or not, Hosokawa will urge China to improve its human rights record by suggesting that Beijing could better win international support and understanding for its economic reform policy if it convinces other nations of its desire to improve internal problems, including human rights, the sources said.
