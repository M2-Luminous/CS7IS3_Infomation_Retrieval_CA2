The consultations enabled a wide range of problems relating to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina to be discussed. Vitaliy Churkin told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the current round of talks on the Bosnian settlement, which started in Geneva on Tuesday [18 January], "is progressing with difficulty." "The aggravation of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina provides unfavorable conditions for the negotiating process," said the Russian representative. "Nevertheless, there are some bright spots. It seems that we have managed to resolve the problem of replacing Canadian blue helmets with the Dutch in Srebrenica, the UN security zone. We are satisfied with this development and expect no further problems."
