FR940511-1-00047 FR940511-1-00012 The proposed amendments to the CCDBG regulations additionally include technical amendments required by the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments of 1992 and the Older Americans Act Technical Amendments. Other proposals respond to general concerns about payment differentials for quality care, children's immunizations, eligibility of children in foster care, availability of certificates as a payment mechanism, and cost limitations for administration and certain other activities. The proposed amendments to the regulations for child care for AFDC families, TCC, and At-Risk Child Care promote coordination among these programs and also with CCDBG to: provide State flexibility in determining a child's physical or mental incapacity; modify and codify policy regarding child care during gaps in employment; require States to define how child care is reasonably related to the parent's work or other activity; and allow States flexibility to conform family fee requirements. Additionally, proposed amendments to TCC would give States the option to provide TCC to families who voluntarily terminate their AFDC benefit, and address the process of requesting TCC. DATES: Interested persons and agencies are invited to submit written comments concerning these proposed regulations no later than July 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed (facsimile transmissions will not be accepted) to the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families, Attention: Child Care Comments, OFA/DJP, Fifth Floor, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., Washington, DC 20447, or delivered to the Administration for Children and Families, Office of Family Assistance, Aerospace Building, Fifth Floor East, 901 D Street, SW., Washington, DC between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on regular business days.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) administers a number of programs that address the child care needs of low-income families. In recent years, the scope of ACF-administered child care programs was broadened to address the child care needs of increasingly larger segments of the population. ACF's child care programs reflect a growing awareness of the needs of the family for safe child care that also attends to the developmental needs of children. They offer the Nation's low income families an important support in their efforts to achieve and maintain economic independence. Child care needs for working families who receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits were first addressed through the dependent care disregard. The family's child care expense (up to $200 a month for a child under age 2 and up to $175 for a child who is at least age 2) is deducted from the family's earnings when determining the amount of the family's countable income for the purpose of the family's eligibility for and amount of AFDC assistance. The dependent care disregard is used by most States as one method for providing child care to working AFDC families. The Social Services Block Grant (title XX of the Social Security Act) enables States to provide social services which are best suited to the needs of its residents. These services can include child care, and most States have used title XX funds to provide child care through contracts with providers. The regulatory changes proposed in this rule concern four child care programs created through two statutes: the Family Support Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;485) and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90). A brief description of each program and of the overall goals of this proposed rule follows. The Family Support Act of 1988 amended title IV&hyph;A of the Social Security Act at section 402(g), providing a very significant extension of ACF's ability to fund child care services. The amendment created two new child care programs. First, it guaranteed necessary child care for working AFDC recipients, and for AFDC recipients in approved education or training activities (including the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) Program). This program is often called AFDC child care. The regulations for AFDC child care are located at 45 CFR part 255. An amendment concerning applicable child care standards under 45 CFR 255.4 (Allowable Costs and Matching Rates) became effective on August 4, 1992. Second, the Family Support Act addressed the need for Transitional Child Care (TCC) during the 12 months after a family becomes ineligible for AFDC due to work. The regulations specific to TCC are located at 45 CFR part 256. However, many of the regulations for AFDC child care (part 255) also apply to TCC. With OBRA 90, Congress established two additional child care programs that further extended child care services to the Nation's low-income families: an optional At-Risk Child Care program (child care for low-income working families in need of such care and otherwise at risk of becoming eligible for AFDC) and the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG). Currently, 49 States and the District of Columbia have approval to operate the At-Risk program. That program, like the other title IV&hyph;A child care programs, requires the State to match Federal funds, but, unlike the other programs, it is capped and the funds are distributed according to a formula. The At-Risk Child Care program is located at section 402(i) of title IV&hyph;A of the Social Security Act. The At-Risk regulations are located at 45 CFR part 257. In this preamble, we refer to AFDC child care, TCC, and At-Risk Child Care as the title IV&hyph;A programs. The CCDBG is intended to provide child care services for low-income families and to increase the availability, affordability, and quality of child care and development services. That program does not require a State match. Regulations for the CCDBG program are located at 45 CFR parts 98 and 99. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;586, made various technical changes to the CCDBG. For example, section 8(a)(1) and (2) of the amendments made changes to section 658J(c) of the Block Grant Act by replacing ``obligation period'' with ``expenditure period.'' Other minor technical corrections to the Block Grant Act are included in the Older Americans Act Technical Amendments, Public Law 103&hyph;171. Purpose of Proposed Rule
