The United States backtracked on an earlier non-tariffication accord and instead slashed import duties in its final schedule screened at the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). It stated that the scaled-down package was conditional on other countries making comparable tariff concessions. Korea followed suit and submitted a schedule containing tariff cuts of 3 percent on the same copper goods and 4 percent on electronic items, instead of none. Seoul proposed bilateral negotiations on March 8 while screening the U.S. offers in Geneva, charging that Washington had broken its promise made last December. It called for bilateral talks because the U.S. list included items of interest to Korea, said Pyun Hyong, director-general of the customs and tariff bureau at the Finance Ministry. Washington is also unhappy about Seoul's withdrawal of earlier offers to abolish tariffs on the nine items and is likely to complain at the two-day screening of Korea's industrial offers in Geneva from Thursday. After Korea's schedule has been screened by Saturday, the two countries will sit down to iron out their differences in tariff cuts before the March 25 deadline for all countries to finalize their schedules. Seoul blames Washington for breaking its promise first while the latter argues that it had attached conditions -- it could scale back its offers if Japan also did so -- and made changes accordingly, pointing out that Seoul made alterations without having attached conditions earlier in the agreement last December.
