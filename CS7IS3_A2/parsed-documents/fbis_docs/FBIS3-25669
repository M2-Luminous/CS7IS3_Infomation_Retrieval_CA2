General Viljoen was speaking at a Volksfront meeting in Lydenburg in the eastern Transvaal. He said this capability, with the political power of the Afrikaner, had led to the Afrikaner becoming a factor that could not be ignored by even the president of the ANC [African National Congress], Mr. Nelson Mandela. According to General Viljoen the Afrikaner was enjoying increasing foreign support, which was putting pressure on the government and the ANC to accommodate the Afrikaner in a future constitutional dispensation. General Viljoen also said that certain intelligence services were attempting to cause division in right-wing Afrikaner ranks. He said right-wing organizations were vulnerable to infiltration and that it was a technique of intelligence services to infiltrate and sow division. After the gathering he told our political news staff that it was possible that the government's intelligence service was involved. General Viljoen would not give examples of the alleged infiltration but said that certain things were happening which had caused him to draw this conclusion.
