"We must recognise on a diplomatic level the republic of Serb Krajina and establish a military and political union with that state," said Deputy Speaker Vladimir Vengerovskiy, a member of the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party. "Russia's traditional interests in the region lie with the Serbs and we must join them in a political and military union," Communist Deputy Vitaly Sevastionov told a news conference. The call for a closer alliance with the Serbs came as Russian diplomats were attempting to broker a peace agreement between Croatian officials and Serbs in Krajina. The delegation said that Serb leaders in Krajina and Belgrade were prepared to offer land on the Adriatic coast to Russia for a naval base and said that up to 200,000 Russians would be welcome to live there. "They could be refugees from ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union or military leaders who lost their posts because of the pull-outs", Sevastionov said. The deputies said the Serb leaders would make an official proposal on establishing a naval base in the near future. They also said that the State Duma would discuss in the near future lifting UN sanctions against the former Yugoslavia, stating that the measure amounted to the "genocide of the Serbian people" in the Balkans. The news conference was held hours before a rival parliamentary delegation led by reformist Deputy Viktor Sheinis was to meet journalists to discuss its separate visit to the former Yugoslavia.
