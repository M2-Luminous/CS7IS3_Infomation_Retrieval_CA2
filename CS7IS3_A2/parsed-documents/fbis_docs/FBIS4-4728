Hata said the opportunity could come in Marrakech, Morocco, later this month when ministers from 119 nations gather for the signing of a global trade pact or at a meeting of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in June. At a press conference after a regular cabinet meeting, Hata dismissed remarks by a high-ranking Japanese Government official that nothing can be done about the trade talks until Japan hammers out economic reform measures in June. Japan still has to make macroeconomic efforts, including tax reform and deregulation, and relevant ministries and agencies are currently working on them, Hata said. The government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested earlier in the day that nothing can be done at the moment and that it is important to show Japan's efforts in the economic measures scheduled for June. Hata said both Japan and the U.S. should make efforts to resume the trade talks. The two countries have opportunities to hold meetings in Marrakech and at the OECD council meeting and Japan wants to inform the U.S. of Japanese efforts at those meetings, Hata said. Hata is expected to meet U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech next week at the signing ceremony for the global trade pact concluded in the Uruguay Round last December under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
