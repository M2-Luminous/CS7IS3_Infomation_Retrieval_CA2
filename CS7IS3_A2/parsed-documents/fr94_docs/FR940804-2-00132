FR940804-2-00132 FR940804-2-00072 [Docket No. 94&hyph;8] James H. Sanders, M.D.; Revocation of Registration On October 12, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, (then-Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to James H. Sanders, M.D. (Respondent), of Barbourville, Kentucky. The Order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr. Sanders' DEA Certificate of Registration, AS6935918, and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent was not currently authorized to handle controlled substances in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and that Respondent's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4). The Order to Show Cause alleged that: Since 1986, DEA received complaints regarding Respondent's excessive prescribing of controlled substances to individuals for no legitimate medical reason; between December 1991 and September 1992, DEA conducted an undercover investigation during which Respondent prescribed controlled substances to undercover agents upon request without performing any physical examination or taking a medical history; during the investigation, Respondent was observed prescribing controlled substances to other individuals in the same manner as he issued prescriptions to the undercover agents; in October 1992, DEA conducted a prescription survey of five pharmacies in Barbourville, Kentucky, which revealed that between April 1, 1992 and October 29, 1992, Respondent prescribed 229,090 dosage units of controlled substances; and on December 9, 1992, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, State Board of Medical Licensure (Board) seized 43 patient records from Respondent's office. The Order to Show Cause further alleged that on January 21, 1993, the Board issued an Order of Temporary Suspension suspending Respondent's license to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. On March 2, 1993, the Board lifted the suspension of Respondent's medical license, however, his controlled substances privileges remained suspended. As a result, Respondent is no longer authorized by state law to handle controlled substances. Respondent, through counsel, filed a request for a hearing on the issues raised by the order to Show Cause, and the matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. On November 19, 1993, the Government filed a motion for summary disposition, which was accompanied by a letter from the General Counsel to the Board, dated October 20, 1993, as to the status of Respondent's controlled substance privileges in Kentucky. The Government argued that since Respondent is not currently authorized in the Commonwealth of Kentucky to handle controlled substances, DEA could not continue to maintain his registration. On December 14, 1993, Respondent filed a response to the Government's motion, asserting, in substance, that Respondent's state license had been temporarily restricted to limit his ability to prescribe controlled substances and that on February 22, 1994, the Board would reach a final decision regarding Respondent's privileges to practice medicine in Kentucky. On December 20, 1993, the administrative law judge issued a Memorandum to Counsel affording Respondent until March 15, 1994, to file a statement as to the status of his authority to handle controlled substances in Kentucky. No such statement has been filed. On April 7, 1994, in her opinion and recommended decision, the administrative law judge found that the Respondent did not deny that his state license to practice medicine has been restricted. The administrative law judge therefore, granted the Government's motion for summary disposition and recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked. On May 10, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. The Deputy Administrator adopts the opinion and recommended decision of the administrative law judge in its entirety. The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f) and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld. See James H. Nickens, M.D., 57 FR 59847 (1992); Elliott Monroe, M.D., 57 FR 23246 (1992); Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11919 (1988). The administrative law judge properly granted the Government's motion for summary disposition. It is well-settled that when no question of fact is involved, or when the facts are agreed upon, a plenary, adversary administrative proceeding involving evidence and cross-examination of witnesses is not obligatory. The rationale is that Congress does not intend administrative agencies to perform meaningless tasks. Phillip E. Kirk, M.D., 48 FR 32887 (1983), aff'd sub nom Kirk v. Mullen, 749 F. 2d 297 (6th Cir. 1984); Alfred Tennyson Smurthwaite, N.D., 43 FR 11873 (1978); see also, NLRB v. International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Ironworkers, AFL&hyph;CIO, 549 F. 2d 634 (9th Cir. 1977); United States v. Consolidated Mines and Smelting Co., Ltd., 455 F. 2d 432, 453 (9th Cir. 1971). Since Respondent is not currently authorized to handle controlled substances in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, it is not necessary to reach a conclusion regarding whether his continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AS6935918, previously issued to James H. Sanders, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked and that any pending applications for renewal of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied, This order is effective September 6, 1994. Dated: July 28, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19057 Filed 8&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
