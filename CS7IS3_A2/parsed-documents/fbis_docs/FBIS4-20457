Digital Equipment Co recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the Pudong Software Park Development Co in Shanghai. Initially, Digital is to offer its new Alpha AXP 64-bit RISC architecture (a high-speed data processing technology), mature network systems integration and other technical and management expertise. ``Shanghai's development in the information technology industry will be explosive and Digital is very fortunate to have this opportunity to be a partner with this dynamic company to further the information technology objectives of China,'' said Bob Allesio, Digital's marketing director. Information technology has recently gained a strategic position in the city's economy, joining automobiles and telecommunications as a pillar industry. The industry expects sales to jump from 1 billion yuan ($115 million) last year to 5 billion yuan ($575 million) in 1995 and 20 billion yuan ($2.3 billion) by the year 2000. City leaders expect the local information technology industry to gain at least one-third of the country's market. As part of the expansion drive, Pudong Software Development Park was founded by the Electronics Industry Ministry and the city government to put East Shanghai in a leading position in the country's software development. The park's ambitious plan is to employ 3,000 software engineers in 1996 and 10,000 by the year 2000. The software park development company, owned by the city government and the Ministry of Electronics, is in charge of the park's infrastructure, business operations and support services. Company president Sun Yuanhong said the signing of the memorandum marked ``the participation of one of the world's leading computer vendors in our project.''
