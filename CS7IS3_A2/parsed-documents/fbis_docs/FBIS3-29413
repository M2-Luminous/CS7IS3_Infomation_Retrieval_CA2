For a month long, from mid-January to mid-February, the two-headed government and the puppets of communist Vietnam and their masters have time and again claimed that they have captured Anlung Veng. On 15 January and on 17, 20, 23, 27, and 31 January, they claimed the capture of Anlung Veng and informed national and international news reporters of the visit to Anlung Veng. II. However, the news reporters have been waiting from one day to another till they have lost patience and accused the two-headed government of deceitful attempts. Such a scornful accusation has become the talk of the town, as the reporters and people in Phnom Penh know that the two-headed government and the puppets have suffered defeat after defeat in their operations in the direction of Anlung Veng. They had been severely defeated in their first, second, and third attempts. Their soldiers have suffered heavy casualties, both killed and wounded. They have died on the battlefield and from starvation, lack of water, malaria. Many of them have deserted. Even with such heavy casualties, the Hanoi authority and the entente continue to order the two-headed government and the puppets to launch the fourth attempt of military operation starting from 9 February. However, their soldiers -- who have low morale -- have deserted. Even the commanders of the operation -- such as Long Sopheap, Prum Samen, Keo Pisit -- have been scared of the battlefield as they have seen many generals, colonels, and other military officers killed or wounded at the front, and they are facing a deadly encirclement by the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK]. III. The spokesman of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] would like to make the following clarification: First, the region of Anlung Veng still remains in the hands of the PDK, but it has been transformed into a battleground between, on the one hand, the forces of the two-headed government and the puppets, and on the other hand, the forces of the NADK and the local people. The fighting continues unabated. However, the most outstanding feature is the fact that the NADK and the local people have been able to encircle the headquarters of the enemy commanding post where Long Sopheap, Prum Samen, Keo Pisit, and quite a number of other generals have to stay permanently in their tanks and always on the move in western and southern parts of Anlung Veng region. Their tanks and heavy guns have been under constant attacks by the NADK and must be on the move at all times. But they are facing another difficulty; that is, the shortage of gasoline. Secondly, from 9 to 15 February, for seven days, the front-line commanders of the troops of the two-headed government had been encircled by the NADK and local people who can see that those puppet commanders were either put to rout or killed on the spot. Those who were able to escape with their troops from the frontline were intercepted and inflicted heavy casualties by our NADK units. The enemy situation has been in a desperate position because of several factors: 1. They are hundreds of kilometers far from their near bases; 2. They have no one civilian who supports them in the region; 3. They cannot supply themselves on the spot. In a word, they are like in desert. Everyday, because of food supply, they complain about ammunition shortage, about the non-forthcoming of tanks, heavy guns because they had in Phnom Penh, and complain about diarrhea and other diseases which have target their troops. [sentence as heard] On top of the list, because of fatigue, desertion has increased. Thirdly, experiences of wars in the world have indicated that when the enemies stay in such an encircled position, cut off from their supply bases -- such were the case of Stalingrad during the Second World War and Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam -- they are finally annihilated. Fourthly, during the course of the war in general and during a major operation in particular, the gain of lots of towns has its own significance [words indistinct]. The most important one is the elimination of the enemy strength. If the enemies lose their strength on the battlefield, they will lose their fighting forces and the towns they occupy. Experiences of the wars in Cambodia and in the world have clearly vindicated that particular view. IV. Can communist Vietnam and its puppets and the two- headed government and the entente -- who have worked out and implemented their strategies and tactics of starting the current situation through the pursuit of the war -- resolve the problem? What will be their fate? Is not a peaceful conciliation better? To such questions, the answers are as follows: Firstly, the above-cited questions can be answered by another question. On the battlefield of Anlung Veng, how many more days or months or seasons can the forces of the two-headed government continue the fighting, as they are in a desert land; they are encircled and cut off from their supply bases; and they have been under a constant attack, especially the guerrilla warfare of the NADK and local people? Secondly, another question is: Taking into consideration the situation in Cambodia as a whole, are the old and new aggressors and their puppets as strong as Americans and Lon Nol? Do they have as much money as at that time? Are they as strong as the first Khmer war of the communist Vietnamese with hundreds of thousands of troops from 1978 to 1991? The next question that comes to mind is: What will be the fate of the two-headed government who wants to continue the Vietnamese war? Thirdly, another question is: Who wants national conciliation and peace? Who are against them? These questions are linked to the question of forces. Those who want national conciliation and peace will have forces. Those who are against them will not have forces. That is indeed a basic and strategic issue. Who supports the national conciliation and peace in accordance with His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point guideline? It is the entire Cambodian nation and people based in the countryside and in the cities, at home and abroad, and peace-loving countries and people in the world, especially those of Asia, who want peace, security, and stability in the region. Fourth, the entire Cambodian nation and people have risen up to uphold the five-point national conciliation banner of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. These forces are gaining strength by the day from one month or season to another. These forces will certainly get rid of the aggressors, the warmongers, those who oppose national conciliation and peace, and the puppets of communist Vietnam until the banner of national conciliation and peace of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk will fly all over the country. World War I and World War II experiences, as well as regional wars, have vindicated that the aggressors and their puppets will be eliminated by the forces of the entire nation and people. The fate of the old and new aggressors and their puppets in Cambodia will certainly not be different. [Dated] 16 February 1994 [Signed] The spokesman of the PDK
