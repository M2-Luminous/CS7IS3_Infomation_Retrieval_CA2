In an interview with AFP, Divjak, one of two deputy chiefs-of-staff in the Bosnian Army, deplored the "lack of determination" shown by the United States and the "irresponsibility" of the European Community, whose negotiator Lord Owen has been trying to broker a three-way carve-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina. With the present balance of forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, any UN withdrawal would "only put a match to the powderkeg the Balkans have become," he said. Divjak said the Bosnian Army was "poorly armed, starved of logistical back-up, but well motivated," and would carry out the political objectives it had been assigned. "Despite protestations of peace, the three parties continue to clash on the ground, because the Serbs and the Croats have not yet completed the boundaries of their quasi-states, while the Bosnian government is seeking to recapture the territory taken from it by force." He said the Bosnian Croat HVO [Croatian Defense Council] forces were trying to forge a corridor in central Bosnia linking the towns of Prozor, Gornji Vakuf and Travnik with Vitez and Busovaca. Some 14,000 soldiers from Croatia with around 40 tanks, helicopters and aircraft had reinforced the HVO troops, Divjak said. But he vowed that the "Bosnian Croats and Croatia will be the biggest losers in this war." A former officer in the defunct Yugoslav army, Divjak, himself of Serb origin, predicted that "without a strong multi-national Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia cannot survive." Serbia's expansionist appetite was not limited to Bosnia, he said, pointing out that Serbs already controlled a quarter of Croatian territory. The Bosnian Serbs were fielding 80,000 men, 25,000 of whom had come from Serbia, he said. Backed by at least 500 tanks, they were trying to establish a corridor running from northwest to southeast along the Krivaja valley, which was why they were currently attacking the Moslem-held town of Olovo, on the Krivaja River some 30 kilometres (18 miles) northeast of Sarajevo. "The Serbs are not interested in Olovo itself," Divjak said. "What they want is to advance up the valley towards Vozuca and Maglaj (which are held by the Bosnian Army) to link up with (Serb-held) Doboj." That way they would drive a wedge between the second and third Bosnian Army corps, he said. Sarajevo itself was in a bad way, he admitted. "Not one single weapon has got into Sarajevo since November 1992," he said. It was now more than a year and a half since the Bosnian forces had managed to destroy any of the 80 Serb tanks training their guns on the city. More firepower was aimed at Sarajevo than had been deployed to pound Berlin into surrender at the end of World War Two, he said, with some 1,500 artillery pieces ranged against the city. By contrast, Sarajevo had not more than 20 artillery pieces, no mortars, no ammunition, few weapons and only a few home-made handgrenades with which to defend itself. "We are putting the emphasis on diversionary tactics," he said. He said airstrikes against Serb positions would help ease the situation. "It would be enough, by way of reprisals, to bomb their mechanised units and tanks, their ammunition dumps, and to knock out the 20 or so bridges across the Drina River between Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina." One thing was certain, he said. "The war will not end tomorrow."
