It is too complicated a process, he said today when he was asked by an ITAR-TASS correspondent whether the DPRK will be able to produce enough plutonium to make atomic weapons. As for the DPRK's departure from the IAEA, Viktor Mikhaylov considers that "this is more a cry from the heart on North Korea's part." He urged a dialogue between Russia and the United States on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK, observing that the country cannot be isolated, even if it announces its departure from the IAEA. "I think," he emphasized, "that on the North Korean issue dialogue will prevail and the DPRK will remain in the IAEA."
