FBIS4-12030 "drnes065dd_94003" FBIS-NES-94-065 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Qaddumi Interviewed on Negotiations Qaddumi Interviewed on Negotiations NC0504063494 Cairo AL-MUSAWWAR in Arabic 1 Apr 94 pp 14-17 NC0504063494 Cairo AL-MUSAWWAR Arabic BFN [Interview with Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, by Salwa Abu-Sa'dah in Cairo; date not given] [Text] Faruq Qaddumi "Abu-al-Lutf", head of the PLO Political Department, one of the organization's prominent leaders, and indeed one of the strongest opponents of the "bad" articles of the Oslo agreement, as he puts it, has given this exclusive interview to AL-MUSAWWWAR. Hebron's massacre, its repercussions, active influence on the peace process, and the changes of priorities and concepts that it dictated, particularly its undermining of the Israeli security theory, was one of the chief issues he discussed. Neither Rabin's policies nor the U.S. violation and circumvention of the text and principles of the U.S. peace initiative escaped Abu-al-Lutf's analysis. In the following interview he outlines the necessary Palestinian negotiating method and sets forth the priorities of Palestinian action after the Gaza-Jericho agreement is implemented. [Abu-Sa'dah] During the Arab foreign ministers meeting two days ago, did you expect better results than the ones actually achieved in connection with the Jerusalem issue and protection for the Palestinians? What level of Arab action do you believe is necessary to serve this cause? [Qaddumi] The Arab group should handle the task of barring U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. This group should also mobilize world support for our demands on this issue, taking into account the fact that Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories. The United States cannot turn its back on the principles on which the peace process was founded. These principles maintain that Jerusalem is part of the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967. UN Security Council resolutions specify this, too. Several weeks ago the U.S. Administration submitted a message on human rights which referred to the same point. [Abu-Sa'dah] What do you say about President Clinton's remark that Jerusalem is Israel's capital? [Qaddumi] The United States, explaining its reservations about the Jerusalem paragraph in the relevant UN Security Council resolution, says that Jerusalem is being left to the final status negotiations. Actually this is a manipulation of words. The United States must be an impartial intermediary and must not interfere in such matters but must let the negotiations take their course. There must be no alteration of the text of UN Security Council Resolution 242 which considers East Jerusalem part of the Palestinian occupied territories. The United States should not give the impression to the world that these territories are disputed territories in line with Israel's pretension that it regained the Palestinian occupied territories from Egypt and Jordan. The UN partition resolution that gave Israel its own birth certificate declares that these territories are Palestinian and belong to the Palestinians who have the right to establish an independent state on them. [Abu-Sa'dah] Will the PLO adopt specific steps to clarify the Palestinian opposition to any U.S. bias to Israel? [Qaddumi] We have begun to take such measures. The Arab League has been active in this regard. It organized a meeting of the Arab ambassadors in Washington and formed a committee which began a dialogue with the U.S. Administration, explaining that the foundations on which the peace process rests must not be changed. Otherwise the process of political settlement would become flawed. The Arab group must also rally world opinion around the idea that Jerusalem belongs to the three religions and that East Jerusalem was occupied in 1967. The whole world recognizes this. [Abu-Sa'dah] What about the alternatives Palestinians have to tackle on the issue of Jerusalem--negotiating it in the final phase--and about the idea of internationalization that Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] raised some time ago? [Qaddumi] Abu-'Ammar has not called for internationalizing Jerusalem. These statements--if we can call them statements--were fabricated by a foreign news agency. Jerusalem in our view is part of the occupied Palestinian territories. I am referring to Arab Jerusalem; it is the capital of the Palestinian state. From the first moment, when we took part in the Madrid conference, [former U.S. Secretary of State] James Baker said that Jerusalem is part of the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967. We are therefore mobilizing world public opinion to emphasize this fact. Our vision is that east Jerusalem must be the capital of the Palestinian state once it is proclaimed. It is impermissible for any party to anticipate matters and determine the fate of this city. Everyone should be committed to the texts of international legitimacy and the UN Security Council resolutions, which provide the basis for the political settlement President Bush suggested on the basis of Resolution 242. This resolution stresses the need to withdraw from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967--east Jerusalem was occupied in 1967--and definitely shows that whatever is being said by the Israeli or American side in this connection is jumping ahead of events. [Abu-Sa'dah] Do you expect the Israeli response to the disputed points in recent talks in Cairo--about the technical details concerning the deployment of Palestinian forces in Hebron--to be positive, or negative? [Qaddumi] We know the policy Israel pursues and we know its negotiating approach; it procrastinates and equivocates. Shamir clearly said before that he wanted these talks to drag on for 10 years without taking a step forward. Rabin and the Labor Party use a more flexible language that deceives many world circles. He says that he wants to emphasize the security aspect in the occupied territories and that Israel gives top priority to the issue of security. He wants to blackmail the Palestinian negotiator--as though it were Israel that is threatened--without committing himself to the Oslo agreement. He even says that these dates [not further specified] are not sacred. After the ugly massacre--committed in Hebron through a conspiracy between the settlers and the Israeli Army--it was proved beyond a doubt that Rabin, who is in collusion with the army, shows by his statements that Israel does not want peace. All he seeks through these practices is to subjugate the Palestinian people and eat up the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He once again describes the Palestinian territories as Judea and Samaria. The al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre proved that it is we, and not the Israelis, who need security. The recent resolution, 904, demanded that protection for the Palestinian people be provided. This rebuts Israel's claim to protect its security against neighboring threats. The massacre has proven that Israel is the chief cause of tension, that it procrastinates and that it wants to devour the occupied territories. We reject that. [Abu-Sa'dah] Therefore, you don't expect a positive Israeli response to the points of dispute concerning the deployment of the Palestinian forces in Hebron? [Qaddumi] Israel is pursuing procrastination in the negotiations. They sometimes agree on certain points, but later on they disagree on these points. When we show flexibility and accept specific points, they consider this a gain and they try to gain more points. We reject this policy. They will make other proposals that run counter to the provisions that have been agreed upon. Israel procrastinates and it is not sincere. We have no confidence in its behavior. [Abu-Sa'dah] During the Cairo negotiations concerning the deployment of the Palestinian forces in Hebron, Israel said that it will unilaterally deal with the settlers the way it sees fit. Do you believe that Israel will comply with its commitment concerning the issue of settlers? [Qaddumi] Israel must clearly adopt measures in this regard. According to Resolution 904, Israel will disarm the settlers. Israel must eliminate the settlements that cause instability and obstruct the peace process. Some settlements cause direct friction and provoke the Palestinian people. These settlements must be eliminated. There are 42 Israeli families, an Israeli school, and various centers in Hebron. All these meant to provoke 120,000 Arabs who live in the town and its suburbs. Many Israelis corroborated these facts and demanded that this Israeli presence be eliminated. Therefore, Israel must eliminate this. Israel adopted some measures, including the imposition of a curfew on Hebron and the occupied territories. This curfew must be lifted. Israel must also end the siege on the West Bank, Gaza, and Jerusalem, because these measures do not help create the appropriate atmosphere for starting the negotiations. The United Nations must send enough international observers of various nationalities, such as Americans, Britons, Russians, and the French, so that the Palestinian people feel secure. These observers will supervise the questionable movements of the settlers. [Abu-Sa'dah] Now that the two sides have agreed on several points regarding the Palestinian force, the deployment in Hebron, and the international presence, should the talks resume, do you expect Israel to withdraw by 13 April? [Qaddumi] The question is not whether we are pessimistic or not. The point is that Israel does not comply with the agreement and does not honor the promises it makes, not even if there is international verification of Israel's promises. In the first place, Israel did not honor the Oslo agreement and did not withdraw on 13 December. Rabin even boasts that these dates are not sacred. Thus, for Israel, none of the points in the agreement are sacred and require long negotiations. Since the balance of power is in Israel's favor and it is the occupying power, it does what it likes. But the cosponsors of the conference must pressure Israel to implement this agreement in full; that is, the withdrawal must take place on time on 13 April and the last withdrawal must take place in June so that the elections can be held. They should have fully withdrawn from Gaza, but they came to Cairo to seek a bigger area for the settlements and to insist on their responsibility for security at the crossing points, although the internal security and the crossing points are two closely related issues. The crossing points are the responsibility of the internal security and they [the Israelis] are responsible for external security, which is a like a seasonal issue that arises in case of an aggression against the Israeli or Palestinian territories. They had an agreement with Egypt, so there is no threat. But they insist on interpreting the agreement the way they want and try to divest it of its real substance under the claim of security. [Abu-Sa'dah] How would you describe the magnitude of the Palestinian rejectionists? [Qaddumi] Everyone has the right to criticize, and the Palestinian people have the right to voice their opinion clearly. If I am one of those opposed to the Oslo agreement and the bad points in it, the others too have the right to object to it. But there are two kinds of opposition: The first is objective opposition. The second is non-objective opposition that involves insults. We are for the first. As to the question of the negotiations, we have accepted them as a political method to gain our rights, but resistance will continue as long as there is a single Israeli soldier in the occupied territories. We are entitled to defend ourselves and resist this occupation. So, we respect the constructive opposition as part of the national movement of the Palestinian people that plays its role the way it sees fit, and we cannot interfere in this. But we listen to criticism if it is constructive. If we believe it is correct, we must take it into consideration. We are going through a difficult peace process and tough negotiations and we do not have any other alternative. If we say we do not want negotiations, what would the alternative be? It is true that the intifadah continues. We have entered the negotiations to cut back on immigrants, contain the settlement-building activity, and take part of our land, albeit gradually. All this is important because time is passing by, the settlements are built, and the immigrants are coming. The settlement process has caused these phenomena to abate with international pressure. We are committed to the political settlement, but we cannot resume the negotiations before Security Council Resolution 904 is implemented. [Abu-Sa'dah] Do you think that Rabin's decision to consider Kakh and Kahane Hay as illegal terrorist organizations will affect the official conduct of the Israeli government and that settlers will abide by the rules to be imposed on them? [Qaddumi] The trend of racism and building settlements is gaining strength day by day in Israel. This is what arouses our suspicion about Rabin's ability to enforce actual measures in a short time to prevent settlers from conducting acts of terrorism and violence against the Palestinian citizens. He will not be able to do that. Moreover, he does not want to take such measures. This is clear in his hesitation concerning the Oslo agreement. It showed on his face during the signing ceremony. He looked as though he had been dragged to Washington against his will by an U.S. order. This is the truth. This hesitation was reflected in his responsiveness to the Israeli army officers; he postponed withdrawal and began to impose unacceptable conditions during the negotiations that produced the foul Cairo agreement--the agreement that forced many restrictions on us. [Abu-Sa'dah] Can you specify what these restrictions are? [Qaddumi] Giving the Israelis control on pathways; their attempts to deploy more troops around settlements; granting more areas to settlements; giving settlers freedom of movement; cutting down the area of Jericho to less than 345 square km, the area stipulated in the 1932 administrative division under the British mandate; and other things they forced on us in violation of the agreement. Rabin does not have the will. In the meantime, he schemes with senior army officers. Peres said "we were negotiating with ourselves." In other words, there was a controversy among them on the stipulations of the Oslo and Cairo agreements--which Minister 'Amr Musa calls the Cairo declaration--because it was just initialed and not fully signed. This agreement awaits the other part of handing over authority to be complete. Hence, we find that the measures Rabin is taking are superficial and absolutely do not create a favorable or relaxed atmosphere to keep up negotiations. The ratio of those who support the Oslo agreement has dropped to less than 10 percent, if not five percent. How can such a leadership lead the masses when these masses do not back the agreement? That is all because of Yitzhaq Rabin. This gave Israeli fanatics cards to play and encouraged them to commit acts of violence and terrorism against the Palestinian people. Rabin has bet on the fanatics; he has become almost one of them. [Abu-Sa'dah] You disapprove of the Oslo agreement, but how would you assess the peace process and the Palestinian negotiating method, both with the Israeli and U.S. parties? [Qaddumi] What we see happening before us does not make us optimistic, something that will obstruct the peace march and create a tense atmosphere that may lead to an explosion in the entire Arab region. It will also affect Israeli society, where there are voices calling for removing many of the settlements, speeding up the withdrawal, and providing adequate security measures so that the Palestinians may feel that Israel is serious about peace. The differences within Israel will increase. Yitzhaq Rabin has concluded an agreement with Shas (an extremist religious party) under conditions that compromise the Oslo agreement as well as the political settlement. [Abu-Sa'dah] How? [Qaddumi] Rabin and Shas agreed on five conditions, allowing Shas to continue building the settlements, stating that they are against a Palestinian state, and that they will continue to establish settlements inside the occupied territories. We have submitted a memorandum to the United States and Russia on this recent Israeli agreement. Yitzhaq Rabin is still playing games, maneuvering, and procrastinating. This policy and attitude by Rabin will destroy the settlement and will increase tension to the point of explosion. [Abu-Sa'dah] What is the scenario that you think the Palestinian negotiators should follow in this delicate stage of the negotiations? [Qaddumi] To insist on the political constants and on a comprehensive withdrawal, discuss the settlements today and not tomorrow so that measures can be taken to remove them, even if gradually; to hand over power to the Palestinians immediately, and to adopt immediate measures in the occupied territories in general and in Hebron in particular so that our people there can feel that there is a desire to establish peace. [Abu-Sa'dah] It seems that the head of the PLO Political Department does not expect the self-rule talks to resume. Is this true? [Qaddumi] That is a false statement. When we accepted the Madrid conference, the United States told us that something must be accomplished quickly, within one year: an interim self-government that is more than self-rule and less than independence. Thus, self-rule is rejected. There are twice the number of our people as compared to Israelis in Palestine, and this is clear. Thus, there must be sincerity in implementing this agreement so that it can be fully implemented in the end and an atmosphere of peaceful coexistence between us and the Israelis can be created, not by creating obstacles, difficulties, and procrastinating like Rabin is doing. [Abu-Sa'dah] Has the Palestinian leadership started to discuss the question of authority in the next stage after getting a part of the land back in the first stage? [Qaddumi] We have a popular saying in Arabic that we should cross the bridge when we get to it. We are not after authority. We just want our land back. We want our people, who were wrenched from that land in 1967, to return. That is our major concern. Another concern is to establish the pillars for the security and peace of our people. After that, we can think about the issue of authority. We are working on constructing our institutions inside the occupied territories so that the people can take on their responsibilities fully without any pressure or threats. [Abu-Sa'dah] I would like to ask you, Mr. Faruq Qaddumi, about the political map of the Palestinian street with its various parties and currents, and whether the Palestinian choice during the first stage will be political pluralism or whether this issue is not under discussion now. [Qaddumi] From the beginning, there has to be free democratic government and free economy. Everyone opposing this course will be thrown outside it by history itself. [Abu-Sa'dah] If you are thinking about pluralism, then you are proposing dissolving the PLO. Is this a possibility? [Qaddumi] The PLO does not necessarily need to be dissolved. It is a haven for every Palestinian citizen and all the organizations and institutions of the Palestinian people. They have the right to stay within the PLO, and to discuss and practice their duties through the organization. It is also their right to explain and criticize every political decision in a constructive way that serves the national movement and cause. [Abu-Sa'dah] But what will the PLO's situation be like with respect to the presence of political pluralism. What is the proposed form for political action now? [Qaddumi] It is the rule of the national front. During the liberation phase, the national front will be formed. We insist on the participation of all parties in this front. They are our partners and have contributed toward the national struggle. They participated with us in decisionmaking. It is their right to work within the framework of this organization and to have their specific responsibilities. [Abu-Sa'dah] Very often in writings about the question of Palestine and in talk among the Palestinian people, discussions touch on the dictatorship in Palestinian decisionmaking. How true is this and how can one avert it, if it is actually present? [Qaddumi] In the stage of national struggle, central democracy is the prevalent principle. To a large extent, it is similar not to dictatorship, but is based on the national front which will run all affairs. However, we are on the threshold of a new phase, during which we need to preserve freedom of speech and political pluralism, as well as freedom to criticize and freedom of choice for the Palestinian people. In other words, these democratic features need to be adopted and the people need to feel that. At the same time, we have all really started practicing them. The issue of democracy is very important and we should not close our eyes to it, to pluralism, or to free economy. In this way, we can contain any individual behavior. However, at this stage, while we are still scattered in all parts of the world, it is not easy for us to construct our permanent institutions. We are a nomadic revolution constantly on the move. When we settle on our land, we will build our permanent institutions and our democracy. Such shortcomings will remain as long as we are dispersed. We should not be harder on ourselves than is necessary. We cannot hold general elections, and therefore we have to resort to other methods until we are able to give our people a choice. Our people are living under different conditions and in several countries. They are under political, economic, and social pressure because of their presence in those countries and they are affected by those pressures, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Some individual actions are caused by the absence of the true form of democratic unity. Our conditions create many failings and make a lot of the actions of the leadership or individuals appear to be individualistic ones. This is the reality. We should not evade this reality but confront it and continue our efforts in this organization and tell whoever acts unilaterally that they are acting unilaterally. If we look at the Arab region and the Third World, we can see that the leaderships there are not criticized as much as the Palestinian leadership. We are nearer to democracy in its unrefined term. We curse and exchange harsh words, therefore we are democrats. The abnormal conditions of our people have created these resentful ideas among the Palestinian people. We cannot change them until we get back to the territories and then tell our people: Be hard on your leadership because you are right in seeing we have made mistakes. [Abu-Sa'dah] How much are you convinced of your remaining involved, when you are openly opposed to the Oslo agreement? [Qaddumi] Being opposed to something does not mean running away from the battle, regardless of the price. The Palestinian cause is not served through statements or press writings. To reach a common concept, we must get together within the framework of the PLO and the establishment so as to have a dialogue because a dialogue will remain one-sided if it is held through newspapers and magazines. [Abu-Sa'dah] What happened in the dialogue between the PLO and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]? [Qaddumi] No dialogue between us and Hamas has been held so far. This does not mean that we have not made mistakes. We have made mistakes. But the stage is really critical and we must overcome many of the mistakes made by this side and the other side. We must sit down and have a dialogue because interaction can only come through a lively direct dialogue. Many forces are trying to damage the PLO's credibility and its ability to lead the Palestinian people. We want all our brothers to participate in this dialogue even if they are opposed to the Oslo agreement. This is the lesser of two evils, because the PLO has lost Arab aid and has been besieged politically, even by the Arabs as a result of the Damascus Declaration after the Gulf war. Some of us were of the opinion that we must get out of this predicament. Many of us opted for the Oslo agreement, which I oppose, as a way out of this dilemma. But as a responsible leader, I cannot leave the others to navigate through the Oslo agreement maze. I am a PLO official and I must be with them to express my views frankly and clearly. [Abu-Sa'dah] Even if such views are not accepted? [Qaddumi] Even if they are not accepted. However, many of my views are beginning to find acceptance. It is becoming clear that many brothers have begun to realize that they were wrong and that they were hasty in doing this or that. One of these mistakes was that we made promises to some Arab states, including Syria, for example, that we will take their views into consideration. But Clinton insisted very strongly that the agreement be signed on 13 September. Therefore, it was not our responsibility. We approached Syria and Jordan. As to the statement that everything was done secretly, the fact is that there were several chances for a breakthrough in the negotiations after they reached a deadlock. A breakthrough was essential. The brothers achieved this breakthrough in the Oslo agreement. They made an effort. But it is not true to say that we lost everything, and that the Arab nation has lost the military option. The Arab nation was in a deep sleep. We had to have a breakthrough to bring about Israeli withdrawal. Enemy withdrawal from any inch of land is a positive thing. If negotiations were suspended, then immigration to Israel, the building of settlements, and intra-Israeli accord would have continued--a significant matter. We have created conflict among the Israelis, and this will undermine Israel from within.
