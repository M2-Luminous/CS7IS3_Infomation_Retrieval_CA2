FR940325-0-00092 FR940325-0-00016 Response: The Department believes that it has full authority to issue §11.91(e). Section 301(c) of CERCLA authorizes the Department to ``promulgate regulations for the assessment of damages for injury to *␣*␣* natural resources.'' Section 113(g)(1) of CERCLA creates a statute of limitations based on the date that those regulations are ``promulgated.'' Since Ohio v. Interior and Colorado v. Interior were issued, there has been considerable confusion over the statute of limitations. Nothing in the language or legislative history of CERCLA explicitly defines ``promulgation.'' As the agency given authority to develop procedures for assessing natural resource damages, the Department believes it is in the best position to evaluate when regulations establishing full procedures have been promulgated. Issuance of §11.91(e) is designed merely to clarify an unclear statutory term and is well within the scope of the Department's expertise and statutory grant of authority. Comment: Some commenters stated that the proposed clarification was consistent with Congressional intent. These commenters noted legislative history indicating that section 113(g)(1) was added to CERCLA out of concern that the absence of final natural resource damage assessment regulations had impaired the ability of trustee officials to pursue claims. According to these commenters, trustee officials are just as handicapped after Ohio v. Interior and Colorado v. Interior as they were when section 113(g)(1) was passed because those cases invalidated a crucial aspect of the regulations, namely the measure of damages. Other commenters stated that the proposed clarification could not be consistent with Congressional intent because it would allow the statute of limitations to be tolled indefinitely. These commenters disagreed with the Department's statement in the July 22, 1993, Federal Register notice that Ohio v. Interior and Colorado v. Interior left trustee officials without a measure of damages. These commenters stated that Ohio v. Interior established restoration costs as the measure of damages. Response: The Department believes that proposed §11.91(e) is completely consistent with Congressional intent. Ohio v. Interior did not overturn the regulations in their entirety; however, it did remand an extremely critical component of the regulations, namely the measure of damages. Although Ohio v. Interior held that restoration costs are the preferred measure of damages, the court also acknowledged that the Department has considerable authority and discretion to shape the specific scope of the measure of damages. Thus, until the Department revises the regulations, no valid measure of damages exists. Section 11.91(e) does not allow the statute of limitations to be tolled indefinitely, it merely ensures that trustee officials are not barred from bringing suit before they have the benefit of complete procedures for assessing natural resource damages. The legislative history of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) indicates that section 113(g)(1) was added to CERCLA because Congress believed that so long as trustee officials lacked procedures for assessing natural resource damages they were handicapped in their ability to bring suit. In the absence of a valid damage formula, the very goal of the natural resource damage assessment regulations, namely the derivation of a monetary damage figure, cannot be fully realized. Comment: Some commenters stated that the proposed clarification of the date of promulgation was incorrect as a matter of law and common sense. The commenters cited dictionaries and case law for the proposition that the date of promulgation is the date on which a signed rule is first made public or is published, not when it has cleared judicial hurdles. United States v. City of Seattle , No. C90&hyph;395WD, slip op. (W.D. Wash. Jan. 28, 1991) ( U.S. v. Seattle ); American Petroleum Institute v. Costle , 609 F.2d 20, 23&hyph;24 (D.C. Cir. 1979) ( API v. Costle ); United Technologies Corp . v. Occupational Safety and Health Administration , 836 F.2d 52, 54 (2d Cir. 1987) ( UTC v. OSHA ). Response: The Department believes that the cases cited by commenters for the proposition that ``promulgation'' occurs when a regulation is first made public are inapposite. API v. Costle involved the interpretation of a provision of the Clean Air Act that prohibited the inclusion of documents in a rulemaking docket after the date of promulgation. 609 F.2d at 22. Noting that the statutory provision was designed to ensure adequate opportunity for public review and to prevent post hoc rationalizations, the court held that the date of promulgation was the date the final rule was first released to the public as opposed to the date of publication in the Federal Register . Id. at 23&hyph;24.
