He said that his post as chairman of the Constitutional Court does not give him the right to interpret the Constitution on his own. However, he perceives the entire problem as predominantly a political conflict. Therefore, it should be tackled using political means and forms--first at a session of the cross-party standing committee chaired by the chairman, at meetings of deputies' clubs, through the cooperation of the clubs chairmen, at the level of committees and political bodies--and only if this fails should the issue be presented to a plenary session [of parliament] or, if need be, to the Constitutional Court. Milan Cic does not perceive the current situation in parliament as a parliamentary crisis or even a constitutional crisis. It is a misunderstanding that can be overcome provided there is goodwill, the chairman of the Constitutional Court stressed.
