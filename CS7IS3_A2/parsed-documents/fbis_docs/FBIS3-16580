Valentyn Landyk, the Republic's deputy prime minister told INTERFAX that the Cabinet of Ministers held a special conference devoted to the formation of a currency rate policy. The conference did not produce a final agreement on a mechanism for currency regulation. However, it is expected that a decision on this will be taken in the next few days. The exchange rate for cash karbovantsy at exchange points at present is about 40,000 to the dollar. The official rate is used by the state to purchase half of the foreign currency incomes of exporters and other payments. At the end of 1993, inflation in Ukraine was over 60 percent per month but in January it fell below 20 percent.
