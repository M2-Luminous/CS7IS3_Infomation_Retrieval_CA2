In truth, the Simferopol guardsmen's military unit personnel are in their barracks. On the evening of 21 May, Viktor Mezhak, first deputy chairman of the Crimea's Supreme Council, visited the unit with a group of deputies, who ascertained that the guardsmen had normal everyday concerns unconnected with some kind of emergency preparations. In particular, Aleksandr Kostikov, commander of the unit, reported that he had not received any orders and had not given the order to his subordinates to prepare for any emergency actions. And here Valeriy Kuznetsov resorted to deceit to have a reason for his own provocative actions. At about 1800 [1500 GMT] on 21 May, the minister brought the employees of the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry to increased combat readiness and armed them with automatic weapons. He ordered them to carry out reinforced protection of the television and radio center, the telephone exchange, and the Supreme Council of Crimea. The press service of the commander of Ukraine's National Guard states: The guard's subunits are in the places of their permanent deployment. The citizens of Simferopol may be calm. Ukraine's National Guard is not preparing for the assaults invented by Mr. Kuznetsov.
