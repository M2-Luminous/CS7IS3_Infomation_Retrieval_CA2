There is nothing strange in itself regarding this. Finland has indeed always been a Western country, but we have been influenced by our legacy from the Cold War. We have been constrained by this," explained [former Foreign Minister] Max Jacobson. In his view, Rehn is right in her understanding of the provisions in the Paris Peace Treaty in that more than just its military aspect has become obsolete: Finland from the very beginning never accepted limitations contained in the treaty. They do not conform to conditions of a democratic country. In foreign policy, Rehn tightly follows the official line. She has been a supporter of the European Union, and according to Jakobson, it is natural for Rehn to say that she will be able to influence [the conditions] of membership also before the referendum.
