Reports reaching the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel news desk say that the acting president will be meeting the French authorities to discuss ways of overcoming difficulties currently facing oil exploitation in the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]-controlled city of Soyo. No one knows what those ways might be. What is known is that Soyo currently represents a daily loss of $12 million. To France, the paralyzation of Soyo prevents the payment of the crude oil that had already been sold but not exploited. A source in Paris has said that Luanda will be forced to use the money it makes from Cabindan oil sales to pay what it owes France, even if does so only in token symbolic installments. That source was also doubtful about the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party's [MPLA-PT] capacity to repay part of its debt in the present conditions, with everything looking set for war. That source added that the MPLA-PT's debt is now in excess of $12 billion. All this is happening at a time when mercenary deals appear to be more difficult to enter into. The South African market is disappointed, because the mercenaries who fought in Soyo in 1993 did not receive the money they had been promised in terms of the contracts they signed, in addition to footing a very bloody bill. Captain (Brooks), a former member of the South African special forces, commanded the operation in Soyo in 1993 and he saw his companions killed one by one in the Soyo jungle, now the resting place of Commander (Piel Smit), a Rhodesian war veteran, and Commander (Frank Taljaard), in addition to some 100 (?assorted) mercenaries. So, the head of the Futungo de Belas Palace is faced with these problems as he travels to France, a country that has already made its position clear: It wants to assist the mediators and help the economy become viable in a climate of peace. This position was made public by the Paris Club last weekend and, according to an African diplomat, it did not go down well with the Futungo de Belas leadership. That diplomat explained that Luanda wants to buy more war materiel and it has not excluded the possibility of securing the services of some French mercenaries, if it can get permission from the government led by Francois Mitterrand. For all intents and purposes, this is already the first defeat the Luanda warlord has suffered in his visit to France. [passage omitted] Paris wants war to stop in Angola, so it has made it public that it will put pressure on Eduardo dos Santos to adopt more flexible stands in Lusaka. In short, Angola's acting president will not be received with the honors usually bestowed on a head of state. In terms of the French Constitution, no election candidate can be received as head of state. That is precisely the situation of the man from the Futungo de Belas Palace. His high-level contacts are to be few and far between. [passage omitted] French diplomats feel that this is not a good time for acting President Eduardo dos Santos to visit France, a diplomatic country that does not like the fact that the MPLA-PT has been stepping up the war in Angola.
