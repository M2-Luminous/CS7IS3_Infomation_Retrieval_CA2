[Confalonieri] Let us not exaggerate. Let us take an example: You progressive forces have an idealized view of the Kennedies, but as far as I know, the Kennedy family, which had vast and widespread economic interests, was never deprived of its property during John's presidency, nor did anyone suspect that the U.S. Government favored his family's business affairs. [Calabro] But Berlusconi is not Kennedy. In any case, let us try to take our discussion beyond the level of smart rejoinders. Already, on the eve of the elections, when you drew attention to the dangers of a conflict of interests, Berlusconi replied that he had taken measures to relinquish his Fininvest activities. Two days ago he repeated: "I am prepared to sell off some companies." Mr. Confalonieri, what will you be selling off? [Confalonieri] We are working to meet the program we established for ourselves prior to the elections, irrespective of Mr. Berlusconi's political decisions: to merge Mondadori -- which has been quoted for some time -- with Silvio Berlusconi Editore, so as to have a major company on the stock exchange. Also, to make limited companies out of Big TV, the television enterprise, the financial products, and Fininvest itself. Do you consider that insufficient? [Calabro] These plans have been announced but never carried out. When will you be quoted on the stock exchange? [Confalonieri] At the end of the process of restructuring and reorganization of our group, which is a very complex one. [Calabro] Your critics say that hitherto you have not quoted anything on the stock exchange because Fininvest's accounts are not in order.... [Confalonieri] An end must be put to the suspicions about our accounts, the electoralist polemics. I hope we will see the start of a period in which our accounts can be examined calmly, and these accounts are in order. Our firms' performance improved in 1993: Fininvest's operating surplus increased by 20 percent in 1993, and its turnover increased by 11 percent to 11.6 trillion lire. [Calabro] Let us return to the sell-offs. Being quoted on the stock exchange does not at all mean "relinquishing" firms in order to avert conflicts of interest. [Confalonieri] We proceed from the fact that none of the Fininvest enterprises can be sold off overnight, as though it were a packet of bread sticks. Do you expect Standa [department store chain], the investment funds, or a television network to be put on the market today and a purchaser will appear miraculously tomorrow with a good offer? Apart from that, to be quoted on the stock market is no minor decision: It means undergoing a lengthy and strict series of inspections by minority shareholders, by the market, and by CONSOB [National Commission for the Supervision of Companies and the Stock Exchange]. And these inspections will ensure that there are no conflicts of interest. [Calabro] But it was Berlusconi himself who said two days ago he is willing to sell off a television channel. Is the prime ministership worth Rete 4 or Italia 1? [Confalonieri] Let us talk about it without any smart comments. You have to consider the assets, the integration between the various activities, the overall context, the publicity and new market, and what RAI [state broadcasting service] does. Not to mention the very future of the entire sector, what with possible cabling proposals, satellites, and digital broadcasting. We shall see. [Calabro] Pending stock exchange quotations and inspections, let us try to consider some imminent conflicts of interest. Prime Minister Berlusconi privatizes STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company]. But Berlusconi the businessman has an investment funds firm called Programma Italia, that STET would very much like.... [Confalonieri] No, such insinuations are unacceptable. Otherwise, what should we say about [Prime Minister] Ciampi and the portable phones issued to Olivetti? It is impossible that Berlusconi would do anything to benefit one of his firms. If anything, paradoxically, the opposite is more likely. Be that as it may, there has been a sharp separation between Berlusconi and Fininvest since the start of the election campaign: He resigned all his positions, he no longer manages anything, he has no responsibilities. [Calabro] Yes, but he remains the owner, the boss. And the issue of conflicts of interest remains unresolved. The Berlusconi government will have to appoint the heads of the banks, but Berlusconi's Fininvest is negotiating with the banks for new credit lines.... The Berlusconi government will have to discuss antimonopoly measures, but Berlusconi's Fininvest owns three television networks.... The Berlusconi government will have to renew the top management at RAI, of which Berlusconi's Fininvest is the leading competitor.... And so on. [Confalonieri] Let us be clear about this: Fininvest is Fininvest, not an offshoot of Berlusconi. It is a holding company that has built up a role for itself in Italy and abroad thanks to Berlusconi's business abilities but also thanks to the intelligence, self-sacrifice, and initiatives of his staff and his managers -- the Gallianis, Dell'Utris, Foscales, Bernasconis, and Dorises. It is a group that deserves attention and cannot be regarded as the plaything of a single person. Just as RAI is a great enterprise, with excellent professional standards, that must be respected. So what if Berlusconi does become prime minister? Fininvest will continue its work. And whoever manages it -- from me, its chairman, to its managing director, Franco Tato -- will do so in total, responsible autonomy. [Calabro] These are mere words, and declarations of principle. The anxieties about conflicts of interest still remain.... [Confalonieri] The deeds, the specific conduct and political decisions of Berlusconi as a man of government, and Fininvest's autonomous initiatives will show that those anxieties are groundless. To think otherwise would be rather like returning to the Middle Ages when the monarch's wealth was the same as the wealth of his kingdom. Does this group seem Medieval to you? [passage omitted]
