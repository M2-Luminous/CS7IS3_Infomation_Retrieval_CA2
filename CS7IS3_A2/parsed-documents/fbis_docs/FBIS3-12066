Camacho Solis sent this letter on his personal letterhead. The letter reads as follows: The 1993, 1994, and current political options are similar. We need to have stability and peace for Mexico to have progress, justice, financial stability, and democracy. The options for achieving this stability will determine our political future. First of all, we might fall prey to the illusion that the fastest way to guarantee order is through the display of hatred, exclusion, intolerance, and rejection of disparate views. On the contrary, we could, from a profound and serene recognition of the source of the problems, the aspirations of society, and an appropriate perception of the nature of the conflicts, reach the conclusion that such a climate of stability and peace will only arise from respecting individual and human rights, and that in order to produce it we need to garner the initiatives of nongovernment and civic organizations, respect freedom of expression, and accept disparate views. Stability requires the strict implementation of the law, not only to control society but also to impose limits on state actions. This is required in any democratic and free nation. There is increasingly less and less time and room to attempt to find a balance by separately taking parts of one political trend or another. Faced with the facts, we must wield our options. Manuel Camacho Solis tells Zedillo Ponce de Leon: Your responsibility is a very serious one. I urge you to use all your intelligence, honesty, and patriotism to place yourself above any interests and to focus your initiatives on the path of peace, justice, and democracy. It is necessary to consolidate the PRI candidacy to prevent the national situation from worsening. You have and will have my support as long as a republican and democratic government plan is being implemented. The democratic option requires national unity; unity that involves all the political forces and citizens that strive to build a more just Mexico. Signed: Manuel Camacho Solis
