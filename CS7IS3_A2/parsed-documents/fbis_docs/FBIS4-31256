The agencies are reporting the formation of the joint General Staff of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina [BH Army], headed by Generals Fikret Muslimovic and Ante Roso. This is, in fact, the result of the mission by U.S. General John Galvin, who organized and directed many meetings between the Bosnian and the Croatian generals. It seems that at the strategic level the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] still has some autonomy: the chief of HVO General Staff, General Milivoje Petkovic, said recently in Mostar that the HVO units positioned near Orasje would be receiving his orders in the case of clashes in Bosanska Posavina [Sava River basin], but also that the 107th and 108th HVO brigade, which are located in the area of responsibility of the 2d Corps of the BH Army are under the direct command of the Bosnian officers. The tension is easing in Mostar, while the occasional incidents between the Bosnian and Croatian forces no longer have serious consequences. It is believed that the Croatian seaports, in particular Split and Ploce, are gradually opening for arms imports, which are accumulating on the Tuzla front, near the northern corridor. What do the troops of the Bosnian new federal army have at their disposal at the moment? Ethnic Diversity The "old" Bosnian army (without the HVO) had some 70,000 to 80,000 effective soldiers (meaning well-armed), and more than 100,000 men in reserve forces. They are organized in six corps and two independent brigades, which are organized according to operational zones. The (JANE'S) SENTINEL agency believes that the Bosnians have 85 tanks and around 100 large caliber cannons, while there are also, as MONITOR found out, at least 14 helicopters concentrated in the regions of Zenica (because of clashes on Mount Vlasic) and Tuzla (see box). The Bosnian Army's forces are ethnically diverse, and correspond to the national makeup of the territory controlled by the central government. At least 10 percent of the Bosnian Army are Serbs. There is only one unit composed exclusively of Muslim soldiers, namely the 7th brigade, which involves volunteers to a certain degree as well. The HVO is organized according to the territorial principle. The arrangement is according to operational zones, and one such zone is made up of six to eight brigades. In the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina the HVO has some 45,000 soldiers (making up a total of 22 brigades), five independent regiments, two armored motorized platoons, and one special unit with 1,000 diversionists. One HVO brigade has around 1,800 people (that number used to vary from 500 to 2,500), while each of the brigades contains the command post, three infantry battalions, and one military police platoon. The regiments number around 1,000 fighters. In western Herzegovina and the Neretva basin there are 20,000 HVO soldiers, in northern Bosnia there are around 10,000 to 12,000 soldiers, 6,000 to 8,000 soldiers in central Bosnia, some 2,000 soldiers in the region of Sarajevo, as much in Bihac, and a quite insignificant number in the enclaves of eastern Bosnia. The Croatian forces in central Bosnia are organized within the 5th operational zone, while in northern Bosnia the 102d, 103d, 105th, 107th, 108th, 115th, and 139th brigades are deployed within the 4th operational zone. According to Western assessments, the HVO has at its disposal 105 tanks (mostly T-54 and T-55), while as for rocket launchers, it has RPG-7, Maljutka, Zolja, Osa, and Ambrust types. Of the multi-stage rocket launchers, the HVO has Oganj and Plamen (128 millimeters), and the manual BM-21. As for cannons these are mostly 76 millimeter caliber, and 105 millimeter howitzers. The controversy over a plane loaded with explosives and (perhaps) ammunition at Zagreb airport -- it was supposed to strengthen the war logistics of the Bosnians -- is not of much significance, and is probably aimed at achieving propaganda goals. The explosives factory in Vitez -- now controlled by the HVO -- is merging with the Bratstvo factory in Novi Travnik (which was attacked by Serbian Galebs [seagulls] on 28 February), which produces rockets, cannons and howitzers, as well as with the rocket fuel factory in Bugojno and the lightweight infantry weapons factory in Konjic. Serbian military sources believe that at the moment the Bosnians most need tanks and armored vehicles (which is logical, in view of their offensive character), and claim that there is a plan for such equipment to be transported by C-5 Galaxy and C-141 Star-Lifter heavy transport planes either to Sarajevo Airport or Tuzla Airport. Generals and Politicians Who are the commanders of the new Bosnian federal army? General Colonel Ante Roso started his military career in the French Foreign Legion, where he worked his way up to the rank of colonel and commander of the 2d parachute brigade. At the beginning of the war in Croatia he commanded the ZNG [People's Guard's Corps] units in Slavonia, and organized the Croatian guard brigade in Vukovar. He was commander of the Croatian special units (Zrinjski and Frankopan units), after which he went to Bosnia, where he became chief of the HVO Staff. Later he gave up that post to General Milivoj Petkovic (then commander of the 113th HVO brigade). Thereafter General Roso was relocated to the command area of Split, where, together with Generals Janko Bobetko and Zeljko Tomljenovic of the Croatian Interior Ministry, he organized the raid on the Serbian position around Maslenica bridge in January last year. After that he returned to Bosnia, and took over the post of commander in chief of the HVO Staff from General Slobodan Praljak. General Fikret Muslimovic is a former officer of the Yugoslav People's Army, who -- at his own request -- was demobilized early in 1992, but the circumstances remain unclear. On the eve of the war he was selling books in Bas-Carsija [Sarajevo old town]. Some claim it was a gesture of his determination, while others say it was just a camouflage covering the fact that he was a KOS [Counterintelligence Service] officer. As a matter of fact, General Muslimovic was the head of the security service of the then Sarajevo Corps, although he actually graduated from the Military Academy, which is to say, his qualifications are those of a "combat" officer. In the BH Army he was chief of the military secret police. Many people believe he was involved in the affair regarding the removal of the former commander of the BH Army, namely General Sefer Halilovic, but this has never been officially confirmed. He enjoys President Izetbegovic's support, whereas to a lesser extent that of Haris Silajdzic's. Some people with whom MONITOR spoke believe that by his appointment as chief of the BH Army Izetbegovic is trying to strengthen his control over the military structure, because so far the top officers have always been more devoted to Silajdzic. Strategic Direction General Tudjman [Croatian president] stated on Saturday that Croatia had no intention of extending the mandate to the blue helmets in the UN protection areas, which expires in September. The matter is probably that the revival of military efforts aimed at placing Krajina under the Croatian control is being prepared. An introduction into this is probably a possible escalation of the war in Bosnia, particularly the battle for the strategic jugular -- the northern Serbian corridor. From the point of view of the Bosnian military forces, Izetbegovic's statement about an acceptable truce lasting two, rather than four months, sounds logical, since the estimates about the time needed for the consolidation of the Bosnian and the Croatian forces to be completed largely correspond to his demand. Still, it is believed that the task of organizing joint units that is awaiting the two sides, will be very difficult, since the existing forces do not meet the conditions necessary for the formation of relatively strong armored battalions -- which are indispensable for offensive operations. In addition, the lack of larger mechanized infantry units capable of providing adequate support to tank units while operating in lowlands and uplands around the northern corridor (from Semberija to Doboj) is very conspicuous. The Serbian military circles are convinced that the basic strategic direction of the latest activities of the Bosnian forces is -- Brcko. This attitude is disclosed by several statements made by people in the Serbian military and political leadership. The Serbs have piled up an enormous force on the 60-kilometer wide front to the south of the Sava, in the wider area of Brcko, but except for several artillery attacks by the BH Army, there has not been any real raid on Brcko. Our estimates say that such a raid will hardly happen, because the Bosnians are hardly capable of holding Brcko, if the fighting for the northern corridor happens to be concentrated on Brcko only. The Bosnians have tied the Serbian forces to the Brcko front, and thus forced them to stretch their lines. The Bosnian forces are keeping up pressure on other fronts, while through their linear disposition of troops, their activities are still not disclosing the point of a key attack. As a matter of fact, this attack will hardly happen, if the Croats fail to guarantee that they will bring in the mass artillery support from the left bank of the Sava. However, this would involve the risk of possible revival of clashes in Krajina, to which a possible introduction may be the recent interruption of the negotiating process between Zagreb and Knin and Belgrade. Nevertheless, it seems that the clashes going on at Mount Majevica at the moment have perhaps the greatest importance: U.S. reconnaissance planes have discovered a strengthened accumulation of Serbian artillery on the mountain. The news agencies claim that the commander of the European military sector south, NATO Admiral Layton Smith, has sought UNPROFOR's permission to attack the Serbian positions. The entire matter is still so confusing, particularly because of the undefined position of the blue helmets in Bosnia, as well as the announcement of their possible withdrawal. Still, it is unlikely that the withdrawal will come about. The crisis regarding the issue has probably been caused by the confusing attitudes of the U.S. Administration. The announced partition of Bosnia in the form of a tripartite union does not sound acceptable either to the Bosnian side, or to the Serbian side, and that situation could possibly be resolved by an eventual military defeat of one of the rival armies.
