The personnel received a corresponding hint before 12 May but did not inform the police, Saxony-Anhalt Senior Public Prosecutor Juergen Hossfeld told journalists in Magdeburg today. Five black Africans fled to the bar after being brutally beaten and chased through the streets by about 60 right-wing radicals. One day before the riots, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution warned the police against attacks by right-wing extremists. Interior and Justice Minister Walter Remmers (Christian Democratic Union) stressed that there was no reason to assume that the suspicions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution would come true.
