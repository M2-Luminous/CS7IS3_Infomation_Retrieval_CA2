Chavan, has said the time is not yet ripe for declaring the general amnesty in Jammu and Kashmir or lifting the ban on the militant outfit JKLF [Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front]. He said the stage for general amnesty will come when the center takes a political decision as a final solution to the problem. In an interview to PTI, the home minister said the Jammu and Kashmir government has already been reviewing the cases of release of some of the detenus against whom there were no serious charges. Mr. Chavan said he will be visiting the state in about a months time to hold public meetings in various areas. In Jammu and Kashmir, curfew has been imposed in Bhadarwah town of Doda District as a precautionary measure following the killing of a youth by the militants this morning. The youth was shot dead by the militants while he was going to an adjoining locality. Most of the foreign mercenaries in Kashmir are critical of Pakistan for misleading them on jihad as they do not find the prevailing situation in the valley as such. Two Pakistani mercenaries -- Mohammad Ramzan of Faisalabad and Fahadullah of Multan told newspersons at Jammu yesterday that Pakistan is infiltrating foreign mercenaries into Kashmir for political purposes after indoctrinating them in the name of jihad. They said there is no danger to Islam in Kashmir. Both of them disclosed that the Lahore based (Markaz-e-Dawatul Arshad) and the ISI [Inter Services Intelligence] are training Muslims from foreign countries for fanning international terrorism in the name of jihad.
