Nakai told his first press conference after assuming the ministerial post that he will not be drawn on debate over collective defense "because it is my duty to protect the Constitution and uphold law and order." Nakai replaced Shigeto Nagano who resigned as justice minister Saturday to take responsibility for his remarks printed Wednesday in a newspaper in which he said the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication and that Japan's war with China and other countries was not an act of aggression. Nagano is a former officer in the wartime Imperial Japanese Army and a former chief of staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force. Asked if he thought Nagano's former military career conflicted with the constitutional principle of civilian control and the stipulation that ministers of state should be drawn from civilian ranks, Nakai said he does not think this applies to a former military officer. "That debate existed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but I have never heard mention of it in the Diet or anywhere else," Nakai said. "Mr. Nagano was made to take responsibility for causing trouble for the nation and the cabinet and I think he understands that."
