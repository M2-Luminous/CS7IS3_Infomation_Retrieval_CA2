The Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs said Monday that the change was occasioned by both popular and scholarly opinions, collected at public hearings and academic forums, urging the government to rename the historic event. On April 19, 1960, students across the country rose up against the reputedly dictatorial and corrupt government of President Syngman Rhee, accused of rigging the presidential election on March 15, and succeeded in ousting Rhee. The first South Korean president announced his resignation on April 26 and sought refuge in Hawaii on May 30. The event, however, was allegedly played down by the following governments of Presidents Pak Chong-hui, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u. The government will consult with related ministries before putting the revision to the regular session of the National Assembly this September, seeking to change the event's title as stated in laws on the privileges of patriots and veterans, according to the ministry. Meanwhile, the Education Ministry is looking into designating the event, whose title currently differs from textbook to textbook in middle and high schools, as "the April 19 revolution," ministry officials said.
