Concerning this event, here is a telephone report by Shaqir Funiqi: [Funiqi] The legitimate leaders of the Albanian science and research institute said that only physical violence -- the only means of this regime in Kosova -- could make them leave their building. After an hour and a half talk, the uninvited emissaries went away, but they left behind the definitive threat that they plan to execute this decision tomorrow. Meanwhile, it is reported that, as a sign of protest against this invidious and uncivilized act, Professor Dr. Zekeria Cana is remaining in the institution. The less culture you have, the less culture you need -- by promoting this idea, the Serb violence in Kosova is arbitrarily extinguishing the last oasis of Albanian thinking and scientific activity -- the Albanological Institute. The wicked Serbian campaign against Albanian culture, which is now being nailed like the Prometheus and is being placed in a grip, is taking on destructive dimensions with a clear postulation -- to also conduct the Serbianization of Kosova in the field of culture. The Albanological Institute, as a model institution of science and knowledge, will certainly survive the violence and will manage to promote the Albanian competent scientific thinking.
