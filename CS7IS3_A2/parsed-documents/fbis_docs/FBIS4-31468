Paradoxically, this has been prevented by strong protectionist policy of the European Union (EU) countries," Agriculture Minister Josef Lux told the 19th FAO (U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation) regional conference today. Czech agricultural policy is striving for farmers' competition in the world markets, but without the excessive support by their economies, Lux stated. The Czech Republic will participate in the main programmes the conference has defined: international agricultural research, application of environment-friendly technology, new patterns of food consumption and changes in nutrition of the population, Lux reported. On Tuesday [7 June] Lux will meet FAO Director General Jacques Diouf.
