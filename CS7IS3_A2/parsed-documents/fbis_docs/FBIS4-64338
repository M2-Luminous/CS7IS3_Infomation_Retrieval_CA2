It is still too little known by the general public that important decisions are made at the European level which affect all citizens. Rinsche is running in the European Parliament election in second position on the North Rhine-Westphalian Land list of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]. Together with the east German observers, the Union caucus in Strasbourg includes 41 members. [Sattler] As early as 1989, the Union parties [CDU/CSU (Christian Social Union)] fared rather poorly with 37.7 percent. Now they are threatened with an even more miserable performance as a result of domestic policy weaknesses. Isn't it frustrating to be punished in European elections for things that have nothing to do with European politics? [Rinsche] In Germany, 37.7 percent for a large party is indeed not the best possible result, whereas elsewhere this result would be seen as great. Here in Germany, one had gotten used to a system with few parties, and now more groupings have the opportunity to enter the parliaments. But you are right, it is a problem when one is made to pay the price for things for which one is not responsible. Unfortunately, we will have these problems as long as the German citizens do not recognize the fact that decisions important for their own lives are being made in Europe, and that the European Parliament is increasingly gaining more rights. It is our job to make this clear, so that this unpleasant episode of the protest election will disappear. [Sattler] Also in a European politics sense, the Union parties are making things difficult for themselves: Helmut Kohl for, and Edmund Stoiber against, Europe. How are you going to convey this curious split to the voters? [Rinsche] During an intense discussion with the European Parliament representatives of the Union, Stoiber clearly stated that he favors the continuation, indeed even a certain strengthening, of European unity. But in Stoiber's opinion, everything that does not absolutely have to be solved on a European scale is to be done by the nations and the Federal laender. I think that the difference is not as great as it is sometimes portrayed to be. And yet it cannot be denied that there are differences here. The CDU accepts in absolute terms the concept of Helmut Kohl. It cannot be ruled out that certain questions being asked by Stoiber, concerning the funding of the European Parliament, for example, will take on increasing relevance in Germany as a whole. [Sattler] There are differences, in other words. Who in the Union will emerge victorious from the directional battle, the pro-Europeans or the Euroskeptics? Fears are making the rounds in many European Union [EU] countries that after Kohl there will be no more true pro-Europeans. [Rinsche] This notion is indeed being expressed repeatedly. Nor can the fact be overlooked that it is Helmut Kohl who is the paramount figure in German European politics. For this reason the chancellor should be empowered to pursue these politics further. I feel that there is a European flexibility in dealing with hardships. I am deliberately formulating it this way. There will be European hardships, here we should not kid ourselves, in the economic, the social, and not least the security sectors--one need only think of East and southeastern Europe. If we want to cope with all these difficulties, we need European unification and the capability to act by the EU. Stemming from this necessity is an obligation to act which sooner or later will become clear to everyone, also to those who now still consider themselves Euroskeptics. [Sattler] What will you focus on primarily during the campaign? [Rinsche] We will call attention to the fact that the problems which are plaguing the citizen can only be solved with Europe--and these include unemployment, the danger of a declining standard of living, perceptible losses on the world markets compared to the dynamic Asiatic economies, the threat of mass migrations, the instability in East and southeastern Europe, the murders and rapes in the former Yugoslavia. The EU can offer solutions to problems if it shows itself to be capable of action. [Sattler] The Union has not come up with an especially large number of prominent first-string politicians for the European Parliament elections--could this be an indication that even after Maastricht the European Parliament is still not taken really seriously? [Rinsche] The question is: How do you define prominent politicians? That does not automatically mean that the dumb ones are here and the smart ones over there, that the well-known people are here and the less well-known people there. I feel that the level of excellence of the representatives of the European Parliament is very definitely comparable to the level reached by the representatives of national and regional parliaments. But it is true that there are no prominent persons here in the sense that they are known throughout the world. However, I think this will improve once the debates and resolutions resulting from the aforementioned European needs penetrate more into the public consciousness. [Sattler] Egon Klepsch as president of the European Parliament was not nominated again by the CDU for the 12 June election. Why was the most prominent Union politician kicked out in Strasbourg? Kohl is supposed to have been the driving force behind it. [Rinsche] I don't see it that way. Klepsch is surely the most outstanding figure in the European Parliament. We are grateful for everything he has done, and is doing, for European unity. The departure by Klepsch is a very complex question and has a number of facets, particularly in Klepsch's CDU land organization in the Rhineland-Palatinate. One of these aspects is that there are young politicians who want to get ahead; another that must be considered is the aspect of the regional distribution of candidates, also within individual land organizations. Klepsch himself will reflect on where his powers will be most meaningfully utilized. I do not think that Helmut Kohl triggered the action. Difficulties arose in the CDU executive committee of the Rhineland-Palatinate. Kohl acted as mediator at the request of the party in that land. A compromise was found, one that did not have the approval of all those involved.
