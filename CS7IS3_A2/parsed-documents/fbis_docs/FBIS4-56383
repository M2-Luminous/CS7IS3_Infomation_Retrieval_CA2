FBIS4-56383 "drlat086__s94003" FBIS-LAT-94-086-S Daily Report 10 Jan 1994 MEXICO Reports, Document on Pre-Rebellion Chiapas Reports, Document on Pre-Rebellion Chiapas Orive, Araujo Remarks 94CA0097C Mexico City PROCESO in Spanish 10 Jan 94 pp 28-29 94CA0097C Mexico City PROCESO Spanish CSO [Article by Manuel Robles] [Text] The leader of the National Peasant Confederation (CNC), Hugo Andres Araujo, said that he was willing to have all leaders of the confederation investigated to clear up any links with the Zapatist National Liberation Army. Adolfo Orive, the CNC's director of training, denied that he had contributed to the violence in Chiapas, asserting that "a paramilitary group is using the peasants to set them at odds" and clarifying that his presence more than 15 years ago in Chiapas "is just history." "We always promoted peasant economic organizations all over the country, but we have nothing to do with the violence in Chiapas," says Orive, the founder and head of Proletarian Line, a Maoist organization that is prominent in teacher struggles in Oaxaca and worker struggles in Monclova, Coahuila, and that "influenced" Chiapas political parties and peasant groups as of 1974, according to Mardonio Morales, a Jesuit priest who has lived for more than 30 years in the Lacandon Forest (PROCESO 888). Orive explains that a week after Mardonio Morales said that he [Orive] and Hugo Andres Araujo paved the way years ago for the emergence of the guerrillas in Chiapas, the vicar general of the diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas, Gonzalo Ituarte Verduzco, denied the charge. Ituarte said that he met Orive when the latter was indeed in Chiapas, promoting credit unions and holding dialogues with peasants. "I am not aware of the rest. I do not know of his record as an official" (PROCESO 881). Last September, the Jesuit priest revealed the existence of guerrilla groups in Chiapas, after asserting that the Torreon Group, whose visible leaders were Orive and Hugo Andres Araujo, had planted the ideological seed in 1974. On Tuesday 4 March at the Agrarian Reform House, as a meeting, chaired by Araujo, about the impact of GATT on the country's farm sector was about to begin, Orive declined to go into detail about his work in Chiapas, although he did agree to talk about the charges against him: "Unfortunately, there are a lot of newsmen who latch onto labels, which I imagine are very appealing...So there is really not much to talk about." A nervous man of few words, the CNC official says that he worked in Chiapas 15 or 16 years ago, when he set up a credit union. "That is history. It was a long time ago. All of it is in writing back there." He was asked what he thought about Mardonio's comments and whether it was true that through those peasant organizations he contributed to the violence in Chiapas. He denies it, asserting: "Otherwise, I would not be here. And that is not all. In documents from those people, when we were there, 15 years ago, they criticized us severely for being pro-government. The people of Chiapas know all this." "So you had nothing to do with it?" "Absolutely not. Our line is a public line, a very obvious one. We always promoted peasant economic organizations all over the republic. We never had anything to do with violence. Obviously we think that the rule of law, which has been violated, ought to be respected, that the peasants are being used to set them at odds...Because the problems of the peasants are one thing, and a paramilitary group that is using them is another." Orive is in a hurry to join the meeting. "What about the formation of the Proletarian Line groups...." "That is all history. Let me get to the meeting." "How do you see the situation in Chiapas?" "It is stable, stable." Also on 4 March, Hugo Andres Araujo stated that he and some of his colleagues promoted "successful economic organizations" in Chiapas. He said that he knew "all of the Chiapas organizations" and that the first ones to come out against violence in Chiapas were Pajal, ARIC, and the Union of Unions, among others, which were "formed back in those years but are now without external guidance." And he voiced this complaint: "Now they want to keep quoting me...I do not want to get into a debate because it is irrelevant. The results of the work are there to see. My training inside the CNC has mainly been in economic organizations; today, it is in the economic and the political area." He explained that he did most of his work in the La Laguna Region, Tamaulipas, Sonora, and San Luis Potosi ("which I can indeed talk about"), and he reiterated: "Many colleagues who formed those organizations are today leaders of municipal committees, mayors, or leaders of leagues that I am called upon to head today." He then added: "This clarification is in order because I will answer for all my work and its results. But it makes no sense for them to attack me now, really...What I will accept is that for 25 years I have been committed to the country's peasant organizations." A day later, in an interview with the news program "Desde Mexico, Buenas Noches" [Good Night From Mexico City] on the Azteca TV Network, the CNC leader said that he was willing to have all CNC leaders investigated "to clarify any ties with the rebel group that took up arms in Chiapas." Lastly, he clarified that the investigation should not be limited to the CNC but should instead include "all areas related to the state of Chiapas." And he asserted that if culprits are found, "the law should be enforced." Gustavo Gordillo de Anda, the current undersecretary of agrarian reform and another of the founders and leaders of the peasant organizations, explains in his 1988 book "Campesinos al asalto del cielo; de la expropiacion estatal a la apropiacion campesina": "Mass Line or Proletarian Line has been a political faction that has opposed the party framework which emerged from the 1968 student movement and since then has done political work in major social movements." His book, which relates the experience of the Coalition of Collective Ejidos of the Yaqui or Mayo Valleys in Sonora, clarifies that the faction's main goal, in contrast to leftist parties, was "that its political activities would not conform to instructions from outside the mass movement." It adds: "The Popular Action Movement arose in the late 1970's out of a confluence of union groups, intellectuals, and activists in the peasant movement. Subsequently, along with four other political organizations, it began what later led to the formation of the Unified Socialist Party of Mexico."
