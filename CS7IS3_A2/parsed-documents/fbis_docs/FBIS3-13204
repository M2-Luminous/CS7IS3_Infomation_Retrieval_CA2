How true is this and what is the reason for the arrests? [Khalifah] I do not believe there are any intentions or designs against the Muslim Brotherhood on the part of the Jordanian Government. After many years of experience, it has become evident to all unbiased and informed people that the stands of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has existed and worked in Jordan for more than half a century, are noble stands aimed at spreading a feeling of security, tranquility, and safety. This is with the exception of some minor incidents fabricated by a handful of evil people who are hired by parties hostile to security in this country. As for the issue of arrests, it is not even worth mentioning. What we know so far is that one of the brothers in the Suwaylih branch of the Islamic Brotherhood was arrested. His name is 'Abd-al-Majid Dayah and he is an engineer. Everything I know about him is good. Another person, named 'Abd-al-Majid Ibrahim al-Majali, is one of the brothers in the Muslim Brotherhood of al-Qasr in al-Karak. He was questioned a few months ago when he wanted to leave Jordan in order to join the ranks of the mujahidin against the communists in Afghanistan. He was held for some time on charges of carrying an amount of money to help the mujahidin in Afghanistan. At the time, he was not a regular member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He was released a few months later. I do not remember how long he was detained. I am totally surprised by those who are trying to create intrigue and level false accusations against this Islamic organization. It has been established in Jordan for more than half a century, since the era of the late King 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn, through the era of the late King Talal, and now in the era of King Husayn. Each of them has known that the call of the Muslim Brotherhood continues to be that of a reliable aid to achieving tranquility and concentrating on Islamic education. It is concerned about the security of the country and our standing within one solid rank against the enemies inside and outside the country. It has been proven through investigations that plotters against Islam and its people were behind the cinema explosions--attributed to Islamists--and the previous explosions in some liquor stores in Jabal Amman and al-Salt. Indeed, this is because the method of the Islamic message is in line with Almighty God's saying: "Invite all to the way of thy lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching." [Koranic verse] It is not the method of Islam to attack the defenseless by planting explosives in cinemas, coffee shops, and public squares, which only harms innocent women, children, and the elderly. The fair investigation of these incidents proved the innocence of those from the Muslim Brotherhood who stood accused. Moreover, the investigation proved to all logical people that these methods are far from the methods of the Muslim Brotherhood, which continues to criticize officials and urges them to stop all illegal practices, including the spread of immoral entertainment, and other violations that could encourage the spread of vice. We continue to search for people who will listen to these complaints and adopt a stand that limits these immoral actions. [AL-SABIL] In light of this, do you believe that there is a conspiracy against the Muslim Brotherhood seeking to sow a rift between them and the regime in this country, in preparation, God forbid, to dealing a blow to democracy in it, particularly since the Muslim Brotherhood has an explicit stand on the peace process in the region? [Khalifah] The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan and in the other Arab countries have not changed their clear policy toward the Palestinian cause since the establishment of their call, although in Islam one greets another by saying: peace be upon you. We can never believe that the Jews want peace with the inhabitants of Palestine or with the other Arabs. The Muslim brothers clearly know this fact, and are also aware of the Jews wickedness, machinations, and enmity toward Islam and its followers. From this premise, if Palestine is not purged of the filth of the Jews, it will remain a Trojan horse the colonialist countries in Europe and America will use to return colonialism to the Arab countries in general, and the Islamic countries in particular. The United States has succeeded in arming the state of the usurper Jews in Palestine and has transformed it into an aircraft carrier to subdue the Arab and Islamic countries. Conceding any part of Palestine to the Jews is banned by Islam. The jurisprudence based on the Koran and the Sunna stipulates the following: If the enemy steps on a single inch of Muslim land, every male and female Muslim is duty bound to carry out jihad. The woman can even leave her husband's house without his permission and the slave without his master's permission. The Muslim Brotherhood and others who preach Islam will be renouncing their religion if they agree to give any part of Palestine to the Jews or the other enemies of God. Palestine and Jerusalem can be liberated only if the Arab countries unite and adopt a cohesive stand with the other Islamic countries. The Jews know this. Therefore, any rumor or machination against the Muslim Brotherhood cannot but originate from the Jewish enemy, its agents, and its partners in Europe and the United States. King Husayn, who has always called for Arab solidarity and Islamic cooperation, and has cautioned against and confronted all outside conspiracies against this homeland whose safety he has secured thanks to his wise policies and alertness, should not pay any attention to any slander campaign or rumor against the Islamic movement in our steadfast country. God knows intentions.
