"We are expecting that South Korea and Indonesia will be able to get seats at the UNSC. And we are expecting that Indonesia will fully support our plan," said Han on arrival at Cengkareng International Airport. Indonesia is also planning to apply for a seat at UNSC for the same period. The visiting minister said that his country's expectation to have full support from Indonesia is on the grounds that Indonesia as chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement plays important roles in world affairs. "Indonesia plays important roles not only in United Nations affairs but also in maintaining peace in the eastern Asia region," he stressed. He termed Indonesia's role in maintaining peace in the eastern Asia region crucial and helpful. Han said that he had also conveyed his country's expectation to other countries such as Thailand and Vietnam. Asked about issues he would discuss with President Suharto, he revealed that one of the topics would be the problem of nuclear weapon in the Korean peninsula. On the occasion, the minister also confirmed that South Korea's President Kim Yong-sam will attend the forthcoming Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders meeting in November this year in Jakarta. Han is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Alatas on Monday and President Suharto the following day. He said that the two sides would discuss ways to deepen, strengthen and expand ties between Indonesia and South Korea. Han's visit to Indonesia is the first made by a South Korean minister since the establishment of a civilian government in the northeastern Asian country in 1992.
