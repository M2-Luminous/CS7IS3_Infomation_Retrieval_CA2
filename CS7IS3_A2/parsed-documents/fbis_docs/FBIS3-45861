Following the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus became heirs to the bulk of former Soviet nuclear arsenal. Although Kazakhstan and Belarus had agreed much earlier to transfer all the strategic weapons deployed on their territories to Russia for destruction, Kiev had declined to do so due to controversies. With 176 strategic missiles and about 1,500 nuclear warheads, Ukraine is the third largest nuclear power in the world after Russia and the United States. So Moscow and Washington became deeply concerned over Kiev's unwillingness to give up its nuclear power status. The concerns had increased after the Ukrainian parliament decided on November 18 that the country would only destroy part of its nuclear arms in the first stage and was prepared to become a non-nuclear state only after being secured against threats from other nuclear powers. The parliament also urged the West to fund Ukraine in dismantling its nuclear weapons. Taking common interests into consideration, U.S. Vice President Albert Gore visited Moscow in December to coordinate the two countries' positions in pressing Ukraine to give up all its nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, Kiev was plagued by financial difficulties to effectively maintain the bulk of strategic weapons, especially after Moscow had refused to provide the spare parts needed by such maintenance. Under such situation, Ukraine agreed to negotiate with Russia and the United States. But the talks had deadlocked on Ukraine's request for financial compensation for the destruction of its nuclear arms and for sharing with Russia the income from selling the uranium to be taken from the nuclear warheads. The three sides had not made any major compromises on the issue until U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to Prague for a summit with leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia earlier this week. Ukraine finally agreed to destroy all the nuclear weapons deployed on its soil. In return, the United States will provide Kiev 175 million U.S. dollars for nuclear arms destruction and another 155 million in economic assistance, while Russia also agreed to allow Kiev to share the income from uranium sales. Because of this, Clinton changed his itinerary and stopped briefly in Kiev on Wednesday to meet with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk before flying to Moscow later the same day. Kravchuk agreed to fly to Moscow on Friday for a summit with Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin so that they could sign an agreement on the issue, which has been jeopardizing Kiev's relations with Moscow and Washington.
