FR941202-0-00128 FR941202-0-00012 As proposed in the NPRM, the random testing rate may be reduced to 25 percent if the industry-wide random positive rate is less than 1.0 percent for 2 consecutive calendar years while testing at 50 percent. Such a performance-based approach rewards ``good'' results while maintaining an acceptable level of deterrence, as well as detection. Based on the comments filed and the experiences of the DOT internal program, we believe that reducing the random testing rate to 25 percent could save up to 40 percent of the annual random testing costs incurred at the full 50 percent rate. A two-tier system makes the drug testing rule more consistent with the alcohol testing rule while acknowledging the difficulty of identifying drug use. We believe that 1.0 percent is the appropriate level at which to permit a reduction or require an increase for the reasons stated in the NPRM. This level is based on the experience that the military and other workplace programs have had with deterrence-based drug testing. Their results reveal that no matter what rate is used for random testing, the testing programs never achieve zero positives. There always is a constant group of ``hard-core'' individuals of less than 1.0 percent of the population who are detected positive over a period of time; these individuals are unaffected by deterrence-based testing because of addiction or belief that they can escape detection. Several commenters asked us to raise the level, primarily to make it easier for their industry to qualify for a reduction in the testing rate. We were unpersuaded, however, by these commenters because we believe it is not appropriate to raise the level to ease compliance, would unduly undermine the important safety objectives of the program, and is an appropriate cut-off in light of what we believe are achievable goals. As mentioned above, many commenters, particularly in the aviation industry, strongly supported a 10 percent testing rate. They noted that the alcohol testing rules provide a three-tier system (50 percent /25 percent /10 percent), and believe that if performance were adequate, an industry, or industry subgroup, should be permitted to test at a 10 percent rate. To the extent that costs are reduced with the number of tests conducted, a 10 percent testing rate would provide important cost savings to the best employers with the smallest drug use problem. On a more intangible level, it would provide a goal for employers. It also would be the most flexible approach. In the NPRM, we noted our tentative conclusion that a 25 percent random testing rate is the minimum effective rate to ensure deterrence for drug use and to allow at least a modicum of detection. There were a number of comments that stated that merely being subject to random testing provided adequate deterrence and detection. Some employer commenters stated that covered employees were unaware of the specific testing rates and that the employees believed that they could be caught at any time. Others denied that their company or industry had any significant problem and considered any but the most minimal testing a waste of time, money and energy. Others focused on the best way to spend the finite resources that could be devoted to drug use prevention. As discussed in the NPRM, illegal drug use is different from alcohol misuse and these differences argue for a higher random drug testing rate. Drug usage is often harder to detect based on behavior and physical clues such as breath and body odor, or drug packaging. Alcohol passes through the body relatively quickly, while many drugs stay in the system for days, weeks or even months. Unlike alcohol use, most drug use is illegal and drug testing helps ensure deterrence and detection of even off-duty use. Considering the vital public interest in protecting the safety of our transportation system and the data that show the deterrent and detection benefits of high random rates for drugs, the Department cannot justify permitting a reduction to 10 percent. Statistically, lowering the rate to 10 percent would result in less representative data since so few employees would be tested. Fewer tests result in less detection. So few tests would be conducted at a 10 percent rate that it might take a long time to notice any adverse effects or trends. Data Required To Raise or Lower Testing Rate The Department is requiring two years of data before a potential reduction in the testing rate because we want to make sure that the use of drugs is, in fact, demonstrably low and the data reflect more than a statistical aberration or an unusual year. On the other hand, if an industry's data indicate a positive rate at or above 1.0 percent in any calendar year, we will raise the testing rate based on only one year's data. Our primary interest is ensuring safety and it is important to take a conservative approach. Under our approach, however, there is up to one years' time lag between a rise in positive test results and an increase in the random testing rate. In extraordinary circumstances that endanger public safety, we may need to take emergency action before the beginning of the calendar year. One-Time Exception There is one relatively minor change from the NPRM. Large transit companies and intrastate motor carriers will begin random testing on January 1, 1995, and small transit companies and intrastate motor carriers on January 1, 1996. If we required a positive rate of less than 1.0 percent for two years of testing at a 50 percent rate for the transit and motor carrier industries, the rate could not be lowered until January 1, 1999, at the earliest. Because interstate motor carriers have been testing for several years and transit and intrastate motor carriers can learn much from other transportation employers that have been testing for a number of years, and because FTA and FHWA will have received a significant amount of data over the first two years, we will provide a one-time exception from this general rule and allow the random testing rate to be reduced based on only one year of data from the entire industry and two years from its large entities. The Secretary, in consultation with the FTA and/or FHWA Administrators does, however, explicitly reserve the discretion to require another year of data from the small entities if he or she deems it necessary for safety. If the Department's review of the data indicates that it is insufficient to make a determination to lower the random testing rate to 25 percent, we will issue a notice stating that the rate will not be changed until one more year of data has been obtained.
