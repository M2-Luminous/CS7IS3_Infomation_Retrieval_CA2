This material, including any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than thirty days after the award for assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly Federal Register notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis.

Update reports (also Form HUD&hyph;2880) will be made available along with the applicants' disclosure reports, but in no case for a period of less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (95 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR, subpart C, and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) for further information on disclosure requirements.) 3. Subsidy-Layering Determinations 24 CFR 12.52 requires HUD to certify that the amount of HUD assistance is not more than necessary to make the assisted activity feasible after taking into account other government assistance. HUD will make the decision with respect to each certification available free of charge, for a three-year period. (See the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) and the guidelines published in the Federal Register on February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9332) for further information on this certification.) Additional information about applications, HUD certifications and assistance adjustments, both before assistance is provided or subsequently, are to be made under the Freedom of Information Act (24 CFR part 15). E. Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act_Prohibition of Advance Disclosures of Funding Decisions HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Reform Act was published on May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. Also, refer to (58 FR 61016), a final rule amending part 4 regarding the regulations of certain conduct by HUD employees and by applicants for HUD assistance during the selection process for the award of financial assistance by HUD. HUD and FmHA employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD or FmHA) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics, (202) 708&hyph;3815. (This is not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. However, a HUD or FmHA employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters Counsel for the program to which the question pertains. F. Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (section 112 of the Reform Act) contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the Federal Register on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912), as 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. Any questions regarding the rule should be directed to: Acting Director, Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815; TDD: (202) 708&hyph;1112. (These are not toll-free numbers.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office. G. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87 and 7 CFR part 1944, subpart G, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from the statute's coverage. IHAs established by an Indian tribe as a result of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from the statute's coverage. Required Reporting A certification is required at the time application for funds is made that federally appropriated funds are not being or have not been used in violation of section 319 and the disclosure will be made of payments for lobbying with other than federally appropriated funds. Also, there is a standard disclosure form, SF&hyph;LLL, ``Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying'', which must be used to disclose lobbying with other than federally appropriated funds at the time of application.
