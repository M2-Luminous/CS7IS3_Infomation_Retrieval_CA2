He added: If the UN Security Council follows this procedure, we would be ready to help the secretary general find a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem. The president said he has made it clear that he remains committed to the 21 March UN document on implementing the confidence-building measures that was prepared by the UN secretary general's representatives, and in his report Butrus-Ghali described it as a fair and balanced document. The president made this statement this morning during an address at a ceremony to receive the credentials of the new Jordanian ambassador to Cyprus.
