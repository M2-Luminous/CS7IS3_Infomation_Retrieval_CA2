Subpart A_Background and Policy §800.1 Purposes and participants. (a) Purposes of the Section 106 process. Section 106 requires Federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties and afford the Council a reasonable opportunity to comment on such undertakings. This part defines the manner in which Federal agencies meet both of these statutory responsibilities through the Section 106 process. The Section 106 process seeks to accommodate historic preservation concerns with the needs of Federal undertakings. It is designed to identify potential conflicts between the two and to resolve such conflicts through consultation among the Agency Official, the State Historic Preservation Officer, the Council, and other interested parties during the early stages of planning. By following the steps set forth in this part to assess the effects of an undertaking on historic properties and either resolving those effects through negotiated agreements or obtaining and considering the formal written comments of the Council membership, Federal agencies evidence that they have taken into account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties and have afforded the Council its reasonable opportunity to comment. (b) Consultation under this part. The fundamental principle of the Section 106 process is the identification and resolution of preservation issues in the planning of a Federal undertaking through an open and ongoing exchange of factual information and opinion between the Agency Official and those agencies, organizations, and individuals with an interest in the undertaking's effects on historic properties. This principle is embodied in the concept of consultation, which means the process of seeking, discussing, and considering in good faith the views of other participants in the Section 106 process. Section 110(a)(2)(E) of the Act requires that agency procedures for compliance with Section 106 provide a process for the identification and evaluation of historic properties for listing in the National Register and the development and implementation of agreements, in consultation with State Historic Preservation Officers, local governments, Indian tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and the interested public, as appropriate, regarding the means by which adverse effects on such properties will be considered. The goal of the consultation process is to seek ways to avoid or minimize the adverse effects of an undertaking on historic properties. The agency should first seek ways to avoid the adverse effects of an undertaking, and where avoidance cannot reasonably or practicably be achieved, should seek ways to minimize those effects. Destruction of historic properties should always be a last resort. Consultation commences at the earliest stages of planning between the Agency Official and the State Historic Preservation Officer and continues through the identification of historic properties, the assessment of the undertaking's effects and negotiation to resolve adverse effects, with the addition of other parties at various points and the ongoing opportunity for participation of the public. Consultation in the Section 106 process normally results in agreed upon outcomes and decisions. In the event that there is disagreement, this part provides that the Council will resolve disputes over the application of these regulations and specific findings under them. In the event that consultation fails to result in resolution of an undertaking's adverse effects, the head of the agency retains final decisionmaking authority for the undertaking after obtaining and considering the formal written comments of the Council membership.
