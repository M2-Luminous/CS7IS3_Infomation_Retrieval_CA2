Hata arrived in Beijing Saturday afternoon for a two-day visit and immediately had talks with Qian and Li. In a two-hour meeting with Qian, also a vice premier, Hata expressed hopes to further develop relations "in a future oriented and global context," a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Replying to Chinese concerns over recent Japanese-Taiwan relations, Hata said Japan's one-China policy has not changed, as stated in the 1972 Japan-China Joint Communique in which Japan recognized China as sole legitimate government, the spokesman said. China's concerns are believed to be based on a high-level visit to Taiwan by Hiroshi Sakamoto, chief of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Industrial Policy Bureau. Japan switched diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing in 1972 and no Japanese cabinet ministers have visited Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province. Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Vincent Siew, Taiwan's economic minister, exchanged greetings at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seattle last November, the first-ever contact between a Japanese premier and a senior Taiwanese official since 1972. Leaders of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a partner in Hosokawa's seven-party coalition government, have sought the opening of ministerial-level ties between Tokyo and Taipei. Both Hata and Qian expressed satisfaction with North Korea's recent agreement to allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities, with Hata stressing Japan's expectation that China play a positive role to "dispel the doubts of the international community" concerning the nuclear program in North Korea, the official said. Qian said he expected "the issue to be solved soon" and recognized its importance to the "peace and stability of Northeast asia," he said. The Japanese foreign minister also told Qian that Japan expects more transparency in China's military expenditures, and urged him to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime, which aims at preventing proliferation of ballistic missile technology. Hata also indicated that human rights improvements in China would be conducive to "respect and trust" in the international community. Qian reiterated active participation in efforts toward a comprehensive ban on nuclear weapons, a nuclear test ban treaty, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and registering conventional weapons with the United Nations, the spokesman said. It was agreed that Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, known as a reformer and believed to be the main force behind China's ambitious economic reform, would visit Japan in February, the official said, while Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is hoping to visit China as soon as possible. The Chinese side also accepted an invitation for President Jiang Zemin to visit Japan. Japan vowed to support China in its efforts to become a contracting nation in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Concerning a new arrangement for Japanese development loans to China, both sides agreed to a new arrangement shortening the loan term period from five and six years to a three-year and two-year arrangement with yearly reviews of loan projects according to the principles of Japan's official development assistance (ODA), the spokesman said. Hata later made a courtesy call to Premier Li Peng and discussed several issues including the economic situation in both countries, the official said. The Japanese foreign minister also went over the principles of ODA with the Chinese premier, which stipulate that loans can be offered to nonmilitary projects that promote further democratization and basic human needs. Japan has agreed to loan China 810 billion yen for the 1990 to 1995 period, of which 528 billion has already been loaned. Li said Japan and China enjoy a good relationship. He praised Japan for its one-China policy towards Taiwan and welcomed the new developments on the Korean peninsula, the spokesman said. Hata will meet with President Jiang Zemin Sunday, before returning to tokyo the same day.
