FBIS4-47405 "jpust012___94159" JPRS-UST-94-012 JPRS Science & Technology Central Eurasia 8 June 1994 LIFE SCIENCES EPIDEMIOLOGY, MICROBIOLOGY, AND VIROLOGY New Ultrapure Vaccines From Russian Medical Academy New Ultrapure Vaccines From Russian Medical Academy 11111111 [MEDITSINA SEGODNYA, No. 4,1994, etc.] 11111111 [MEDITSINA SEGODNYA, No. 4,1994, etc.] CSO [Editorial Report] The Medical Academy imeni Sechenova claims to have developed a method for obtaining vaccines that significantly exceed the international standard for purity. The Moscow physicians' newspaper MEDITSINA SEGODNYA (No. 4 1994) reports that the new purification method will enable Russia to meet its domestic demand for vaccines and also to sell vaccines abroad. The method uses novel filters developed by the medical biotechnology laboratory of the Sechenova Academy in collaboration with the Khimvolokno Scientific Product ion Association. The new filters consist of hollow synthetic fibers used in spacecraft filters, which remove impurities in several stages until the preparation is molecularly uniform. According to the newspaper, the purity of vaccines made with the filters is 1900 to 2500 antigen units, higher than the World Health Organization standard of 1500 antigen units. Purification equipment using the filters can process 40 liters of concentrated preparation in three hours, as compared to 1 liter per hour using conventional membrane disk filters. The Bioavtomatika Scientific Research Center in Nizhegorod makes the purification equipment. MEDITSINA SEGODNYA reported that the Sechenova Academy has already used the new technology to create an extremely pure diphtheria anatoxin, soon to be mass produced by Biomed in Moscow. In collaboration with the Moscow Chemical Technology Institute imeni M. V. Lomonosov, Sechenova has also developed a better test for evaluating immunity to diphtheria. The test kit uses colored latex coated with purified anatoxin as an immunity indicator. It has a two-year storage life when refrigerated, compared to two to three months for erythrocyte-based tests. The test can be used for rapid assessment of individual or group immunity to determine if vaccination is necessary and safe (Moscow MEDITSINA SEGODNYA No. 4 94).
