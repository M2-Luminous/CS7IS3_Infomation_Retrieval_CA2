Quito radio stations that reported the attack added the bomb did not cause substantial damage in the building where it was placed, and no information was known about the perpetrators. There were two false bomb threats at polling stations in the capital, and in Esmeraldas, a city on the Pacific Coast, three people were injured in an incident between political adversaries, according to a television network. No incidents have been registered throughout the rest of this Andean country of 11 million people, except for delays in the opening of polling stations due to the late arrival of electoral officials, the lack of voting material, and similar cases.
