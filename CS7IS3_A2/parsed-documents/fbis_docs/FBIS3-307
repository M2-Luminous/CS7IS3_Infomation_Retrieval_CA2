The ANC's national working committee said in a statement in Johannesburg it had received a full report of the March 1 meeting between ANC President Nelson Mandela and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi and that it "warmly welcomed the positive outcome of the meeting". Committee members had discussed the idea of international mediation, proposed by Mr Buthelezi, as a way of resolving outstanding differences between the two parties, and had agreed to explore this route. "To pursue the matter further with the IFP, the ANC proposes the establishment of a joint task team to address the specifics and agree upon mutually acceptable terms of reference." The committee had also decided to set in motion discussions with the IFP on other outstanding issues, including future meetings between their respective leaders. [passage omitted]
