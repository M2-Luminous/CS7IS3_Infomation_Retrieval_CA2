FBIS4-42727 "drweu110aa_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS OECD Ministerial Session Opens in Paris OECD Ministerial Session Opens in Paris Examines Trade, Russian Aid Issues OW0806032394 Tokyo KYODO in English 0302 GMT 8 Jun 94 OW0806032394 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Paris, June 8 KYODO -- The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will adopt a joint communique Wednesday [8 June] proposing an agenda for the next round of world trade talks and urging stronger links with other countries, Japanese officials said. The OECD will also sign on an agreement with Russia on cooperation to help its transformation to a market economy after the annual meeting ends around noon, they said. In the communique, the OECD will call for reinforcing the global free trading system and a new role for the Paris-based organization in the rapidly changing world, according to the officials. As a possible theme for the next round of multilateral global trade negotiations, which will succeed the Uruguay Round of talks concluded in December, the communique will propose linking trade and environment, investment, labor and competition policies, they said. The proposed new role of the OECD should be built through strengthening its links with countries such as South Korea, which wants to join the OECD, China and other Asian countries, they said. Mexico was admitted in the OECD last month as the first newcomer to the 33-year-old organization since 1973, and many other countries, mostly in the former Soviet-dominated bloc, are reportedly hoping to follow suit. Jobs crisis strategy, agreed by the 25 member states Tuesday, will also form part of the joint statement, the officials said. The more than 60 detailed job-creation steps in the strategy were drawn up after a two-year study. The number of jobless people of working age in the 25 countries is heading for a record 35 million. In addition, the communique will include an agreement to prevent bribery -- especially in developing nations -- by companies in the member countries. The United States proposed that corrupt practices be included because a U.S. law banning international bribery puts its enterprises at a disadvantage with firms in other countries that have no such legislation. The planned assistance to Russia, to be signed by the OECD and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, will focus on aid in the legal and statistical fields. The aid package will be reviewed every year in annual cooperation programs that the two sides will map out jointly. The signing will be followed by a meeting of OECD and Russian ministers to exchange views on the organization's support for the ongoing conversion in Russia of military industries to commercial ones. Nobuo Matsunaga, who represented Japan at the OECD sessions, is scheduled to separately meet Kozyrev on Wednesday morning, the officials said. The bilateral talks, the first in two and a half months since then Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata met the Russian foreign minister, will include discussion of how to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue, they said.
