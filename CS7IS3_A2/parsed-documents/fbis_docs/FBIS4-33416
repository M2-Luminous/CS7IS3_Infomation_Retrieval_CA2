Foreign Ministry sources confirmed today to PRENSA LATINA that normal conversations continue between Belgian diplomats and local foreign ministry officials in a daily analysis of the situation and of the mechanisms to apply for attaining a definite solution to the issue. Willy Verriest, special envoy from Brussels, and Paul Vermkirsch, chief of the Belgian mission in Cuba, have already met twice with acting Foreign Minister Isabel Allende. They also exchanged viewpoints with Serafin Rodriguez, chief of the Europe Department. In all cases, the parties agree on recognizing the illegal nature of the stay by the group occupying the Belgian residence, which violates the security and extra territoriality of this European nation's legation in the Caribbean island. Likewise, the parties ratified the Cuban Government's refusal to recognize this type of action as a valid method to leave the country, as it ignores the legal procedures established for these cases. The sources reaffirmed that as a show of good will, Cuba will abstain from taking measures against those who voluntarily leave the ambassador's residence and decide -- if they so wish -- to process in an appropriate manner their request to travel abroad. This measure [words indistinct] was confirmed by the recent departure of four occupants and their return, without any difficulty, to their respective homes. Foreign reporters and observers who reside in Havana feel that this attitude by the other occupants of ignoring the joint stand of Cuba and Belgium regarding their irregular presence in the residence keeps them isolated, and it is deliberately hindering a solution to the problem.
