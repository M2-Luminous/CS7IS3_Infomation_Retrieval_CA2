He said he believes broad cooperation between conservative forces could obstruct a Socialist-Liberal majority in the new parliament. According to Lezsak, many people want to vote on May 29 for fear of an overwhelming ruling power leading to autocratic rule and a constitutional dictatorship. On June 4, the MDF's National Board will look into the reasons behind the party's poor election performance. It will also decide whether to discuss past and current affairs with delegates of the 8th National Convention, or to elect new delegates, and select a date for the next national meeting sometime before October.
