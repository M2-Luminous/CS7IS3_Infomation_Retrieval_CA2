But Tokyo will use "every level of communication tools" to break the impasse over the bilateral trade talks, Hideaki Kumano, vice MITI minister, told a press conference. Kumano said Tokyo and Washington have yet to fix a timetable and other details for an early resumption of the deadlocked framework negotiations. Kumano denied speculation that vice MITI minister for international affairs Sozaburo Okamatsu, the chief Japanese trade negotiator for the framework talks, will meet high-ranking U.S. trade officials during his ongoing visit to the U.S. Okamatsu is in the U.S. only to deliver a speech at a Chicago college, and will return home Thursday, Kumano said.
