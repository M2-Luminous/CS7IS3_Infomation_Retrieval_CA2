FR940922-1-00054 FR940922-1-00008 As EPA discussed in the NPRM, the first question presented by this issue is whether the ZEV sales requirement is a ``standard relating to control of emissions.'' See 59 FR at 21735. EPA initially determined, in letters sent to New York and Virginia state officials on January 7, 1993, that the ZEV sales requirement is not a standard, based on the belief that it had no direct effect on emissions associated with the LEV program, given the existence of the NMOG fleet average requirement. EPA stated: ``The ZEV sales mandate simply limits the flexibility otherwise accorded manufacturers to choose the mix of vehicles produced to meet the NMOG fleet average requirement.'' Id. Therefore, as EPA found that the ZEV sales mandate did not limit the quantity, rate or concentration of NMOG emissions, EPA stated that the mandate was not an emission standard, but instead was an accompanying enforcement procedure. In fact, the OTC stated in documents accompanying its recommendation that the ZEV sales mandate is an accompanying enforcement procedure and is not required by section 177. Indeed, the ZEV sales requirement does not require that overall tailpipe emissions of NMOG from California vehicles be any lower than they would have been in the absence of the sales requirement. The amount of NMOG tailpipe emissions produced by such vehicles is controlled by the NMOG fleet average requirement, not the sales mandate. However, current EPA data indicates that the ZEV sales requirement clearly will have a beneficial effect on emissions of evaporative hydrocarbons and tailpipe emissions of NO X from vehicles in the LEV program. Therefore, it appears that the determination of whether the ZEV mandate is a ``standard'' must be based on other factors. An argument that the ZEV sales requirement is not an emission standard would be based on the presumption that ``standards'' are only the numerical limits placed on sources restricting emissions of particular pollutants. This argument is similar to certain language found in Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association v. EPA (MEMA), 627 F.2d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1979) the only significant court case to directly deal with the term ``standard'' in the context of the Act's motor vehicle emission program. EPA argued in that case that the term ``standard'' referred to ``a numerical value setting the quantitative level of permitted emissions of pollutants by a new motor vehicle.'' Id. at 1111. The court neither adopted this definition nor did it take issue with EPA's definition. The court did state that the legislative history ``indicates that Congress intended the word `standards' to mean quantitative levels of emissions rather than regulations involving certification or in-use maintenance restrictions'' (emphasis added). Id. at 1112. The court also cited Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States, 434 U.S. 275,286, 98 S.Ct. 566, 573 (1978), in which the Supreme Court took a very narrow view of the term ``emission standards,'' stating that it only applied to ``a quantitative level,'' not to work practice standards. ( Adamo was later overruled legislatively twice by Congress. Congress first revised section 112 in 1978 and Congress then revised section 302 in 1990 to ensure that EPA used a more expansive definition of ``emission standard.'') However, this approach has some disadvantages. First, it divorces the term ``emission standard'' from actual emission reductions. Without a mandate to sell cleaner cars, there is no enforceable benefit to having numerical emission ``standards'' for those cars. In addition, it can be argued that sales requirements do ``relate to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles.'' Moreover, such a determination may have implications for other requirements in the LEV program and other programs, particularly requirements that include averaging, banking and trading, requirements that include fleet averaging, and requirements where a phase-in is used. (If a phase-in is not a standard, could a state require 0% (or 100%) compliance, instead of partial compliance, with a standard being phased in over time?) Moreover, the court in MEMA stated that the ``only species of emissions control regulation which directly addresses air quality is a standard.'' Id. at 1113. This language seems consistent with a determination that the term ``standards'' includes sales requirements because without a sales requirement, a numerical limitation on emissions from a type of vehicle by itself has no effect on air quality. As discussed below, EPA believes that it need not reach a decision on this issue at this time. However, EPA requests comment on whether it is appropriate in the context of this proceeding to decide this issue.
