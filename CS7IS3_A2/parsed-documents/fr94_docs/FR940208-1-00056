FR940208-1-00056 FR940208-1-00011 One method for monitoring fugitive tank truck or railcar emissions would involve the use of a portable hydrocarbon analyzer to detect emissions during loadings. However, such a requirement is considered to represent an excessive burden, especially at unmanned terminals where entry is gained through a cardlock system. Another method for exercising control over leaking tank trucks would consist of a work practice standard. The work practice standard format would consist of a requirement that the owner or operator of the terminal restrict loadings of gasoline tank trucks to those for which documentation was on file that the tank had passed an appropriate vapor tightness test within the last year. This type of requirement is in effect in many areas of the country under current State rules and is the basis for setting the MACT control level. Since it is the most practical and effective means of controlling tank truck or railcar fugitive emissions at loading racks with vapor control systems, this work practice standard was selected by the Administrator as the requirement for fugitive tank truck leakage control. Emissions from gasoline storage tanks at bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations consist of a combination of standing and working losses. These emissions consist of vapors that escape through rim seals on the circumference of the tank (internal and external floating roof tanks), and for fixed-roof tanks, through several vents and other openings necessary to relieve built up internal tank pressures. The large number of emission points makes testing these sources excessively expensive and burdensome. Based on the best industry practice in use for controlling these emissions, an equipment and work practice standard is being proposed for the control of these storage tanks, which is identical to the national standards in practice for new storage tanks, 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb. For fixed-roof tanks, an internal floating roof would be added, and for existing external floating roof tanks, a secondary seal would have to be added for those tanks with only a primary seal on the floating roof. Periodic visual inspections and seal gap measurements would be necessary to ensure that the seals are continuing to maintain the required control. Both bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations utilize pumps, valves, and other liquid and vapor transfer equipment components that may develop leaks over time. Due to the large number of sources, testing each to quantify emissions would be expensive. Thus, an equipment leak LDAR program and specific equipment standards similar to those currently being practiced at petroleum refineries, chemical manufacturing facilities, and a few terminals could be used to identify leaking components so that timely repair could be carried out. It is proposed that monthly monitoring of components and specific equipment standards at new facilities and quarterly monitoring of pumps seals and valves only at existing facilities, with the described provisions to modify these frequencies on the basis of monitoring results, be carried out. E. Equivalent Systems of Emission Reduction The Administrator does not preclude selection of alternative means of compliance to those described above in part D of this section, provided that the owner or operator provides proof of compliance as specified under section 112(h)(3) of the Act. If, after notice and opportunity for comment, the owner or operator of any source establishes to the satisfaction of the Administrator that an alternative means of emission limitation will reduce emissions of any air pollutant at least as much as would be achieved under the design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, the Administrator shall permit the use of the alternative means. F. Selection of Emission Test Methods and Continuous Monitoring Requirements The proposed standards require several types of performance tests, as well as both periodic and continuous monitoring to ensure that the intent of the standards to achieve maximum emission reductions is realized. The tests include performance testing of the bulk terminal control system, vapor leak monitoring and repair of the vapor collection system before each performance test, and annual vapor tightness testing of tank trucks and railcars that will load at the affected terminals. All of these procedures have been used with acceptable results and are consistent with ยง63.7 of the proposed General Provisions for performance testing. Storage tanks at terminals and pipeline stations would require periodic visual and seal gap measurement tests (consistent with 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb). Equipment components would have to be monitored and repaired as necessary in accordance with the applicable LDAR program (requirements are detailed in 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV).
