[Lacalle] Considering we are a minority government--of which we were already aware before the 1989 elections--I believe we have accomplished quite a lot. Indeed, we have done everything we were permitted. We could not do some things because we lacked the support of Congress or of the citizenship--as in the case of the Law on Government-Owned Enterprises. This was the fate of the two most important issues the country must resolve, namely the social security system and the privatization of state-run enterprises. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] What happened to those questions? [Lacalle] It is very simple. The privatization of government-owned enterprises came under fire at the plebiscite. [Former president and Colorado Party leader] Dr. Julio Maria Sanguinetti and left-wing sectors campaigned against it under the slogan "Vote Against the Government." It goes without saying that they won a political victory, but they acted like a brake on the modernization of Uruguay, slowing it by several years. Moreover, they acted even though Congress had enacted a watered down and tempered privatization law. With regard to social security, we submitted a reform bill to Congress but we could not muster the necessary votes to pass it. Last year, for example, the state had to subsidize the social security system to the tune of $282 million. Imagine what that means to a country whose annual export earnings total $1.7 billion. This situation affects the competitiveness of companies because labor is very expensive in Uruguay and the cost of living goes up for workers. This may sound a bit pompous, but our responsibility to our country and to history is saved. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] What do you think about Dr. Sanguinetti, who considers the Broad Front as his only political opponent in the run-up to the elections? He even predicts that the 27 November elections will polarize voters around himself and [Broad Front presidential candidate] Tabare Vazquez? [Lacalle] As I do not like making political prophecies, I will tell you an anecdote. Before the 1989 elections, the Colorado Party contended that it would govern until the year 2000, and that its main rival was the Broad Front. All the public opinion polls supported this forecast. Six months later, I won the elections by the greatest margin ever recorded in our history. Sanguinetti is merely using a political strategy. If you want to know why, you must ask him. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] The problem is that for the time being he does not want to talk to the press. [Lacalle] Well, Dr. Sanguinetti said something very important in Buenos Aires, on [Bernardo] Neustadt's television program. He said: "We do just fine until we open our mouths." [AMBITO FINANCIERO] The local press say you have lost clout with your own political faction and that you are unable to impose Senator Juan Andres Ramirez's candidacy. Is that true? [Lacalle] I have been in politics for 35 years and was the first elected "Blanco" [Party] president in 160 years. During those years, I have fallen and started anew. I have endured bombs planted by Tupamaros guerrillas and the action of hooded military men, and I have lost more elections than I have won. This is just another circumstance, but I will respond in a more precise way on 28 November. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] What do you think about of Argentine interest in joining NAFTA? [Lacalle] Brazil and Argentina are interested in other forms of integration because of their internal policies and not because they are not interested in the Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. Argentina is determined over the issue of NAFTA and Brazil has a project, which to some extent is an alternative to Mercosur--the South America Free Trade Zone. I believe it is a big mistake because political anxiety is the worst fate to befall a country's foreign policy. By signing the Treaty of Asuncion, we committed ourselves to establishing one of the largest markets in the world. If we do so appropriately and expeditiously, we can partake in this game of giants in which economic blocs rather than individual countries participate. Argentina and Brazil would attain what seems to be their objective of belonging to the first world by enhancing each other's position--and with our participation--within the Mercosur. [AMBITO FINANCIERO] Last week the United States declared Uruguay "eligible" to join NAFTA. Are you not tempted? [Lacalle] No, because I do not look to the United States to guide my life, even though I must obviously take it into account. For me, the United States' positive evaluation of our country can only be interpreted as a compliment. What I did propose to President Bill Clinton is a link between NAFTA and Mercosur. This would not rob Uruguay of its sleep as it already has a priority--Mercosur.
