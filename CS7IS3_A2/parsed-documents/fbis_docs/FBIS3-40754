How is this done? Is there a defined plan to achieve this? Does this plan provide additional incentives to encourage investors to develop the southern valley rather than basing their operations in Cairo and the surrounding cities? The local administration minister responds: [Sharif] Regarding the southern valley, a decision has been made at the highest state level to channel development to the south. The south has been deprived of vitality for many years, given that the focus has been on the capital and the large governorates. We are now making a maximum effort to channel the bulk of development to the south. The state's role in achieving this centers on support of social services in the southern governorates, such as health, education, infrastructure, utilities, and sewerage. That leaves production, which is an important, vital part that can provide new jobs for young people. Developing the Southern Valley [Al-Husayni] Jobs in the governorates of Upper Egypt are perhaps limited for young people, who tend to migrate to the capital in search of work. [Sharif] Therefore, we are trying to create jobs in the southern governorates by providing social services. In other words, when we build a school, hospital, or offices for service providers, we provide new jobs for young people. We are also creating jobs through production projects that will be established there. The private sector will play a primary role in establishing these projects. To achieve this, we have begun to establish a number of industrial zones, including one in the governorate of Sawhaj, one in the governorate of Asyut, and three in the governorate of Bani Suwayf. [Al-Husayni] Are these industrial zones being established in the governorates or in the new cities, which are considered an extension of these governorates? [Sharif] This is being done in accordance with each governorate's circumstances. For example, we have established an industrial zone in the new city of Bani Suwayf in the governorate of Bani Suwayf, and another zone in Sawhaj, east of the Nile. We are taking into account the creation of new communities, but we are not moving too far away from the infrastructure. These new industrial zones will offer all advantages, tax and customs exemptions, unlimited exportation, and domestic marketing opportunities. Additional Incentives in the South [Al-Husayni] Someone who invests in the cities of 10 Ramadan and 6 October on the capital's periphery can obtain all of these exemptions and benefits. Will additional incentives be offered for investing in the southern valley? [Sharif] Nominal land prices are an additional incentive for investing in the southern valley. Also, the southern governorates are making efforts, under the governors' direct supervision, to provide all immediate services required by investors in the new industrial zones. We all know that investors are most bothered by red tape and having to go from one office to another. Therefore, an office subordinate to the Investment Authority has been opened in the governorate of Sawhaj to make matters easy for persons investing in the south. [Al-Husayni] Does the Sawhaj investment office have all authorities [to act independently], so that investors do not need to refer to the Investment Authority's main office in Cairo? [Sharif] (With conviction) The investment office established in the governorate of Sawhaj has all authorities to act independently. The investor will not need to refer subsequently to the authority's main office in Cairo. Another incentive to invest in the south is the ability to acquire land for a project at a price equivalent to the cost of utilities. Land is being offered to investors in the southern valley at nominal prices. [Al-Husayni] What is the price for a meter of land in the industrial cities in the governorate of Sawhaj or Asyut for example? [Sharif] In the industrial zone in the governorate of Sawhaj, for example, a meter cost 50 Egyptian pounds, even though this new zone is located only about three or four km from eastern Sawhaj. Also, we have built in this new city 14 schools, several clubs, and a town for tradespeople. Residential neighborhoods are now being built in these new cities, and roads connecting them to the governorate are being paved. Also, investors can acquire as much land as they wish in these new cities, with no maximum limit. As a result, 100 projects have been submitted to date to the Investment Authority's Sawhaj office, even though the call to develop the southern valley was made just a few weeks ago. One main reason for investors' obvious interest in investing in the new industrial zones is no doubt President Husni Mubarak's speech to inaugurate the session of the People's Assembly and Consultative Council. President Mubarak said that all projects worth five million pounds or less do not require authorization to start operating. Therefore, an investor's mere trip to the investment office and completion of a form provided by that office is by itself considered authorization to start operating. The Investment Office in Sawhaj [Al-Husayni] By five million pounds, do you mean the value of the capital with which the project will be established or the total value of the project's investments? [Sharif] The value of the capital with which the project will be established, not the volume of the project's subsequent investments. [Al-Husayni] Investors are afraid to start a project without taking the measures required by the Investment Authority, especially notification of pertinent agencies and obtainment of authorizations. They do not want to be surprised, after their factories start operating, by inspectors from these agencies asking them for permits and authorizations regulating activity in industrial facilities. [Sharif] (Confidently and calmly) The reality is that an investor, by merely filling in the information requested on the form given to him at the Investment Authority's Sawhaj office, in effect begins immediately to notify all pertinent agencies. For example, the Sawhaj office notifies customs to exempt the investor from customs duties. It notifies taxes to open a file on the investor and exempt him for 10 years. Then, it notifies the notary office, because the investor may need to purchase and register land. It notifies social insurance and manpower to permit the investor to employ the manpower required for the project. It notifies electricity and the governorate to which the investor is subordinate if the investor wishes to purchase land in the governorate. It notifies the Construction Ministry if the investor needs to purchase land outside of the governorate's cordon. The investment office does all of this as soon as the investor fills out a form given to him by the office. Approval of 40 Projects [Al-Husayni] Will the Investment Authority's office in the governorate of Sawhaj serve all investors in the southern valley? Or will investment offices be opened in each governorate? [Sharif] Our goal in the future is to establish an office of the Investment Authority in each governorate. We have begun with an office in the governorate of Sawhaj. That office is striving to provide all facilities to investors in the southern valley. [Al-Husayni] In your estimation, when will these new investment projects begin to be implemented in the industrial cities in the southern valley? [Sharif] (Smiling with optimism) Actually, investors are very interested and enthusiastic. The Investment Authority has approved 40 projects. I therefore expect that factories will begin operating in these new industrial zones in the south within a year, God willing. [Al-Husayni] As we move to promote development in Egypt's governorates, will the governorates be divided into integrated economic regions in geographical planning, instead of being treated as independent provinces, to achieve the goals of development plans, especially now, when it has become a crime to transport goods from one governorate to another? [Sharif] (Responding immediately) First, we need to treat this issue in the framework of the economic reform plan with which the country is now proceeding. Based on regional economic planning, and with a view toward production as an economic pivot, we have begun to shift the major load in reform to the private sector. Based on these concepts, the dimensions of regional planning and development have expanded, because, as you said in your question, we cannot study the problem of development in Egypt by examining it in each governorate separately. This is especially so, because there are very small governorates that cannot by themselves generate development opportunities. For example, it is difficult to plan development in the governorate of al-Qalyubiyah, because development opportunities exist there in only two or three projects at most. However, development planning becomes more substantive if we speak of the greater Cairo area, which includes Cairo, al-Jizah, and al-Qalyubiyah. The same applies to the Sinai Peninsula. We cannot think about developing North Sinai and South Sinai without also considering Ismailia, which extends 30 kilometer east of the Suez Canal into the peninsula, and Port Said as well. This region should be viewed comprehensively. The Gulf of Suez should also be viewed as an integrated, coordinated unit for development purposes. We cannot view the governorate of the Red Sea or Suez separately. Therefore, when we study a project to develop the governorates, it is better to think on the level of region, where resources are better integrated. Regional Planning [Al-Husayni] What is meant by institutional building, and how is it supported? [Sharif] There is a Regional Planning Authority in the Planning Ministry. Its current role is to collect and study the governorates' projects to pave the way for implementing them. We are now looking beyond this role to one in which the Regional Planning Authority begins to formulate comprehensive development plans for each region, instead of just collecting them. This requires a review of these organizations. There are 26 governorates in Egypt. These governorates are also divided into seven planning regions. We are now stimulating planning activity to generate economic integration between the governorates. [Al-Husayni] For a long time, we have disregarded regional planning for the governorates. Have measures actually been taken to stimulate regional planning activity as you stated? [Sharif] I have asked that the governors, the leaders of these regions, begin to meet as a regional council. Three councils have actually met and begun to discuss regional development plans. These steps are being taken now to achieve development at the level of the region, not the governorate. Decline of Small Industries [Al-Husayni] Even as we strive to encourage small industries, we see vital industries--tourism and export industries--starting to disappear, such as the silk rug industry in the village of Abu-Hamam and Akhmim, most of whose output was exported, and the industries of Khan al-Khalili, because the older generation of craftsmen are more interested in sending their children to college to become physicians and lawyers. [Sharif] (Shaking his head in objection) We are using all of our capabilities to encourage small industries, based on an integrated plan. Six thousand workshops in all of Egypt's governorates have been financed with loans totalling 64 million pounds. Regarding the silk rug industry you mentioned, the Social Affairs Ministry is now purchasing and marketing abroad all of the silk rugs produced by tradespeople or families. [passage omitted] The Project to Count the Number of Unemployed [Al-Husayni] A propos training, a large training institute with major capabilities is subordinate to the Local Administration Ministry. Why is its role limited to training only local administration workers? Why do we not try to use these enormous capabilities to train workers in other sectors? [Sharif] First, this institute was established to train the ministry's local administration leaders. Courses are also held for local administration officials. For example, housing sector workers were given training when the new housing law and Egyptian construction code were promulgated. This was done in cooperation with the Construction Research Institute. The latter is also involved in international activities through its cooperation with the Arab League and the Organization of Arab and Islamic Capitals and Cities, whose training center is located at the institute. Also, two courses were held. One of them was in connection with the Arab Development Institute and concerned the problem of rural-urban migration. We have numerous activity programs. Our policy is that the institute should operate continuously and that its capabilities should be exploited as much as possible, taking into account that we need to complete construction of the institute. Until then, the institute can admit only a limited number of trainees. [Al-Husayni] Some time ago, the ministry began cooperating with the Manpower and Training Ministry in a project to count the unemployed in all governorates with the goal of providing jobs for unemployed young people. Then you stopped. Are there reasons for that? [Sharif] (Calmly) We stopped, because we actually completed the unemployment count in 21 governorates. The other five governorates do not have an unemployment problem. [Al-Husayni] Which governorates do not have an unemployment problem? [Sharif] The governorates of North Sinai, South Sinai, Red Sea, Marsa Matruh, and New Valley [al-Wadi al-Jadid]. [Al-Husayni] Was the count in the governorates restricted to college graduates, or did it include all unemployed young people? [Sharif] This count was only for graduates of the educational track, in other words graduates of universities and intermediate institutions. [passage omitted]
