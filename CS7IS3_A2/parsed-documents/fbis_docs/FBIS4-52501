The three vocal legislators are former Construction Minister Taku Yamazaki, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Kato and former Posts and Telecommunications Minister Junichiro Koizumi. The name, "YKK trio," is based on the initials of their family names. The trio plans to bring together liberal legislators from both the main opposition LDP and non-LDP political parties, with an eye to the possibility of a major reconfiguration of alliances within the political community in the near future, they said. The political community is rife with speculation over the imminence of such restructuring if the LDP succeeds in mustering the support of the second largest opposition Social Democratic Party in passing a no-confidence motion against the minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata through the Diet. Yamazaki, a longtime backer of former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, said the new group will seek to "reform the LDP even at the risk of disbanding the party." Yamazaki also said the new group will seek to release legislators from the customary obligations and bonds of LDP factions to which they belong. Kato said the new group will try to be the driving spirit behind deregulation and other policies. The trio is lobbying other legislators from various factions to bolster the size of the new group to the order of 50, they said. The group will convene its first meeting early next week to decide on its formal name. The trio has been deemed as the critics of the current LDP leadership led by LDP president Yohei Kono. Kato dismissed speculation that the new group is seeking to form an alliance with Watanabe, whose threat to splinter from the LDP plunged the party into a serious quandary last month.
