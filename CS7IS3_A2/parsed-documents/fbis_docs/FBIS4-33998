CEOIC, which represents 280 organizations, today warned in a communique that "events continue moving toward a confrontation." The organizations demand a "break of the military blockade" surrounding the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), respect for human rights in Chiapas, and a clear development and financing policy for Chiapas land. Upon releasing the CEOIC communique, Arturo Luna Lujan, organization secretary for the Independent Agricultural and Peasant Workers Central Organization [Central independiente de Obreros Agricolas y Campesinos -- CIOAC] said that due to noncompliance by the federal and state governments, the peasant associations will start a permanent sit-down strike opposite the Tuxtla Gutierrez government palace. One must remember that on 14 April, during one of the most critical moments of the land takeover, the CEOIC and several federal and state government entities, signed a truce agreement regarding the agrarian situation in Chiapas. In this truce agreement, peasant organizations that comprise CEOIC pledged to suspend the occupation of properties and land, while government authorities pledged to resolve the state's agrarian problem. Among the main agrarian problems afflicting Chiapas are an enormous land tenancy, much agrarian backwardness, multiple presidential resolutions that have not been carried out, and hundreds of unfulfilled land requests. Currently, despite the fact the exact area is not known, it is reported that about 50,000 hectares have been taken by Indian and peasant organizations in several places in the state, and a further 40,000 hectares within the conflict area, mainly in Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las Margaritas Municipalities -- the latter being where the EZLN is located. At the same time the CEOIC and government were signing the agreement on 14 April, negotiations were also begun with other government entities at the federal level, such as with the Social Development and Government Secretariats, with which a series of measures and meetings were agreed upon to deal with the various demands presented by the groups that comprise CEOIC. "Despite these agreements, the replies have been noncompliance, proposals have been incomplete and seek to deprive jurisdiction, and a there is a lack of desire to resolve once and for all the Chiapas land problem," the brief CEOIC text states. It regrets that despite all its efforts to reach true peace, with justice, democracy, and social development, events advance toward confrontation. That is why to solve their demands, the CEOIC demands the presence and commitment of Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno; Secretaries Victor Cervera Pacheco, Carlos Rojas, and Carlos Hank Gonzalez, for Agrarian Reform, Social Development, and Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources, respectively; Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, president of the National Human Rights Commission; Humberto Benitez Trevino, Attorney General of the Republic; and Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas State. Peasant leader Arturo Luna Lujan said that CEOIC members watch the weeks go by without receiving a definite reply from the authorities because until now all they have received have been written proposals. This situation has generated a climate of uncertainty and desperation, therefore the council peasants have decided to resort to a permanent sit-down strike as a way to exert pressure on the federal and local governments to give a positive reply to these demands. When referring to the number of strikers, Luna Lujan said there will be between 2,000-5,000 peasants and Indians, but the numbers could increase gradually as the days pass without true solutions. We are asked not to takeover land, not to hinder the peace and reconciliation process, but the authorities "do not make the slightest effort to keep their word or to contribute to the creation of a climate of stability that leads to a favorable situation for signing the peace agreements," he concluded.
