The report includes extracts of the proposal papers read by 13 delegates at this morning's session on the three chapter headings on the state, state structure, and head of state. The proposal paper prepared by the group representing peasants was read by U Shwe Hla and U Kyaw Aye. U Shwe Hla of Rakhine State proposes that a basic principle be prescribed to declare Rangoon the state capital and a "Union territory under the direct administration of the president" due to its unique position as the seat of government and its importance for the country's defense and security, economy, and international communications. He also suggests that "other areas with unique conditions, such as the Coco Islands, be declared Union territory under the direct administration of the president." Next, U Kyaw Aye of Karen State continues reading the report dealing with qualifications for president -- loyalty, genuine citizen born of parents who are citizens, appropriate age -- and the election of president through the electoral college composed of all members of Parliament who will be separated into three groups. The three groups are: "The first group is composed of members of the chamber of Parliament who are elected based on equal representation from states and divisions; the second group is composed of members of the chamber of Parliament based on population; the third group is composed of members of Defense Services nominated by the commander in chief of the Defense Services to the two chambers of Parliament." Next, the proposal paper prepared by the group representing workers is read by U Kyaw Win Tun of Mandalay Division, explaining the need to include perpetuation of existing national territory as a basic principle in the constitution. U Kyi Myint of Pegu Division continues reading the workers group report dealing with the state structure and prescription of self-administrative divisions and self-administrative zones. U Aung San of Magwe division continues reading the workers group report suggesting the president be elected by the electoral college composed of three groups of members of Parliament. Next, U Sam Lut Naw of Kachin State repesenting the workers group read his paper. Addressing the issue of whether the Convention delegates can determine which national groups are entitled to self- administered zones or self-administered divisions and in which states and divisions, U Sam Lut Naw says this matter cannot be determined by the delegates. He says "the basic principle unanimously endorsed by the delegates calls for prescription of self-adminsitered areas for national groups if they have an appropriate number of population living collectively in a congruous territory. It says based on the size of population and extent of the territory, the status of self-administered divisons or self-administered zones are to be granted as appropriate." He says, however, the delegates do not have at their disposal data on the size of population and territory to determine the self-adminstration status. He says: "The delegates do not know what constitutes an appropriate population size, and they cannot decide on the matter. Furthermore, he says the delegates do not know which national groups have asked for status of self-administered division or zone. He says the delegates do not know which national groups, out of 135 national groups, want self-administered divisions or zones. As for the requirement for living collectively in a congruous territory, the delegates have no knowledge. The delegates also have no knowledge of geographical location and dimension. Therefore, I believe the status of self-administered division or zone can be determined only after the knowledge is obtained on the aforementioned two unknown points. [applause]. Therefore, I propose that it is only appropriate for the state to form a commission to decide on the issue of self-administered areas." Continuing, U Sam Lut Naw, worker representative of the Kachin State, addresses the issue of election of president. He says: "Even major countries in the world only have one president and one vice president. The population and territory of the Union of Myanmar [Burma] are not big. Therefore, there should not be two vice presidents but one president and one vice president. [applause] Also, there should be only two groups in the Electoral College without a group composed of members of Defense Services nominated by the commander in chief of the Defense Services to the two chambers of Parliament. The two vice presidents should be elected by two groups of the Electoral College composed of members of two chambers of Parliament. [number as heard] [applause] Members of Parliament from the Defense Services nominated by the commander in chief of the Defense Services are already included in the two chambers of Parliament." In the recorded portions of delegates speeches carried on 23 and 24 March, U Sam Lut Naw is the only delegate to have received applause for his speech. In this session, the recording of his speech was interrupted by applause four times. Next, U Min Naing, an artist, reads the report of the group representing intelligentsia and intellectuals. The report suggests the additional principle -- that "the state is a state where indigenous fraternal national people live in unity through weal and woe" and the term "Myanmar" refers to all national groups residing in the state -- be added to the already accepted four principles concerning sovereignty, government, territory, and population. The report also suggests that a national group, regardless of whether or not they obtain the self-administered status, should have the right to participate in their regional affairs and to freely preserve the language, literature, culture, customs, and traditions they cherish according to the law. The report also calls for prevention of exploitation of one race by another. Continuing the report, Henzada U Myint Wai proposes that three groups of the Electoral College elect the country's president and two vice presidents. The report also proposes that the president be elected in the last month of the third quarter of the fiscal year to give sufficient time to the president to attend to financial matters. Next, the report prepared by the group representing public servants is read by U Maung Maung of the Ministry of Hotel and Tourist Industry. The report proposes to include the provision: "Myanmar is a sovereign and independent state" in the chapter on the state in order safeguard and uphold national sovereignty and independence. Continuing the report, U Yan Naing Aung of the Ministry of Agriculture, proposes that areas of strategic, economic, and administrative importance be declared as "Union territories under the direct administration of president." Addressing the issue of granting self-administered areas, U Yan Naing Aung expresses the view "that it is not appropriate for a national group, which already has the status of region or state, to demand the status of self- administered division or self-administered zone in another region or state." He says similarly, if a national group has been granted a self-adminstered zone or self-administered division in a state or division, it is not appropriate to grant self-administered zone or self-administered division status to the same national group in another state or region. Next, Dr. Kyaw Win of the Ministry of Health continues reading the report of the public servants. The report proposes the corollary to "the basic principle that the president must be loyal to the nation and its citizens, the president or one of his parents, or his spouse, or any of his legal children, or spouse of any of his legal children shall not owe allegiance to a foreign power or serve a foreign power and shall not be a citizen of a foreign country." The report also proposes that the president be well versed in the national affairs to have correct judgement and effective leadership. The report also proposes that the president meet the residency requirements of at least 20 years in the country. Lieutenant Colonel Tin Kha of the Defense Ministry continues with the report of the public servants. The report deals with the 37 basic principles proposed by the group dealing with citizenship, term of office of the president, requirement for president and vice president to resign from a social or religious organization from the date of his election, and qualifications for president and vice president. The report says the group representing public servants gives priority to emergence of a modern and developed state. The plenary session ends at 1605 after the submission of the reports.
