Recently, the People's Bank in Jiangxi Province made a special survey of the effect on agricultural production and the peasants' income following decontrol of grain prices and dealings, what new circumstances and new problems might occur in the procurement, marketing, transportation, and storage grain enterprises may face under the new system, and what effect these new problems may occasion for the bank. Results of the survey show that cancellation of command style plans in agriculture and decontrol of grain markets have played a positive role in stabilizing grain production, increasing the peasants' income, and systematizing grain procurement and marketing. Nevertheless, some problems remain in production, procurement, and marketing. I. Current Status of Grain Production, Procurement, and Marketing Throughout the Province With the establishment of a socialist market economy, the former highly centralized system in which the state controlled the allocation of all grain is no longer in keeping with the new situation in rural villages where contract procurement that expresses the deregulation of grain procurement and marketing has come about in response to the times. Surveys everywhere show that the new grain production, procurement, and marketing system exhibits new vitality. A. Restructuring of agriculture continues, the grain growing area decreasing. With the cancellation of command style planting plans, the peasants enjoy greater authority to make their own production decisions. They are free to plan production rationally on the basis of market supply and demand, as their own circumstances require, growing whatever they like. This has greatly stimulated a restructuring of rural industry. Survey of the farm crop growing area shows a decline in the area planted to grain. Statistics show a 20,469,300 mu area throughout the province sown to grain in the spring of 1993, 7.8 percent less than in 1992. The percentage of the total crop area planted to grain decreased from 72.8 percent in 1992 to 68.7 percent in 1993. This included a 18,477,000 mu area planted to early rice, 1,956,000 mu less than in 1992. The area planted to superior hybrid grain varieties increased, more high yield, premium quality, and high economic benefit varieties being sown. Survey statistics for nine counties in Ji'an Prefecture show a 12,417 mu increase in the area sown to premium quality early rice, up 3.8 percent from 1992. Premium quality rice was planted in 54.5 percent of the total early rice growing area. In Shangrao Prefecture, 1.5 million mu was planted to premium quality rice. This was 60 percent of the total rice growing area, and a 25 percent over the same period in 1992. The early rice growing area increased from 15 percent in 1991 to 60 percent in 1993. In Jingdezhen city, 165 peasant households planted 1.96 percent less grain in 1993 than in 1992 while increasing the area sown to hybrid varieties 19.44 percent over 1992. B. Grain marketing has become livelier, the amount of grain in storage "deflating" markedly. Jiangxi is an agricultural province that has suffered from "difficulty selling grain" in recent years. Granaries throughout the province are filled to overflowing, grain storage tying up a large amount of bank credit. Following decontrol of grain sales markets, grain companies seized the opportunity to transform their operating mechanisms in an effort to stimulate sales and develop marketing farther afield, grain marketing becoming livelier in consequence. During the first quarter of 1993, Fuzhou Prefecture marketed 524 million jin of trade grain, 341 million jin of it parity price grain, and 201 million jin of it negotiated price grain. This represented a respective 78.4, 40.4, and 229.3 percent increase over the same period in 1992. As of the end of the first quarter of 1993, the prefecture's granaries contained 1.87 billion jin of grain, 406 million jin less than at the end of 1992. Grain loans decreased by 24.81 million yuan, 40.7 million yuan more than for the same period in 1992. As of the end of May, grain in storage throughout the province decreased by 4.273 billion jin. C. The price of grain rallied, peasants anticipated income rising, and their interest in growing grain increasing. Following grain market decontrol, prices rallied everywhere. In Nanchang markets, the price of premium grade early crop long grain and premium grade late crop long grain rice increased more than 17 percent. The trend continues strong and the outlook is good. Currently, the early crop market price is 27 yuan per 50 kilograms, and the late crop market price is 33 yuan per 50 kilograms, both exceeding the sum of the floor price and the excess price. In addition, individual grain dealers are numerous, grain marketing channels widening. Competition with the state-owned grain sector is intense, and expectations are that grain prices will continue to rise. Thanks to the upturn in the grain market, grain prices have picked up tremendously and the peasants have received tangible benefits. Comparison of February 1993 with July and August of 1993 shows a 72 yuan per mu increase in peasant income from the upturn in prices alone. The People's Bank in Fuzhou Prefecture reports that the peasants are happy to grow grain following the upturn in grain prices. Formerly a 420,000 mu reduction in the grain growing area was planned, but only a 380,000 mu reduction occurred. II. Several Existing Problems The decontrol of grain prices and grain dealings occurred against a background of a still not very highly developed grain market. Consequently several problems remain in the contract procurement of grain that are manifested in "four difficulties and one low." A. "Difficulties in implementation" of grain procurement contracts. Ganzhou, Yichun, Fuzhou, and Yingtan prefectures, and Jingdezhen City report that since the deregulation of grain procurement, some peasants are resentful for various reasons. They suppose that now that fixed procurement quotas have been abolished, it is no longer necessary to sign contracts. As of the end of May, contracts signed in the three prefectures and Jingdezhen City numbered 83.5, 76.4, 90, 82.7, and 66.0 percent of the planned number. The reason for this poor showing is that the basis for the "market price" in contract procurement is not clear. The peasants have misgivings. They fear that contracts may not be honored. The contracts that grain departments sign with peasants explicitly provide that when the market price of grain is lower than the floor price, all grain covered by the contract will be purchased from the peasants at the floor price; and when the market price of grain is higher than the ceiling price, all grain covered by the contract will be purchased at the market price. This is a fine means for protecting the peasants' personal welfare, but it is difficult to live up to in practice. Since no document stipulates the time of the market price that is to be used, the market price of what department or jurisdiction, or who is to subsidize the "inversion" that this method pricing causes, disputes are inevitable. Second is favoritism in the issuance of downpayments on porocurement, which damages the peasant's interests. The Fuzhou Prefecture People's Bank reports that Nanyue County issued 4.44 million yuan in advance payments during 1993, 2 million of which was in cash, the remaining 2.44 million being issued in the form of "fertilizer" coupons. In Dingxi County, 4.25 million yuan of payments in advance was entirely in the form of supply and marketing cooperative credit on sales. Since they are unable to sell it or the available kinds or quality of the fertilizer is poor, the peasants were very resentful and even created problems. Third government departments interference and deductions are numerous, the peasants' burdens remaining fairly heavy. The Ganzhou Prefecture People's Bank reported that the peasants still must pay more than 90 assessments of various kinds. In order to meet their payment quotas, when governments at all levels sign grain contracts with peasants, they attach a schedule showing taxes and fees to be deducted. After the grain is sold and accounts settled, the peasants obtain almost no cash at all. A survey conducted in a certain village in Ningdu County showed the contract ordering of 9,400 kilograms of grain, but 10,050 kilograms was needed to offset the payment of various taxes and fees. Obviously, the peasants do not want to sign such contracts. B. Grain enterprises will face "difficulty buying grain." Grain market decontrol demolished the "monopoly" position of the state-owned grain units. It produced a situation of multiple economic components, multiple ways of doing business, and multiple circulation channels all competing with each other. Because of their own limitations, grain departments may face future procurement difficulties. The first problem is that only 85.7 percent of the planned contract procurement contracts for the province have been concluded. Second, is the dispersal of sources of grain. Not only do collectives and individuals compete for grain, but people from neighboring Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces stream to Jiangxi to buy grain. They go from door to door to buy it; they pay high prices for it; they pay on the spot, and they make no deductions. C. Difficulties obtaining grain procurement money. Pressures on grassroots level banks have increased. No issuance of I.O.U.'s for grain in 1993 is an important guarantee the state has made to gain the peasants' confidence. However, owing to the the high speed growth of investment in fixed assets this year, and the craze for buying stocks and bonds, and for pooling funds, savings have grown only slowly, funds have dispersed in many directions, and banks have trouble finding money to pay out. At the same time, because of local governments' fiscal straits, grain enterprises' serious losses and accounts owing, and the sluggish turnover of bank funds, money is in short supply throughout society and banks find the going difficult. A survey of the Fuzhou Prefecture People's Bank shows that up until 1991, the prefecture government was able to allocate 287 million yuan to subsidize losses in the grain sectors, but now it is unable to provide a cent. Instead it must increase interest payments by 14 million each year. As of the end of 1992, grain enterprises had posted losses of 347 million yuan, an amount equal to the prefecture's fiscal receipts for 1 1/2 years. Since more than 60 percent of the Bank of Agriculture's total credit was tied up in loans for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, and thus did not turn over rapidly, the banks were operating under an overload. Thus, a situation occurred very easily in which the People's Bank alone had to ensure the funds needed for grain procurement. The Shangrao Prefecture People's Bank reports an abnormal shortage of Bank of Agriculture credit funds in the prefecture at the present time. As of the end of May, it still owned banks at a higher level a net 15.31 million yuan. Meanwhile, more than 780 grassroots level banks throughout the prefecture had only somewhat more than 20 million yuan in People's Bank contingency savings accounts. Some grassroots level branches that even had trouble paying the salaries of enterprise staff members and workers and paying out funds held in savings accounts, had to supply the money for the procurement of 530 million jin of contract grain as well. Finding the money needed to buy 265,000 dan of cotton and 120,000 dan of tobacco is very difficult. Unless banks at a higher level are able to allocate quickly the funds needed for procurement, the issuance of I.O.U.'s for grain procurement will be virtually unavoidable. D. Authority over grain is highly centralized; grain marketing is decontrolled but not open making "invigoration difficult." The method of handling the buying and selling of grain under the planning system long prevented grain enterprises from making their own decisions about grain dealings. Today, although the state has deregulated grain prices and dealings, the deregulation applies only to grain sold at negotiated prices, but authority for plan procurement grain and grain that the government uses to regulate the market, which still accounts for the bulk of grain procurement, is still centralized in the hands of the central government and the provincial governments. Grassroots grain agencies still lack the authority to make decisions about this grain. A Xinyu City People's Bank survey shows that as of the end of April the city had 233.01 million kilograms of grain in storage, 118.47 million kilograms of which was being stored for the state, 22.6 million kilograms of which belonged to the State Council for use in regulating grain markets, and 65.53 million kilograms of which was parity price grain. The negotiated price grain over which grain enterprises could really exercise authority amounted to only 26.41 million kilograms, or 11.3 percent of the total. This high centralization of grain authority has resulted not only in swollen granaries, the accumulation of old grain, and serious waste, but it has also dampened the interest in grain dealings of grassroots grain units. E. Returns from grain farming remain fairly low; the number of peasants going elsewhere to work is on the rise. Abandonment of the land should be a cause for serious concern. A Jingdezhen City People's Bank survey shows a peasant income of 344.20 yuan and expenses of 263.90 yuan per mu of grain for a net income of 80.3 yuan per mu. This net income does not include tractor, water, electricity, and fuel expenses, and various withholdings. After a further deduction for grain retained for their own consumption, the peasants have virtually no cash income. Their income is far lower than what can be made from growing cash crops or leaving the land to work. Because of the relative low returns from the growing of grain, the number of young members of the work force who are leaving the land to work elsewhere has risen sharply. As a result, some farmland has been abandoned and allowed to lie fallow. During 1993, more than 70,000 people in Shangrao, Guangfeng, Boyang, Yugan, and Yongxin counties have left the land to work elsewhere. Ruichang City reports the departure of 38,000 people for jobs elsewhere during 1993, double the 1992 number and approximately 33 percent of the city's rural manpower. Thirty-one of the 51 able-bodied workers in Team 4 at Xiaban Village in the same city have left for jobs elsewhere, leasing to peasants in nearby townships 320 of the village's 600 mu of farmland, which is unintensively farmed. Dexing City reports that 10 mu of wetlands lie fallow because of the departure of peasants from the city. In several townships and villages, between 20 and 30 percent of paddy fields were not being farmed in May. It is estimated that the city's early paddy crop will be 3 million kilograms less than in 1992. The Jingdezhen Municipal People's Bank reported that 12 percent of the reduction in the early paddy growing area is attributable to growing only a single rather than a double crop. III. Several Suggestions Bread is the staff of life. Grain is a strategic commodity that has a bearing on social tranquility and the development of economic stability. It affects the personal well-being of 1 billion Chinese. Further good implementation of grain production and marketing policies, and doing a good job of grain procurement are of major importance in ensuring stable grain production and long and peaceful governance. Some problems remain in the wake of the deregulation of grain prices and grain dealings. All departments concerned should take action and work steadily to solve them. A. The implementation of all policy measures regarding grain production must be ensured to gain the confidence of the people. First, all possible must be done to make down payments on grain procurement to households so that the peasants will have the funds they need for production. Second is the need to adhere to contracts and to ceiling and floor prices in the procurement of grain , halting the deduction of various fees in grain procurement, allowing money from the sale of grain to reach the peasants' hands. Third is the need to control the steady rise in prices of agricultural means of production, and to lower the cost of seed grain for further increase in peasant interest in growing grain. B. Completion of grain procurement and marketing system reform to invigorate enterprises. In the sale of grain to regulate markets, provinces should delegate directly to grassroots grain units all plan allocation grain quotas, grain sales outside plan being centrally regulated by the province. This would not only ensure the province's plan procurement, but would also help deregulate and enliven grassroots grain units. C. Grain units should improve their service attitude, change their work methods, overcome current difficulties, and continue to maintain and develop their roles as principal channels. D. A good job should continue to be done specialized household administration of grain procurement funds to ensure that adequate funds are available on time, and to prevent their draining away or diversion to other purposes. As an accompaniment to grain circulation system reform, a gradual change should be made from grain procurement funds to a grain regulation fund, setting up special grain regulation fund administration agencies to replace the specialized household administration of grain procurement funds.
