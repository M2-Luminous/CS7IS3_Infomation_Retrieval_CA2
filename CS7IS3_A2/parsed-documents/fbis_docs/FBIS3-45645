The formal annual economic plan will only be made public after it has been passed by the NPC in March of next year. However, from the research of CPC think-tanks, we can gain an understanding of some of the ideas of the authorities in respect to the economy next year. "An Analysis of 1994 Macroeconomic Trends" by Liang Yan [4731 6056] The direction of the economy in 1994 will be determined by the orientation of the regulatory and control policies adopted by the central government. In the first half of 1993, the speed of growth in national GNP (gross national product) reached 13.9 percent. Seen from the current economic operational situation, it will be very unlikely that it will be possible to bring annual growth in GNP back down to below 10 percent by relying solely on the existing regulatory and control strengths. Thus, the annual growth in GNP for 1993 will very likely be between 9 and 12 percent. 1. The expectations and actions of the central government. The various central research institutions have put forward four possibilities for GNP growth next year. 1. First possibility: GNP growth will be less than 9 percent. When the central government is deciding the orientation of its 1994 macroeconomic policies, it will be mainly considering the two following factors: 1) The level of economic growth in the second half of 1993; 2) The growth in the level of prices. If the GNP growth in the second half of 1993 falls back to below 7 percent (the possibility of this is very small), the central government will place price levels in a secondary position, and will implement a relaxed monetary policy, so that the GNP growth in 1994 will recover to 9 percent. This is because the fall in GNP growth to 7 percent will mean a higher price has to be paid for the retrenchment policies, and nobody wants to see that. If price level increases follow GNP growth back below 10 percent it is certain that we will see a relaxed monetary policy in 1994. Second possibility: GNP growth will be 9 percent. If the GNP growth in the last half of 1993 falls back to between 7 and 10 percent, and if growth in price levels continues to hover around 15 percent, it is possible that the central government will take as its major concern clamping down on inflation, and will continue to implement a tight monetary policy for a time, at least until price level growth returns to below 10 percent. In this way, the GNP growth in 1994 will hover around 9 percent. Of course, the central government would not be happy with this situation. Third possibility: GNP growth will be 10-12 percent. If the GNP growth in the second half of 1993 is between 10 and 12 percent, and price increases fall back to below 10 percent, this will be an economic operational situation which will be quite pleasing to the central government. This is because, in such a situation, there will be little difficulty for the central government to make policy choices. This will result in the central government maintaining a tight monetary policy in 1994. The degree of tightness will be reduced but it will not be completely given up. As long as the GNP growth rate is lower than 12 percent, but higher than 10 percent, the tight money policy will assist in restraining the sprouts of economic overheating as necessary, and can also guard against an economic landslide. Fourth possibility: GNP growth will be above 12 percent. If the GNP growth in the second half of 1993 is maintained at or above 12 percent, and the level of price increases is higher than 10 percent, then in 1994 the tight monetary policy of the last half of 1993 will be maintained and the degree of tightness may even be increased. Looking comprehensively at the various factors, the economic regulatory and control policies adopted by the central government in 1994 will depend of the operational results of the economy in the last half of 1993. However, the aim of maintaining GNP growth at 10 percent in 1994 will not be difficult. The key question is what measures need to be adopted to curb inflation, so that it can be controlled at below 10 percent. 2. The expectations and actions of local governments. The local governments represent the interests of the regional economic entities. Thus, there are often clashes with the overall interests represented by the central authorities. However, the local governments are also very important intermediate links in the implementation of the central government's targets, and the effectiveness of the central government's policies is to a large degree determined by the matching policies of the local authorities. Seen from the current situation, it is impossible for local policies to fully implement central macroeconomic regulation and control policies. It may well occur that they, to a greater or lesser extent, water down the central policies when implementing them in the localities. This is because there is mutual vying between provinces and regions in terms of economic growth, and this has become a major factor in promoting economic overheating. In addition, because of the imbalance between the economic development of various regions, they all have full reason to try to accelerate the economic development of their own regions. The local governments in various regions are worried that if they completely implement the central retrenchment policies, it will result in their locality suffering harm. In the first half of 1993, while the speed of GNP growth in some coastal provinces exceeded 20 percent, in some other provinces, GNP growth was only about 3 percent. The situation across the country was that the growth in coastal areas was higher than that in the central areas, and in turn that in the central areas was higher than that in the western areas. This disparity basically reflected the levels of economic development in the respective areas. The high speed of economic growth in the last two years involved the role played by a certain amount of mutual vying between provinces. This was particularly so in respect of the leading provinces, whose speed of economic growth exerted a very great psychological pressure on other provinces. Economic operations in 1994 will still be carried out under the impetus of the mutual vying between various levels of local government. The central government's tight monetary policies have already realized certain results. However, the policies and activity modes of local governments cannot be changed and it is very likely that those who have been affected most by the tight monetary policies are the hinterland provinces. First, the funds of coastal provinces do not have the feedback problem, and it is possible that for there to be continuous development in those areas. The process by which a small amount of the funds of hinterland provinces are fed back from coastal provinces also means that the costs of the original engineering projects will increase. Under the current tight monetary policies, feed-back funds will for a time experience difficulty in finding a profitable project. This will result in the use-efficiency of the funds of the hinterland provinces being greatly affected. Second, the funds which have been fed back from the coastal areas and invested in projects may, in a situation where there are no guarantees of continuing funds, turn into dead funds. For these two reasons achieving the feed-back of funds is extremely difficult. The goals and activity modes of local governments means that economic operation will maintain a growth of about 10 percent. This is because the tight monetary policies of the central government have not yet been implemented to the degree where they completely bring under control the activities of mutual vying between local governments. At the same time, the differences in the economic development levels of various regions are becoming increasingly great and in the process of microeconomic regulation under the tight monetary policies, the mutual vying among local governments will push the Chinese economy to a fairly high level of growth. 3. The expectations and actions of enterprises. The tightening up policies which were initiated in the last half of 1993 resulted in newly commenced projects being partially controlled, and the prices of building materials falling back to lower levels. These tightening up measures checked the scale of production of enterprises, and the market saw a contraction. However, the capacity of enterprises to absorb the costs of raw and semifinished materials was improved. In looking at whether or not the economic results of enterprises can be improved, we have to look at which of these influences is the strongest. If the former is stronger than the latter, the enterprise results will see a decline. In the opposite case, the results will see an improvement. Actually, the current microeconomic regulatory policies deliver a message to enterprises, and that is that in 1994 the economy will still grow at quite a high speed. However, in a situation where financial order sees an improvement, it may well be of greater benefit to the development of production by industrial enterprises, as funds will flow toward industrial production. However, in a situation where the pressure on the scale of investment is not great, enterprises have an optimistic attitude towards economic growth in 1994. In addition, over the last year, consumption by social groups has seen a trend of strong growth, and consumption by the people has seen a steady rise. Thus, economic development in 1994 may well see stable high-speed growth prompted by the optimistic activities of enterprises. "Analysis and Forecasting of Grain Supply and Demand" by Cheng Cheng [4453 0701] 1. Forecast of grain supply in 1994. 1. Forecast of the country's output. According to forecasts by the Ministry of Agriculture this year (1993), there will be increased agricultural production in most areas of the country. Total grain production is likely to reach 438.86 million tonnes. In 1994, output may reach 451.79 million tonnes, which will be a record figure. The increased grain production in 1993 has been realized in a situation where area planted has seen a continual reduction. (Following reductions in the previous 2 years, there has been a further reduction of 11 million mu this year) It is estimated that 1994 will see a slight increase in the area planted, and the total may reach 1.66-1.68 billion mu. 2. Forecast of imports next year. In the past, it was generally the case that over 10 million tonnes of grain was imported annually. Now that prices have been freed and each region can operate as it wishes, it is estimated that 1994 imports will be 13 million tonnes. Converted to unprocessed grain, this will be equivalent to about 15.03 million tonnes. 2. Forecast of grain demand in 1994. 1. Forecast of food grain demand. In 1992, per-capita grain consumption in China was 235 kilograms. It is estimated that in 1994, this figure will fall to 233 kilograms. If, in 1994, the national population reaches 1.20 billion, the total volume of food grain consumed throughout the country will be 15.93 million tonnes. 2. Forecast of fodder grain demand. In 1992 the per-capita consumption volume of fodder grain was about 63 kilograms. It is estimated that in 1994, the per-capita fodder grain demand might reach 67 kilograms. The national demand for fodder, converted to unprocessed grain, will total about 93.22 million tonnes. 3. Forecast of demand for industrial-use grain. It is predicted that in 1994, demand for industrial-use grain (including industrial-use grain utilized in foodstuffs, non-staple foodstuffs and non-food products), converted into unprocessed grain, will total about 14.15 million tonnes. 4. Forecast of demand for seed grain. It is predicted that the demand for seed grain throughout the country in 1994 will be 19.15 billion tonnes. 5. Forecast of export volume. From January to August, China exported 7.79 million tonnes of grain, an increase of 560,000 tonnes on the same period last year. The volume of grain imports was 4.51 million tonnes, a reduction of 4.59 million tonnes as compared with the same period last year. With this one increase and one decrease, over the period January to August, the net exports increased by 5.15 million tonnes. It is estimated that the net import of food grain in 1994 could reach 7 million tonnes, while 1994 exports could reach 12 million tonnes. Totaling the above-noted items and adding the 3 million tonnes of grain wasted or spoiled annually, the total demand for grain will be 462.92 million tonnes, of which domestic demand will total 452.92 tonnes. 3. Analysis of China's grain supply and demand in 1994. On the basis of the calculations above, 1994 should see demand exceeding production, and we will have to make use of stores and imported grain to fill the shortfall. Thus, the general trend of the market price of grain next year will be upwards. In particular, because the market looks good for paddy, corn and wheat, their prices will rise to varying degrees. "Inflation Rate in 1994 Will be Between 7 and 10 Percent" by Jiang Zhuowen [3068 0340 2429] There are many factors which will affect the trend of prices in 1994. Of these many factors, a number of factors such as the scale of investment, macroeconomic policies, interest rates for deposits and the price reforms will have a major influence on prices in 1994. Investment. The value of actual investment completed in 1992 was 758.9 billion yuan, an increase of 37.6 percent. This year, the plans kept the figure to 800 billion yuan, an increase of 5.5 percent. However, excluding price rise factors, there will be an increase of between 34 and 40 percent. By July, as the strengthened effects of macroeconomic regulation and control had begun to see results, the cut back of fixed assets saw a reduction in newly commenced projects, a decline in commodity housing investment and a reduction in the growth of investment in local projects. However, the various key state construction projects, especially those which increased supply and alleviated bottlenecks, were not affected. From this we can see that while the increase in fixed assets investment this year may be lower than the growth in 1992, it will not be much lower, and it is likely that a growth rate of about 30 percent will be maintained. That is, investment will be 940 to 980 billion yuan. It may also occur that the investment will break the 1 trillion yuan mark. If this year's growth rate is maintained next year, it will have a definite effect on the overall annual price trend. The regulatory and control power of the macroeconomic policies. Because of the deepening of reform and opening up, the establishment of a market economy structure and particularly because of the initial establishment of China's commodity market and the initial establishment of an economic operational mechanism, macroeconomic regulation and control has already seen initial results. As to how to carry out regulation and control during the next step, the central authorities have decided to carefully handle the regulatory and control power, so as to avoid great economic fluctuations. The characteristic of the operation of these macroeconomic regulatory and control measures is "restricted braking, so as to achieve a soft landing." Thus, it is predicted that in spring next year, the regulatory and control powers may be gradually relaxed. Interest rates. The raising of savings deposit interest rates by the People's Bank of China on two occasions, 15 May and 11 July, had the dual effects of increasing deposits and controlling people's inflationary expectations. However, the sizes of the increases and the rapid pace of their concrete implementation are worthy of study. The great increase of 2.18 percent in the interest rate on 15 May saw a lively response by urban and rural residents, and in May and June the people increased their deposits by 54 billion yuan. This was 18.2 billion yuan more than the increase during the same period of the previous year. It should be possible to complete the issue of state bonds in coordination with administrative measures. Seen from the situation at present, if the current interest rate level is maintained until the first half of next year, it will be beneficial to the reduction of the money supply, and it will ensure that prices see a quite low growth rate. Price reform. Considering things from the current controlling of inflation and the controlling of inflationary expectations, the State Council has decided to implement no further price reform measures in the second half of this year, and related plans have been postponed till an appropriate time in future. The choice of an appropriate time to implement price reforms is a very important issue. The reason price reforms saw results during the period of economic improvement and rectification was because at that time the overall level of prices was quite low. Thus, even if the price reforms took big steps, it did not induce inflationary expectations among the people. The current postponement of the implementation of price reform measures is intended to restrain inflation. Although the investment, interest rate and macroeconomic policies and the price reforms will play basic roles in respect of the price situation next year, we also need to pay attention to exports, imports, exchange rates and the economic situation around the world. Exchange rates. Generally, it can be said that the price of renminbi on the foreign exchange market will continue to be stable. This is because on the one hand, international pressure is great. Various Western countries widely believe that China promotes imports by keeping the value of its currency low, so as to offset the disadvantageous effects of the large increase in imports following its readmission to GATT. If the renminbi is devalued by a great amount however, it will have a negative effect on the efforts to be readmitted to GATT. On the other hand, the policy-making level in China has already recognized that relying purely on a low exchange value of renminbi to promote exports is not only of limited effectiveness in promoting exports, but can also increase the prices of domestic imported products, and give rise to domestic inflation. This will have a negative effect on China's efforts to control inflation. Thus, a stable exchange rate is the basic trend. Next year, there will be a decline in the growth of the scale of investment, interest rates will be maintained at current levels, macroeconomic policies will continue to increase the degree of macroeconomic regulatory and control, price reforms will continue to be deferred, there will continue to be a favorable balance of trade and the exchange rate will be stable or will see a slight decline. In addition, there will be the effects of "cockiness factors" [qiao wei yin su 5062 1442 0936 4790]. Thus, next year, the level of prices will see an overall fallback. Over the year, there will be a low rate of economic growth of between 2 and 5 percent. Next year, the scale of investment will maintain a growth rate of 30 percent, while at an appropriate time in the first half of 1994, interest rates and macroeconomic policies will be gradually readjusted. Price reforms will also be revived and they will be tightly grasped and completed. In terms of foreign trade, there will be a small favorable balance or an overall balance. The exchange rate will be basically stable or will see a slight decline. This will be beneficial to macroeconomic readjustment and the maintenance of an appropriate speed of growth. It will also be beneficial to absorbing the effects of cockiness factors. Next year, the basic trend of prices will be a stable increase of between 7 and 10 percent. "Steel Output in 1994 to Top 90 Million Tonnes" by Wang Li [3769 0500] In the first half of 1993, China's steel output reached 43.43 million tonnes, in which the output of steel products reached 38.5 million tonnes. These figures were respectively 12.5 percent and 21.23 percent up on the same period in the previous year. Calculating on this basis, the total annual production for 1993 will reach 87.5 million tonnes. This shows that China's iron and steel industry has great prospects. In 1994, if the national economy continues to grow at a speed of 9 percent, there will be a corresponding increase in the consumption of steel products, and the output of steel products will continue to grow on the basis of this year's production. There appears no doubt that steel output will top 90 million tonnes next year. Following the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, China's steel output may leap to the number two position in the world next year. Although next year the steel products market will continue to see a situation where supply cannot meet demand, it is predicted that the supply-demand contradiction will be less intense than that this year. The reason the steel enterprises will see such growth is that during the Seventh Five-Year Plan and during the first 2 years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, a great volume of technical transformation funds have been invested, and production capacity has been raised. Thus, next year steel output will continue to see sustained growth. What will constrain it will be raw materials such as iron ore and scrap steel and the transport facilities. Apart from having to adopt necessary policies and encourage increased production of iron ore domestically, there is also a need to appropriately increase the imports of iron ore, scrap steel, and steel blanks. To sum up, as there will still be a supply-demand gap, we can look forward to another upward movement in the market. In 1994, the demand for steel products will grow by 10-13 percent. As to resources, domestic production may increase by 12 to 15 percent and to some degree it will be necessary to rely on imports. In terms of trading in iron and steel, there will be a decline in the import of steel products. This will show itself in the second half of this year. According to relevant statistics, in the first half of this year, 11.16 million tonnes of steel products were imported, a growth of 3.6 times as compared with the same period in the previous year. However, in the second half of the year, the volume of steel products imported has seen a decline. It is estimated that over the full year, about 15 million tonnes will have been imported. In 1994, even if China joins GATT, the volume of imported steel products certainly will not be higher than this year, and will very likely be about 10 million tonnes. "Renminbi To Devalue by 15 Percent in 1994" by Jia Changlu [6328 7022 6424] During the period while the renminbi is making the transition to free convertibility, there exists the risk that inflation will be induced. The exchange rate lever will become an important means by which to regulate domestic and external economic relationships. In 1993, because of the strengthening of psychological expectations and speculation in foreign exchange, strong market- driven fluctuations occurred in the swap exchange rates. Over 7 months, the swap exchange rates for the renminbi saw three major fluctuations, on each occasion exceeding 20 percent. This means that the renminbi has already been successively devalued from the posted exchange rates, to where even the swap exchange rate is, through these fluctuations, moving downward. China's economic relations with the outside world have already greatly expanded and fluctuations in international prices directly affect the domestic economy. If the renminbi is not freely convertible, a great amount of international inflation will flow into the country, but it will not be possible for domestic inflation to be transferred out into the international sphere. If there is no futures market for renminbi, the major risks and damage resultant from exchange rate fluctuations will have to be borne entirely by enterprises. During the period while the renminbi is making the transition to free convertibility, there exists the risk that inflation will be induced. There will be an increasingly close relationship between Chinese residents and foreign exchange, and the exchange rate lever will become an important means by which to regulate domestic and external economic relationships. On the basis of this situation, in 1994 the renminbi will experience the following trends: To what degree will the renminbi devalue in 1994? The posted exchange rates are determined on the basis of export foreign exchange costs, while the swap exchange rates are decided by the import situation and the foreign exchange management system. In 1994 and for several years hence, renminbi exchange rates will see a trend of devaluation. The reasons for this are: -- The domestic economy will see sustained high-speed growth and GNP will grow at over 10 percent annually. --Inflation will be sustained at quite a high level, with the retail price index seeing an annual growth of 10-15 percent. --Exports will grow annually at over 20 percent, while imports will grow even more swiftly. Thus, a trade deficit will appear. --Foreign exchange management will be gradually relaxed and even if it is not relaxed, actual loss of control will become increasingly serious. At the same time, the fluctuations in the swap exchange rates will be frequent and these will mainly arise through speculation in foreign exchange. If the state engages in effective intervention through foreign exchange purchases and sales, these fluctuations may be reduced. If the state uses the highest price limit to carry out control, it will result in the expansion of the foreign exchange black market. Initial estimates indicate that in 1994, swap exchange rates will see a drop of about 15 percent. This will exceed the domestic price rises and economic growth. In subsequent years we will see a devaluing of between 10 and 15 percent annually. This is deduced on the basis of historical experiences. Over the last 15 years, the renminbi exchange rate as calculated on the basis of the posted price has fallen from $1 being equivalent to 1.7 yuan to where it is valued at 5.8 yuan, a fall in value of 240 percent, or an average annual fall of 10 percent. According to the swap exchange rates, it has fallen in value to 10.8 yuan, a drop of 535 percent, or an average annual devaluation of 15 percent. Also, the overall level of domestic prices has risen 150 percent. That is to say, the value of the renminbi externally has fallen at a rate which is twice as great as the decline in the domestic value, and in future this trend will continue. Is the swap exchange rate stable? The exchange rate falling back in July 1993 was mainly the product of the implementation of state economic regulatory and control measures, which changed psychological expectations and resulted in companies selling off large quantities of foreign exchange. The reason it did not break through the 8.5 yuan base line was the limitations imposed by the foreign exchange costs of exports. If the value of the renminbi climbed further, it would affect exports and promote imports. At present, the rate is stable at about 9 yuan. This is the result of a balance between the two forces. In the first half of the year, the trade deficit reached $3.5 billion, while foreign exchange reserves fell to $6 billion. Proceeding from the requirement to achieve a balance of international payments, the renminbi should not be allowed to devalue excessively. However, as the domestic economic retrenchment whereby banks only accept funds and do not provide credit has been in place for over four months, the renminbi is extremely tight, and it will naturally not lose much value. The current stability is only temporary. The domestic tight monetary policies cannot be sustained for too long a time, and they will probably begin to see gradual relaxation by the end of the year. Also the demand for foreign exchange to fund imports has not been reduced. Thus, it is predicted that by the beginning of 1994, there will be a further fall in the renminbi swap foreign exchange rate. "The Risks of Merging Exchange Prices Next Year" by Jia Changlu [6328 7022 6424] The 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decided that beginning next year, the exchange prices of the renminbi would be gradually unified. At present, for renminbi there are "three prices for the one currency." There is the "official price" (where $1 converts to 5.68 yuan). There is also the "swap price" (where $1 converts to 8.7 yuan) and further the "black market price" (where $1 converts to 9 yuan). The situation is extremely chaotic and this has obstructed the normal development of international trade and investment. Can the dual-track exchange rate be unified? Another significance of the devaluing of the posted exchange rate is that under conditions where the swap exchange rate is stable and the differential between the two exchange rates is quite small, achieving the unification of the dual exchange rates, scrapping foreign exchange quotas and changing quota management into spot exchange management so as to realize a unified exchange rate, is one of the things which China has promised to GATT as a condition for its readmission. This must be achieved in the next few years. The end of 1993 is the best opportunity for the merger of the dual exchange rates. The price differential of the two tracks will be small, the scrapping of quota prices will cause little disturbance and if there is a desire to purchase quotas, the amount the state financial administration will have to pay out will be small. However, it should be noted that there exists quotas for 10 billion in foreign exchange, and that to purchase these will still require a large volume of renminbi. At the end of 1992, the posted exchange rate was 5.8 yuan, while the swap rate was 7 yuan. The quota price however was only 1.2 yuan. If they first devalued the posted exchange rate to 6.8 yuan and then purchased all of the outstanding quota on the basis of $1 of foreign exchange quota converting to 0.2 yuan, the cost would have been the lowest. Unfortunately, the reforms were too slow and the opportunity was missed. The end of 1993 also provides an opportunity. If the posted exchange rate is devalued to 8 yuan, and quota are purchased at a quota price where $1 converts to 0.5 yuan, then it will be possible to achieve the unifying of the two tracks at the 8 yuan level. This could still be regarded as a good move. If, for fear of being unable to guarantee foreign exchange income or in order to pander to the interests of particular departments, this merger is again deferred, a greater price will have to be paid in future. The risk of implementing free convertibility of renminbi. Implementing a unified floating exchange rate does not mean that the renminbi will be freely convertible. It will only be basically freely convertible in the trade sphere. There will still be strict restrictions on individuals and foreign investors. The next step however will be to completely abolish foreign exchange controls and allow free convertibility in respect of foreign exchange. It is estimated that this will be achieved in 3 to 5 years. However, the risks are very great. If just 20 percent of the people's savings deposits of 1.2 trillion yuan were converted into foreign exchange, then 240 billion yuan would be converted into $20 billion. If we work on the basis of a ratio of one to twelve, this conversion would consume all of China's foreign exchange reserves. An even greater problem is that the banks just do not have so much renminbi to expend. If people become nervous, at any time a bank run might occur. Then, if consumer goods are in insufficient supply, foreign exchange will become the target of panic purchasing. Thus, as renminbi heads toward free convertibility, there is a need to be extremely careful. "Investment To Exceed 140 Billion [figure as published] Yuan in 1994" by Lu Dacheng [7120 6671 2052] Next year, the total value of fixed investment throughout the country will exceed 1.4 trillion yuan, a 24 percent growth on 1993. This high speed of growth will be achieved on the basis of the 45 percent growth seen in 1993 as compared with 1992. The statistics of the State Planning Commission show that in 1993 the total fixed asset investment in society will be over 1.14 trillion yuan, a 45.1 percent increase over the previous year. In this, whole-people investment will grow 50 percent, collective investment will increase 59 percent and individual investment will grow by 8 percent. This trend of investment inflation led to the implementation of macroeconomic regulatory and control policies in the middle of this year. The characteristics of fixed asset investment in 1993 can be summed up in the following points: 1. There has been high-speed growth in investment in state-owned enterprises and, in the first half of the year, this reached 70 percent. Collective enterprises saw even greater growth, with investment in the first half of the year growing 105 percent. 2. Local project investment has been higher than central investment, with the proportion of local investment seeing straight- line growth. 3. Investment clearly moved towards the southeast coastal areas. The growth there was over 30 percent higher than growth in the central and western regions. 4. The investment structure has not been rational. Apart from transport and communications, the proportions of investment in bottleneck sectors declined. Also, the proportion of productive, constructive investment declined, but commodity housing saw a very high rate of growth. 5. Investment performance has been poor and there has been a decline in the fixed asset creation rate. 6. The rate of funds provision has not been ideal. The annual investment plan arranged by the state only provided 44.79 billion yuan. However, the actual needs of construction on the basis of rational engineering were 49.8 billion, meaning a shortfall of 5 billion yuan, a figure representing 11.2 percent of the estimate. Although retrenchment policies have been implemented, due to the inertia of growth and other promotional factors, China's investment demand is still growing and expanding at a quite high rate. According to forecasts, total social fixed assets investment in 1994 will exceed 1.4 trillion yuan, and actually reach 1.417 trillion yuan, a growth of 24.3 percent. Of this, whole-people investment will see a growth of 25.5 percent, collective investment will see a growth of 27.3 percent and individual investment will see a growth of 12.2 percent. The reasons for the growth of investment in 1994 can be summed up as follows: Policy-nature reasons include: 1. In order to reduce the economic development disparities between the eastern, central and western regions, next year the state will support the development of the central and western regions and, to a certain degree, will increase the support it provides for the development of these regions. 2. In order to increase the vigor of old medium-size and large state-owned enterprises, the state will continue to increase investment in them. Economic-nature reasons include: 1. The macroeconomic regulation and control measures implemented this year have brought about a soft landing for the economy in the second half of the year. This has laid a foundation for quite swift economic development next year. 2. This year, many investment projects have already been commenced and a large amount of funds have already been put into them. They cannot really be abandoned half way. 3. Prospects look good for the drawing in of foreign funds in 1994 and there will need to be corresponding renminbi investment. "State-Run Enterprises to Undergo Major Reorganization in 1994" by Jia Changlu [6378 7022 6424] The third plenary session decided to increase the pace of reform of state-run enterprises. China's state-run enterprises face a major challenge and 1994 will be a crucial year for them. An intense clash. The stage of changeover from the old track to the new will see some overlapping and a series of clashes. Next year, in their production operations, state-run enterprises will keep one eye on the market and will be guided by market signals and will organize production on the basis of marginal patterns. They will keep the other eye fixed on the government. They will put efforts into completing the government targets and in this respect will have to diverge from the laws of margins. In resource deployment, they will have to consider economic rationality, but will not be able to violate their loyalty to the upper levels. Economic operations will have to be in accord with lateral market relations, but will also have to be coordinated with vertical administrative relations. The enterprises will have to face the market and take responsibility for operations and their own profits and losses, and will also have to bear all kinds of social, administrative and policy tasks. In this way, they will lose most of their autonomy in operations and their right to assume responsibility for profits and losses. The limits of enterprise property rights are hazy. Sometimes, ownership rights are expanded and this eats into the rights and interests of the operators. At other times, ownership rights are reduced, and this produces an outflow of state-owned assets and a flood of short-term activities by enterprises. The operational rules for property rights are not unified and administrative rights and economic rights are overlapping and entangled. In the market, bureaucratic practices prevail while in the bureaucracy, market practices prevail. The two systems are locked together in confrontation and it is thus difficult for state-owned enterprises to achieve efficiency. Thus, the reform of state-owned enterprises next year must follow two principles. First, the noneconomic factors of state-owned property rights must be given up. This principle can be realized through the reform of government organs and functional transformation. This will allow the separation of economic rights and administrative rights and the separation of economic functions and administrative functions. The second is to promote the structuralization of property rights. If there is a desire to form an economic environment in which there is exchange at equal value and effective competition, then it is necessary for there to exist many competitive property rights entities, not ownership entities. The three major trends in 1994. On the basis of the above analysis, next year the development of state-owned enterprises will see three major trends: First, the trend of separate streams. The majority of small and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and some of the large enterprises which are not suited to the implementation of a state ownership system will be "transferred down" to collectives or individuals through leasing or contracting, and they will gradually be transformed into shareholding operations. Various enterprises, which because of their serious losses and the fact that they have long been unable to make enough money to cover liabilities, will have difficulty avoiding the fate of bankruptcy and elimination. Second, the trend of hybridization. Not only will there be crossholdings among state- owned property rights entities, but there will also be mutual shareholdings among different types of property rights entities. Jointly, they will establish enterprise groups and, through pooling funds and technology with foreign businesses, they will bring into play the superiorities of "hybridization." Third, a competitive orientation. The state will control the property rights of large enterprises which affect the national economy and the people's livelihood, but the enterprises will have full operational autonomy. The enterprises of different natures will compete equally and state- owned enterprises will bring their own superiorities into play through competition, and will guide the healthy development of the market economy. Thus, next year there will be a high tide of internal autonomy in China's state-owned enterprises.
