"However, Americans are sensible enough, they know how talks should be conducted and it is possible to come to terms with them on all positions," Baturin said. He said that Yeltsin's attitude to the problem was influenced by numerous requests made by deputies of the State Duma to look into the matter and, for the last time, such a request was made by the Duma council. The president received protests from the Orenburg region, where the exercises were scheduled to take place. As a result, Yeltsin decided to look into the matter again, Baturin said. Asked about unjustified expenditures in connection with preparations for the exercises, Baturin said that the "involvement of military units had not been envisaged. There were plans that the exercises would be held by a limited number of Russian and U.S. officers and generals with the help of maps and computers, Baturin said. In his opinion, the material cost of the exercises, unlike the political cost, is not big at all.
