In the past his unwavering intent to achieve financial stabilization by any means went hand in hand with the confrontation strategy of the Kremlin. It would be interesting to see whether this politician is undergoing an evolution. The minister's new year's article in IZVESTIYA is indicative; in it, he appraises the current reforms and offers some forecasts regarding the development of the Russian economy in the event of a change of course. The inveterate radicalism of the very first phrase of this press communication by the deputy prime minister makes one shudder: "The current financial policy brings out a harsh reaction on the part of the opposition. This means that we have succeeded in implementing a consistent financial policy." More quotes: "...cutting through fierce resistance put up by the Central Bank and a number of members of the government," "...despite the resistance on the part of the Central Bank and various sectoral lobbies," "our unceasing fight against the Supreme Soviet, the Central Bank, and sectoral lobbies in the government." Whether Boris Fedorov wants it or not, he is not only the minister of finance, but also a politician; and while the first part of the article, in which he relates the accomplishments and the fighting, shows us the minister of finance, only Fedorov the politician could propose a minimum program for any cabinet for the next year. What is included in this minimum program? Ensuring truly positive interest rates in order to attract savings and "paying reasonable compensation from noninflationary sources to citizens for losses incurred because of liberalization." The population's real income should increase from $100 to $250 a month. It is necessary to introduce tax regulators that will reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. Inflation should be brought down to 5 percent a month--an equivalent of 80 percent a year--in the nearest future. As the budget deficit is reduced to 5 percent of the GNP and below, the tax burden on producers of goods can be reduced. Following that, in order to scare the reader, Boris Fedorov presents a list of horrors that will befall us in the event of abandoning the reform: prices rising at 2,000 percent a year; an exchange rate of 10,000 rubles for a dollar; an increasing dollarization of the economy; fixed prices on some goods and confiscation of money in the banks; and a shortage of goods. Of course, one senses in this juxtaposition a single-vision perception of the development of the Russian economy (if we do not achieve stabilization we will get "Ukrainization") and the same complete lack of substantiation and fanatical adherence to the "party line." "God save Russia from deviating again from the correct road," Fedorov ends his article. How does Boris Fedorov intend to solve the problem of employment and raise the population's average income considering that 10 million people will have no job at all, and enterprises that have not gone bankrupt will nevertheless be unprofitable because of the low exchange rate of the dollar? What expenditures will then be required for maintenance of law enforcement organs? How does one bring inflation down considering that any tightening of the money supply produces only a cash crisis? Why, finally, can we today try to index people's savings "through noninflationary monetary means" while only yesterday this was rejected under a threat of hyperinflation? There may be only one answer to all this: I am the minister of finance; these are not my problems. However, while such a position on the part of the minister of finance is completely consistent and beyond reproach, can Fedorov the politician--a man who should be aware of what results his departmental zeal will produce--formulate the issue this way? "We should stop attempting to crossbreed a hedgehog and a grass snake--as is known, the product of it is barbed wire. The elections gave us a warning," wrote B.G. Fedorov. Fedorov is wrong. The elections did not give us a warning. The Russia's Choice radicals lost the elections. And they lost not to communo-fascists, as had been expected, but to a new force, capable of using social discontent to a highest degree. And if we consider that, Russia either needs to be crisscrossed either by a hedgehog-grass snake hybrid right now or we have to realize that the country on which we conduct experiments in fighting inflation by monetarist methods will fall into Zhirinovskiy's hands in 1996. And it will again end in hedgehogs and grass snakes.
