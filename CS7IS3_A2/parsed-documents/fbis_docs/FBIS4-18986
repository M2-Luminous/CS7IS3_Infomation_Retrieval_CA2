It was obvious that the Serbs would only understand "this clear language," Ruehe said in an interview with the daily DIE WELT (Tuesday [12 April] edition). A "human catastrophe on an immense scale" was beginning to emerge in Gorazde. Now everybody has to exert an influence on the Serbs to stop their attacks. Russia could also continue to play an important role in this process, the minister stressed in the article, which was released in advance of publication by the Federal Defense Ministry. Hitherto the United Nations has had neither the legal nor the practical opportunities to actively disarm the Serb besiegers. It is therefore all the more important now to exploit all the opportunities in Bosnia, "where the United Nations could fall back on NATO's resources." This means military air operations in particular, Ruehe said. Neither the civilian population nor UN troops must come to harm during this. Ruehe once again stressed that the deployment of German soldiers in the former Yugoslavia will "not be considered" for historical reasons.
