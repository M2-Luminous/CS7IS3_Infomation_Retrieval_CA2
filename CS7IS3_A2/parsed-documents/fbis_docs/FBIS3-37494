The draft is to be submitted for consideration by the CIS Coordinative and Consultative Committee, which will hold its meeting in Moscow on 1 March. As Yevgeniy Gorelik, press secretary of the CIS Executive Committee, told an RID correspondent, the main controversies which arose during the drafting of the agreement concerned an article defining the status of Ukrainian representatives in the coordinative bodies of the economic union. The Uzbek delegation insisted that Ukrainian experts and permanent representatives be entitled to only put forward their suggestions. The Ukrainian delegation, which arrived in Minsk to participate in the project, proposed that it should be defined in one of the articles that decisions adopted by the CIS coordinative bodies be considered as recommendations with regard to Ukraine. The majority of participants in the meeting did not, however, accept this proposal. The last word in this dispute rests with the prime ministers and presidents who will chair sessions of the Council of CIS Leaders and Government Heads at the end of March, said Yevgeniy Gorelik.
