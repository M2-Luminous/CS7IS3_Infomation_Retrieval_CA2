There is no electricity for the eighth month running and it is uncertain when there will be any. There is no drinking water and no food has come into the town lately. No humanitarian aid convoy has come for days. There are increasingly shortages of medicine and those most needed are unobtainable for days at a time. There is a constant crisis with medicines to cure ulcers, epilepsy, (?hypertension), and many other diseases. A special problem is the lack of fuel for the hospital generator, municipal vehicles, and other vital needs of the town. As the Mostar Commune War Presidency reports, it is already the fourth time that the Croatian Defense Council has turned back fuel that the UNHCR has tried to take to the hospital on the left bank [of the Neretva]. In a word, the situation in Mostar is critical and it is becoming increasingly difficult every day.
