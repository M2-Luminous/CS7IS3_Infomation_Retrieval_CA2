British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), which operates the Sellafield reprocessing works, is importing the uranium and making the shells at its Springfield Works at Preston in Lancashire. The company is acting as an agent for the Ministry of Defence. The extent of BNFL's role as a weapons manufacturer -- hitherto unknown outside a small circle of nuclear workers and the ministry -- is revealed in a US government export licence, a copy of which has been obtained by The Guardian. It was granted in October for the sale of 158,758 kilogrammes of depleted uranium. This would be sufficient to make tens of thousands of armour-piercing, anti-tank rounds. In the wake of increasing suggestions that some Gulf war veterans are suffering from mystery illnesses and their children from deformities, the use of highly toxic uranium and the vapourising element beryllium for the tips of British shells is highly sensitive. Investigations into the possible causes of the so-called Gulf syndrome in the US centre on the use of chemical, biological, and viruses by the Iraqis and uranium shells by the Allies. The shells were used in earnest for the first time in the Gulf war and an estimated 40 tonnes of depleted uranium was left on the battlefield, mostly in the form of toxic and radioactive dust. Contamination is at its worst when tanks are hit by shells, destroying the vehicles, and in the resultant fire uranium dust is spread in a wide area. No clean up has been attempted in Kuwait and much of the uranium dust is now scattered about in the thousands of square miles of desert covered by the battle. Some 4,000 US uranium-tipped tank rounds were fired and a smaller number from British guns. The success of uranium and beryllium tipped weapons in armour piercing has inspired the Ministry of Defence to step up production. Uranium is two and a half times as dense as steel and penetrates armour more effectively than the tungsten, copper and nickel alloy currently used. An initial licence issued to BNFL by the Americans on October 5, 1993, expiring on January 31, 1995, allows BNFL to import the depleted uranium. The BNFL shells are believed to be exclusively for British forces but the US licence allows for export to Nato countries. Royal Ordnance, owned by British Aerospace, is also making 120 millimetre uranium-tipped shells for British tanks using imported US uranium. The Ministry has been questioned by a number of MPs about its testing of uranium-tipped weapons at firing ranges in Scotland and Cumbria. Jonathan Aitken, the defence procurement minister, visited Kirkcudbright, in Galloway on September 21, to reassure local people that there was no health risk from test firings of the shells at the Ministry's Dundrennan test sight. Around 4,000 test shells have been fired there in the last 10 years.
