For more than two years, a reinforced Belgian UN battalion has been stationed in Serb-occupied Baranja. In late February, at the height of the tension surrounding Sarajevo, one armored combat company, however, was assigned to go and back up the UN troops in Bosnia posthaste. This move meant that a large proportion of the protection for the Baranja detachment (BELBAT) was lost. After the experience in Rwanda, it was decided to reinforce this detachment with extra armored vehicles. On Friday, it was decided not to send new men or equipment there. The general staff were ordered by the UN senior command to investigate how the Belgian combat company in Bosnia could be reincorporated into BELBAT. Belgium is, however, temporarily keeping its transport and engineering company in Bosnia.
