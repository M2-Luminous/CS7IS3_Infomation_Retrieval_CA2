Tuleyev under general heading: "Russia Pregnant With Strike"] [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich, As a Federation Council deputy I am obliged to send you a written request and obliged to tell you the following. In the Kuzbass, where you were nominated for president and where miners have been your constant support, an extreme economic and political emergency has taken shape. You know that it is connected with the stoppage of enterprises, reciprocal nonpayments, the nonfulfillment of your edicts and instructions, and unemployment. People have been unable to get their wages for five months. There is a wild, uncontrolled increase in prices. And most important, people are not protected from the rampage of crime, they live in fear of their lives in the full sense of the word. My frequent appeals to the government and to you personally are left without proper attention. Unless urgent and effective steps are taken right now, the most terrible thing -- a general strike -- could occur in the Kuzbass. In terms of its strength it would be the 1989 strike, in which you took part, but squared. If it is allowed it will deal a terrible blow to the Russian economy because the lack of coal will bring everything to a standstill. My conscience is clear. I have done everything I could to warn of this social eruption when I was chairman of the oblast soviet before you dissolved the representative organs. As God is my witness people's demands are entirely just; the miners did not go on strike in 1989 in order to live in poverty and fear, experiencing every day the violation of human rights. I support the Kuzbass people's demands and, of course, I shall be with them. I appeal to you once again as president to take urgent and effective steps, including those I have suggested and which are at present in the hands of your apparatus. [Signed] Federation Council Deputy A. Tuleyev
