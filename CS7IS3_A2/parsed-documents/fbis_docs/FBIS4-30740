This was discussed, among other things, at the SZDSZ press briefing. Judit Laszlo reports from there. [Laszlo] [passage omitted] Considering the chances for a coalition, party Chairman Ivan Petoe said that the SZDSZ did not view the distribution of ministries purely as a mathematical exercise. Were the MSZP-SZDSZ coalition to come into being, it would be the result of a historic compromise, Petoe said. [passage omitted] The price of the compromise is that the would-be coalition should implement a liberal economic program but the SZDSZ would like to see the personnel guarantees for this too, Petoe said. He also stressed that the SZDSZ would be able to conduct coalition negotiations only with a united MSZP, because the SZDSZ does not wish to set itself up as a judge to decide over the issues of dispute that exist between the various wings of the MSZP. An MSZP-SZDSZ coalition is inconceivable unless a compromise solution is arrived at in respect of the person of the prime minister. At the same time, the SZDSZ is not in a position to make recommendations for the person of the prime minister, it was said at the press briefing. [passage omitted]
