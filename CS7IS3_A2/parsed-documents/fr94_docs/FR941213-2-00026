FR941213-2-00026 FR941213-2-00017 [Docket No RP88&hyph;44&hyph;051] El Paso Natural Gas Co.; Notice of Compliance Tariff Filing December 7, 1994. Take notice that on December 5, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), tendered for filing, pursuant to Part 154 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act and in compliance with the Commission's Order on Remand issued November 4, 1994 (November 4, 1994 order), at Docket No. RP88&hyph;44&hyph;045, certain tariff sheets to its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1&hyph;A. El Paso states that it is adding a new section 4.2(e) to its Capacity Allocation Procedure in compliance with the November 4, 1994, order in which the Commission ordered El Paso to revise its tariff to include provisions giving relief to any Shipper serving high priority end-users when that Shipper has exhausted all other self-help remedies in times of bona fide emergencies. Accordingly, section 4.2(e) provides for the allocation of capacity required to meet an emergency for firm Shippers serving high priority end-users in cases of a bona fide emergency that would result in irreparable injury to life or property, absent the availability of additional pipeline capacity. El Paso respectfully requests that the Commission accept the tendered tariff sheets for filing and permit them to become effective January 4, 1995, which is not less than thirty (30) days following the date of the filing. El Paso states that copies of the filing were served upon all of El Paso's interstate pipeline system transportation customers and interested state regulatory commissions. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with ยง385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before December 14, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestant parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
