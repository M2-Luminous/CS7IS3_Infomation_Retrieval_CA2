Khalid added that the signing of the Cairo agreement by Yasir 'Arafat is illegitimate and is not binding on the PLO or the Palestinian people because 'Arafat did not refer to any of the PLO institutions that have a say on the present and future of the Palestinian people. Khalid urged the PLO Executive Committee chairman to respect the Palestinian people's will, and to subject the Gaza-Jericho agreement to a referendum among the Palestinians inside and outside the occupied territories. He said this referendum would let the Palestinians express their opinion on this agreement and this destructive policy that furthers division within the PLO and the Palestinian people, sacrifices the Palestinian people's higher national interests, and changes the territories into protectorates under Israeli sovereignty.
