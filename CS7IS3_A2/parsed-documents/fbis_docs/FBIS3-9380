Describing the situation in Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that "Karadzic's terrorists and Abdic's paramilitaries are continuing to cooperate in destroying this part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All last night, particularly after midnight, they pounded the defense positions on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, Hasin Vrh, and Barakovac with artillery and tanks. They attempted an infantry breakthrough yesterday evening but our defenders managed to repel it with great effort." He says that "the members of the paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomy have been using artillery since yesterday against the Cazin districts of Krivaja, (Liskovac), and (?Prle). They also used chemical agents, and Osa and Zolja portable rocket launchers. This is continuing this morning. They have massacred six members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] Army, and captured several others." Viktor Boban reports from Maglaj from the theater of operations of the B-H Army Operative Group Bosna that "yesterday evening the Chetniks intensified their attacks on Rujnica, in the region of Zeleni Kamen, and combined it with an attempt at an infantry breakthrough. However, our defenders had no problems repelling this enemy attack." He says that "this morning after 0500 the Chetniks launched a savage artillery and infantry attack on several parts of the Rujnica defense lines. The B-H Army was ready for this attack, and responded with equal ferocity so the valley of the Bosna River is reverberating to heavy explosions. The general alarm has been sounded and the population is in shelters. At the moment of filing this report shells are pounding the town." The B-H Army 4th Corps Information Service reports that "the cease-fire on the Mostar front over the last 24 hours has not been fully observed. Extremists from the Croatian Defense Council have been less active than over the last few days but they still fired a few grenades from a portable grenade launcher at the demarcation lines in the city. Elsewhere the cease-fire has held."
