FR940317-1-00102 FR940317-1-00013 (b) The Sending States under current international reciprocal agreements include Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Spain, and SHAPE. (c) Reference should be made to DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix L for delineation of what constitutes a foreign military force, a foreign civilian component, and a foreign dependent. (d) Whenever claims arise involving foreign soldiers training or otherwise stationed in the United States pursuant to bilateral agreements or other arrangements, such as foreign military sales agreements, which contain specific claims provisions, the claims office receiving the claim will report such claims to the Commander, USARCS, for guidance as to the resolution and, if necessary, payment of such claims. (e) The United States, as a Receiving State, is responsible under some Status of Forces Agreements, for the investigation of incidents, and for the processing of claims, arising from acts or omissions of members or civilian employees of an armed force of a sending state present in the United States. The United States may be liable for partial payment of such claims if they arise incident to the official duties of the sending state's soldier or employee. Article VIII of the NATO SOFA is the most commonly invoked agreement of this sort. It applies to torts committed within the North Atlantic Treaty Area, which includes the continental United States and island possessions north of the Tropic of Cancer (i.e. excludes Puerto Rico, Hawaii and American Samoa). It also applies to claims arising out of acts by military or civilian personnel, regardless of nationality, who are assigned, attached to, or employed by an international headquarters established under the provisions of the Protocol on the Status of International Military Headquarters Set Up Pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty dated August 28, 1952 (e.g. Supreme Allied Command, Atlantic). (f) Single service responsibility for the processing and settlement of claims cognizable under this section is assigned to DA by DODD 5515.8. The Secretary of the Army hereby designates the USARCS as the Receiving State Office for claims cognizable under this section with authority to settle such claims in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2734b. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix L.) (g) As Sending State forces are considered assimilated into the armed forces of the United States for purposes of the SOFAs, their members are also barred from being compensated by the United States when they are injured incident to their service, Daberkow v. United States, 581 F.2d 785 (9th Cir. 1978). (See also DA Pam 27&hyph;162, appendix L for an example of a government-to-government claim bar in these circumstances.) ยง536.107 Notification of incidents. In order for the United States to properly discharge its claims responsibilities under international agreements, it is essential that the responsible military authorities be notified of all incidents, including off-duty incidents, in which members of a foreign military force or civilian component are involved. Any installation that learns of an incident involving a member of a foreign military force or civilian component which results in personal injury, death, or property damage will notify immediately by the most expeditious means the installation to which such person is assigned or attached. An information copy of such notification will be furnished to the Commander, USARCS. In the event the member is not assigned or attached to any installation within the United States, the Commander, USARCS will be notified. The notification (exempt report, AR 335&hyph;15, para 720) will contain so much of the following information as is readily available: (a) Date of incident. (b) Place of incident. (c) Nature of incident. (d) Names and organization of foreign personnel involved. (e) Name of potential claimants. (f) A brief description of any damage, loss, or destruction of property, and personal injuries or death. ยง536.108 Liaison with sending State representatives. The Commander, USARCS is responsible for maintaining liaison with designated representatives of Sending States as to claims matters under this section, and establishing internal operating procedures. ยง536.109 Investigations. (a) Immediate investigation of each incident involving a member of a foreign force or civilian component is required in order to ensure that all necessary information, including necessary statements and depositions, is obtained before the foreign personnel involved, either principals or witnesses, depart the United States. (b) Responsibility for the investigation of an incident rests upon the commander of the installation to which the member of a foreign force or civilian component is assigned or attached, or if not assigned or attached within the United States upon the Commander, USARCS. He or she is authorized to designate an appropriate agency of the Armed Services for this purpose. (c) The installation responsible for the investigation will be free to request appropriate assistance from any other installation within the DOD to the end that a reliable and complete investigation of the incident will be accomplished most economically. Such requested assistance may be for an investigation of the entire incident, or it may cover only part of the investigation; for example, it may be a statement from one witness. Normally such requests will be made of an installation having claims responsibility under the appropriate departmental regulation and nearest the place of the occurrence. In a case involving an aircraft, such request will normally be made of an installation that also has the capability of investigating air accidents giving due regard to the type of aircraft.
