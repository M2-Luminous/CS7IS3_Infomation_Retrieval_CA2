On 28 March Ghali presented a report to the UN Security Council concerning the development of the peace accords in El Salvador. He emphasized the government's failure to comply with several points of the Chapultepec Pact, signed in Mexico City in January 1992. Ghali indicated in his report that "it was necessary to adopt urgent measures so that the peace process can get back on track" and to "demand" that the Salvadoran Government comply with all the peace accords. "The truth is that we are surprised because the reply implies that the government lacks the political will to comply with the accords, and this is not true," Cristiani said. He said Ghali's report does not explain to the Security Council all the reasons that have prevented compliance with important aspects of the agreements, and this has nothing to do with a lack of will. The report says constitutional reforms have yet to be endorsed in the judicial branch and that there are delays in the distribution of land among former fighters, the National Civilian Police's deployment, and the former National Police's dismantling. Cristiani said: In the case of the constitutional reforms, the decision is up to the legislative branch rather than the executive branch, and "the (?government) is not responsible for this." He said the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) is also responsible for the lack of compliance with the peace accords, particularly with regard to the distribution of land among former fighters. Cristiani accused the FMLN of refusing to participate in a high-level meeting to "leave the new government with a clean slate concerning the accords." He called into question the fact that no one had waited for the report from Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, former chief of the [words indistinct] mission, who handed over his post on 31 March and whose analysis of the peace process is "more in accordance with the country's reality." According to Cristiani, the report presented to the UN Security Council was prepared based on information delivered by the UN secretary general's adviser, Alvaro de Soto, who made "a quick visit to the country." The Salvadoran president announced his government will send a written reply to Ghali next week, debating his report point by point. It will also send a copy to the Security Council. "The time to answer has come because it seems the government does not want to comply," Cristiani said, who noted that the official document would be released soon.
