Mr. Chan Sek Keong argued that the court could find Foo in breach of the Official Secrets Act [OSA] even if it decided that there was not enough evidence to show that Foo had intended to communicate the information to Mr. Choy Keen Meng. The A-G said Foo knew or ought to have known that when he mentioned the figure 4.6 percent to Mr. Kelvin Quek, a government economist, his utterance would have been heard by Mr. Choy. This was because the latter was close by. Yet he took the risk, said the A-G. Foo is alleged to have communicated the flash estimates on the way to lunch on June 19 with Mr. Quek and Mr. Choy. The A-G said the evidence of Mr. Quek and Mr. Choy, which the prosecution had relied on to prove that Foo knew that the flash estimate for the second quarter was 4.6 percent, had not been rebutted. For instance, he noted that Mr. Quek's testimony that he was certain he had discussed and explained the nature of the flash estimates to the accused remained "unshaken". Under cross examination by Mr. Chelva Rajah, counsel for Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Mr. Quek had shown he was a truthful witness, said the A-G. "He was prepared to admit that it was not proper for him to have given an indication of the direction in which the economy was heading." During his lunch meeting with Foo, Mr. Quek had indicated how certain sectors of the economy were performing. During his hour-long submission, the A-G yesterday asked that a number of inferences be drawn against Foo. Among them: -- That he had heard Manu Bhaskaran utter the words "first flash" as otherwise he would not have remembered the expression when giving his statement to the Internal Security Department. -- That Foo also understood from Mr. Quek's explanation that flash estimates are never published, and only the final figure would be published.
