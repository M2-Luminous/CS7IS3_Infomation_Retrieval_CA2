T. Yeshchanov, A. V. Kulakov, V. V. Kulakov and A. D. Chernousov, Immunology Institute, Russian Federation Ministry of Health; UDC 612.017.1.083.3(575.172)] [Text] Much attention is currently being devoted to indicators of the immune status of healthy people in different regions of the country [1]. Persuasive evidence was obtained indicating that the body's immune system reacts very sensitively to various unfavorable effects, and it can be used to test for these effects [3]. Indicators of the immune status of people of different regions differ [1]. Such research has special significance in the country's ecologically unfavorable regions as a way of revealing the extent of the immune system's disturbance and the need for purposeful clinical examination and treatment and for measures by which to improve the health of the people. One of the ecologically unfavorable zones requiring special attention is the Aral zone, including the Republic of Karakalpakstan, where examination and treatment results for 1989 [2] reveal elevated morbidity characterized as the immunodeficiency syndrome and as the autoimmune and allergic syndromes (Table 1). Study of the immune status of the population of the Republic of Karakalpakstan is required if we are to plan measures to reduce overall morbidity. Table 1.

Diagnostic questionnaire cards developed by the Immunology Institute of the Russian Ministry of Health [5] were filled out on each subject. Immune status was evaluated in accordance with procedural recommendations of the USSR Ministry of Health [5], including level I and II tests. Determinations were also made of the concentration of the rheumatoid factor, and of antibodies to thyroglobulin and trinitrophenyl in blood serum by triphasic immunoenzymatic analysis (IEA). The absolute and relative leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were estimated by the commonly employed procedure using Zadorozhnyy's stain, while T-lymphocytes and their subpopulations were determined with monoclonal antibodies obtained from the Immunology Institute using a flow-through cytometer. The concentration of serum IgG, IgA, IgM was determined by Mancini's method, while IgE was determined by the IEA method. Phagocytic activity of neutrophils was evaluated on the basis of absorption by latex particles. The t-test was used for statistical treatment. Results and Discussion According to WHO data diseases associated with disturbance of immune system function fall within so-called immunopathological syndromes (infection, allergic, autoimmune). They manifest themselves as chronic inflammatory diseases, as the absence of resistance to infections, and as allergic and autoimmune afflictions. Questionnaire results revealed that 37.3 percent of the surveyed population suffers diseases falling within these syndromes. Table 2 gives the average immune status indicators for the Karakalpakstan population, as well as for residents of Semipalatinsk and workers of an antibiotics plant (Moscow) and the Khimplast Plant (Nizhniy Tagil), used for comparison purposes (the data were obtained by associates of the Immunology Institute of the Russian Ministry of Health). The first interesting thing analysis of the results shows is an extremely low concentration of T-lymphocytes and their subpopulations in Karakalpakstan residents in terms of both percent and absolute content (see Table 2). While the concentration of lymphocytes is 63.2 +/- 1.29, 70 +/- 0.7 and 62.02 +/- 0.45 percent in subjects from Semipalatinsk, Moscow and Nizhniy Tagil respectively, for Karakalpakia this indicator is 52.58 +/- 0.52 percent. The absolute number of lymphocytes in subjects in Karakalpakia is also significantly reduced. The concentration of CD4[.sup]+[/]-lymphocytes among Karakalpakstan residents is 39.8 +/- 0.46 percent, while in the indicated cities (Semipalatinsk, Moscow, Nizhniy Tagil) it is 34.4 +/- 1.1, 45 +/- 0.7 and 35.81 +/-0.39 percent respectively. In this case the absolute number of CD4[.sup]+[/]-lymphocytes in Karakalpakstan residents averages only 498 cells/mm[.sup]3[/]. All of the indicated differences are statistically significant (p<0.001). An evaluation of the frequency of deviations of the percent and absolute concentrations of lymphocytes from average standard values in Karakalpakstan residents (Table 3) revealed that the lymphocyte count was less than 19 percent for 10.9 percent of the subjects, the indicator was above 37 percent for only 6.03 percent of the subjects, and the absolute lymphocyte count of 33 percent was less than 1,200 cells/mm[.sup]3[/]. There were an especially large number of people with an absolute concentration of CD1[.sup]+[/]- and CD4[.sup]+[/]-lymphocytes below standard indicators (53.2 and 64.6 percent respectively). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3.

The percentage of persons for whom the phagocytosis indicator was above standard values is 65.8 for Karakalpakstan residents (see tables 2, 3). Such an increase in phagocytic activity is possibly associated with a source of constant infection. Evaluation of the B-system of immunity in Karakalpakstan residents revealed a significantly higher concentration of IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE than in the residents of the cities used for comparison. Thus, while the concentration of IgG, IgA and IgM in residents of Semipalatinsk, Moscow and Nizhniy Tagil was 1337.4 +/- 21.8, 1313 +/- 27 and 1095.3 +/- 13.17 for IgG, 190.3 +/- 6.82, 215 +/- 9.1 and 220 +/- 5.7 for IgA, and 156.7 +/- 5.3, 140 +/- 5.1 and 144.4 +/- 4 for IgM, these indicators for Karakalpakstan residents were equal to 1497.6 +/- 17, 265.3 +/- 5.6 and 167.1 +/- 3.9 respectively. The percentage of people for whom these indicators were above normal was 1.14 for IgG, 17.8 for IgA and 12.9 for IgM (see Table 3). The percentage of persons with hypoglobulinemia did not differ from the union-wide value. Additional research characterizing activity of the immune system did not reveal gross disturbances, and the levels of the rheumatoid factor, antibodies to thyroglobulin and trinitrophenyl fluctuated within normal limits. The morbidity structure of the Karakalpakstan population is dominated by autoimmune diseases, which exceed union-wide indicators by 2-8 times, while the frequency of diseases falling within the infection syndrome exceeds the union-wide indicator by 2.5-4 times (see Table 1). When taken together, these figures are very similar to laboratory data and morbidity indicators obtained in surveys of elderly people [4]. It may be hypothesized that the residents of the indicated regions are exposed to unfavorable factors that lead to the described changes in immunological indicators, which manifests itself phenomenologically as early aging and as diseases associated with immunodeficiency. However, additional research will be required to establish a direct relationship between this morbidity and disturbance of the immune system. Conclusions 1. The relative and absolution numbers of T-lymphocytes and their subpopulations are reduced among residents of the Karakalpakstan Republic. 2. A higher concentration of serum IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE and higher phagocytic activity of leukocytes are typical of residents of the surveyed region. Bibliography 1. Alekseyev, L.
