In an open criticism of the education of legislators studying the draft bill on the National Defense Organic Law, the president said: "I think people with experience should comment on these kinds of issues, particularly military issues. But it is precisely those who have not completed the fourth grade or done their military service who want to comment." The head of state made these comments when asked about the position of legislators who support the idea of having an equal number of military and civilian representatives in the National Defense Council. The occasion was the celebration of the "Day of Military Justice" at the Diserjumil [Military Justice Service Directorate] premises in Itaugua. Rear Admiral Carlos Lopez Moreira agreed with Wasmosy, and pointed out that the executive bill essentially seeks "to avoid excessive bureaucracy." Lopez Moreira said the idea is to avoid having a gigantic National Defense Council that would be difficult to assemble. The admiral added that officers are not opposed to including "civilians" on the council, as some legislators want to make people believe. Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee members, who were scheduled to discuss the retirement of Armed Forces officers who want to run for president or other important positions, decided to postpone the discussion of the issue until 29 June, due to the absence today of the military representatives. According to a note remitted to Defense Committee President Sergio Lopez, the military representatives justified their absence "due to service reasons."
