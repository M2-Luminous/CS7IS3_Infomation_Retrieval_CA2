The appeal was contained in a statement issued in Tamale and signed by the northern regional president of the association, Mr. Mohammed Mumuni. The association pointed out that despite the recent directives of the task force commandant to the Konkomba warriors to gather at certain designated areas for the disarming process, they have flouted these orders and are still attacking and burning down villages. It cited the cases of Tabia and Sanye which were attacked and burned last week resulting in the loss of lives and damage to property. The association expressed concern about the alarming rate of displaced persons and appealed for more relief aid for them.
