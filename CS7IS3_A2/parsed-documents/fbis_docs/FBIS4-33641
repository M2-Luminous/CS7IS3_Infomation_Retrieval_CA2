These obstacles are inextricably intertwined since the provinces are unable to ease their situation, which is provoked by increased relative prices and the difficulties of marketing their products. The showcase was Tierra del Fuego Province, which has a flourishing economy under the protection of a moribund Industrial Promotion System. Difficulties arising from other causes, but with similar consequences are found throughout the country -- be it the other Patagonian provinces, the northwest, or the northeast. The country is haunted by the ghost of recession over setting the production machinery in motion. This recession could be staved off by strengthening the domestic market or by increasing exports. The former possibility seems, however, to have reached a point of counter-production, given the reiterated call to increase domestic savings. Hence, the only alternative is to increase our exports, although we are still trying to increase our productive capacity to a point where we can place our products on the international market at more competitive prices. The search for increased factory capacity is weighing heavily on the trade balance deficit, which is an ominous warning for the near future. The possibility of devaluing the peso has been totally ruled out. This move would cause hundreds of bankruptcies because the indebtedness of the private sector. Thus the exchange rate should be improved through a reduction of costs. The recent hike in public utility rates was not only instrumental in checking the trend toward reducing costs, it also helped to ease the May inflation above zero percent. The immediate move of economic authorities will be an all-out offensive to reduce labor costs and to restore the provincial administrations' economies. There are also plans to scare off the ghost of recession, which would undermine the basis of one of the most vital tools of the convertibility plan -- namely, the level of tax revenues. Housing development plans were designed to boost the construction industry, which is undoubtedly the driving force of the economy and which generates many new openings. The present international financial market is hampering the normal avenues into which investment projects are generally channeled and is obliging the government to devise a panoply of ideas to boost the construction industry. If the United States had not had the wonderful idea of betting on its growth and had decided against increasing interest rates to prevent an overheating of the country's inflation, the international situation would have continued favorable for Argentina. Yet, the Clinton administration bet on growth and consequently placed a question mark on the entry of foreign capital into Argentina based on the danger of a possible increase in domestic interest rates and consequently, a slowdown in Argentina's economic growth. Following the same line of reasoning, it would be of paramount importance for the government to signal that it will try to reduce its trade deficit as a way to obtain genuine foreign currency, and thus ease the scarcity of foreign financial resources. To conclude, several economists have warned of the risks that political needs may entail for the economy. Ricardo Lopez Murphy from the Radical Civic Union [UCR] believes the Constituent Assembly is the worst thing that could have befallen the Argentine economy. Lopez Murphy shares the views of Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. He utters things that, to some extent, may be interpreted as the expression of Cavallo's thinking. Cavallo is concerned about the outcome of the Constituent Assembly, the power to be vested in the coordination minister, and the concessions that may be granted to the provinces. The 1995 presidential elections are on the horizon, and it has already been warned that there might be an increase in government spending to attract votes to the ruling party. Nevertheless, the Economy Ministry is well aware that the Convertibility Plan was the most effective weapon in the last elections, and therefore, will avoid any possible chaos in public accounts. As another UCR economist -- former Central Bank President Jose Luis Machinea -- said: "The best social program the government can implement is to try to stave off recession." Machinea added that the only way the government can meet this objective is "by increasing exports by an average 15 percent per annum."
