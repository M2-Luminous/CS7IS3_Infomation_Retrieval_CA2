The former Transport Ministry official pointed out in an interview that the airport is in closer proximity to other Asian countries than Japan's busiest international airport at Narita near Tokyo. The airport has been built on a man-made island five kilometers off the Senshu District of Osaka Prefecture. Matsumoto, who assumed his post at the beginning of the month, predicted the airport will be a boon for those coming from local areas to make connections with international lines since it will also serve domestic lines. In contrast, the new Tokyo international airport, located east of Tokyo in Chiba Prefecture, has very few domestic lines so many passengers must commute the considerable distance between it and Tokyo's domestic airport at Haneda. Matsumoto, who has lengthy experience in promoting airplane safety measures, said the Kansai airport will be a "faultless" one when it comes to air safety. Matsumoto, 49, said the only thing that concerns him is the fact that side winds can reportedly be quite strong at times.
