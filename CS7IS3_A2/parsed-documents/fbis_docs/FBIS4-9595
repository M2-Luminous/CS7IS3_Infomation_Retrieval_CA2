Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "overnight, the Serbian aggressor concentrated the greatest amount of manpower and equipment since the beginning of the preparations for the resumption of the offensive on the free Brcko territory. Chetnik transport helicopters, flying at low altitudes, [words indistinct] flights on the Ovcari-Brcko route. An influx of an immense quantity of motorized [words indistinct] was also registered from the direction of Ovcari. Up until 2200 on the Ovcari-Brcko route, the movement of heavy transport and combat vehicles of the Serbian aggressor could be heard. Our reconnaissance scouts were unable to register [words indistinct] of chetnik reinforcements outside the Brcko area. The concentration of enemy armored- mechanized hardware was registered last night on the central part of the Brcko front, Cadjavac, and Bijelina Ravna. The temporarily occupied Brcko is full of chetniks; the town is literally overflowing with chetnik phalanxes, which are causing increasing problems even for the citizens of Serbian nationality. According to our reconnaissance sources, Brcko Serbs are afraid to leave their homes for fear that they might be robbed [words indistinct]." An unidentified correspondent reports on an extremely poor line that "chetnik activity in the 4th Corps theater of operations, or more precisely, on the Konjic and Bijelimic fronts [words indistinct]. In addition to antiaircraft machine gun and small arms fire at the defense lines and suburbs of Konjic, Karadzic's followers early this morning fiercely shelled the residential areas in Glavicine. At the time of filing this report, the offensive activity has decreased somewhat. There was no offensive activity of the Serbian-Montenegrin aggressor on the southern part of the front, while the separation lines between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] [words indistinct]. However, we must say that the implementation of the Washington Agreement in this area is progressing very slowly simply because the HVO still has not given up on its intention to divide Mostar." Gracanica correspondent Izudin Durakovic reports that "the aggressor continued provocations overnight, although mainly from a distance. Using 82-mm mortars from Besanj, 122-mm howitzers from Jajcevac, and tanks from Sjenina, the chetniks shelled Obric and Mujanov Mezar. They tried to use the shelling to infiltrate small subversion groups, which the defenders discovered in time. During the night, the chetniks carried on regrouping their manpower and hardware, which implies that they will today continue their offensive activity on the northern part of the Trebava [River] front."
