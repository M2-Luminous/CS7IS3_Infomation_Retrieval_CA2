FR940602-1-00111 FR940602-1-00014 EPA estimates that between zero and eight percent (0&hyph;13 facilities total) of the interim-status BIFs could incur a cost of doing a trial burn due to this proposed rule. The resulting annual national cost is $0 to $520,000. The low end of the affected facility universe is ``zero'' because, although submission of ``data in lieu of'' a trial burn is an option under current regulations for a facility with ``sufficiently similar'' units, it appears that facilities almost never exercise this option. EPA guidance on trial burns states that ``although it is possible to satisfy this requirement by submitting information showing that a trial burn is not required, this is a rare occurrence *␣*␣*.'' 2 Neither of the trial burn contractors that were contacted was aware of a successful ``data in lieu of'' application. Regional permit writers knew of a few permits that were granted based on the ``data in lieu of'' provision, but in those cases the units were determined to be identical and, therefore, would still qualify under today's proposal. Thus it is likely that the main effect of changing the ``data in lieu of'' provision will be to clarify already existing practices, and to reflect more realistic situations and how EPA currently interprets this provision. 2 Guidance on Setting Permit Conditions and Reporting Trial Burn Results. US EPA January 1989. The second permitting requirement that may result in a direct cost to the regulated community is the delineation of the process following a trial burn failure. Today's proposed rule proposes that, following a trial burn failure, (1) The combustion facility must immediately restrict operation for those conditions that failed the trial burn, and (2) the combustion facility must either revise the permit application to reflect the new conditions (estimated cost $5,100), or revise the trial burn plan and rerun the trial burn (estimated cost $110,000 to $550,000). EPA estimates that 4% of interim status combustion units (six facilities over the next twenty years) will fail a trial burn for one or more conditions. Of these, 17% (one facility) is expected to simply revise the permit application and 83% (five facilities) are expected to revise the trial burn plan and rerun the trial burn. Annualized over a ten year period, discounted at 7%, the resulting annualized national total cost of facility actions that follow a trial burn failure is $70,000 to $340,000. Although the above costs can be attributed to today's proposed rule, EPA does not expect there to be any true incremental costs. Currently, if an interim status facility fails a trial burn, the permitting authority can deny the permit. In addition, based on conversations with EPA Regional permit writers, no permit writer would grant a permit to a facility that failed the trial burn unless the facility re-ran (and passed) the trial burn or revised the permit conditions. Thus, the incremental cost of this proposed requirement, when current practices are taken into account, is $0. The main effect of the delineation of the process that follows trial burn failures would be to clarify current permitting requirements. In summary, the potential annualized total national cost for the permitting section of today's proposed rule is estimated to be $70,000 to $860,000. The annualized incremental cost, when current practices are taken into account, is estimated to be between $0 to $520,000. EPA expects that the main effect of the permitting provisions of today's proposed rule will be to clarify and codify current practice. b. Other effects. In addition to the costs estimated above, the requirement that interim status combustion facilities be subject to the performance standards of §264.342 (for incinerators) or §266.104 through §266.107 (for BIFs) upon completion of trial burn has the potential to impose costs due to the restricted operating conditions. However, despite the proposed restriction following trial burn failure, operations at the affected units are not expected to cease entirely, because the proposed restriction on operations pertains only to the condition(s) that fail to meet the specifications in the trial burn plan. The unit can continue operations under a modified design and/or operating conditions that are sufficient to allow the unit to function within the performance standards. In addition, the restriction lasts only until the trial burn plan is revised and a new trial burn occurs or the permit application is modified. Therefore, EPA does not expect this provision to significantly disrupt facility operation or impose significant additional costs. B. Summary of Benefits The RCRA permitting program was developed to protect human health and the environment from the risks posed by the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. By improving and clarifying the permitting process, today's proposed rule produces environmental benefits that result from a more efficient permitting process. Below is an explanation of how each of the provisions of today's rule provides benefits. 1. Expanded Public Involvement Opportunities The main benefit of the expanded public participation requirements of today's rule is to provide more opportunities for the public to become involved early in permitting decisions regarding hazardous waste storage, treatment, and disposal facilities that may ultimately affect their communities. EPA believes these requirements will allow applicants and permitting authorities the opportunity to address public concern in making decisions about the facility and the proposed permit. Providing the public with an expanded role in the permit process, by promoting community participation and input at all decision-making levels, also will help to foster continued community involvement after sites become permitted. In addition, expanding public involvement opportunities should streamline the permitting process, since public issues will be raised and addressed earlier in the process. Currently, the public does not formally get involved in the permitting process until the draft permit stage. This stage occurs after the permitting agency and the permit applicant have discussed crucial parts of the Part B application; thus, the public feels that most major decisions on the permit have already been made at this point. 2. Modification of the Permitting Process One benefit of the permitting provisions of today's rule is to clarify current practices and, therefore, facilitate the permitting process by making it easier to understand for the public and the regulated community.
