The two governments will hold a vice ministerial meeting on the matter in Washington on 24 May. In the meeting, the two nations will decide to incorporate in the agenda four additional areas of cooperation, including drug eradication and the establishment of a network to promote exchanges between institutes engaging in environmental protection studies. Although Japan-U.S. economic framework talks were suspended in such sectors as autos and macroeconomics following summit talks in February, the two governments have continued to discuss the issue of bilateral cooperation in the area of global issues. The Japanese Government hopes to seek ways to resume deadlocked trade talks in the sectoral and macroeconomics areas by confirming cooperative ties between Japan and the United States at the forthcoming meeting in the area of global issues. The framework talks consist of three main sections: macroeconomics (such as continuation of tax cuts), bilateral cooperation in solving global issues, and sectoral areas (such as government procurement, autos, and insurance). Although the recent summit talks failed to result in an agreement on macroeconomics and sectoral areas, the two governments have since kept contacts with each other through diplomatic channels. The two governments have decided to hold a third round of vice ministerial talks as scheduled because there are no points of conflict in the area of bilateral cooperation in solving global issues. The third round of talks will be attended by Deputy Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Hayashi and Deputy Vice Minister for Industrial and Trade Affairs Okamatsu from the Japanese Government, and Under Secretary of State Wirth as U.S. delegate. As for drug eradication measures, the vice ministers are scheduled to discuss the need to promote information exchange between Japan and the United States and how to help the Peruvian Government's efforts to transform opium-growing areas into more normal agricultural areas. Concerning establishment of a network between environment protection institutes, the two nations will proceed with a plan to set up a system of information exchange between European nations, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region as a measure to help prevent global warming. In addition, a "children and health" program designed to supply vaccines for developing countries and a "coral reef protection measure" will also be discussed as additional areas of cooperation. At the summit talks in February, the two governments agreed to cooperate in dealing with 15 global issues -- such as environmental protection, population, AIDS, the ocean, and transportation technology. Officials concerned with those issues from both governments will also attend the forthcoming meeting, and in the meeting the two nations will follow up the February agreement. As for economic framework talks in macroeconomics and sectoral areas, it is expected that unofficial vice ministerial negotiations will begin this week in hopes of finding ways to resume the talks. At the unofficial negotiations, the two nations are expected to exchange and coordinate views on how to define "objective criteria," which is a main cause of the failure of the summit talks in February.
