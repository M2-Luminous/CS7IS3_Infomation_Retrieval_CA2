The Indonesian President continued: `It is precisely the same aspiration to create a peaceful and prosperous region that serve as the bases of the struggle of the member-states of ASEAN. In this context, we are highly appreciative of Vietnam's participation as an observer and of its seriousness to establish cooperation in many areas with ASEAN. `Due to the our experience during more than a quarter of century and to the strong solidarity among ASEAN member-states, we have been able to preserve stability and security in Southeast Asia, even though the pattern of international relations is undergoing fundamental changes. ASEAN is trying its best to stress on the importance of settling a dispute through peaceful means. We can reduce the potential conflicts in our region by continuing to hold discussion aimed at enhancing mutual trust. Conversely, we have to see to it that these different potentials can be used as beneficial assets for our cooperation'... President Suharto went on: `I am sure the Vietnamese Government also sees the many opportunities that can still be developed through a close regional cooperation covering various aspects of the economic development. In this spirit, I am highly encouraged by the economic cooperation in various sectors that have been established so far. `However, I also believe that there are still many areas that we can work together. There are still opportunities available in the trade relation and cooperation, capital investment, financial services and other areas. `The basis of our economies are complementary. Our two respective governments attach great importance to the creation of a healthy business climate. Enterpreneurs in both countries are very eager to expand their economic scopes. All of this convinces me that Vietnam and Indonesia can develop cooperation as dependable and mutually beneficial economic partners. `The future close relationship between our two countries is further strengthened by the close bonds of friendship between both Vietnamese and Indonesian officials. Such close relationship and mutual trust are important in the efforts to impartially settle a number of issues affecting the bilateral relations between Vietnam and Indonesia. `As neighbouring countries that share the same historical affinities, I sincerely hope that we can conclude the ongoing negotiation in a satisfactory manner, particularly on the issues of the continental shelf boundary and repatriation of non-refugees. I am convinced that based on the good-intentions that have been demonstrated by both parties so far, we can achieve a satisfactory result'. In reply, President Le Duc Anh said that the Vietnamese people had forever borne in mind the Indonesian people's wholehearted support for their just struggle for national reunification. The Vietnamese leader continued: `At present the Vietnamese and Indonesian people have common desires to build Vietnam and Indonesia into prosperous countries, and Southeast Asia a region of peace, stability and cooperation. This is the firm basis to constantly consolidate and develop the time-honoured friendship and cooperation between the two countries, and made it become the everlasting friendship as stated by President Ho Chi Minh 35 years ago when he visited Indonesia'. After hailing the great achievement recorded by the Indonesian people in the past 25 years under the leadership of President Suharto, President Anh said: `In its capacity as president of the Non-aligned Movement, indonesia has made positive contributions to a Southeast Asia of peace and cooperation and to a stabler and more prosperous world. Indonesia thereby, has an increasingly important role to play in the region and the world. Vietnam strongly supports Indonesia's positive activities, and stands side by side the Indonesia for a long lasting peace and prosperity in the region'. [sentence as received] `We have always treasured and constantly strengthened the relations of friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation with countries in the region on the basis of bilateral and multilateral cooperation. We are satisfied at the fine development of the Vietnam-ASEAN cooperation. As observer in ASEAN, Vietnam is trying its best with support from all ASEAN member countries to early become full member of the organization. We hold that this conforms to the benefits of the two parties and to peace, stability, cooperation and development in the region'. `I believe that my visit to Indonesia would contribute to further promoting the friendship and all-sided cooperation between the two countries in the interests of the two nations and for the sake of peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity in Southeast Asia and the world as a whole', he concluded.
