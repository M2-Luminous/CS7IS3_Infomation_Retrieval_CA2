FBIS4-62727 "drsov096_i_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-096 Daily Report 17 May 1994 CENTRAL ASIA Kazakhstan Kazakh, Russian Special Services Sign Protocols Kazakh, Russian Special Services Sign Protocols LD1705121094 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 1101 GMT 17 May 94 LD1705121094 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Fyodor Ignatov] [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] 17 May TASS -- "The special services of Kazakhstan and Russia have never worked against each other, nor will they do it in the future," Director of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey Stepashin told a press conference here after signing several documents on cooperation between the special services of the two countries. Stepashin added that if Russia did not help set up counterintelligence services in the CIS countries, this would have been done by others. "The Russian Federation is least of all interested in this," Stepashin said. An agreement on cooperation and interaction between the former Russian Security Ministry and the Kazakh KGB was signed for the first time in March 1992. However, as it was noted during the press conference, no mechanism for its implementation was worked out and the important document remained paralysed. It was of a purely declarative nature. The protocols first signed in Moscow and now in Alma Ata [Almaty] give it concrete substance. The heads of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service and the Kazakh National Security Committee have signed protocols in Alma Ata [Almaty] on cooperation in combatting international terrorism, in ensuring the safety of civilian air traffic, in conducting economic counterintelligence operations and combatting smuggling, as well as protocols on joint actions to combat drug trafficking and corruption, to make effective use, in mutual interests, the operational and technical facilities of the radio-counterintelligence units and to ensure the security of special military and other international railway carriages. It was noted during the press conference that such broad cooperation was undertaken for the first time in the CIS countries. Replying to an ITAR-TASS question, Stepashin said that his current visit to Alma-Ata [Almaty] was planned in advance and was in no way linked with the signing in Dzhambyl on 12 May of the agreement on operational interaction between the special services of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. "Kazakhstan is an independent state and it decides itself whom to cooperate with," Stepashin added. This statement was confirmed by sat Tokpakbayev, chairman of the Kazakh National Security Committee. The special services of Kazakhstan, he noted, have established close contacts with their colleagues in the United States, Great Britain, France, FRG, and several other countries. They are constantly coordinating their actions to combat international terrorism. This work is not directed against any third country. Stepashin and Tokpakbayev made no bones of the fact that there were quite a few problems yet in the difficult work to coordinate the actions of the special services of their two countries, because it was quite a new area of cooperation. The heads of the special services of Russia and Kazakhstan are sure that all the problems, cropping up on their way, will be settled, because there is a mutual desire to do it.
