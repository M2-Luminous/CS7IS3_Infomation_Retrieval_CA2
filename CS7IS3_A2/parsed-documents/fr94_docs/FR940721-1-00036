FR940721-1-00036 FR940721-1-00011 ␣Acquisition of Investment Interests As set forth in §1001.952(a)(1)(ii), an ``interested'' investor (who is in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity) must obtain his or her investment interest through trading on a registered national securities exchange on terms equally available to the public. This does not mean that an interested investor may acquire his or her interest in any way other than the methods available to the general public to acquire investment interests. We believe that the investor must acquire his or her investment interest in the same way as members of the public_directly off of a registered national securities exchange through a broker_and it must be the same type of investment interest that is available to the public. For example, a transaction in which the interested investor receives restricted or ``lettered'' stock from the entity would not be considered a valid acquisition of investment interests under this requirement. The discussion above does not represent a change in this standard. Rather, it serves only to emphasize that the investment interest `` must be obtained on terms equally available to the public through trading on a registered national securities exchange *␣*␣*'' (§1001.952(a)(1)(ii)) (Emphasis added). Moreover, to obtain an investment interest ``on terms equally available to the public,'' there cannot be any side agreements that require stock to be purchased or that restrict in any manner the investor's ability to dispose of the stock. Any such agreement would constitute a sham transaction which would disqualify dividend payments to that investor from safe harbor protection. ␣Loans for the Purchase of the Investment Interest One of the standards in the large and small entity investment interest safe harbors prohibits the entity from loaning an investor funds that are used by the investor to purchase his or her investment interest. (See §§1001.952(a)(1)(iv) and 1001.952(a)(2)(vii).) We are proposing to change this standard to prohibit other investors, individuals or entities as well as the entity from making such loans. ␣Class of Investment Interests In the 60&hyph;40 investor rule in the small entity investment interest safe harbor (§1001.952(a)(2)(i)), we established two categories of investors: (1) ``untainted'' or ``disinterested'' investors are those who do no business with the entity, but hold the investment interest purely as an investment; and (2) ``tainted'' or ``interested'' investors are those who are in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity. For purposes of determining in which category to place an investor, we require ``each class of investments'' to meet the 60&hyph;40 apportionment between the two categories. We have become aware of the difficulty in applying the 60&hyph;40 rule to each class of investors in a joint venture where the general partners hold a separate class of stock or investment interest from the limited partners. In such a situation, that class of investment interest for the general partners consists of 100 percent ``tainted'' or ``interested'' investors since the general partners are providing services to the entity. Therefore, we believe that the entire joint venture does not qualify for safe harbor protection. While it is not always true that an active investor holds a different class of investment interest from a passive investor, we have found that it is unnecessarily restrictive to have this 60&hyph;40 investor rule only apply to each class of investment interest. Thus, we are proposing to modify this first investment interest standard to allow an alternative to the class-by-class analysis. The new alternative would allow equity investment interests to be combined together or debt investment interests to be combined together (separate from the equity investments) for purposes of apportioning investors into ``untainted'' and ``tainted'' pools and meeting the 60&hyph;40 test. Only equivalent classes of equity investment interests could be combined, and only equivalent classes of debt investment interests could be combined. That is, the classes of investment interests combined would have to be similar in all material respects. For example, the classes to be combined would have to have equivalent returns in proportion to amounts invested. In addition, if one class is given preferential treatment (e.g., in the case of disposition), such an interest could not be combined with subservient interests for purposes of compliance with the 60&hyph;40 investor rule.
