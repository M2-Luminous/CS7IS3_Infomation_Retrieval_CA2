In particular, he informed the session participants about the measures taken by the leadership of Ukraine in the field of nuclear disarmament and armaments control. Relevant decisions by the Supreme Council, the president, and the government convincingly testify to Ukraine's responsible attitude toward issues of the nonproliferation of mass annihilation weapons, and Ukraine's readiness to establish equal partnership relations with all countries to ensure universal peace and stability. Touching on the nuclear weapons nonproliferation issue, the Ukrainian representative told the participants in the forum that a relevant agreement on the implementation of the IAEA guarantees in relation to the nuclear materials used for peaceful nuclear activities in Ukraine was coordinated with that agency recently. In his speech Borys Tarasyuk paid special attention to the prospects of Ukraine's participation in multilateral undertakings to control the export of sensitive goods and technologies. In particular, he criticized the stand of the former Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] member states, which does not take into account Ukraine's proposal on its participation in the process of creating a new international regime of export control.
