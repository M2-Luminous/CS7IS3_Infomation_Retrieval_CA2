The foreign minister will visit Japan, India, and China. On 6 April, he will join Edouard Balladur in Beijing for a visit which is particularly significant because it is doubly symbolic. The prime minister's visit will take place within a few weeks of the 30th anniversary of the restoration of diplomatic relations between France and China by General de Gaulle. Following the normalization jointly agreed on in January, this visit will also confirm the end of the quarrel started by the sales of arms to Taiwan under the Socialist governments. [Lambroschini] You are starting a vast tour of Asia. Do you really think that France can play a role on a theater of operations which is so far removed from its natural sphere of influence, namely Europe? [Juppe] I think so. For several years, we have shown, if not indifference, then at least a degree of negligence toward some Asian countries. For instance, the last bilateral visit by a foreign minister to Japan and India date back to 1987. However, in this region, France can play a dual role. First, it must have an increased economic presence in the most dynamic area of the world. Employment in France also depends on Asia. Overall, our market share in the area is around 2 percent, in other words half that of Germany. Second, France must also play a political role. We have had a political dialogue with China for 30 years. I think that France can also add a dimension to its relations with Japan which is not exclusively commercial. Finally, it is important not to forget countries with smaller populations but in which we have a very longstanding tradition: I am thinking of the countries of former Indochina: Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. For this last country, France has played an essential role, in the UN framework, in the organization of elections which, after 25 years of war, have paved the way for peace. [Lambroschini] You are going to participate in Edouard Balladur's visit to China which will confirm the normalization of relations between Paris and Beijing. Now that the dispute created by the arms sales to Taiwan has been removed, what positive effects can France expect from China? [Juppe] The prime minister's visit will mainly be a political visit which falls within the framework of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations. When the government was formed last year, I noted that our relations with China were not good. We know what had cast a shadow over them: a number of arms sales to Taiwan. My objective was to reestablish the political relationship between France and China, because it is in our interest to do so. The aim was not to abandon our relations with Taiwan, but to return to a degree of restraint which had been forgotten. We have achieved that because, by common consent, we decided to restore warmer relations in January. That will be demonstrated by the prime minister's presence which, I repeat, has a primarily political dimension. Second, we hope that our economic relations will be developed in a whole series of sectors in which China needs cooperation -- telecommunications, transportation, aeronautics, urban development, energy, and so forth. [Lambroschini] But France's commercial lag cannot be explained only by the Taiwan affair. Do you not think that our businesses are more timid than the German or Italian competition? [Juppe] The deterioration in the political situation has played a role, but this is probably not the only explanation. Our businesses must also be encouraged to show more dynamism. Our trade deficit with China is 12 billion francs [Fr]. This is therefore a challenge to us. I think that if the French Government shows real determination, the industrialists are capable of mobilizing. With Singapore, we have a trade surplus of Fr2 billion. With Korea, our relations are balanced. [Lambroschini] In 1964, France was the first Western country to restore relations with Beijing. Why did French businesses not profit from this advantage? [Juppe] This advantage has been very useful. Even if Germany is doing twice as well, we already have a market share which is not negligible: It is at the same level as that of Britain. And yet, since 1964, we have perhaps rested too much on the idea that it was enough to have good political relations for trade to follow. China has changed. It has swung into a different system -- that of a market economy in which, aside from a few big contracts which are the result of a largely political choice, the decisionmaking process is much more decentralized. We must adapt our working methods to this new Chinese situation and encourage businesses to engage in direct dialogue. [Lambroschini] Is it not humiliating for France to note that there are double standards? The United States has also sold "offensive" weapons to Taiwan. And yet, the reprisals only affected France. [Juppe] I do not want to go back over that. We have opened a new chapter, let us not go back over it. But, you know, international relations are still based on power relationships. [Lambroschini] Having said that, the Chinese reacted very badly when U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher preached to them on human rights. [Juppe] France has absolutely no intention of turning a blind eye to the human rights problems in China. During Mr. Balladur's visit, we will speak clearly on this subject. When Mr. Christopher went to China, there was obviously great tension, but I would nonetheless like to point out that the aim of the visit was not to find out whether or not the United States would grant China most favored nation status. It already has it. The aim was simply to find out whether it was going to be called into question. Let us not have any complexes. We will say what we have to say. But we do not need any lessons in morality from anybody. [Lambroschini] How do you reconcile the defense of human rights and the preservation of economic interests? [Juppe] This is a problem which is not specifically Chinese. We have numerous commercial interlocutors and partners who are not irreproachable in terms of human rights. If I started to draw up the list, I do not know where I would stop. Our attitude is therefore very clear. We remain loyal to our principles, saying to our interlocutors that we are not satisfied with the existing situation. At the same time, we are defending France's interests. [Lambroschini] When you say that the prime minister's visit is primarily a political visit, what strategic impact can France have in this region? [Juppe] It is true that China may seem remote and that Europe's security is our main priority. But we have reasons for affinity with China. Our two countries are permanent members of the Security Council. This responsibility often leads us to compare our views and sometimes to coordinate them. Second, France and China are nuclear powers, and sometimes have the same kinds of concerns. A political dialogue between our countries is therefore useful. I would like to add that we are interested in the stability of the whole region because France is a world power. I cannot neglect this area in which it has cultural and historical interests. The fact that Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos are envisaging joining ASEAN shows quite clearly that we stand to gain from having a presence and having dialogue with China. [Lambroschini] Do you see China as a stabilizing factor in the region? Or do you think that this new economic power will necessarily become a military power which could be tempted by hegemony? [Juppe] China is already a power. The fact that this area is not protected from strong tensions is perfectly clear. There are often clashes in relations between China and Japan. Moreover, we must not disregard North Korea and the danger which its rejection of the nonproliferation rules could present for the region, particularly South Korea. For the time being, I see China as a factor of stability. At all events, it must be encouraged to move in this direction. [Lambroschini] What do you hope that your visit to Tokyo will achieve? A reduction in the enormous trade deficit between Japan and France? [Juppe] This is our main trade deficit, on the order of Fr23 billion. We must clearly not resign ourselves to this situation. A few spectacular successes show that French businesses can penetrate the Japanese market. And not only the big ones or the luxury industries. There are also successes for small- and medium-sized businesses. Through a system of information and support for our companies, we hope to extend this trend. I also note that, for three years, our trade balance with Japan has been improving. [Lambroschini] But Japan must make parallel efforts. The authorities are doing nothing to encourage the entry of foreign products. Do you think that you will be heeded this time? [Juppe] I am not sure that a visit is enough to ensure that you are heeded. But, in the future, we will also be able to use the instruments created within the framework of the Uruguay Round negotiations, especially the World Trade Organization [WTO]. We must ensure that the rules of the game are more clearly defined in a number of fundamental spheres. [Lambroschini] Japan is agreeing to import rice because the national harvest has been bad. But a campaign of denigration was immediately started: "This rice tastes bad or has weevils." The same blocking technique was formerly used against our cheeses. How can the creation of the WTO, to take over from GATT, persuade the Japanese to import more? [Juppe] The Japanese tenacity is well-known. For years, the Americans have been thrown off course by it. That is no reason to give up. These practices are unfair, they are not in accordance with the philosophy of GATT. We will therefore take advantage of this new international body which contains a procedure for the prevention and settlement of trade conflicts. If that does not suffice, it would be useful for the European Union [EU] to equip itself with equivalent retaliation methods. In the international sphere, only the language of power is understood. [Lambroschini] But the EU has a great weakness. In reality, Japan is facing 12 countries which are competing with each other. [Juppe] Theoretically that is not the case, because, with regard to international trade issues, the EU is united. But the facts are there. Japan has political superiority: It is easier to negotiate when you are expressing the viewpoint of just one government than when you are expressing the viewpoint of 12 states. In addition, it must be admitted that, culturally, Japanese society agrees to make sacrifices to protect itself. Domestic prices are very high: This makes it possible to find flexible export margins. Some of the Twelve are almost allergic to regarding the EU as an entity. For many of our partners, this Union is merely a market. For us, it must be a power. It is a market which must have the capacity to organize and defend itself. [Lambroschini] Paradoxically, France and Japan are in the same camp opposite the United States which, despite the recent GATT agreement establishing the foundations of the WTO, is again using the reprisals of the 301 provision against Tokyo. [Juppe] We have vigorously condemned this practice which is contrary to the spirit of the WTO. Even if, legally, this WTO does not yet exist. You are aware of the battle which the Twelve fought to improve the instruments of EU commercial policy. The decision was made on 15 December, but experience shows that having the documents is not enough, you also have to have the will. However, I am not sure that it still exists among the European officials of this sector. [Lambroschini] In the strategic sphere, the impression is that Japan feels more confident. Do you see this increase in power as a stabilizing factor in Asia or, instead, as a danger? [Juppe] I do not want to give an evasive answer, but it may be both. It is an illusion to imagine that a country which has this economic power can remain a political dwarf. There is a logic in the lives of nations and states. This logic and this desire for power must be channeled in the right direction. That is why the political dialogue with Japan strikes me as so important. [Lambroschini] Do you think that Japan might one day be tempted by the acquisition of nuclear weapons? After all, it has neighbors who have the bomb -- China and India -- and another, North Korea, which dreams of having it. [Juppe] Japan has given constitutional pledges and I see no reason to think that it is tempted to change its line. Moreover, the aim of French diplomacy is nonproliferation. And this is also something which we must express clearly to our Japanese interlocutors. In Tokyo, I will explain why we have such a firm attitude on the question of North Korea. For us, the fact that this country has withdrawn from the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and that it refuses to keep its promises to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is unacceptable. [Lambroschini] Are you in favor of Japan joining the Security Council as a permanent member? [Juppe] This is not 1945. We must take account of the new situation in the world. We have no objections in principle to Japan joining the Security Council, but we would add two or three considerations. The first is that being a Security Council member does not only give you rights. It also implies duties and obligations. In particular, participating in peacekeeping operations. Japan has already agreed to that with its involvement in Cambodia. The second consideration is that there are regional balances to be respected. If Japan and Germany join, it is obvious that the big countries of the south, even if they are less economically developed, also have a reason to join. [Lambroschini] Is political cooperation between France and Japan limited to the nuclear problem and the United Nations? [Juppe] Not at all. For instance, with regard to Third World aid, I think that we need to create a synergy. France is one of the few countries in the world to reaffirm that development aid must remain a priority. At the last G-7 summit, it was Japan which, with France, was the country which was most receptive to this idea of an additional effort for Africa. [Lambroschini] For a long time Japan has been told: Pay and shut up. But should we not expect problems when Japan wants a say? [Juppe] That is precisely what I mean by political dialogue. That consists of saying: Let us talk and pay, each according to our abilities. [Lambroschini] You are also going to Delhi. Do you hope to develop relations between France and India, which are still limited? At a time when that huge country is starting on the path to economic liberalization, France is only India's eighth biggest commercial partner. [Juppe] Our relations with India are inadequate. In the economic sphere, we have some difficult disputes which are not encouraging our businesses. They must be settled. There is the dispute over the construction of the HBJ [expansion unknown] gas pipeline or the problems connected with the construction of the Dulmasti dam in Kashmir. It is not easy to find a solution, but we must make an active effort to do so, because we stand to gain from developing our bilateral relations. Mr. Rao, the current prime minister, has undertaken a policy of economic modernization which is producing good results. The 200 or 300 million inhabitants who have already entered the consumer society represent a very big market. [Lambroschini] It is said that the Chinese market is commercially more exciting but that the Indian market is less dangerous politically. [Juppe] In all cases you have to take risks and show perseverance. It is true that our commercial relations with India are balanced, whereas we have a Fr12-billion deficit with China. Our market share in India is larger than the one we have in China. [Lambroschini] Like China, India is experiencing great tensions: religious, ethnic, and social. How do you view the dialectic between this economic growth which is taking shape and the archaism of some of India's structures? [Juppe] With modesty... It is not for France to try to outline social development in such a huge and complex country with such strong cultural traditions. Our role is to tell India that we are ready to work with it. I think that we have something to contribute here too. The preferential dialogue between Moscow and Delhi is no longer what it was, because one of the partners -- the former USSR -- has changed profoundly. That gives us a window of opportunity which we must use.
