"The purpose of our organization is to mobilize the knowledge and resources of the US private sector for assisting reforms in Central Europe," says Maureen Kiser, official representative of the Citizens Democracy Corps (CDC) in Moscow. "We are working on the assumption that the transition to the market implies not only reforms at the macro-level, but also day-to-day work at the level of enterprises, public organizations and municipal services." The Citizens Democracy Corps is an American noncommercial, nongovernmental organization whose Executive Committee includes former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former US Ambassador in Russia Robert Strauss, many prominent Congressmen, industrialists and scientists. It is financed by the state-owned US Agency of International Development (USAID) which has allotted 2.2 million dollars for the Corps' programmes. These programmes envisage the extension of aid by highly skilled consultants from the USA. A distinctive feature of the CDC program is that it envisages the extension of aid in the shape of business advice on a pro bono basis. The Corps' staff members identify what specialists are needed for a particular enterprise and undertake all subsequent work to complete the Russian applications. They find specialists in the USA and pay the cost of air tickets. Customers must only offer local transportation, provide housing and an interpreter. One more feature of the programme is its volunteers. They are Americans who desire to share their time and knowledge with those who could utilize it in Russia. The work of the Citizens Democracy Corps is carried out on the basis of two main programmes. The first -- Business Entrepreneur -- is geared to small and medium-size businesses. "We do not impose our model, but explain things which are the abc's of any successful entrepreneurship making it possible to bring out competitive products," says Robert C. Jacoby, director of the Business Entrepreneur program in Moscow. The second programme -- Citizens Volunteer Program -- focuses on strengthening the economic basis of public and private democratic institutions. This programme is used to render assistance to local authorities in areas such as local economic development and institution supporting privatization. The selection of Russian customers is highly competitive. "For the time being we select a mere 10 percent of the total number of applications, counting on promising enterprises which seriously desire to reach out to the world market," says Robert C. Jacoby about his programme. What requirements must an enterprise meet? The number of its employees vary from 50 to 1,500, the enterprise must have been privatized or be in the process of privatization, with priority being given to producer enterprises. Besides, the leadership of the enterprise must be receptive to new ideas. At present and in the next few months the Business Entrepreneur program will be carried out the most actively in Moscow, the Moscow Region and Samara. The Citizens Democracy Corps has been active in Russia since July 1992. Here are but a few examples of its cooperation with Russian partners.
