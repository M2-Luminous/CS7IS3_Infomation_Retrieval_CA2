The declaration says: It is high time to say that the nations in this area must no longer destroy each other and that such action aginst the life, rights, freedom and dignity of other nations is predominantly directed against one's own nation, against one's own grandfathers, fathers, sons and grandsons. It is high time one understood that it is only a peaceful and just solution of all conflicts and misunderstandings present in relations between nations in this area that can bring real happiness to people; their future will be salvaged only when we offer each other the possibility of living as we are accustomed and as our ancestors used to. It is time for us to recall that the present tragic conflict in the Balkans is a sin against every religion, because it is in no way compatible with any religious principles whatsoever. Taking advantage of religion for the sake of justifying hostility and divisions is an immoral and unlawful act. True believing Christians and true believing Muslims are striving toward peace. This is their genuine desire and this is also in conformity with the Creator's commandments. And what can we do, we who believe in the one God? We should and must pray and work and keep on believing that our prayers will be answered. We are also appealing to everyone in the world who believes in God to join us in our prayers for peace, and all those responsible for political decisions to re-examine their conscience before God and history. What will prevail and how can peace be attained? May the Lord bestow peace, progress, wealth, and success in the pursuit of righteousness on all those divided today by deadly animosities.
