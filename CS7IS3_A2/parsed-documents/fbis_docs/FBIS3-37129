The Abkhazian permanent representative to Moscow, Igor Akhba, who also took part in the consultations and the head of the Georgian experts' group, Irakly Machavariani, told Interfax that the joint jurisdiction was supposed to include issues related to foreign policy and trade, customs service and border guards, human rights protection, the energy sector, transportation and the credit and financial systems. The two sides decided not to speculate on the question as to whether Abkhazia will remain part of Georgia or not, but to solve specific issues. Both Akhba and Machavariani consider this as a constructive side of the dialogue. The Georgian expert even noted that he had not expected such progress. At the same time, neither of the sides retreated from its positions. The Abkhazian delegation supports the republic's independence from Georgia, equal relations, and does not rule out the possibility of creating a confederation of the two states. On the contrary, the Georgian side insists on preserving Georgia as a single state embracing Abkhazia. Machavariani said that the head of the experts' group, UN representative and professor at the University of Geneva Giorgio Malinverni, will prepare a report on the results of the consultations for the third round of the Georgian-Abkhazian talks in Geneva scheduled for February 22. Malinverni asked both sides to prepare their proposals as to which powers they wanted to delegate to the joint power body.
