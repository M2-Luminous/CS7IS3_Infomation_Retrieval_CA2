"Important changes have been made at the Defense Ministry and Interior Ministry where our major concern was to appoint civilians just as the old democracies do... Of course, we have thought also to the stability and credibility of these institutions... The appointment of a civilian to head the National Defense Ministry was also meant to shelter the Armed Forces from political infringements and ungrounded allegations. The Armed Forces must remain our main national support, the major trustee of Romania's territorial integrity," said the Romanian premier. "The appointment of a civilian as defense minister was not imposed to us from outside... The council of Europe recommended it, they did not obligate us to do it... We have followed the practice in the majority of the democratic countries which have civilians as defense ministers. "The new minister of the interior, a lawyer, will monitor closely the enforcement of the law and, not the least to mention, will speed-up the pace of the reform of the Interior Ministry departments... This move has been thought of also in point of the fight against corruption. We hope that the finalisation of the reform of the justice would mean another step forward in the fight against this plague," said Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu.
