At the end of the discussion, the meeting adopted a statement opposing "macroeconomic numerical targets" designed to gauge the degree of market opening by sector in goods and services. The statement cites two reasons for opposing macroeconomic numerical targets, saying: 1) The Japanese Government is not in a position to meet such macroeconomic numerical targets; and 2) if Japan agrees with the United States on setting numerical values or anything like them, the United States will force Japan to meet the numerical values in accordance with the trade act; and such a trade arrangement could lead both Japan and the United States to pursue managed trade. The statement also calls on the governments to "deal constructively with trade issues between the two countries." With the Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for 11 February, negotiations on such sectors as automobiles, auto parts, insurance, and government procurement are in the final stage, and Keidanren has compiled the statement in response to the situation. The statement warns against setting numerical targets by sector, claiming: "Intergovernmental negotiations must be confined to sectors for which the governments of the two nations are responsible and if the intergovernmental negotiations go beyond those sectors, this will invite the administration's intervention in the business activities of private enterprises and run counter to deregulation." The statement also points out that the European Union (EU) is showing an interest in managed trade after learning about it from Japan and the United States. As an example of self-indulgence [hitoriaruki] in numerical targets, the statement cites semiconductors and laments that although the Japanese government is not supposed to commit itself to the import ratio of foreign-manufactured goods, it has done so and the commitment has forced Japanese enterprises to "meet" the import ratio by quarter. As for the level of Japanese market access for foreign goods, the United States, which has thus far asked Japan for a specific numerical share, is now asking for a level equivalent to that of European nations and the United States. Commenting on the turnaround in the U.S. trade demand, the statement refutes it, saying: "The supply-demand structure varies from country to country and the U.S. trade demand is unreasonable. The ratio of government procurement in aircraft, farm produce, communications gears, and medical instruments is higher in Japan than in European nations and the United States."
