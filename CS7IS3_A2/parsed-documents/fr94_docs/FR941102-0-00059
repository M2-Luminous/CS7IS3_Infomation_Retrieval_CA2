FR941102-0-00059 FR941102-0-00013 40 CFR Part 180 [PP 9F3811/R2082; FRL&hyph;4916&hyph;9] RIN 2070&hyph;AB78 Pesticide Tolerances for Myclobutanil AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document extends the time-limited tolerances for residues of the fungicide myclobutanil and certain of its metabolites in or on the raw agricultural commodities cherries (sweet and sour), nectarines, and peaches until April 1, 1995. This extension will allow EPA adequate time to evaluate studies conducted by Rohm & Haas Co. required to support permanent tolerances for this chemical in or on these commodities. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written objections and hearing requests, identified by the document control number, [PP 9F3811/R2082], may be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (1900), Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. M3708, 401 M St., SW., Washington DC 20460. A copy of any objections and hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be identified by the document control number and submitted to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice, published in the Federal Register of January 9, 1990 (55 FR 779), which announced that the Rohm & Haas Co. of Independence Mall West, Philadelphia, PA 19105, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 9F3811 to EPA proposing to establish tolerances under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a) for the fungicide myclobutanil ( alpha -butyl- alpha -(3-hydroxybutyl)-1 H -1,2,4-triazole-1-propanenitrile) and both the free and bound forms of its metabolite alpha -(3-hydroxybutyl)- alpha -(4-chlorophenyl)-1 H -1,2,4-triazole-1-propanenitrile in or on stone fruits group (except cherry) at 2.0 parts per million (ppm) and cherry at 5.0 ppm. Subsequently, Rohm & Haas amended the petition by deleting the request for the stone fruit group and requesting tolerances for peaches and nectarines at 2.0 ppm and cherries (sweet and sour) at 5.0 ppm. Additionally, the Agency requested that Rohm & Haas amend the petition by proposing a tolerance of 4.0 ppm in/on cherries. The petition was amended by requesting that the tolerance for cherries be reduced to 4.0 ppm. In the Federal Register of February 5, 1992 (57 FR 4368), EPA established tolerances, on an interim basis, in 40 CFR 180.443 for residues of this chemical in or on the raw agricultural commodities cherries (sweet and sour), nectarines, and peaches. An expiration date of October 1, 1994, was imposed for the tolerances. The interim tolerances were established based upon the condition that data be submitted to the Agency to fully support permanent tolerances for these commodities. The conditions imposed by the establishment of the interim tolerances were that the chronic/oncogenicity feeding studies in the mouse and the rat be repeated. Both studies need to be repeated because a maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) had not been achieved. However, no preneoplastic lesions were observed in either study to suggest possible carcinogenic activity, and myclobutanil did not induce either genotoxic effects or chromosomal aberrations in a series of mutagenicity tests. In addition, no strong structural activity correlation to other carcinogens has been found. Under these circumstances, EPA concluded that no significant carcinogenic risk was posed by these tolerances for the timeframe involved in receiving and reviewing the repeated studies. The Agency evaluated dietary exposure to the fungicide residues for the commodities which have established permanent or interim tolerances. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) based on the 2-year rat chronic feeding study (NOEL of 2.49 mg/kg body weight/ day), using a hundredfold uncertainty factor, was calculated to be 0.025 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from previously established tolerances and interim tolerances is 0.002217 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 8.865 percent of the ADI. The data submitted in support of the tolerances and other relevant material have been reviewed. The toxicological data considered in support of these tolerances are discussed in detail in the document establishing the interim tolerances which was published in the Federal Register of February 5, 1992 (57 FR 4369). Based upon the above dietary risk estimate, the Agency believes that an extension of the interim tolerances would not pose a significant public health risk for the period of time indicated and would allow the Agency sufficient time to review the final reports on all the required data. EPA does not expect that the required data will significantly change the above risk estimate. On the basis of the available studies on myclobutanil, the Agency has concluded that the human risk posed by the use of myclobutanil on cherries, nectarines, and peaches does not raise significant concerns. The Agency has determined that extending the tolerances will protect the human health. Therefore, as set forth below, the tolerances are extended to April 1, 1995. Based upon the reviews of the rat and mouse oncogenicity studies, the Agency will determine whether establishing permanent tolerances is appropriate. Residues remaining in or on the above raw agricultural commodities after expiration of these tolerances will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term, and in accordance with, provisions of the conditional registrations. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections to the regulation and may also request a hearing on those objections. Objections and hearing requests must be filed with the Hearing Clerk at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issues(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
