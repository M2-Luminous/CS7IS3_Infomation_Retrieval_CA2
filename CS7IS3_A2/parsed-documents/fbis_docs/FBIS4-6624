The association said the highest figure in the 10-year period was 8.04 million tons in fiscal 1989. The increase for fiscal 1993, which ended March 31, 1994, was chiefly due to more orders for bulk ships, which recovered to a 3.3 percent growth from fiscal 1991 levels after a sharp drop in orders in fiscal 1992 because of the world recession, an association official said. The contracts included 125 bulk ships of 3.75 million tons and 21 tankers of 2.11 million tons, it said.
