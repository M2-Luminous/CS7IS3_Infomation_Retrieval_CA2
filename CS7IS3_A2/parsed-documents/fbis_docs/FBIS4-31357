Mihail: "Concerted Fire Upon the Leu"] [Text] Owing to the fallacious economic-financial policy conducted over the past four years, currently, and in the near future, the leu is under the pressure of a mass of over 10 trillion lei. This inflationist mass has been caused by the 1993 budget deficit which exceeded 800 billion lei to which the budget deficit of 1994 may be added, programmed to rise to almost 1.9 trillion lei. The same kind of inflationist money is represented by the over 350 billion lei's worth of nonperforming loans granted over 1990 that was transferred to the public debt. That was another antireform measure intended to further weakened the leu in an attempt to continue to protect the state-owned economic sector. The leu is also under the pressure of the major part of the 4 trillion lei worth of loans which have been granted to state-owned companies. These companies have their hands full trying to buy raw materials and pay for the energy, fuel, salaries, and so on, while the money they earn by selling their products is totally insufficient to pay back the loans. Aside from this, a part of those loans was and still is used to manufacture goods that are sold at a loss or remain unsold, on stocks. This is a genuine cemetery of loans that paralyzes economic activity, because the banks are unable to regain and reuse that money. The recommendation recently made in Bucharest by the head of the IMF delegation to reroute a part of the loans currently held by the state-owned sector to private companies may be followed only if a significant number of state-owned companies are closed, an inconceivable thing for the executive. Another thing that is exerting pressure upon the leu is the continuation of the production for stocks, which is proved by the fact that over the first four months of 1994 the stocks of unsold goods have increased by 10 percent. Arrears (unpaid investments and debts among companies) worth about 2.8 trillion lei may be added to all this as buried money that has been taken out of the monetary circuit, which is a direct source of inflation. The salaries paid by state-owned companies, which lack the necessary financial resources to do so, also belong to the category of inflationist money. Furthermore, pressure is being exerted upon the leu also by the hard currency amount of about $800 million currently existing throughout the country (for which lei were spent) and which is hoarded up in the country or abroad by the companies that fear that the leu will further devaluate or that their money would be confiscated. A total mass of 10 trillion lei is thus putting the fragile leu under a tremendous pressure. As a matter of fact, the inflation rate of almost 230 percent registered in 1993, which was 4 to 5 times higher than expected, fully attests the inflationist monetary mass currently existing in the country. Parallel to all the aforementioned direct and immediate factors, our national currency is submitted to a latent and long-time erosion by the fact that poor quality products at exaggerated prices are still being produced (shoes, clothes, cosmetics, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, soft drinks, radio and color television sets, and so on) that are surpassed by similar foreign-made products. The same goes for the extremely expensive and totally unsatisfactory quality of the services. A special pressure is exerted upon the leu by the high costs of energy, heating, telephone, and so on, which, together with the high food prices, exhaust the incomes of the large majority of the population and prevents it from buying non-edible products. A similarly great pressure is exerted upon the leu by the avalanche of taxes, fees, the taxing of taxes, interests, commercial taxes, and so on, which artificially increase the price of products and services, at the same time also hindering economic activity. The accentuation of the polarization of money and assets, as a consequence of the economic blockage, turns a great number of workers, public servants, pensioners, and so on, into an immense mass of non-consumers of non-edible products. The leu is also under the pressure exerted by the tremendous financial effort made to reimburse the due installments and the interests for the loans taken from abroad. The fact that the Romanian National Bank has been buying dollars for that purpose has a double inflationist effect, first because it is paying over 1,600 lei for $1, and second because thus it deprives the companies of the hard currency assets they would need for imports so that they can produce for export. Such being the objective terms of our current economic-financial situation, the optimistic assessments made on the occasion of the signing of the accord with the IMF with respect to the efficiency of the measures intended to achieve economic restructuring and the boosting of privatization, including the measures to improve the tax and the banking system, lack any real basis. Our industrial potential, which has not been re-equipped over the past 20 years and which was further destroyed and submitted to decay over the past four years, cannot be mended within a few months. Promises made regarding the recovery of economy and the increase of our standard of living over the second half of 1994 lack any grounds. In 1994 the Romanian economy needs about $7-8 billion for the import of the absolutely necessary quantities of energy, fuel, raw materials, equipment, and staple foodstuffs, as well as for the reimbursement of foreign loans and the payment of the interest. The Romanian economy is unable to produce that much. One feels powerless and bitter thinking that countries such as Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, South Korea, and so on, achieve exports worth $7-8 billion within only a few weeks! Whereas we are running about asking to be lent a few hundred million dollars, which momentarily eases our situation, but, in the long run, will be a new burden. In this context it seems at least strange the way in which the executive appreciates the new foreign loans we have been granted, while actually that money will make the situation even more difficult because our foreign debt will increase by about $1 billion. On the other hand, we will be unable to comply with the objective criteria imposed by the IMF and the World Bank, namely the growth of the gross industrial product, the freezing of the state budget deficit at the established level, the observation of the established inflation rate limit and that of the total amount of money handed out as loans, the substantial reduction of arrears, and the diminishing of the deficit of the foreign trade balance of payments by making exports supersede imports and not by taking further foreign loans, as is being currently done. The fact that we become indebted and have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in order to partially better the balance of foreign payments, that is, to refund other debts and to consolidate the hard currency reserves of the country, is actually a failure, rather than a success. After almost four years of great phrases about economic reform, today, everyone realizes that all these things cannot be achieved unless large-size state industry is privatized and unless foreign capital is attracted to re-equip our economy and make large-scale investments. The re-equipment of the industry alone would cost more than $20 billion. This requires a radical change in the current conceptions and legislation. Because no one wants to buy the assets held by the large state companies, which currently are assessed to be worth over 20 trillion lei, a value that with each new appraisal will continue to grow on paper, but not in reality. Besides this, great Western companies will never invest in Romania under the circumstances of the aggressive devaluation of the leu and the current regulations guaranteeing the security of the investment, land property, the recuperation of the investments in hard currency, and the duration of the recuperation. However, the current authorities (the parliament, the presidency, and the executive) finds such radical changes inconceivable. Those authorities are also doing everything they can to block private initiative and property and to maintain and strengthen state property and the involvement of the state in the economy. That is why reform is not progressing at all, as the current authorities are unable to implement privatization and to achieve the restructuring of the economy, which are key elements of the reform. The [IMF] memorandum will appear in front of our eyes more like a mirage, because each day we are getting farther away from it, despite all the optimistic statements made by the executive. The principal obstacle hindering the recovery of our economy is the lack of capital, and this problem will persist, because as long as there are no other cheap resources available, and depositors are paid 100-percent interest, our commercial banks will be unable to cut down the interest rates of the loans they grant, unless they are prepared to run the risk of losing their capital. Prices will continue to grow, inflation will increase, and the leu will not recover. Over the future months, they will partially or totally close down a great number of industrial units, as it will become impossible to provide them with energy, fuel, raw materials, and so on, because neither further subsidies from the state budget, nor further bank loans will be available for them. Even the companies that still have money and raw materials will be unable to sell their products for want of purchasers. The number of the unemployed will grow and the amount handed out to them as allowances will become merely symbolic. Owing to the lack of capital and clients and suffocated by high taxes, fees, and interest rates, numerous privately owned companies will cease activity. All layers of the population will be affected, both the employees working in the state or private sectors and the ones working in the state administration, education, health, culture, and so on. Owing to lack of resources, it will become impossible to merely partially index salaries and pensions, as used to be done until now. The year of 1994 will doubtlessly be the most difficult one of the transition period, with large-scale social convulsions caused by the accentuation of the economic crisis and general pauperization. All this will happen regardless of who holds power, as there are no short-term solutions to make the national economy and currency recover. The blocking of the reform costs and will continue to cost a great deal.
