He was speaking as Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd began a two-day visit to central Bosnia, as part of consultations on whether British troops should continue to serve with UN forces there. He stressed there was no question of Britain pulling out unilaterally or withdrawing during "these winter months". His comments came as protracted talks to try to end the fighting remained deadlocked. Mr Rifkind told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There is no question of us pulling out during these winter months. There is a job to be done ... and that is going to take a little bit longer at the very least. "Secondly, I don't think there is any likelihood of Britain pulling out unilaterally. "What we are talking about is whether the United Nations as a whole should continue to be in Bosnia, whether the time might come at some stage when it no longer can carry out its mandate. "That's not just a matter for the United Kingdom. France, Spain, Canada and a number of other countries are all having exactly this debate at the present time." Britain and France currently provide the thrust of the UN military operation which protects aid convoys to treacherous parts of Bosnia. Mr Hurd, following the main supply route running through the British bases at Tomislavgrad, Gornji Vakuf and finally Vitez, the location of the First Battalion Coldstream Guards, will speak to officers from the battalion group before moving on to the UN headquarters for Bosnia in Kiseljak tomorrow. Mr Rifkind, pressed whether it was unlikely that British troops would still be serving in Bosnia in the spring, indicated that this was too early a time for withdrawal. "`Come the spring' I think is fairly early, we are not far from the spring. "I think the important point first of all is to see this winter through." But if by the spring or early summer there was no prospect of a peace settlement "then it does have to be addressed as to whether the UN presence is making a material contribution to ending this ghastly war." Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said a unilateral British withdrawal would be "wholly unreasonable". But Tory MP Peter Viggers said the humanitarian mission was grinding to a halt and it was time to pull out the troops. The Gosport MP and Commons Defence Select Committee member told the Today programme: "We are coming to a time of decision. I fear that decision must be to withdraw the troops." Meanwhile, peace mediator Lord Owen was struggling to retain credibility after an embarrassing vote of no confidence from disgruntled Euro MPs in Strasbourg. The 106-95 vote showed their determination to express dissatisfaction at Lord Owen's failure to find a breakthrough after almost two years of bloody conflict.
