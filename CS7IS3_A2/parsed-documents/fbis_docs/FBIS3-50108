"This will have far-reaching consequences, because it is clear now that it is the Muslim side which does not want peace. The formal justification for the sanctions was the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thus, the sanctions can no longer remain in place, because the Serb side has demonstrated the maximum degree of cooperation and its wish to achieve peace," Krajisnik stressed. [passage omitted]
