The government's decisions to date justify a supposition that this kind of authorization will indeed be formulated for the prime minister, said Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's chief diplomat, during Monday's [31 January] press conference at the Office of the Council of Ministers. Olechowski stated he will submit a motion to the government requesting that it approve a resolution authorizing the prime minister to sign the document. Observers deem the Council of Ministers' acceptance as virtually certain, although, as is widely known, Poland has reservations with regard to "Partnership for Peace" because it says the program provides no guarantees for future membership of our country in the Western alliance. In a separate conversation with RZECZPOSPOLITA, Jerzy Milewski, who is chief of the National Security Bureau and first deputy defense minister, said he believes the Council of Ministers will give the prime minister a "green light" enabling him to sign a so-called document of principles, in which the West outlined the main principles of the "Partnership" and which contains an invitation to take part in the program. Specific issues regarding NATO-Poland cooperation will be worked out during consultations which are to begin shortly. Both "Partnership for Peace" and general relations with NATO are scheduled to be one of the main topics discussed during the prime minister's visit to Brussels, as well as during a meeting with the new first deputy secretary general of NATO, Sergio Silvio Balanzino of Italy (Manfred Woerner is seriously ill). During the second day of the visit (3 February), Waldemar Pawlak will present a lecture at a conference organized by the Washington-based Strategic and International Research Center. The topic of the lecture will be the security of Poland and Europe in general. The prime minister will also be a guest of Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski. Regardless of the prime minister's participation, some personalities from Polish political life are also scheduled to take part in the Brussels conference--for instance, Professor Bronislaw Geremek. Polish National Bank Chairwoman Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz will be a representative of the Polish economic sector. Apart from that, Waldemar Pawlak also, as the first Polish prime minister to do so, will meet with Willem van Eekelen, secretary general of the Western European Union. During the unofficial part of the prime minister's visit to Brussels, some talks are also scheduled with EC Chairman Jacques Delors and also with European Parliament Chairman Egon Klepsch. The prime minister's associates, however, refused to let journalists know what specific topics would be discussed during the talks. All they said was that the new prime minister's second trip abroad (following the Prague summit with the U.S. and Visegrad countries' presidents) is supposed to emphasize Poland's efforts toward integration with the West, and that the visit is associated with the fact that on 1 February Poland's treaty of association with the European Union becomes effective.
