Five hard years behind bars for a crime he has repeatedly denied have taken their toll on his health. His serious hepatitis condition shows through his yellowed eyes. But his spirit has not been broken. He is chatty, often enthusiastic in offering views on various aspects of the Chinese government, talks of his time in prison, and more importantly, of the love of his life his 30-year-old wife. Coming from a military family, Wang, 35, is nothing short of the character expected -- disciplined, patriotic and courageous. Throughout the interview, he is forthcoming with his feelings on China, but cautious when questions touch upon his comrades. For years while he was in jail, Wang was refused treatment for his hepatitis condition. It was only after his wife travelled to more than 10 countries, rallying support from various heads of state and numerous international democracy groups, that Wang was finally released. During the interview, Wang repeatedly turned to Hou, looking into her eyes and smiling affectionately, grateful for her strong belief in him and her efforts to have him released. Wang still calls his wife "little girl", an affectionate nickname -- possibly given to her because of her petite size when they first met at a party in Wuhan in 1986. To him, Hou is still a little girl -- but with a big character and immeasurable courage. Because of his little girl's political rallying worldwide, the ailing Wang was released on April 23, and arrived in the United States after China agreed to allow him to go overseas for medical treatment, a face- saving practice often used by China to release dissidents when it bows to international pressure. Wang, however, denied that he was allowed to go overseas purely for medical treatment. It was all a plot to satisfy Beijing's selfish interests, he insisted. "I was not allowed to go, I was ordered to leave my homeland. That is the real truth. "I remember that morning on April 18 when three senior judiciary officers came and told me that I would be allowed to go after repeated requests from the US government and after careful consideration by the Chinese government. It was decided I had better leave for treatment overseas." Wang's first tearful reaction was: "I don't want to leave my country." He then pleaded with them to allow him to remain in the country, putting him on parole so that he could get medical treatment outside the prison. The officials replied: "Definitely not. If you do not agree to go to the US you will remain in jail with no treatment." He finally agreed. Wang recalled that this was the first time he cried -- he just could not bear the thought of leaving his homeland, regardless of the difficult situation he was in. Even the harshest conditions in prison, and the pain he suffered during his 21 hunger strikes could not force him to cry. "I smiled every time I went on a hunger strike. I was not sad because I knew I was doing the right thing," he said. Wang described himself as a patriotic Chinese, but admitted he could never understand the government. "I cannot understand why the Chinese government keeps on hounding its people and keeps on treating us like enemies. And why are we being chased out of the country? "How come every time we are in trouble, we need other countries and other people to step in to rescue us?" Wang denounced China for repeatedly using Chinese dissidents as political pawns to fulfil its trade interests, and above all to win Most Favoured Nation trading status from the US. "This practice should be stopped. They should not continue with this shamelessly. The Americans are trying to use MFN to help solve problems in China, but our government is using it to fulfil its MFN dream," he said. "This is equal to selling out the whole of the Chinese race. China needs to rethink its policy towards its people and should treat us fairly if it still cares about national dignity." Surprisingly, Wang refused to blame his ill health on the poor prison conditions he lived in and the fact that he was denied proper medical treatment for hepatitis. But his prison life was undeniably harsh and lonely. "The first cell I was put in was less than three square metres. There was a bucket which served as my private toilet, and for companionship I had dozens of flies buzzing around all day and all night long, along with hundreds of insects and various species of worms. It wasn't all that solitary a confinement after all," he joked. Wang's mental and physical condition have surprised a great many people, including his wife and friends. Many anticipated he would be completely broken after six months in prison. Wang proved them wrong. But even he admits it was incredible that he survived such harsh conditions. He hopes his fellow dissidents who are still in prison will be better treated, and he called for improved medical treatment for the sick. According to Chinese law, any prisoner who has served one third of a jail term can be allowed medical treatment outside prison. In Wang's case, his request was repeatedly turned down. In the US, Wang is receiving free medical examinations, but he has yet to find money for the expensive treatment. Still, he insists he does not want financial support from the US government. "I don't want to deal with any government at all...I want to be independent," he said. Wang admits his decision to leave China was made because he did not want to disappoint his wife and others who had worked for his release. More importantly, he was concerned that, if he turned down the offer of release, he might jeopardise the chances of other dissidents. Wang believes there will be a better China in the near future if democratic movements either inside or outside China are better planned. He believes there are three things overseas democracy activists can do to improve China's human rights. "Firstly, they should do their best to preserve the present democratic force in China, which means they have to provide a safe back door to prepare for the worst scenario. "Secondly, they have to provide financial support for the mainland's democratic movement. Last, but not least, they should continue to strengthen international support and keep feeding this support back to China." Wang believes China's mainstream democratic movement still remains on the mainland, and urges overseas activists not to become too removed from China. "Any slight detachment from the mainstream movement in China would be equal to pulling the plug of the life-support machine that is keeping the dissidents going on the mainland." He strongly disagrees with many who believe that China should be fed the Western recipe of democracy. "That Western style would never work in China. We need to formulate something that suits the Chinese taste." Wang says a better tomorrow for the Chinese, either in or out of China, should begin with a fight for dignity. "I want to let the world know we Chinese are not cowards. There are many of us on the mainland who are not afraid to fight the communist regime or voice a different view." Throughout the best part of the interview, Hou kept silent nodding at times to show support and agreement on certain issues. Wang's little girl surprised many Chinese officials on the mainland during her courageous five years of campaigning for his fair treatment and ultimate release. Wang admits that when it comes, to drawing the right attention and support, his little girl is streets ahead. He first met Hou at his own house party in Wuhan. A colleague introduced the two and recommended she join their magazine. Wang was not convinced of her ability then, despite praise from various quarters. But it was love at first sight, and Wang said Hou totally swept him off his feet. The two were married two months later in December that year. Wang says he believes in eternal love, at least in his case. "The day we were married Xiaotian told me: 'Juntao, if you go to heaven I will follow you. If you go to hell, I will follow you, and if you get knocked down, I will be the first one to lift you up.' "I thought she was bull-shitting me at the time, because many people do that in Beijing. I was so wrong," he said, reaching out to touch her hands. Hou said their strong love kept her going during his imprisonment. "There was no communication between us at all during those years. We both relied on that special feeling linking our souls, which kept us going," she said softly. Wang did not realise his wife was the person behind his freedom. Only on the day of his release was he told by those who had imprisoned him. "I thought it was really strange they all told me not to forget the greatness of my wife." Even on the way to the US, when he thanked the accompanying US official, the man told him: "You should thank your wife. Her sincerity touched every major democracy activist worldwide, many heads of state and our president."
