Those sending the funds moreover often indicated their specific purpose. Zaporizhzhya Oblast, for instance, sent 100 million karbovantsi for the construction of housing for naval servicemen, the Ternopil Oblast Union of Officers of Ukraine sent seven million karbovantsi for the construction of the patrol craft Bayda Vyshnevetskyy, and the inhabitants of the city of Snyatyna in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast sent more than five million karbovantsi for the construction of the small ASW ship Pokuttya.
