An hour long break was announced at 1100, and our correspondent Janis Podins used this opportunity and asked to the microphone a member of the Latvian delegation, a deputy to the Fifth Saeima, Ilga Grava. [Begin recording] [Podins] Taking into account yesterday's incident, what was the first hour of the talks with the Russian delegation like? [Grava] Taking into account all that has happened, it should be said that the first hour of the talks was very normal. We both gave our apologies and some analysis of what has happened. The Russian side already understands that thing very well. They repeated once again their assessment, understanding that that was a provocation and in no way blaming the Latvian Government, nor blaming the delegation, nor Latvia as a state, but stressing again that that was a provocation and just reminded us that such provocations complicate not only relations between Russia and Latvia -- if we have no agreements at the moment which govern these relations -- but we also have to understand that relations between Russia and Latvia also determine relations between Latvia and other states, and that such [sentence incomplete as heard]. Well, they assessed (?everything) in a very normal way and we have now their agreement [words indistinct] and we will continue our work. [Podins] And what new is, nevertheless, in the stance of the Latvian delegation? And whether Russia accepts it? [Grava] We have not spoken yet a single word about the agreement, timescale, nor about anything else. Mr. Virsis said -- 31 August. Russia said with such a bit of sarcasm that it has really had to wait until the middle of January to come to this conclusion, [word indistinct] also understood that we have to accept that.
