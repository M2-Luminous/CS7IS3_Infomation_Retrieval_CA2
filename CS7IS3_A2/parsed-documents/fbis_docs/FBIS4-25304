An official from the Chinese Ministry for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MFTEC) described today the forum as "indicating the broad prospects for developing the Sino-Australian economic and trade ties." The forum, ended in Sydney yesterday, was first held in Melbourne early this month and has altogether attracted 450 people from the Australian business circles. The forum, the largest ever held in Australia, was also attended by more than 100 businessmen from China's 20 provinces and cities, who have brought with them 519 projects, valued at seven billion U.S. dollars. Commenting on the results of the forum, the MFTEC official told Chinese reporters today that the investment in China is on the upsurge in the Australian business circles. That's because, he said, "the deepening of reforms in China's economic system and its rapid economic growth have created great opportunities for the Australian businesses." The Chinese official also said that Australia, which has shifted its economic and trade focus towards Asia, is in a dire need of China's largest and most potential market in Asia. He said that the two countries have seen a steady development of bilateral economic and trade ties in the past years thanks to the mutual complementarity of the two economies and the importance the Governments of China and Australia have attached to promoting the bilateral ties. Official figures indicated that China has approved 1,310 projects involving Australian investment by the end of last year and China has invested 130 projects in Australia. The 335 projects singed at the forum mainly focus on communications, energy, petro-chemical industry, food processing industry, textile industry, building materials, agriculture and others. China and Australia enjoyed a two-way trade of three billion U.S. dollars last year, representing an increase of 29 percent over the previous year, according to China's official figures.
