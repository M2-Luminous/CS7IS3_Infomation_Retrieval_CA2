FR940523-1-00016 FR940523-1-00005 Standardization of Testing Data Based on a variety of previous comments, the Postal Service would not mandate standardization of presort software documentation, layout, and format with this proposal. The mailing documentation currently generated by presort software would be evaluated to ensure that all data necessary to support the rates claimed in the mailing category tested were present and could be readily identified and understood. The Postal Service believes, however, that eventually a more common framework for test results needs to be established to have an efficient, accurate PAVE review and certification process. The Postal Service proposes to explore the feasibility of having software manufacturers return an electronic file rather than hard copy documentation for future PAVE testing. From this electronic file, the Postal Service could perform computer analysis of PAVE test results, begin to develop analysis software for a computer grading solution, or print documentation in a common format for ease of review. In order to pursue this concept, the Postal Service would need to establish a common electronic file structure with standardized data fields. Although the issue of using an electronic file is not specifically part of this proposed rule (hard copy documentation is proposed for manual evaluation for initial PAVE tests), comments concerning its eventual implementation are requested. A potential file structure has been drafted and is available on request to those wishing to comment on its content and layout.
