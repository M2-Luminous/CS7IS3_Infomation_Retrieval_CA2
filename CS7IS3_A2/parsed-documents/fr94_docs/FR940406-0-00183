FR940406-0-00183 FR940406-0-00012 For the reasons discussed above and in the NPRM, and in light of the comments, beginning in MY 1996, the agency will no longer require light trucks to meet the CAFE standard separately, based on whether they are captive imports. A new Table IV is being added to the regulatory text, which indicates a single CAFE standard for all light trucks without category distinctions. Since CAFE credits cannot ordinarily be applied across classes of light trucks, the agency proposed a method of accommodating the 3-year carryforward and carryback of credits for light trucks after the elimination of the two-fleet requirement. Only Chrysler commented on the proposal, stating that it agreed with the agency. No other comments addressed the issue. The manner in which NHTSA will allow CAFE credits to be carried forward or backward once the captive import and other fleets are combined is the same as that used by the agency during the transition from 2WD and 4WD standards for MYs 1980&hyph;81 to optional combined standards for MY 1982 and later (45 FR 83233, December 18, 1990), as well as the subsequent termination of any 2WD/4WD option in favor of a single combined standard for all configurations in MY 1992 (55 FR 12487, April 4, 1990). For MY's 1993&hyph;95, a manufacturer's captive import and other light truck credits can be applied to offset shortfalls in the combined fleet incurred up to three model years later (i.e., MYs 1996&hyph;98). If, on the other hand, a manufacturer wished to use credits earned in the three years after elimination of the two-fleet requirement to offset a shortfall incurred between MY 1993 and MY 1995, the manufacturer would have to separate its MYs 1996&hyph;98 CAFE credits into ``captive import'' and ``other'' components based on each fraction of the fleet's share of total production. NHTSA notes that it does not foresee any manufacturer making use of carryforward or carryback credits for captive imports, however. As mentioned above, in the relevant years, only Chrysler has had even a minimal number of captive imports, and it has not needed to use any credits during that time. Nor does the agency expect any manufacturer to establish a captive import fleet in the MY 1996&hyph;98 timeframe. VI. The Need of the Nation To Conserve Energy The United States imported 15 percent of its oil needs in 1955. The import share reached 36.8 percent in 1975, the year EPCA was passed, and peaked at 46.4 percent in 1977, at a cost of $91 billion (stated in 1992 dollars). Although the share declined to below 30 percent in the mid-1980's, lately the United States has again become increasingly dependent on imported oil. Over 40 percent of the country's petroleum needs have been imported in every year since 1988. In 1992, imports totaled 43.6 percent. Sharply lower oil prices in the past decade, however, cut the value of oil imports to $50.5 billion in 1992.
