FR940620-2-00067 FR940620-2-00042 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34203; International Series Release No. 673; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;33] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating to FLEX Options Designated in Foreign Currencies June 13, 1994. I. Introduction On August 24, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, 2 a proposal to trade and settle Flexible Exchange Options (``FLEX Options'') in specified foreign currencies. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b-4 (1993). The proposed rule change was published for comment and appeared in the Federal Register on October 3, 1993. 3 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32977 (September 28, 1993), 58 FR 51660 (October 3, 1993). II. Description of the Proposal The purpose of the CBOE's FLEX Option program is to provide a frame-work for the Exchange to list and trade index options that give investors the ability, within specified limits, to designate certain of the terms of the options. 4 Such terms currently include the underlying index, 5 type (put, call, or spread), exercise style (American, European, or European-Capped), expiration date, 6 strike price, and form of settlement (a.m. settlement versus p.m. settlement). 7 4 The Commission approved the CBOE's FLEX Options framework on February 24, 1993, permitting the Exchange to list and trade FLEX Options based on the Standard & Poor's Corporation (``S&P'') 100 (``OEX'') and 500 (``SPX'') Indexes. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31920 (February 24, 1993), 58 FR 12280 (March 3, 1993) (``FLEX Options Approval Order''). 5 The CBOE lists and trades FLEX Options based on the OEX and SPX Indexes, which consist of 100 and 500 highly capitalized stocks, respectively, FLEX Options Approval Order, id; the Russell 2000, which consists of the bottom 2,000 of the 3,000 largest U.S. equity securities in terms of domestic market capitalization, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32694 (July 29, 1993), 58 FR 41814 (August 5, 1993) (``Russell 2000 Approval Order''); and the Nasdaq 100, which consists of the stocks of 100 of the largest, non-financial U.S. issuers quoted on the Nasdaq National Market, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34052 (May 12, 1994), 59 FR 25972 (May 18, 1994) (``Nasdaq 100 Approval Order''). 6 A market participant's ability to designate the expiration date is not without limitation. Specifically, in order to protect against possible market disruptions that may otherwise result from the concurrent expiration of listed options and FLEX Options, the expiration dates for FLEX Options must be at least three business days away from the expiration dates for existing listed options. See FLEX Options Approval Order, supra note 4. 7 See CBOE Rule 24A.4, Terms of FLEX Contracts. In the FLEX Options Approval Order, supra note 4, the Commission designated FLEX Options as ``standardized options'' for purposes of the options disclosure framework established under Rule 9b-1 under the Act. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31919 (February 24, 1993), 58 FR 12286 (March 3, 1993) (``9b-1 Order''). For the same reasons stated in the 9b-1 Order, FLEX Options on specified foreign currencies are deemed ``standardized options'' for purposes of the Rule 9b-1 options disclosure framework. In the present proposal, the CBOE is seeking to expand its FLEX Options program to allow FLEX Options to be designated for trading and settled in certain specified foreign currencies. The permitted designated foreign currencies include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Japanese Yen, Deutsche Marks, Swiss Francs, French Francs, or European Currency Units (``ECU''), as well as U.S. Dollars. In implementing its proposal, the CBOE is changing CBOE Rule 24A.4 (``Rule 24A.4'') (``Terms of FLEX Contracts'') in three ways. First, the CBOE proposes amending Rule 24A.4(c) to add settlement currency to the list of contract term categories that parties to any FLEX Option contract are required to designate. Second, the CBOE proposes amending Rule 24A.4(d) to make it clear that bids and offers responsive to FLEX Requests for Quotes 8 must be stated in terms of the designated currency and may be expressed only as a specific designated currency amount or as a percentage of the ``Underlying Equivalent Value'' 9 (and thus not in the form of a fractional price). Third, the CBOE proposes amending Rule 24A.4(f) to list the various currencies in which FLEX Options may be quoted, traded, and settled (``Eligible Currencies''). 8 The term ``Request for Quotes'' means the initial request supplied by a submitting member to initiate FLEX Option bidding and offering. CBOE Rule 24A.1. 9 CBOE Rule 24A.1 defines ``Underlying Equivalent Value'' to mean the aggregate underlying monetary value covered by that number of contracts, derived by multiplying the index multiplier by the current index value times the given number of FLEX Options contracts. Minor changes to certain other FLEX Options rules have also been proposed by the Exchange. The Exchange proposes to add a new paragraph (g) to Rule 24A.5 (``FLEX Trading Procedures and Principals'') to specify for each Eligible Currency the minimum permissible increments of change in currency amounts for successive FLEX Quotes. Also, the Exchange proposes an amendment to Rule 24A.9 respecting appointment of FLEX Market Makers to clarify that the CBOE will appoint market makers to FLEX Options in respect of particular settlement currencies for FLEX Option-eligible indexes.
