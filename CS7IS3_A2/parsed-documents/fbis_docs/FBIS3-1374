Those forces are on an offensive under the leadership of [former military commander for Huambo Province] Jorge Sukissa. They are attacking defenseless civilians in general as well as National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]-controlled areas. Reports from the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel, Vorgan, correspondent in that area, say that the Luanda communist regime's air force bombed the villages of (Caumbangala), (Cuilo), (Chacolo), and (Samucuai) on 20, 21, 22, and 23 March, killing 34 civilians, including 22 children. It is interesting to note that the government press in Lunda Sul Province has made no mention at all of those attacks by the MPLA-PT forces. Instead, it has falsely accused the UNITA forces of taking the initiative and launching an offensive. The UNITA forces have the simple duties of defending the people against the genocide being perpetrated by Jose Eduardo dos Santos' men and of abiding scrupulously by the unilateral cease-fire declared by UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi on 20 September of last year. Meanwhile, the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola have informed the Angolan and international communities that they will do everything in their power to defend the people against attacks by South African or any other mercenaries helping the troops run by Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace.
