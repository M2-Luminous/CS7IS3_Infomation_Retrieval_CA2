As of the end of 1992 (1993 data are still being processed), China's state-owned assets had a total book value of 3,069.7 billion yuan (excluding resources assets and the state-owned assets of the armed forces and the armed police corps), representing an increase of 385.1 billion yuan over the 2,684.6 billion yuan of the previous year or a growth rate of 14.3 percent. Of total state-owned assets, 47.5 percent were managed by units of the central authorities and 52.4 percent by the localities. Judging by the usage of state-owned assets, 72 percent were operational assets and 28 percent were nonoperational assets, of which operational assets increased by 13.1 percent. Of total assets society-wide, state-owned assets had an absolute advantage. In important sectors such as energy, communications, banking, and foreign trade, over 90 percent of assets were held by state-owned enterprises. Sectors in which state-owned assets increased comparatively quickly were industry, construction engineering, agriculture, and forestry. Their growth rate was 10 percentage points higher than the national average. State-owned assets in the real estate sector and in joint-stock enterprises increased by 69.8 percent and 175.7 percent respectively, representing the fastest growth rates. Shandong Province was the region where state-owned assets grew the quickest. In 1992, they grew by as much as 30.5 percent. Next were the coastal regions of eastern China and southern China. The first 10 provinces and municipalities with the largest state-owned assets managed by localities were Guangdong (165.7 billion yuan), Jiangsu (103.2 billion yuan), Shandong (102.8 billion yuan), Liaoning (96.5 billion yuan), Sichuan (87.7 billion yuan), Shanghai (82.7 billion yuan), Beijing (79.2 billion yuan), Hubei (69.6 billion yuan), Hebei (66.3 billion yuan), and Zhejiang (62.5 billion yuan). Moreover, state-owned enterprises have continuously improved their vitality. In 1992, state-owned enterprises across the country achieved taxes and profits totaling 329.1 billion yuan, an increase of 16 percent over the previous year, and they earned 117.6 billion yuan of profits, an increase of 11.3 percent over the previous year. The 24.3 percent of state-owned enterprises incurring losses was a 7.3 point decrease from the 31.6 percent of the previous year. The proportion of losses in operational returns decreased from 32.1 percent to 26.7 percent. Taxes and profits turned over by state-owned enterprises accounted for approximately two thirds of total budgetary income.
