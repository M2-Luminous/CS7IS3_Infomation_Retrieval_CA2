The case is trying 48 defendants including Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman. The court heard the remarks of State Security Chief Prosecutor Usamah Qandil on the defense's presentation of the case. The court decided to postpone the trial until Tuesday to hear the comments of the defense on prosecution remarks. Usamah Qandil said the judiciary in Egypt is free and independent and that there is no intervention in its work and no influence on the judges in trials. He said the defense was interested in defending 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, who absconded, despite it having no right to defend him without paying the same attention to the jailed defendants. The defendants have thus become the victims of their crimes and their defense. According to Egyptian law, a defendant who has absconded cannot be defended in court. He said that 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman was subpoenaed correctly. He was subpoenaed to appear before the prosecution, but he cannot be subpoenaed in the State of New Jersey, as the defense claimed, because it is a very big state, not a small village where a person can easily be discovered. Chief Prosecutor Usamah Qandil said the case is not one of politics or opinion, as the defense claimed. It is a case of defendants who have committed crimes for which the Egyptian penal code will punish them. He affirmed that the emergency law is constitutional. He said there is no truth in defense remarks that it is unconstitutional, especially as the Higher Constitutional Court issued a verdict confirming that it was constitutional to apply this law. He clarified that the republican decree on declaring a state of emergency is a supreme decision. The courts cannot oppose it, since it falls within the scope of state action as part of its duty to keep social peace. He noted that the defendants in this case can be tried before the Higher State Security Court-Emergency. He said the State Security Courts organized by the law form part of the natural judicial system, while the State Security Courts-Emergency were formed according to the emergency law. These are extraordinary courts linked with the state of emergency. The state security chief prosecutor said that the first defendant in the case, Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, practices local and international terrorism and continues to incite youths. He has misled them and made them join the convoy of destruction and sabotage, which moves toward a sea of blood amid the dismembered parts of Muslim and non-Muslim victims. He noted that there is no text in the Constitution the articles of which contradict the process of approving the rulings of the Higher State Security Court-Emergency. He clarified that when the law stipulated approval of the rulings, it defined the limits for the signing authority according to its speciality. It stipulated that before approval, the rulings must be reviewed by the approval office, which consists of judges who review the rulings before approving them. The representative of the prosecution concluded his comment by asking for the maximum sentence for the defendants. He noted in this regard that the crimes they have been accused of have been confirmed by the prosecution's eyewitnesses and investigation.
