FR940630-0-00012 FR940630-0-00005 One commenter, Boeing, requests that the proposed requirement for operational checks be removed from the AD until the FAA reviews the ``more comprehensive'' scheduled maintenance recommendations developed by the Model 757/767 Thrust Reverser Working Group, which will be recommended in the next revision to the Maintenance Review Board (MRB) report. Boeing believes that adoption of the maintenance recommendations contained in that forthcoming revision will ensure that an adequate level of safety (with regard to the sync-lock installation) will be maintained by all operators of Model 757 series airplanes. The FAA recognizes the concerns of these commenters regarding the requirement for periodic operational checks of the sync-lock following its installation. However, the FAA finds that the operational checks are necessary in order to provide an adequate level of safety and to ensure the integrity of the sync-lock installation. The actions required by this AD are consistent with actions that have been identified by an industry-wide task force as necessary to ensure adequate safety of certain thrust reverser systems installed on transport category airplanes. Representatives of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) of America, Inc., and the FAA comprise that task force. Representatives from other organizations, such as ATA, have participated in various discussions and work activities resulting from the recommendations of the task force. The FAA acknowledges that the operational checks specified in this AD and CMR items are similar in terms of scheduled maintenance and recordkeeping. This AD addresses an unsafe condition and requires installation of the sync-lock to correct that unsafe condition. The FAA has determined that the requirement for operational checks is necessary in order to ensure the effectiveness of that installation in addressing the unsafe condition. This determination is based on the fact that the sync-lock is a new design whose reliability has not been adequately proven through service experience. In addition, service experience to date has demonstrated that failures can occur within the sync-lock that may not be evident during normal operation of the thrust reverser system and may not result in activation of the sync-lock ``unlock'' indicator. The ATA's suggested alternative to accomplishment of the operational checks would permit each operator to determine whether and how often these checks should be conducted. In light of the severity of the unsafe condition, however, the FAA has determined that allowing this degree of operator discretion is not appropriate at this time. Therefore, this AD is necessary to ensure that operators accomplish checks of the integrity of the sync-lock installation in a common manner and at common intervals. The FAA also finds that addressing operational checks of the sync-lock integrity in a recommended action, such as an MRB report, will not ensure an acceptable level of safety with regard to the thrust reverser system. However, the FAA recognizes that an operational check interval of 4,000 hours time-in-service, which will be recommended by Boeing for inclusion in the next revision to the MRB report, corresponds more closely to the interval at which most of the affected operators conduct regularly scheduled ``C'' checks. The FAA has reconsidered the proposed interval of 1,000 hours time-in-service for accomplishment of repetitive operational checks. In light of the safety implications of the unsafe condition addressed and the practical aspects of accomplishing orderly operational checks of the fleet during regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be readily available, the FAA finds that accomplishment of the checks at intervals of 4,000 hours time-in-service will provide an acceptable level of safety. Paragraph (c) of the final rule has been revised accordingly. Since the issuance of the proposed rule, Boeing has issued Revision 2 of Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0035, dated June 23, 1994. The service bulletin revision moves general work instruction Step B from Work Package 2 to Step Q in Work Package 8. In Revision 1 of the service bulletin, Step B of Work Package 2 specified procedures for removal of the ground to the EICAS for the REV ISLN VAL message; however, the ground should not be removed as part of Work Package 2. Rather, the ground should be removed as part of Work Package 8 in order to avoid loss of the REV ISLN VAL message on EICAS. Revision 2 of the service bulletin correctly describes procedures for removal of the ground as part of Work Package 8. Revision 2 of the service bulletin also describes procedures for installation of an additional bracket on the P36 disconnect bracket and to make a cutout on the P37 disconnect bracket on certain airplanes. The FAA has reviewed and approved this latest revision to the service bulletin and has revised the final rule to reflect it as the appropriate source of service information. The FAA finds that citing this latest revision to the service bulletin will impose no additional burden on any operator. It should be noted that Revision 2 of Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0035 references Rolls-Royce Service Bulletins RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9725 and RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726 as additional sources of service information for accomplishment of the originally proposed sync-lock installation. However, the Boeing service bulletin does not specify the appropriate revision levels for the Rolls-Royce service bulletins. Therefore, the FAA has added ``NOTE 1'' to paragraph (b) of this AD to specify that the intent of that paragraph is that the appropriate revision levels for the Rolls-Royce service bulletins that are to be used in conjunction with Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0035 are as follows: Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9725, dated June 23, 1993, or Revision 1, dated January 7, 1994; and Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9726, dated June 23, 1993, or Revision 1, dated October 1, 1993. In addition, since the issuance of the proposed rule, Rolls-Royce has issued Service Bulletin RB.211&hyph;78&hyph;9822, dated October 1, 1993. This service bulletin describes procedures for installation of a revised thrust reverser sync-lock. The FAA has determined that accomplishment of the actions described in this service bulletin, in conjunction with Boeing Service Bulletin 757&hyph;78&hyph;0035 [which was cited in paragraph (b) of the proposal as the appropriate source of service information for installation of an additional thrust reverser system locking feature], constitutes an acceptable alternative to the sync-lock installation specified in paragraph (b) of the proposal.
