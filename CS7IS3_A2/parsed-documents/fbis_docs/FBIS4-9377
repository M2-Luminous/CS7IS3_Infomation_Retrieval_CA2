The results of the poll were published in the 31 March issue of VECER on pages 4 and 5. The journalists interviewed 200 people, half of them Skopje residents and the remainder residents of 10 other towns in Macedonia, asking two questions: -- Will you vote in the November elections (with the predetermined responses: yes, no, and do not know); -- Why (with a few answers mentioned but no overall results given). The interviews were conducted partly by telephone and partly face-to-face. VECER claims that it followed "appropriate methods" to assure that the respondents were chosen "accidentally" and remained anonymous. The responses to the first question are broken down by ethnic group: Macedonian, Albanian, and other (Turks, Serbs, Romanies, and so forth), and by gender. VECER provided no further information on methodology, nor was the margin of error supplied. Anticipating Turnout According to VECER, voter turnout in Macedonia's first multiparty elections in 1990 was about 84 percent. Noting that voter turnout can change dramatically and that it is thus too early to predict voter turnout in November, VECER recalls that in the first round of the by-election, which was held on 20 March, 46 percent of those eligible voted, but that in a subsequent survey 54 percent indicated they would vote in a 3 April runoff round. VECER promised to sample the mood of the electorate periodically. With respect to the November elections, VECER found that 73 percent of those surveyed planned to vote, with only 13.5 percent saying they would not vote and an equal percentage uncertain. People between 35 and 45 years of age were the most inclined to vote, as were those with a secondary or higher education, 77 percent of whom intended to vote--compared to only 36 percent of those with a primary school education. Gender was also salient: 81 percent of the men surveyed intended to vote, compared to 59 percent of the women. The breakdown by ethnic groups is shown in the table below: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Will Vote |Will Not Vote |Undecided | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Macedonians |75 |9 |16 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Albanians |72 |23 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Others |63 |23 |14 | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
