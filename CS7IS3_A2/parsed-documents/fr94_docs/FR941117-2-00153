FR941117-2-00153 FR941117-2-00102 •Inter-refinery feedstock transportation; •Harbor, escort and assist tug services to vessels; and •International crude trade (one vessel). SeaRiver, by letter of October 24, 1994, provided additional information in connection with its request of September 29, 1994. SeaRiver advises that since September 1990, the Vessel has operated in foreign service, having now completed more than 60 voyages, primarily from the Middle East and Mediterranean areas to European ports. On occasion, the Vessel has loaded North Sea crude in Scotland for transportation to other European discharge ports. Earlier this year, the Vessel also transported a Strategic Petroleum Reserve cargo from Sullom Voe. SeaRiver advises that its plans are that the Vessel will continue to operate in international service, optimally in the Middle East and European foreign trades. However, this does not preclude the vessel from trading in the U.S. In Attachment I to its letter of October 24, SeaRiver shows the number of voyages and foreign areas of operation for the Vessel for 1992, 1993, and 1994. SeaRiver also requests the necessary written permission under section 805(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (Act), for vessels owned and operated by SeaRiver in the domestic trades. These include tank vessels used to transport crude from Alaska to U.S. west coast destinations and solvents, chemicals, specially and petroleum products from the U.S. gulf to the U.S. east coast. SeaRiver also operates towboats and barges that move petroleum fuel products, specialty products and chemicals along the U.S. gulf coast and inland waterways. SeaRiver advises that tugs are also used in harbor assist, escort and oil spill response service on the U.S. west coast and in the Gulf. SeaRiver states that it may acquire additional U.S. flag tonnage as an owner/operator or may dispose of existing tonnage in the course of normal business operations. Additionally, SeaRiver indicates that it may spot, term or bareboat incharter and/or outcharter U.S.-flag tonnage as necessary to satisfy business requirements. SeaRiver lists its domestic fleet and areas of operating in Attachment II to its letter of October 24, 1994. SeaRiver advises that it presently distinguishes accounting for the expenditures of the S/R MEDITERRANEAN separate from other operations. SeaRiver will further guarantee to institute any additional internal procedures that may be necessary to ensure that any operational subsidy granted will apply only to the S/R MEDITERRANEAN. SeaRiver is also requesting a waiver of section 804(a) of the Act. In addition to owning, operating, inchartering and outchartering U.S. flag vessels, SeaRiver also incharters foreign flag tankers to support domestic operations (e.g. Gulf of Mexico ligthering service). SeaRiver advises that Exxon also has international affiliates that own, operate and charter foreign flag vessels. These affiliates are located primarily in Europe, the Far East and Latin America. The vessels are managed and operated by the affiliates and are totally independent from the U.S. flag marine operations of SeaRiver. These Exxon affiliates may acquire additional foreign flag tonnage as owners/operators or may dispose of existing tonnage in the course of their normal business operations. The affiliates may also spot, term, or bareboat incharter and/or outcharter foreign flag tonnage necessary to satisfy business requirements. Attachment III to SeaRiver's October 24, letter details all of the Exxon affiliates's owned, operated, and chartered foreign flag vessels. SeaRiver advises that Exxon is a participant in the Revised Voluntary Tanker Agreement (MARAD Contract MA&hyph;11725) under which Exxon agrees to make foreign flag tanker tonnage capacity available to the U.S. to further meet (beyond the SeaRiver U.S. flag tonnage) emergency national defense needs. The Bahamian registered vessels which are noted in Attachment III to the October 24 letter are covered by the Agreement.
