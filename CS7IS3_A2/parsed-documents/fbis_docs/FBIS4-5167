The decision of the DPRK SPA adopted at the session is as follows. The decision of the DPRK SPA on the successful fulfillment of the tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment: The 21st plenary session of the Sixth WPK Central Committee has set 1994 through 1996 as a period of adjustment for the socialist economic construction and has put forward a strategic task to be fulfilled during that period. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In the socialist economic construction, we should set the upcoming three years as a period of adjustment as decided by the 21st plenary session of the Sixth Party Central Committee and thoroughly implement the agriculture-first policy, light industry-first policy, and trade-first policy during that period. Along with this, we should firmly give priority to the coal industry, power industry, and railway transport--which are the leading sectors of the national economy--and should continue to develop the metal industry. The task of socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment is to thoroughly implement the agriculture-first policy, light industry-first policy, and trade-first policy; to firmly give priority to the coal industry, the power industry, and railway transport; and to continue developing the metal industry. The WPK's presentation of the task of socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment is a wise step, enabling our socialist construction to be further deepened and developed at a new higher level, while consolidating the success gained during implementation of the Third Seven-Year Plan. The WPK's revolutionary economic strategy is to totally comply with the basic interest of our revolution and construction, as well as to correctly reflect the aspirations and demands of our people. Also, the strategy is a just policy, which makes it possible to significantly raise our people's standard of living to extraordinarily strengthen our country's independence and the might of the socialist economy in conformity with the demands of socialism. Only when the revolutionary economic strategy is embodied, will the long-cherished desire of our people to eat rice and meat soup, wear silk clothes, and live in a tile-roofed house be brilliantly achieved within the near future. At the same time, the country's self-reliant economic foundation will be consolidated as firm as a rock and a firm prospect to occupy a higher hill of socialism will be opened. The DPRK SPA will decide as follows to successfully fulfill the tasks of the socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment put forward by the WPK. 1. The DPRK SPA will thoroughly implement the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy. Thoroughly implementing the agriculture-first policy, light industry-first policy, and trade-first policy is a basic guarantee for significantly raising the people's standard of living in the demands of socialism. It will effect the industrialization and modernization of agriculture at a higher level by thoroughly implementing the agriculture-first policy. Also, it will satisfactorily solve the issue concerning the people's food [inmindului mongnunmunjelul wonmanhui haegyol halgosida] by more greatly increasing all agricultural products, including grain production. It will greatly develop the country's irrigation system by repairing and reinforcing irrigation facilities and by more effectively adopting the irrigation method [kwansu pangbop], while consolidating the success made in irrigation and electrification [surihwawa chongihwaui songgwa]. It will satisfactorily meet the demands of electricity by repairing and newly establishing power supply facilities and by improving the power supply system. It will raise the utilization rate of the existing agricultural tools in the rural communities to the maximum and newly produce and supply various agricultural tools, including more than 30,000 tractors and 10,000 cargo trucks. Also, it will produce various kinds of chemical fertilizer and agricultural chemicals. As a result, it will raise the comprehensive mechanization and chemicalization in the national economy to a higher level. Crops of rice and corn per chongbo [one chongbo equals 2.45 acres] will be further increased by thoroughly implementing the demands of rural technological revolution and chuche-based farming method so that the grain production target of 15 million tonnes may be achieved in the coming years. All domains of rural economy, including livestock, fruit cultivation, and sericultural sectors will be developed so that demands for meat, fruit, and vegetable and raw agricultural products demanded by industries can be satisfactorily guaranteed. Innovations in the production of people's consumer goods will be accelerated through the development of light industry. Textile factories will be repaired, reinforced, and modernized so that fabric production can be increased by over 20 percent during the period of adjustment. Knitting and clothes-processing industries will be developed so that various kinds of clothes suitable for our people's figure and socialist lifestyle can be produced in large volumes. The shoe industry will be modernized and production capacity will be utilized reasonably to increase shoe production by over 10 percent during the period of adjustment, thus, people's diverse demand for shoes will be satisfactorily guaranteed. The food industry will be developed and production of popular foods will be increased to enrich and diversify people's dietary life. The volume and kinds of daily necessities will be increased and their quality will be further improved. Local industry will be developed by modernizing local industry plants and reinforcing local resource bases. Production of various quality daily necessities and food will be significantly increased by reinforcing the production of 3 August people's consumer goods in all domains of people's economy including plants, enterprises, and cottage industry cooperatives and units. Various areas of the people's economy will sufficiently produce and guarantee various raw materials for light industry, including chemical textiles and plastic. A new turn will be made in foreign trade in conformity with the changing circumstance. All areas of people's economy will actively mobilize export resources, reinforce export bases, actively increase production, and improve the quality of export items of large foreign demand, including steel material, nonferrous metal, machinery equipment, batteries, magnesia clinkers, cement, processed stone, silk products, and traditional Koryo medicine. Overseas markets will be actively developed, credit will be earned, and external trading transactions will be expanded and developed in various forms and methods, including processing trade, reselling trade [toegori muyok], commission trade, joint venture and management, economic and technological collaboration, and overseas construction. Investment conditions for foreign companies will be satisfactorily guaranteed and investment inducement activities will be promoted by strengthening management in the Najin and Sonbong free economic trade zones. 2. Coal and electricity industries, and railway transportation, which are the leading sectors of the people's economy, will be assured that they are given priority, and the development of metal industry will be continued. Continuously developing the metal industry and assuring that priority is given to the leading sectors of the people's economy are important demands for expanding and developing agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade, and for strengthening the self-reliance and independence of economy. Coal production will be increased by 30 percent during the period of adjustment with the strengthening of the coal industry by giving precedence in tunneling and removal of soil and rocks, modernizing mining and transportation equipment, accelerating construction of new mines and new pits, carrying out construction work ahead of schedule, and giving priority to providing materials and equipment. Investment in the crude oil industry will be increased so that more oil fields can be discovered by using reinforced exploring facilities and equipment, and by focusing efforts on exploring potential areas. In the electricity industry, electricity production will be increased by 30 percent during the period of adjustment by repairing and reinforcing power plants, improving technological management, and accelerating power plant construction. Thermoelectric power plants will be in full operation through sufficiently supplied coal, hydroelectric power plants will increase the efficiency of water pressure, and factory thermoelectric power plants and small-to-medium hydroelectric power plants will normalize electricity production. The construction of large-scale power plants will be actively accelerated so that they can begin operation ahead of schedule. An increased number of power plants using waste heat, small-to-medium hydroelectric power plants, and wind-power generating stations will be built, and nuclear power plants will be built on a large scale. Daily railway cargo transportation will be increased by over 30 percent by strengthening the material and technological basis of railway transportation and organizing transportation organizations and command. Main lines will focus on railways, more trains and engines will be manufactured, and transportation organizations and command will be modernized and will be more scientific. In the metal industry, priority will be guaranteed for iron ore production by reinforcing the tunneling and mining capacity of metal mines, including the Musan mining complex. The production of steel materials will be further increased by repairing and reinforcing the production procedure of iron and steel stations with modern technology. 3. Economic organizational works will continue to be properly carried out and economic management will be carried out well. Properly carrying out economic organizational works and economic management is a prerequisite for successfully implementing the tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment by highly displaying the revolutionary enthusiasm and active creativity of the masses. In conformity with the demands of the party's revolutionary economic strategy, the State Administration Council will improve economic operations and organizational works, and further grip, guide, and control all sectors and units of economic society. On the basis of the firm guarantee of the state's unified guidance on economic works, the creativity of committees, ministries, and provincial, municipal, and county plants and enterprises will be highly displayed. Particularly, provinces, cities, and counties will do their utmost to produce and guarantee people's consumer goods on their own by mobilizing local resources and reserves to the maximum. The people's economic plan will be practically drawn up under the principle of making everything obedient to implementing revolutionary economic strategy. All areas and units will implement without fail the daily, monthly, quarterly, and indexical national plan. Material and equipment will be provided to agriculture, light industry, and export production with priority by properly carrying out material supply works. The all-people support movement to these sectors will be vigorously carried out. Along with this, the material and equipment for the leading sectors of the people's economy and metal industry will be thoroughly guaranteed. In conformity with the demands of the Taean work system, the management of labor, equipment, and material will be improved, economic assets will be properly maintained, the economic efficiency of production and management activities will be maximized, economic leverages such as cost, price, profit will be properly utilized, the independent accounting system will be correctly implemented, and control by won [Korean currency] will be intensified. By vigorously carrying out the movement for production increase and conservation as an all-mass movement, we should discover all reserves for production increase and should actively save raw materials and materials including electricity, coal, and fuel, thus thoroughly eliminating various phenomena of wastefulness. We will see to it that valuable scientific and technological inventions, technical innovation plans, creative designs, and rationalization plans be worked out by inspiring the patriotic passion and abilities of the producing masses, scientists, and technicians so that they are effectively used in production. 4. We will further strengthen the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks and will highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. It is a decisive guarantee for successfully implementing the tasks of the period of adjustment of socialist economic construction that all the people highly demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle in firm unity with the party and the leader. We will see to it that all functionaries and workers firmly arm themselves with the chuche revolutionary outlook and vigorously display the might of single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks in implementing tasks of the period of adjustment in firm unity with the party and the leader. All domains and all units of the national economy, upholding the militant slogan, "Let us vigorously accelerate the socialist general march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle!" will effect a new upsurge in socialist economic construction by discovering what is in shortage and by producing what is not available and by assuming the attitude and position worthy of masters to carry out works with their own strength even without help from the upper echelon, although such help is better than none. All economic guidance functionaries and workers will break through difficulties laid before them by their own strength with such spirit as one with which our working class and people produced hand-grenades with empty hands during the arduous days of war; restored the economy on the empty land after the war, and effected the great Chollima upsurge. They will successfully carry to accomplishment the tasks of the period of adjustment of socialist economic construction by continually innovating and advancing with the spirit of adding the speed of the nineties to Chollima. 5. We will further enhance the responsibility and role of guiding functionaries of the state economic organizations. Successful implementation of tasks of the period of adjustment of socialist economic construction depends on the sense of responsibility and role of the state economic guiding functionaries, who are the commanding staff of the revolution. The state economic guiding functionaries should cherish thoroughgoing faith and determination to entrust their destinies to our party and to die at the post of duty while defending their revolutionary outposts, and should become the standard-bearers and vanguards in upholding the party and the leader. Through practical struggle to successfully implement the tasks of the period of adjustment of socialist economic construction, the guiding functionaries will highly display the sense of loyalty to the party and the leader. With a sense of confidence and optimism that they will win victory without fail on the road of upholding the leadership of the great leader and great party, the guiding functionaries will always think creatively, will boldly and revolutionarily carry out works, will stand at the van of difficult tasks, and will fulfill their responsibility and role assigned by the party and the leader by fully demonstrating all of their wisdom and passion. The guiding functionaries will deeply mingle with the producer masses according to the demand of the revolutionary slogan, "We serve the people!" and should share joy and sorrow with them. Thus, they will skillfully organize and mobilize the masses to the implementation of the tasks of the period of adjustment. 6. The establishment of concrete execution measures for these decisions will be entrusted to the DPRK Administration Council. The Seventh Session of the Ninth SPA of the DPRK 7 April 1994 Pyongyang
