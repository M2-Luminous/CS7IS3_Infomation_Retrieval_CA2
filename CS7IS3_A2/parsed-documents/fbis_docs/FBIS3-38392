Poland, for example, was raised to the level of a safe third-country; since then, refugees, who had crossed Poland on their way to Germany, had to expect to be returned to Poland as soon as they arrived here. However, the agreement with Poland has obviously not produced the result Bonn expected. Instead of the approximately 10,000 who should have been returned each year, the number was just somewhat higher than 3,000, which has, allegedly, created some ill-feelings. Federal Interior Minister Kanther returned today from Warsaw, where he had met with his counterpart and with the Polish president. He stopped in Rostock Warnemuende on his way back to Bonn. I now have my colleague Henning von Lewies on the telephone from there. Mr. Von Lewies, what did Kanther have to say about the German-Polish talks, or has he maintained his silence? [Von Lewies] Mrs. Beindorf, Kanther said one could not speak of ill-feelings, and that the media played up the affair. He said the talks with his Polish partners in Warsaw on various issues were excellent, and that they included topics such as cooperation in the struggle against crime and the return of cultural objects. So, as he claimed, there were no ill-feelings or irritation. He added, however, that there is much need to take action. Contacts between the border organs should be improved. It is intended to exchange liaison officials, which suggests that things at the German-Polish border are not as they should be. In addition, German equipment should be provided for the Polish police and border security organs, as was agreed in the 1993 treaty. This is, so to speak, the result of that visit to Warsaw. [Beindorf] Did Kanther comment on the numbers that I mentioned at the beginning -- the 10,000 Bonn expected, compared to the only 3,000 refugees who were actually returned? [Von Lewies] No, he did not say a word. He downplayed the commotion and said the affair was played up by the media. [passage omitted]
