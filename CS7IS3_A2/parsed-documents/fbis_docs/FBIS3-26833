This is a vast area of fertile land. Amid the great tides of reform, opening up, and modernization construction, southern Jiangsu presents us with a brand-new pattern for economic and social development which is characterized by its distinctive local feature. This is land on which tens of millions of hard-working peasants are forging ahead along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. As early as 1983, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, chief designer of China's reform and opening up, spoke highly of the reform and construction of southern Jiangsu during an inspection tour to the region. At that time, the Suzhou area enjoyed a per capita annual industrial and agricultural output volume of nearly $800, taking the lead in the country in solving people's problems concerning food, clothing, daily necessities, housing, employment, education, culture, and other areas of public welfare. Tremendous changes also took place in the mental outlook of people there. Upon his return to Beijing from inspection trips to Jiangsu and other places, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in speeches -- which have been collected in Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping: "Evidently, the realization of the four modernizations promises high hopes of success." (Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, p. 24) A year later, at a meeting held by the central authorities, Comrade Deng Xiaoping again cited the example of southern Jiangsu, saying: "Their creations alone are amazing achievements!" "Material goods serve as a foundation. When our people enjoy a better material life and an enhanced cultural standard, their mental outlook surely will undergo great changes." (op. cit., p. 89) Today, southern Jiangsu has taken more strides along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. As soon as they set their foot on this hot land, people will be infected by the tremendous enthusiasm of the southern Jiangsu people engaged in the socialist construction, and will be filled with admiration at the remarkable results they have attained in the building of two civilizations. Facts have proved incontrovertibly that the success of southern Jiangsu is nothing less than a great creation of the southern Jiangsu people under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Arduous Yet Successful Explorations Under the Guidance of the Theory of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics Southern Jiangsu's successful practice can be attributed to its superiorities in natural resources, geographic location, and economic strength. However, superior objective natural conditions cannot create social miracles. For a considerably long period of time, the economic structure of southern Jiangsu as a whole did not display any fundamental differences from the economic structures of other areas in the country. The rural reform, which features the contracted responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, serves as an opportunity for China's rural areas to change from stagnant growth to prosperity. The vast numbers of cadres and masses in southern Jiangsu have seized this opportunity firmly. Relying on the immense energy released by the impact of reform and on their advantages accumulated through the collective economy, they have proceeded from realistic conditions and their own demands, put into effect the contracted responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output, and established peasants' autonomy in production and management. They have broken with egalitarism in distribution, and have allowed and encouraged some people to get rich first, thus considerably arousing the enthusiasm of the vast numbers of peasants to get rich through hard work. They gradually have lifted controls on the prices of agricultural and sideline products, eliminated a series of obstacles set by the system of unified purchases and distribution, and brought about great increases in the rural commodity rate. What needs to be specially mentioned is their vigorous effort to develop town and township industries; as a result, they have opened a new field for transferring surplus rural labor forces to nonagricultural industries, thus accelerating the process of turning the natural economy of rural areas into a commodity economy. Town and township industries are a great creation of the Chinese peasants, and the cadres and masses in southern Jiangsu have made outstanding contributions to this creation. Like all new things, town and township industries were not welcomed with flowers and applause when they first made their appearance in the historical arena; rather, they have experienced a winding course of development. During the period dominated by the planned economy, town and township enterprises had no planned products, no planned supply of raw and supplementary materials and energy, and no planned sales quotas or channels. What they could do was to find "rice" to "cook" and borrow "hens" to "lay eggs," and such practices invited all kinds of criticisms and accusations, claiming that these industries "were pounding the planned economy," "scrambling with state-owned enterprises for raw materials and markets," "undermining socialism," and "giving rise to unhealthy trends." In the face of such great pressure, the cadres and masses of southern Jiangsu believed that the road they were taking was the correct one, for the establishment of town and township industries tallies with the economic and social development rules in rural areas of southern Jiangsu, and also conforms to the interests of the vast numbers of peasants, as well as their hopes for extricating themselves from poverty and bringing about common prosperity. In June 1987, Comrade Deng Xiaoping set a high value on town and township enterprises: Our biggest unexpected harvest is the development and rise of town and township enterprises. He later stressed on many occasions: "Town and township enterprises are very important, and need to be further developed and enhanced." (op. cit., p. 355) The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have issued many important documents and have called many important meetings to reaffirm the value of town and township industries, and to stress the need for giving them policy support and guidance. All this has served as great encouragement to the cadres and masses of southern Jiangsu, and also has provided a fundamental guarantee for town and township industries to attain rapid growth on a smooth road. Since then, peasants have started to run industries, thus expediting the process of industrialization, urbanization, agricultural mechanization, and modernization in rural areas. This was the first great rise for town and township enterprises in the 1980's. The second rise started in 1992 and featured export-oriented high-tech industries, thus bringing about a satisfying situation wherein town and township enterprises are run in a large scale and can produce high-grade and fine-quality products. At present, town and township enterprises in southern Jiangsu have established their position as a pillar of the entire rural economy. Relying on the tremendous economic strength created by town and township industries, the collective economy that depends mainly on the public ownership has been consolidated constantly, the rural modernization has begun to take off, and the construction of small towns and townships has accelerated continuously. As a result, tens of millions of peasants are leading a fairly comfortable life. The success of southern Jiangsu in using its distinctive features to explore a road of development has sketched a brand-new portrait of socialist modern rural areas. -- The economy of southern Jiangsu is growing at an unprecedentedly high speed. During the period from 1979 to 1992, the GNP of southern Jiangsu grew at an average annual rate of 16.5 percent, with the total value ten times higher than before. Most of the counties (cities) in the rural areas of southern Jiangsu have doubled once and again their annual total industrial and agricultural output values, among which some could double their output value in about five years. Take the case of Wuxi County, which ranks first among China's 100 best counties in comprehensive indexes. From 1978 to 1991, the county's average GNP went up by 20.2 percent every year; the per capita distribution level of peasants rose by 18.4 percent; and its total financial income by 12.71 percent. Moreover, the county attained the goal of quadrupling its industrial and agricultural production ahead of schedule. -- In the rural economic structure of southern Jiangsu, the proportion of the nonagricultural sector miraculously has surpassed that of the agricultural sector, and definitely has become a pillar industry. By the year 1992, the total industrial output value of town and township industries in southern Jiangsu accounted for over two thirds of the total economic value of society. The Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou region, which has a population accounting for only 0.88 percent of the country's total, attained a total town and township industrial output value amounting to 16.8 percent of the country's total. -- The rural areas of southern Jiangsu have adopted positive measures to coordinate relations between industry and agriculture so as to stabilize and develop agricultural production. Fine-quality and highly efficient agricultural production bases have been set up to push forward the process of putting into use machinery, chemicals, improved varieties, water conservancy, and social services in agriculture. During the Seventh Five-Year Plan, the agricultural aid funds provided by the southern Jiangsu region reached a figure higher than 4 billion yuan, or five times higher than the state input during the same period. Relying on the real strength of the collective economy, Wuxi County has set up more than 600 small farms of all types at all levels, and has ensured well-coordinated development in primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in rural areas. -- The progress of rural economic development in southern Jiangsu has brought about profound changes in the economic and social structure of rural areas. A large number of small towns and townships have emerged, and have become commercially prosperous hubs that link urban and rural areas on the basis of fairly complete facilities and functions, and convenient transport conditions. In addition, they have become hot spots for peasants to live and work. This move has improved the conditions and quality of peasants' production and life to a considerable extent, and has greatly accelerated the process of turning the rural industrial structure into a nonagricultural structure, as well as the process of urbanizing the population mix. -- With strong economic backing, all social undertakings and the building of socialist spiritual civilization in rural areas of southern Jiangsu have attained remarkable progress. The rural areas of southern Jiangsu have made great improvements in educational conditions, and rank among the country's best in perfecting the educational system and in good teaching facilities. Fairly rapid growth also has been attained in all kinds of social undertakings, including medical care and public health, culture and sports, press and television, social insurance, public welfare, urban afforestation, and family planning. The rural areas of southern Jiangsu now have basically reached their goal of providing the young with education, the old with old-age care, the sick with proper medical treatment, and the victims of natural disasters with sufficient relief. As a result, people in the region have taken on an entirely new mental outlook, and public security there is also quite satisfactory. -- The glorious accomplishments achieved by the rural areas of southern Jiangsu through their hard struggle have been recognized unanimously by all sectors of society. Among China's 100 best rural counties with strong comprehensive economic strength in 1991, 11 counties (cities) among the 12 in southern Jiangsu ranked among the first of the 100 counties. According to an appraisal made by the Jiangsu Provincial Statistics Bureau in 1992 of the comprehensive economic strength of more than 2,000 towns and townships throughout the province, the first 10 of the province's "100 best towns and townships" were towns and townships in southern Jiangsu. The enhancement of the region's real economic strength has given general expression to the accomplishments attained in practice by southern Jiangsu, and also to the region's success in practice. "Three Main Bodies," "Two Coordinations," and "One Common" -- Southern Jiangsu's Distinctive Experience Gained Through Practice The rural areas of southern Jiangsu have opened up a road for development with special regional features, and have given shape to a unique pattern for economic and social development: "The Southern Jiangsu Pattern." The following are its salient features: "Three main bodies" -- Regard public ownership and the collective economy as the main body of the ownership structure; regard town and township industries as the main body of the industrial structure; and regard market orientation as the main body of the economic operational mechanism. "Two coordinations" -- Bring about coordinated development among the region's economic and social sectors, and coordinated development between building the material and the spiritual civilizations. "One common" -- Uphold the principles of distribution according to work and of more pay for more work; take into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual; and open up a road for gradually bringing common prosperity to peasants within the community. "The Southern Jiangsu Pattern" is one of the rural development patterns that emerged in China during the process of transforming traditional agriculture into modern agriculture, and transforming a natural economy into a large-scale commodity economy. In addition, the pattern is also a great achievement attained by the peasants of southern Jiangsu who, proceeding from realities, integrate the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics with the realistic conditions of southern Jiangsu, take their own road, and build up the new socialist countryside with the characteristics of southern Jiangsu. Their success can been observed in the following aspects: First, They have consolidated and perfectd socialist public ownership, integrated efforts to give play to the advantages of the collective economy with efforts to mobilize the enthusiasm of laborers, and enabled rural productive forces to grow at a high speed. Known for its very solid and powerful collective economy, the rural areas of southern Jiangsu persistently have regarded the collective economy as the main body of the ownership structure. In the process of effecting the contracted responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, this region has paid attention to stabilizing and reinforcing the foundation of the collective economy, created a management mechanism whereby unified management is combined with separate management, and effectively integrated efforts to give play to the advantages of the collective economy with efforts to mobilize the individual enthusiasm of peasants. Of southern Jiangsu's total industrial output value in 1992, the output value of industries under collective ownership accounted for 80.52 percent, while the proportion of production-oriented fixed assets owned by the second-grade collective economy reached as high as 91.8 percent. Facts have proved that the ownership structure of southern Jiangsu, with the collective economy as its main body, can entirely meet the development needs of productive forces at the present stage, and not only can accommodate but also can greatly push forward the development of productive forces. The endless vitality and superiority of the collective economy have been displayed by its powerful strength in coordinating economic interests among all sectors in rural areas, and in pushing forward the development of town and township industries, agriculture, and other trades. Second, They have readjusted the industrial structure, regarded town and township industries as pillar industries, and relied on their own resources to create the material conditions for attaining well-coordinated development in all industries and trades in rural areas. It is another prominent sign of the comprehensive and successful development of southern Jiangsu to rely on industries for well-coordinated development among agriculture, sideline production, industry, and commerce, and for all-round growth in the rural economy. Relying on its natural links with urban industries and commerce, the southern Jiangsu region entered the industrial sphere earlier than other regions across the country. In addition, it has continuously increased the proportion of industries, increased the total quantity of industries, reorganized the industrial structure of rural areas, and gradually taken to the road of rural industrialization. In southern Jiangsu, people already have reached this consensus: Without strong town and township industries, there will be no stable agriculture, no flourishing tertiary industries, no blooming construction of small towns and townships, and no comprehensive prosperity of the entire urban and rural economy. Third, They have made full use of the market mechanism; broken down barriers between regions, and between urban and rural areas; and accelerated economic development according to the needs of the market. The market economy is a highly efficient economic means of pushing forward the development of the socialist economy. The secret of southern Jiangsu's rapid economic takeoff lies in its persistence in carrying out market-oriented reform. An enterprise has to face the market right from its birth, and then grow and strengthen through the trials of the market. Its production and management should rely entirely on the orientation of the market and should suit the changes of the market. Its main factors of production will not depend on the distribution and supply of the state, but be determined by the market. It should withstand the trials of market competition in which only the superior can survive, and its fate will be decided by its victory or failure in market competition. Led by town and township enterprises, the entire economy of southern Jiangsu will take positive steps to adapt itself to the demands of the market and will make full use of the market operational mechanism. This has been reflected mainly by the following: Relying on the market to seek opportunities to expand enterprises through many ways; opening up new markets, relying on large and medium-sized cities and major industries, and building up all-positioned multilevel domestic and overseas market systems; making use of the market, extensively assimilating and organizing social resources, and accelerating the cultivation of markets for all major factors of production. We can say without any exaggeration that southern Jiangsu, especially town and township enterprises in southern Jiangsu, are pioneers in the development of the socialist market economy. Fourth, They have brought about well-coordinated economic and social development, and paid attention to strengthening the building of material civilization while building up a high-degree of socialist spiritual civilization. The more we carry out reform and opening up, the more we need to strengthen the building of the socialist spiritual civilization. This gradually has become a consensus among the cadres and masses in the southern Jiangsu region. People in southern Jiangsu have realized through practice that all work should obey and serve the key task of economic construction, and that failure to boost the economy will mean no accomplishment in all other fields. Only when we uphold two civilizations can we bring about and ensure healthy, stable, and rapid development [jian kang, wen bu, xun su fa zhan 0256 1660 4489 2975 6598 6643 4099 1455] in economic construction; only when we strengthen the building of spiritual civilization around the center of economic construction can we attain well- coordinated development in the building of the two civilizations. Through more than 10 years of exploration and summarization, this region has accumulated the following rich experiences: 1) Leaders at all levels have attached great importance to building the two civilizations. Principal leaders of party and government organizations in all localities and departments persistently do two types of work simultaneously, attaching equal importance to both; 2) Attention has been paid to the "five major buildings" of ideology, moral practice, culture, democracy and the legal system, and social public utilities; 3) Efforts have been made to stress input and infrastructure, to make full use of economic strength accumulated in the course of high-speed economic growth, and to reinforce the basics and hardware of spiritual civilization; 4) Strides have been taken to place emphasis on planning and implementation, to regard the building of the spiritual civilization as an important part of creating a sound investment environment, and to list this as one of their work targets; 5) A series of effective mass activities has been carried out to promote the building of the spiritual civilization and to guide the masses to participate and receive education. Such activities include systematic appraisals of outstanding households with new social practices and civilized villages and towns. Fifth, They have upheld the principle of distribution according to work, opposed egalitarianism while preventing polarization, and guided the vast numbers of peasants onto the road of common prosperity. The practice in rural areas of the contracted responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output serves to break away from the production and distribution patterns of the past, which featured "large-scale operation" and "everybody eating from the same big pot." Relying on the collective economy, governments and social organizations at all levels in southern Jiangsu have set up a multi-element interest distribution mechanism, which relies mainly on cooperative economic organizations in towns and villages, so as to regulate interest relations among all sectors of rural areas; to handle correctly relations among the state, the collective, and the laborers; to unify in an appropriate way the policy of allowing some of the people to get rich first with the target of attaining common prosperity; to uphold the principle of placing the primary stress on efficiency, while giving fair consideration to issues of secondary importance; to put into effect within the collective economy a general practice of "sharing profits gained from industrial production, shouldering risks in agricultural production, and allowing each sideline product to try its best"; and to rationalize the income gap of labors in the community through a practice that relies mainly on distribution according to work, makes allowance distribution (such as encouraging the subsidization and development of agriculture by industry) supplementary, and advocates common consumption (such as community welfare undertakings). "With neither nouveau riches nor poverty-stricken households, every family is leading a fairly comfortable life" -- this is a vivid depiction of how peasants in this region are taking to the road of common prosperity. "Three main bodies, two coordinations, and one common" is a new road opened up by the rural areas of southern Jiangsu in the process of reform, opening up, and modernization drive, as well as an illustrative and concrete practice of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in this region. From this successful practice, people can find strong evidence to prove that Comrade Deng Xiaoping is correct in his definition of the essence of socialism, that is, "to emancipate and develop the productive forces, eliminate polarization, and bring about common prosperity." Study New Situations, Solve New Problems, and Constantly Deepen the Practice of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics in Southern Jiangsu The experience gained by southern Jiangsu is also a successful experience that has passed the test of practice, and has undergone constant improvement and attained new progress alongside the development of practice. The most precious point about southern Jiangsu's experience is that the region has never rested content with what it has achieved, never relaxed its efforts to forge ahead, and never stopped on the same spot. This is because the concept of remaining at the same level tallies neither with the Marxist outlook on development nor with the nature of the southern Jiangsu people. At the initial stage of the development of town and township industries, peasants in the region created something by carrying out a practice whereby peasants worked at factories in the daytime and in the fields at night, "acted as both workers and peasants," "left the fields without leaving their homeland," and "entered factories without entering cities." Alongside the constant enhancement in the level of productive forces and in economic strength, they have created other brand-new experiences in exercising an appropriate scale of land operation and running various kinds of farms through the collectivization of agriculture and intensive management, thus bringing about bright prospects for a second takeoff since the adoption of the contracted responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output. Similar new creations can be seen in many fields in the development of southern Jiangsu. Today, the experience of southern Jiangsu has attracted public attention, yet the cadres and masses of southern Jiangsu have a broader view, and are always trying to correct their mistakes and put pressure on themselves in order to attain greater results in the future. The establishment of the socialist market economy system is a profound change. During this great change, southern Jiangsu needs to explore and study many prominent problems and use new methods to resolve them if it wants to push the economy onto a new stage and achieve new aims in its practice. -- Seek a more effective form of realization for the public ownership and the collective economy. At present, the form of realization adopted by town and township enterprises under collective ownership in southern Jiangsu is primarily community ownership featuring "townships and villages, each owning what they run." Although it has apparent superiorities, this form of ownership still gives rise to various degrees of ambiguity in property rights relations. The joint-stock cooperation system, which is on trial practice in southern Jiangsu, can be described as a solution to this problem. Possessing the strong points of both the joint-stock system and the cooperation system, the joint-stock cooperation system is more suited to the characteristics of the town and township collective economy, which relies mainly on medium-sized and small enterprises. Efforts should be taken to put the system into trial use, and to spread correct and efficient methods among the users. Conscientious studies also should be carried out on relevant issues concerning the present implementation of the joint-stock cooperation system, the establishment of a modern enterprise system, and the cultivation of a new microeconomic foundation. -- Uphold public ownership as the main body of the economy, and encourage and support other economic elements so as to attain common development. At present, the individual and private economies still occupy a relatively small proportion in some localities in southern Jiangsu. To solve this problem, positive measures should be drawn up to encourage the growth of nonpublic economies. In addition, studies need to carried out on how to encourage the common development of many other economic elements while ensuring the dominant position of the publicly owned economy. -- Perfect the industrial structure and bring about coordination among different industries. Southern Jiangsu has more advanced secondary industries, yet its tertiary industries are at a level lower than the average levels of the country and the province, while its primary industries also are faced with the question of how to enhance themselves on a constant basis. Under such circumstances, strides should be taken to study and implement relevant measures as soon as possible so as to further readjust and perfect the economic and industrial structures according to the needs of the new situation, and to bring about well-coordinated development in primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. -- Accelerate the pace of opening to the outside world, and vigorously enhance the level of foreign-oriented practices. The southern Jiangsu region has always attached great importance to and achieved real results in the aspect of opening to the outside world. Yet generally speaking, it still lags behind the Zhu Jiang Delta. The region should readjust its opening-up strategy, and should move from domestic markets to international markets, and from foreign-oriented practices to internationalized practices with great strides. Efforts should be made to make full use of the excellent opportunities brought about by the opening and development of the Pudong District, to formulate and implement an export-oriented economic development strategy in accordance with customary international practices, to set up large-scale enterprise groups and push them into the world market, and to take an active part in the international division of labor and in international cooperation. -- Do better planning, reinforce ecological and environmental protection, and bring about healthy development in the urbanization of rural areas. While pushing forward with rapid economic development, the industrialization of rural areas in southern Jiangsu also has given rise to many problems that should not be overlooked. The most prominent among these are the irrational planning and pattern of urban construction, the excessive occupancy of already infertile farmland, and the adverse impact on ecology and environment. All these problems have aroused the attention of leaders and relevant departments in the southern Jiangsu region. We still need to make up our minds and exert great efforts to seek strategies and measures to solve these problems, so as to bring about healthy development in the industrialization and urbanization of rural areas, and to make the two supplement each other. The arduous explorations carried out by the southern Jiangsu people over the past 10 years or more are yielding fruitful results, and the success of their practice is convincing. In the face of the new situation and the opportunities for future development, the cadres and masses of the southern Jiangsu region are greeting the trials of this era with a brand-new attitude. Surely they can constantly win new victories in reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive as long as they uphold the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, never waver in carrying out the party's basic line, emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts, carry out hard struggle, and have the courage to forge ahead and open up new paths. A new, socialist southern Jiangsu that enjoys "a prosperous economy, advanced science and education, a fairly comfortable life, sound social security, and civilized social practices" soon will present itself once again with a magnificent posture before the eyes of the people of the whole country!
