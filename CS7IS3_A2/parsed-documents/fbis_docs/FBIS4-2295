FBIS4-2295 "drchi068_v_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 TAIWAN Council Urges Media To Condemn Beijing on Rights Violations Council Urges Media To Condemn Beijing on Rights Violations OW0804080994 Taipei CNA in English 0732 GMT 8 Apr 94 OW0804080994 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Sofia Wu] [Text] Taipei, April 8 (CNA) -- The National Press Council of the Republic of China [ROC] Friday [8 April] pleaded for world attention to Mainland China's callous handling of a recent travel disaster in which 24 Taiwan tourists died. The council also asked two major world press organizations -- the International Press Institute and the Freedom Forum -- to join Taiwan in condemning Beijing's human rights violations. The council said in its letters to the two organizations that Chinese communist authorities have continued to withhold information on the cause of the disaster and refused to give Taiwan reporters access to the incident site. The 24 Taiwan tourists, along with six mainland crew members and two guides, were burned to death inside the lower cabin of a cruise ship that was ferrying them across Qiandao (Thousand Island) Lake in Zhejiang Province on March 31. "While the victims' relatives are depressed and anxious to know the truth about the disaster, mainland authorities have blacked out news coverage of the accident," the council said. It added that mainland authorities have even performed autopsies on the bodies without consulting relatives of the victims, and restricted the movement of the grieving relatives who rushed to the mainland after the disaster. Moreover, mainland officials have barred the relatives from taking photographs of the victims' bodies as well as barred Taiwan reporters from visiting the shed where the boat is being kept. A TV reporter from Taiwan was even temporarily detained and other TV reporters have reportedly been harassed over their news coverage. "The rights of free access to news and the public's right to know have been disregarded by mainland authorities," the council said. "Mainland officials' inhumanity in handling the disaster and flagrant violation of press freedom should be condemned by the international community," it added. In its letters, the council also condemned Beijing for sentencing Xi Yang, a Chinese reporter for the Hong Kong newspaper MING PAO, to 12 years in jail on charges of stealing state financial secrets. The council said Xi's conviction cannot be deemed a judicial judgment since Beijing authorities have so far not given evidence to prove Xi had been doing anything apart from normal news gathering. Xi was detained on Sept. 27, 1993 and formally arrested 10 days later. He faced a secret trial and has been denied contact with his family and friends since his detention. "The conviction is a flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Mainland China has signed," the council noted.
