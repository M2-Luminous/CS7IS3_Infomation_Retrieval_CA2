FR940513-2-00043 FR940513-2-00028 On October 5, 1992, M.A. Norden Company (Norden Company) formally applied to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for reconsideration of the June 15, 1984 Final Determination for the Norden Company site in Mobile, Alabama pursuant to section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act to accommodate a scaled down proposal. Additional information supporting this request was received by EPA on August 5, 1993. EPA made visits to the Norden Company site in February 1992 and September 1993. As more fully described below, Norden Company has proposed to discharge 9,300 cubic yards of dredged or fill material into approximately 1.5 acres of wetlands on the section 404(c) restricted site in order to construct a roadway to provide access to an adjacent upland site. This new proposal would reduce the direct impacts of the original proposal from 25 acres of wetlands filled to approximately 1.5 acres filled. The June 15, 1984 Norden Final Determination restricts the use of the entire 25 acre Norden Company site for any discharges of dredged or fill material. Therefore, implementing this new proposal would require that EPA amend the 1984 Final Determination. If EPA, upon consideration of the original administrative record, the new proposal, supporting documentation, and any public comments, determines that such amendment is appropriate, a section 404 permit issued by the Corps of Engineers would still be necessary before discharges associated with the access road could proceed. Norden Company would have to follow the standard permitting process for that approval. That process provides an additional opportunity for public notice and comment. Proposed Activities Norden Company has submitted a detailed description of the proposed project. The project description below is based on these Norden Company submissions and may be further revised in the section 404 permit application review process. The proposal is to extend an existing abandoned railway spur across the site as a vehicular roadway for use by heavy truck (container) traffic from the Port of Mobile facilities to a storage area on the upland. The existing railway spur is 30 feet wide and 900 feet long. It would be widened and extended, at a slight angle, approximately 600 feet across the wetlands and drainage canal to reach an upland area. Approximately 9,300 cubic yards of sand material on geotechtile fabric will be placed in the wetlands for roadbed fill. The typical road section will be 36 feet wide at the top and 60 feet wide at the base with 3:1 side slopes. Silt screens will be erected and the side slopes will be seeded and mulched to prevent erosion and sedimentation of the adjacent waters and wetlands. Four concrete culverts (three 24 inch diameter culverts and one 36 inch diameter culvert) will be placed through the fill, underneath the roadway to allow for exchange of water between the divided portions of the wetland. A box culvert will be placed in the existing drainage canal to allow for unobstructed flow. Mitigation for project impacts is proposed in the form of providing culverting where none previously existed through the railway spur to allow for better water circulation. Norden Company anticipates that the work would be completed in six months. EPA is soliciting comments on the current proposal by the Norden Company. Specifically, comments should address whether this proposal would have lesser impacts on the aquatic environment than the project which was originally proposed. In addition, EPA is interested in determining whether there are less environmentally damaging practicable alternatives to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem while fulfilling the basic project purpose.
