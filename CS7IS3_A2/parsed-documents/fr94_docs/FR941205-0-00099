FR941205-0-00099 FR941205-0-00024 62. On May 26, 1993, the Commission adopted an Order, 58 FR 32452 (6/10/93), denying a Request for Stay submitted by Yankee Microwave, Inc. (``Yankee''). In subsequent pleadings Yankee requested reconsideration of that Order, or alternatively, the immediate grant of its petition for reconsideration. Yankee sought relief, on behalf of its cable system customers, from the provisions of ยง76.64(b)(2) regarding the superstation exception. Alternatively, Yankee requested revision of that section of our rules so it would apply to microwave carriers of a superstation signal, as well as to satellite carriers of such a signal. By Order of the Chief, Mass Media Bureau, a temporary waiver was granted to Yankee upon a finding by the Bureau that Yankee would suffer irreparable harm if the provisions of the rule were enforced prior to our decision on the pending petitions for reconsideration. On October 5, 1993, the Mass Media Bureau adopted an Order which denied a similar request filed by EMI, Inc. (``EMI'') primarily based on that party's lack of a showing of imminent harm. We now address the requests and oppositions raised by parties to this proceeding. 63. In the Report and Order we rejected arguments that the retransmission consent requirement should not apply to superstation signals delivered via terrestrial means such as microwave. Petitions for reconsideration argue that the effect of the rule is to unfairly discriminate in favor of satellite carriers to the detriment of alternative delivery methods such as microwave. We are persuaded by commenters that the unintended effect of the rule is to unfairly discriminate against alternative methods of delivery of a superstation signal. We believe, consistent with the stated purpose and intent of the 1992 Cable Act, that it is the delivery of satellite signals, not the manner of delivery which should be excepted from the retransmission consent requirement. In other words, if a superstation meets the definition of ``superstation'' contained in the Copyright Act, then the manner of delivery of such a signal shall not control. However, as discussed more fully below, the exception will only apply to delivery of such a superstation signal outside the local market of the station. 64. Rights of superstations within the local market. Section 614 defines a local commercial broadcast station as any full power commercial television broadcast station licensed by the Commission that is located in the same television market as the cable system. As long as the local commercial broadcast station delivers a good quality signal and agrees to indemnify the cable system for any additional copyright liability, the station is entitled to must-carry rights within the local market. Otherwise, that station has the right, pursuant to Section 325(b) (4)&hyph;(5), to elect retransmission consent. Section 325 states that the term ``superstation'' shall be defined according to Section 119(d) of Title 17 of the United States Code. Section 119(d) of Title 17 defines a superstation as ``a television broadcast station other than a network station, licensed by the Federal Communications Commission that is secondarily transmitted by a satellite carrier.'' 65. We believe that Congress intended for all local commercial broadcast stations to have the option to assert either must-carry or retransmission consent within their individual market. These local commercial broadcast stations do not become superstations until such time as they are retransmitted via satellite outside their market, an activity unrelated to their status as local commercial broadcast stations within their market. Therefore, such local commercial stations retain the right to elect between must-carry and retransmission consent within their market.
