FR940913-0-00049 FR940913-0-00016 40 CFR Part 52 [OH57&hyph;2&hyph;6367; FRL&hyph;5054&hyph;5] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Ohio AGENCY: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The USEPA is partially approving and partially disapproving a requested revision to the Ohio State Implementation Plan (SIP) for particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ) for sources within specified source categories that require continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) and reporting. The revision request consists of CEM requirements contained in operating permits. USEPA is disapproving the CEM requirements contained in expired permits and approving the CEM requirements that are contained in unexpired permits. Additionally, there are no NO x sources in the specified category. Therefore, USEPA is also approving Ohio's negative declaration for NO x sources. USEPA's action is based upon a revision request which was submitted by the State to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule becomes effective on October 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the SIP revision request, public comments on the rulemaking and other materials relating to this rulemaking are available for inspection at the following address: (It is recommended that you telephone Maggie Greene, at (312) 886&hyph;6088, before visiting the Region 5 Office.)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Summary of State Submittal On January 5, 1987, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) submitted to the USEPA a request for a revision to the Ohio SIP for particulate matter and nitrogen oxides for sources within specified source categories that require continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) and reporting. The revision request consisted of CEM requirements contained in operating permits for 116 associated sources at 37 facilities. The revision was submitted to satisfy the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(F)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Clean Air Act and the specific provisions described in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P. Section 110(a)(2)(F) provides that the SIP must require the installation of equipment to monitor emissions from stationary sources, periodic reporting of such emissions and correlation of such reports with any emission limitations established in the SIP for source categories identified in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P. The source categories and the respective monitoring requirements identified in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P are listed below: 1. Fossil fuel-fired steam generators. This category shall be monitored for opacity, nitrogen oxide emissions, sulfur dioxide emissions, and oxygen or carbon dioxide. 2. Fluid bed catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerators. This category shall be monitored for opacity. 3. Sulfuric acid plants. This category shall be monitored for sulfur dioxide emissions. 4. Nitric acid plants with greater than 300 tons per day production capacity shall be monitored for nitrogen oxide emissions. On March 11, 1994, the USEPA published a rulemaking action in the Federal Register (59 FR 11569) proposing to disapprove the requested revision because the CEM requirements were contained in expired permits and were no longer enforceable. USEPA stated in the proposed rulemaking action that if the OEPA submitted up-to-date permits containing approvable CEM requirements for the facilities covered by the revision, USEPA would approve the revision request through the effective dates of such permits. On April 11, 1994, the OEPA submitted a new revision request to USEPA in response to the March 11, 1994 proposed rulemaking, along with its comments on the rulemaking. Comments were also received from Dayton Power and Light Company (DP&L), and Fuller & Henry on behalf of the Environmental Committee of the Ohio Electric Utility Institute and the following member companies: Buckeye Power, Inc., Columbus Southern Power Company, Dayton Power and Light Company, Ohio Edison Company, Ohio Power Company, Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, The Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company, and The Toledo Edison Company (Ohio Utilities). II. Public Comments and USEPA Responses USEPA's evaluation of the comments is summarized below. OEPA Comment: On May 5, 1987, USEPA approved Ohio EPA's SIP revision based on permits to operate which incorporated the appendix P sulfur dioxide monitoring requirements for Coulton Chemical Plant in Toledo, Ohio and the E. I. duPont de Nemours and Company facility in Miami, Ohio that were issued on January 3, and March 25, 1986, respectively. USEPA Response: This rulemaking action involves CEM requirements for particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions. As stated in the proposed rulemaking action, this revision request does not apply to the monitoring of sulfur dioxide emissions at fossil fuel-fired steam generators and sulfuric acid plants. The sulfur dioxide CEM requirements for the above facilities were discussed in a separate Federal Register rulemaking (54 FR 1693), dated January 17, 1989. OEPA Comment: Failure on the part of USEPA to act on the opacity monitoring provisions of the SIP in a timely manner has adversely affected the State since it is required to resubmit additional documentation and be subject to changes in USEPA policy. USEPA Response: This Agency is limited to taking action on the revision request that has been formally submitted to it, and has no choice except to disapprove CEM, recording, and reporting requirements contained in unenforceable expired permits. OEPA Comment: As late as April 8, 1994, Ohio EPA staff has been told that even if OEPA filed the required information in accordance with the March 11, 1994 Federal Register , the SIP submittal may not be approvable. USEPA Response: This comment seems to be the result of a misconception on the part of OEPA. USEPA stated in the March 11, 1994 Federal Register that if the OEPA submitted up-to-date permits, containing approvable CEM requirements, the USEPA would then approve the revision request in the final rulemaking action. In an April 5, 1994, discussion regarding furnishing OEPA example CEM rule language, it was mentioned that USEPA was exploring the possibility of conditionally approving the SIP revision request in the final action. It was further stated that conditionally approving the revision might not be possible and the issue would be discussed further with OEPA. No statement was made that the revision might not be approved if up-to-date permits were submitted to USEPA. Ohio Utilities Comment: The Ohio Utilities' stated concern with USEPA's proposed disapproval action is OEPA's proposed incorporation of the CEM program into Ohio's SIP on a permit-by-permit basis. This method of adopting approvable CEM requirements creates an unnecessary burden on Ohio EPA and the regulated community, fails to recognize the flexibility needed to operate a successful CEM program, and does not allow for due process as in the case of rulemaking. USEPA should instead require Ohio EPA to go through rulemaking procedures and adopt 40 CFR part 51, appendix P to satisfy CEM requirements. The Ohio Utilities also expressed concern that permit specific CEM requirements place unnecessary burdens on OEPA and the regulated community and that there is little or no opportunity for public comment. USEPA Response: The USEPA has requested that the OEPA go through rulemaking procedures and adopt the CEM requirements in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P by revising language in existing Ohio Administrative Code rules or by adopting new rules. OEPA's promulgation of rules will resolve the problems associated with incorporating the CEM requirements into the SIP on a permit-by-permit basis. The rules would require that all sources in a category listed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P install, calibrate, maintain and operate equipment for continuously monitoring, recording and reporting emissions in accordance with appendix P's minimum monitoring requirements. Section 119.03 of the Ohio Revised Code requires OEPA to provide public notice and hold a public hearing when rules are adopted, amended or rescinded. Written or oral comments may be presented at the public hearing. The rules would then be submitted to the USEPA as a SIP revision request. Thus, all interested parties would have an opportunity to comment before the revision to the SIP becomes final. Ohio Utilities Comment: The Ohio Utilities expressed concern about the fact that circumstances at a facility may change requiring a change in the CEM monitoring requirements and the facility would have to follow existing permit requirements, even though inapplicable, until OEPA revises the SIP. Additionally, Ohio Utilities expressed concern that the OEPA may have erroneously incorporated CEM requirements into permits for sources not covered by appendix P. USEPA Response: The USEPA understands the concerns of the Ohio Utilities. Instead of incorporating CEM requirements on a permit-by-permit basis, USEPA has requested that the OEPA revise existing rules or adopt new rules to incorporate the CEM requirements, for specified source categories, into the Ohio SIP. Any revised rules adopted by the State to establish its CEM program must meet all of the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(F)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Clean Air Act and the specific provisions contained in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P. As to the point regarding erroneous incorporation of CEM requirements into permits, it is not clear to USEPA which sources are being referred to by the Ohio Utilities. However, before the new rules are incorporated in the Ohio SIP, the regulated community will be given an opportunity to comment regarding the appropriateness of CEM requirements being applied to sources. Also, see USEPA's response below that addresses concerns about CEM requirements for two facilities. Adherence to the State and the Federal administrative procedure acts will ensure that the regulated community is afforded the due process associated with rulemaking actions. The CEM requirements being approved by this rulemaking action will be effective through the expiration date of the permits. Dayton Power and Light Company (DP&L) Comment: DP&L objects to USEPA including and/or identifying DP&L's Longworth and Hutchings Stations as being required to comply with the requirements of appendix P. USEPA Response: The OEPA submitted a SIP revision request, consisting of Permits to Operate to USEPA on January 5, 1987, and requested that USEPA rulemake only on those portions of the permits pertaining to the CEM requirements. The Longworth Station, Application No. 0857040016 B004, was identified in OEPA's January 5, 1987, submittal as a fossil fuel-fired steam generator with greater than 250 million BTU per hour heat input that requires CEM. The Permit to Operate for Longworth Station, Application Number 0857040016 B004 in OEPA's April 11, 1994, revised submittal does not contain CEM requirements, but instead provides for visible emission readings. Therefore, USEPA is not rulemaking on the Longworth Station Permit to Operate. DP&L Comment: DP&L's Hutchings Station has demonstrated to the State that it has an annual average capacity factor of less than 30 percent for its boilers and, pursuant to 40 CFR part 51, appendix P, paragraph 2.1 is not subject to CEM requirements. Because of the low annual average capacity factor, neither Ohio EPA nor the Regional Air Pollution Control Agency have required Hutchings Station to install opacity monitors. USEPA Response: 40 CFR part 51, appendix P, paragraph 2.1 requires CEM for fossil fuel-fired steam generators with an annual average capacity factor of greater than 30 percent as reported to the Federal Power Commission, or as otherwise demonstrated to the State by the owner or operator. The Special Terms and Conditions contained in the Permits to Operate submitted to USEPA by OEPA on April 11, 1994 for DP&L, Hutchings Station, Application Numbers 0857780013 B001 through 0857780013 B006, require that Hutchings Station undergo an annual review to determine if continuous opacity monitors must be installed. As requested by OEPA, USEPA is rulemaking only on the portions of the permits that contain CEM requirements. Therefore, USEPA is not rulemaking on the DP&L, Hutchings Station, Permits to Operate. DP&L Comment: DP&L expressed its concern about the CEM requirements being approved only through the effective dates of the permits and about the fact that the OEPA has not adopted rules to incorporate the CEM program requirements into the Ohio SIP. USEPA Response: As stated previously in USEPA's response to the Ohio Utilities comment, USEPA has requested that OEPA adopt new or revised rules for incorporating the CEM requirements of 40 CFR part 51, appendix P into the Ohio SIP. As to the limited duration of the approval, CEM plans are required by 40 CFR 51.214 to contain legally enforceable procedures for requiring stationary sources listed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix P, to install and operate CEM equipment. In this instance, USEPA can only approve the CEM requirements through the effective date of the permits, because expired permits are not legally enforceable and would, therefore, not meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 52, appendix P. III. Rulemaking Action USEPA is approving the CEM requirements through the expiration dates of the up-to-date Permits to Operate and disapproving the CEM requirements as to permits that have expired. CEM recording and reporting requirements are approved for sources at the following facilities: Cincinnati Gas and Electric (CG&E) Company&hyph;W. C. Beckjord Station CG&E Miami Fort Station Cleveland Electric Illuminating (CEI) Company (Centerior Energy) Ashtabula Plant ``C'' CEI Lakeshore Plant Columbus Southern Power Company (CSPC)&hyph;Conesville Station Dayton Power and Light (DP&L) Company&hyph;J.

OP Muskingum River Plant Orrville Municipal Power Plant Piqua Municipal Power Plant American Municipal Power-Ohio, Inc. Procter and Gamble Company Champion International, Hamilton Mill British Petroleum Oil Company&hyph;Toledo Refinery Ashland Petroleum Nitric acid plants of greater than 300 tons per day production capacity must be monitored for nitrogen oxides. The State of Ohio does not have any nitric acid plants that exceed the 300 ton per day production capacity. Therefore, USEPA is approving the State of Ohio's negative declaration for nitrogen oxide emissions at applicable nitric acid plants. USEPA is disapproving the CEM requirements contained in expired permits for the following sources: Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company, W. C. Beckjord Station, Application Nos. 1413100008 B001 and 1413100008 B04. Cleveland Electric Illuminating (CEI) Company, Ashtabula, Application Nos. 0204000211 B002 and 0204000211 B004.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq ., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements. I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPS on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S. Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). USEPA's disapproval of a portion of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA does not affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover, USEPA's disapproval of a portion of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA certifies that this action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 14, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
