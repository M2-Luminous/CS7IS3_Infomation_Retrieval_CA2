[Ja'ja'] Instead of quoting our sources, come to us and see for yourself, then you can write about what you are going to see all the way to my residence in Ghidras. [AL-HAYAH] Do you mean that there are roadblocks? [Ja'ja'] The issue is not the number of roadblocks or the troops, but the manner in which they are deployed along the roads leading to Ghidras. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] Have you contacted His Excellency President Ilyas al-Hirawi? [Ja'ja'] No, I have not contacted him so far. He was busy yesterday with the breakfast banquet he gave in B'abda Palace. [AL-HAYAH] And why have you not contacted him today (yesterday) [11 March]? [Ja'ja'] We do not want to disturb his excellency with this issue. We are leaving him to concentrate on the main issue, that is the Middle East negotiations. [AL-HAYAH] And with the Army command? [Ja'ja'] There are no contacts with the command. The contacts are made with some authoritative officers in the area. They reply that this presence lies within security deployments in the provinces. [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] The Army has been deployed in Ghidras for a long time. [Ja'ja'] The nearest point to Ghidras was less than a kilometer away. This point was concealed and not on the main road. We asked the Army command at the time about this point's task. We were told that its job was to supervise the valley. [AL-HAYAH] And what is happening now? [Ja'ja'] The Army is deployed in five directions: a point is set up in each direction. There is a point on the road leading to here. [AL-HAYAH] It is said that the measures include all areas, and that security units have lists of suspects involved in the bombing incidents. [Ja'ja'] Fine. Let them come and tell us who they are, and I am prepared to hand them over. Why overtake events when the investigation is under way? [passage omitted] [AL-HAYAH] It is reported that they have lists of suspects involved in security incidents, including an attempt on the president's life, and that the accusation is leveled at Raji 'Abdu, nicknamed the "captain." [Ja'ja'] Raji 'Abdu is not accused in the case concerning his excellency the president. He was accused of bombing the Rumyah barracks. Anyhow, his case is now in the hands of the Lebanese judiciary. When a verdict is passed and it becomes clear whether he has any link, they will see whether or not we are going to hand him over. [passage omitted]
