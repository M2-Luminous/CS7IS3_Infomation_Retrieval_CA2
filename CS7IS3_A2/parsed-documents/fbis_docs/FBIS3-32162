We think [words indistinct] decrease in funds caused by a drop in oil prices, the paralysis of activities in the country. Quite to the contrary, the country must produce more [word indistinct] with the efforts and work of all Ecuadorans, and it will never [words indistinct] solution to problems. [end recording]
