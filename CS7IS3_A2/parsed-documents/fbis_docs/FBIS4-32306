In the meantime, Henryk Goryszewski, the new chief of the presidential National Security Office [BBN], says that the president is the boss of the chief of the General Staff even now. "That is against the legal system in force," responds the defense minister. During a previous KOK session, Lech Walesa did not succeed in convincing all of its members to make the chief of the General Staff subordinated to the president of the country. Debate on the topic was postponed until today. KOK's composition includes: the president; the prime minister; Sejm and Senate speakers; chiefs of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Internal Affairs Ministry, and the National Defense Ministry [MON]; the finance minister; teh chief of the General Staff; the chief of the President's Office; and a secretary. Some of the officials (among them, the MON chief and the Sejm speaker) want the chief of the General Staff to be subordinated to the defense minister. MON will today again present the draft of a law describing presidential powers, as well as those of the defense minister and the chief of the General Staff. However, the draft does not include so-called safety valves that used to provide for sanctions in case, for instance, the chief of the General Staff were to exceed his powers. During the previous KOK session, it was precisely the "safety valves" that aroused many reservations on the part of the Belweder. The Small Constitution provides only that "the president, in consultation with the defense minister, appoints the chief of the General Staff." Details are defined in a statute. There has not been any doubt so far that, according to the legal system in force, the chief of the General Staff is subordinated to the minister. In yesterday's edition of POLSKA ZBROJNA, however, Henryk Goryszewski (BBN chief and a KOK secretary for a few days now), said that, according to the Constitution, the chief of the General Staff is subordinated directly to the president, even now. "This does not mean, of course, that the head of the General Staff is separated from the minister by a wall; however, he is also not subordinated to the president through the head of the National Defense Ministry," Goryszewski explained. "That is contrary to the legal system in effect," comments MON Chairman Piotr Kolodziejczyk, who also made the reservation that he has not yet read Henryk Goryszewski's statement.
