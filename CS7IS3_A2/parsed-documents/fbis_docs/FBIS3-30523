We were told this by today's guest, Aleksander Kwasniewski. Later today the leaders of the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance will meet. [Begin recording] [Kwasniewski] I am trying to convince both Marek Borowski and the prime minister about the hierarchy of issues. The most important issue for today is the budget; the most important issue is an effective government; personal matters are somewhere behind. I am convinced that if such principles are accepted by the prime minister then Marek Borowski will not submit his resignation--he is a responsible politician.... [Unidentified correspondent, interrupts] But did he say yesterday that he was withdrawing his resignation? [Kwasniewski] The resignation has not been submitted... [Correspondent, interrupting] It was submitted last Friday. [Kwasniewski] No, it was not submitted; it was just announced... [Correspondent, interrupting] Then did he withdraw his announcement? [Kwasniewski] Yes, if these principles are accepted then I think that the whole issue will be settled positively. [end recording] Kwasniewski added that he expects Prime minister Waldemar Pawlak's reply on the question of possible nominations for deputy ministers of defense, foreign affairs and internal affairs from among the coalition members. The prime minister will also explain the role of Jerzy Milewski, deputy defense minister and the head of the National Security Office, in the government.
