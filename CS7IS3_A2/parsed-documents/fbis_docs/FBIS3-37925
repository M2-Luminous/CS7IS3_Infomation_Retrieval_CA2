The president's press service has circulated the text of the greetings, which say: To the personnel and veterans of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation: With all my heart, I congratulate servicemen and members of their families, veterans of war and the Armed Forces, and the civilian staff of the Army and Navy on the Day of Defenders of the Fatherland. The Day of Defenders of the Fatherland holds a special place in the calendar of festivals. All the people celebrate it, paying a tribute of respect and gratitude to Russian servicemen. It is they who were the first to stand up against those who tried to destroy our state with fire and sword and to enslave our people. During the most difficult, mortally dangerous moments of the war, they bore the salvation of Russia without sparing their lives. Today it is you, servicemen of the Army and Navy, who are the worthy heirs and successors of martial traditions. Under difficult conditions, you are displaying steadfastness and endurance and are honorably carrying out your professional and civic duty. Like the whole of the country, the Armed Forces are currently going through a period of deep transformation. The Army is one of the main foundations of Russian statehood, the guarantor of peace, the guarantor of stability in the country and of the people's democratic gains. It is for this reason that it must be mighty and mobile, equipped with the most effective weapons systems. The state will do everything so that servicemen and members of their families will feel protected in social terms, in order that the prestige of the military profession is enhanced. I have no doubt that the personnel of the Russian Armed Forces will continue to be faithful to the Constitution, to their oath and duty, and will cherish the military vocation and military comradeship. I wish you, dear servicemen, your families and friends, veterans and civilian staff of the Army and Navy, robust health, happiness and prosperity. Honor, glory, and immense gratitude to you for your difficult military labor. I wish you success in your service and lives! [Signed] B. Yeltsin
