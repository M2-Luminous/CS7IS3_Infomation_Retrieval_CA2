In a telephone call he made today to the Suez Canal Authority [SCA] chairman, Engineer Muhammad 'Izzat 'Adil, the Qatari minister said that Qatar has postponed discussion of a project to build a pipeline to carry Qatar's natural gas to Italy following a recent offer from the SCA giving a 30.5 percent reduction to Qatari gas tankers using the Suez Canal. Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim added that the project to build a pipeline to carry Qatari gas to Europe through Israel is merely a project, the implementation of which is linked with Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and does not aim to damage the Suez Canal, because the latter "is all the Arabs' canal." The Qatari foreign minister stressed that his country will take no step on this project without considering the interests of the Arab countries, especially Egypt. He added that Arab and foreign media have exaggerated this issue. The Qatari foreign minister's telephone call was made following press statements by Engineer Muhammad 'Izzat 'Adil in which he expressed his concern about the negative consequences of building a pipeline to carry Qatari natural gas to Europe through Israel.
