Although it has attracted widespread attention, it has yet to command adequate notice. This editorial, which is being issued specifically to help launch this massive activity of investigation, study, and propaganda in a more vivid and thorough manner, briefly states some of our viewpoints for the purpose of discussion with our readers. As early as some 10 years ago, our country proposed the principle of "taking the improvement of economic efficiency as the central task" with regard to economic work. We can say that we have achieved considerable results in this regard, having enjoyed sustained national economic development for many years in a row. Enterprises are the basic units that create wealth in modern society. It is none other than the improvement of overall efficiency in enterprises that has helped our country gain and rapidly accumulate massive social wealth. This fact is obvious and palpable to everybody. Take as an example state-owned enterprises which constitute the most-discussed topic. We cannot simply characterize them with the phrase "poor economic efficiency." It would not be objective and fair if we did not adequately affirm the tremendous contributions made by state-owned enterprises, large and medium ones in particular, by overlooking their pivotal role in stabilizing and promoting the overall situation, their status as the main source of the country's financial revenue, and the many additional social functions they perform. Nevertheless, we must note that the economic efficiency of our country's enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises, is still not very ideal. Their input-output ratios remain low in many aspects, with some showing a downward trend. Some of them have failed to attain record levels in terms of the ratio between investment and productive capacity resulting from such investment, the profit rate on capital, labor productivity, and the index of efficiency in materials consumption. The total amount of losses in state-owned enterprises has increased. Efficiency has become a prominent issue that determines whether our country's economy can develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. In evaluating the general efficiency of our country's economy and enterprises, we must, therefore, conduct an extensive, objective, and concrete analysis against the backdrop of reform and development to avoid generalizing our conclusion. This is the first viewpoint we want to state. Perhaps people will ask: Why are our results consistently not ideal despite many years of calling for and working toward better economic efficiency? This question is not easy to answer because the factors affecting our efforts to improve efficiency are very complicated and cover a wide range of areas. Perhaps the answer lies here: Economic efficiency is difficult to improve because it is the result, as well as the general reflection, of many facets of the way the national economy functions. As our country's economy is making the transition from planning to a socialist market economy, this structural change has basically hampered economic efficiency. For example, the old investment structure shows considerable resistance to change, the "credit-inflated" development model has not been changed completely, and investors do not assume corresponding responsibility for economic efficiency. Consequently, the chronic disease of "investment starvation" is still hard to cure while the stubborn ailment of duplicating construction projects and feverishly launching new ones strikes frequently. This has predestined a sizable number of enterprises to incur losses even before they were formally established. Also, the experiment to establish a modern enterprise system has just started, and state-owned enterprises have yet to change their operating mechanisms effectively. Consequently, it is still difficult basically to halt the phenomena of "assuming responsibility for profits only but not for losses," of losing state-owned assets, and of shifting the economic efficiency of enterprises in other directions. Our country's economic structure also has hampered economic efficiency. Slow growth in peasants' incomes has inevitably affected the development of rural markets, curbed the sale of industrial goods, and left many of the products needed by peasants stranded in enterprises' warehouses. Naturally, it would be difficult to improve enterprises' efficiency. "Bottleneck" sectors such as communications and transportation also have prevented enterprises from bringing in raw materials and shipping their products to other places, thus affecting their economic efficiency. Enterprises' "internal functions" have directly hampered their efficiency. Even if enterprises have changed their operating mechanisms and are capable of "operating independently and assuming sole responsibility for their own profits and losses," there are still the questions of how to "operate independently" and whether to "assume responsibility for profits or losses." Whether enterprises can ultimately improve their economic efficiency depends on how they reform themselves internally, how they upgrade their technological levels, how they manage themselves, and how they perform in terms of quality, operations, and marketing. The truth that we emphasize about enterprises improving their "internal functions" is readily apparent if we look at the disparity between different enterprises operating under more or less similar conditions, and if we analyze the "good" and "bad" fortunes of a given enterprise during different periods. After analyzing the many factors that hamper economic efficiency, we understand that improving economic efficiency is a pressing task of the moment, as well as a long-term strategic task. We should vigorously carry it out over the long term by improving the macroeconomic environment while enlisting the efforts of individual enterprises. This task is the economic objective of our reform and development, as well as an important lever with which to advance reform and development. This is the second viewpoint we want to make. How should we improve economic efficiency? General Secretary Jiang Zemin has called for "hatching new ideas for development." New ideas are also needed for improving economic efficiency. We should explore new ways while maintaining the original effective methods. It can be said that the 14th National CPC Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee have basically provided such new ideas, the former by setting the goal of building a socialist market economy and the latter by adopting a corresponding "decision." A fundamental way to improve enterprises' efficiency is to bring enterprises onto the market and turn them into the main competitors there. This will allow the fittest to survive, let new enterprises emerge from among the old, and ensure continuous progress. People have raised the issue of how to organically combine the efforts to "invigorate state-owned assets" and "improve state-owned enterprises" on the basis of none other than the theory regarding market mechanisms playing their fundamental role in allocating resources. The course of action taken by the Beijing No. 1 Light Industrial Group, whose story appeared in this newspaper, is a case in point. People seem to have suddenly found the key to unlock the door of economic efficiency. We should continue to explore on the basis of this idea. The practice in 1993 has given people a newer, deeper, and more correct understanding of macroeconomic regulation and control. As a matter of fact, the market economy requires a closer integration of microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics is the foundation of macroeconomics, whereas macroeconomics serves as the environment for microeconomic activities. A great many enterprises have long understood quite well that this is the inherent meaning of market economics. Accordingly, they have always given consideration to both macroeconomics and microeconomics in their quest for economic efficiency. They not only study current market conditions but also forecast future trends. Rather than interpreting the state's macroeconomic regulation and control as an adverse restrictive factor, they take it as an important guide to their actions. Consequently, they are likely to achieve fairly good and steady economic efficiency while constantly coordinating the relations between microeconomics and macroeconomics. The Handan Iron and Steel Works, whose story appeared in the news media, is a case in point. To improve economic efficiency, we should make "investments in both tangible and intangible aspects." Some enterprises have taken the lead in correcting their past mistake of paying attention to "tangible aspects" to the neglect of "intangible aspects." And they have achieved considerable economic efficiency. Besides input in science and technology and better management -- something frequently stressed in the past -- the so-called "investment in intangible aspects" should also include the exercise of intellectual property rights and the study and implementation of enterprise strategies for development, products, operations, and marketing. The experience of some foreign enterprises in applying the law of the market economy, as well as regular operational strategy, is also worth emulating. It can be said that many ways and means for achieving economic efficiency in accordance with the law of the market economy are there for us to uncover, study, explore, and apply. This is the third point that we want to make. Economic efficiency is a matter of paramount importance, as well as a very complicated issue. Nevertheless, we can improve economic efficiency in a step-by-step manner so long as we grasp the essentials. In carrying out "China's Deep-Going March Toward Economic Efficiency," we must henceforth conduct more thorough activities of investigation, study, and propaganda. We should raise issues as well as analyze causes. More important, we should sum up and publicize some new ideas and good methods for solving problems. We believe that China's economy during the 21st century is bound to be a dynamic one that is structurally sound, rapidly expanding, and fairly efficient. Let us work together toward achieving this goal.
