Things are moving appropriately. We have already agreed on 50 percent of the issues presented to us today. In this, we not only see the opportunity to satisfactorily answer the demands but it is also an opportunity to produce a broad affinity on the agreements for a political solution to the Chiapas conflict and on the peace agreements. Today is Mexico's Flag Day. Today's Flag Day celebration in San Cristobal de las Casas has special significance for the negotiations. The Mexican flag allows us to: 1. Maintain and defend Mexico's territorial integrity. 2. Resolve the Chiapas conflict in Mexican territory. 3. Search for dialogue instead of confrontations because we trust Mexico and in its future. 4. It is necessary we reach agreements and respect each other to build a better fatherland. This is what I had to say today. Thank you for being here. You are very kind.
