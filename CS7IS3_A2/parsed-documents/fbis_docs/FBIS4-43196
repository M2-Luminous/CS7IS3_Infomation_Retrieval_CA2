PASOK lost a significant part of its support and should deal with it, even if the voter's attitude is different in the elections for the European Parliament. There are many reasons that the voters looked elsewhere and did not vote for PASOK again. The main reason is PASOK's economic policy. Therefore, the following question is raised: Will PASOK change its policy, and if so, how? Will it implement the same, or a more correct program with greater consistency and determination, or will it hand out benefits in order to regain its lost ground? Seeing the problem from a wider spectrum, Acting Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos acknowledged, while commenting on the election result, the government should not ignore the message it has received. He stressed that the government should continue implementing its policy in accordance with its preelection program. "We did not promise benefits," he said, and stressed: "We should implement our program with consistency." The message to New Democracy, whose leaders did not manage to prevent a further decrease in the party's support, is of another kind. It is a message that will create a very serious problem for [New Democracy Chairman] Miltiadhis Evert. New Democracy lost support, mainly to Political Spring, which has doubled its support in eight months. Political Spring has thus become an accountable factor not only in in terms of the opposition, but in the country's political landscape because of its role in the presidential election. That will determine whether or not the country will go to general elections in May 1995. Probably, Political Spring will chose the former in order to increase its support. The ballot also sent a message of optimism to the smaller parties whose approval ratings increased. The electorate wants the presence of small political parties. Yesterday's vote for the small parties was not merely a vote of sympathy or temporary support to prevent their disappearance. Of course the small parties should utilize the voters' support and react properly. The government and political parties should carefully analyze the election results and not undermine the value of messages that came out of the ballots.
