The victim said that he was trying to hand over the seventh and eighth chapters of the global concept of public security in Russia he had drawn up to Yuliy Gusman, his colleague in the deputy corps. In response to Gusman's flat refusal to familiarize himself with the paper, Captain Ivanov himself acknowledged, he said imprudently: "If you don't read it you will end up like Makarov." Hearing his name is so dubious a context, Andrey Makarov hit the LDPR adviser with a case, smashed his lip, tore off a pocket from his uniform, and tried to tear his shoulder boards.
