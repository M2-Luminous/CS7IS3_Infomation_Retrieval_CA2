Imports reached 27 billion dollars, 73 per cent of the 1992 level and 61 per cent of the 1991 level. The budget deficit in 1993 is expected to amount to 11 trillion roubles (seven per cent of the Gross Domestic Product), an 18-fold increase from 1992, while the inflation growth rate grew ten times. Unemployment in Russia reached 3.8 million people (as calculated in accordance with ILO [International Labor Organization] methods), of which 835 thousand are formally recognised as jobless.
