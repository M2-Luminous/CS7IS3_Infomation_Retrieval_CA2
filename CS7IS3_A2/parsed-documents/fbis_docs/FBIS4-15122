"I have already made a relevant proposal for creating the economic union, and now it largely depends on the leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States," Nazarbayev said at a meeting in the federation of Japan's economic organisations, refferring to his idea of an Euro-Asian union. He believes that the new structure can "help CIS states at least during modernization of their economies." Goods, which are produced now in the former Soviet Union, are competitive only on the domestic markets of CIS because of their low quality." Nazarbayev pointed out that he had always stood for economic integration, and expanding of relations but not for their elimination, which finally led to the economic collapse in the former Soviet Union. "What the politicians made was like cutting off arms and legs from a living organism, lives of millions of people become worse," he said. Two years ago, the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States was essential to promote a relatively peaceful separation within the framework of the former Soviet Union, though some states failed to avoid victims, according to Nazarbayev.
