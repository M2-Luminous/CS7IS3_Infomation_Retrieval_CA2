John Major, in a wide-ranging letter to the chairmen of constituency Conservative parties, also underlined the Government's determination to crack down on crime, to reform education and to bring peace to Northern Ireland. He insisted that the Tories remained the only party of low taxation and vowed that criminals would be made to pay for their crimes. He also denounced those with "fashionable attitudes" about education which were light years away from common sense. On the economy, he said: "As we start the New Year we can look forward with far greater confidence to a strengthening recovery -- and to the steady growth in jobs and prosperity that will come with it. "After a difficult period for many people, we now have a tremendous opportunity before us. We are seeing stronger-than-expected growth combined with lower-than-expected inflation. "It is time for us to be more confident as a country. To put the pessimists in their box. And to look at the opportunities before us and how to take them." He added: "The plain fact is that we are leading Europe out of recession and we must build on the advantages that gives us. "I want to build our recovery on sound foundations. I want a recovery that lasts." He said the Government had to bring the books back into balance and although it had to raise revenue it had not put up income tax rates. "The Conservative Party remains the party of the lowest possible tax and the only party whose instinct is to cut tax and leave money with individuals and families and not take it for the state. "We raise taxes only when we have to. They (opposition parties) raise taxes whenever they want to." The Prime Minister said there would be tough new measures against crime and legislation to return to traditional teaching methods. "Never before has such a comprehensive effort been launched to ensure that we prevent crime, that we catch criminals and that the guilty are convicted and punished." He added: "Our intention is to ensure that crime won't pay -- but criminals will." Mr Major said children had to learn at school the basic skills they would need in later life. As well as lessons to read and write and do sums, "they have to learn self-respect, respect for others and respect for authority." "Every child at school should be taught good discipline and good self-discipline. Good order brings good learning," said Mr Major. "Orderly classrooms, clear timetables, regular tests, homework, team sport and uniforms -- all these have a part to play in giving a sense of purpose and self-discipline to pupils. "I do not believe such ideas are old-fashioned. I believe they are essential -- and so do millions of parents." He stressed that children had to learn the difference between right and wrong. "If children are brought up in a moral vacuum, can it be any surprise if they later go off the rails? "If we spend more time making excuses rather than apportioning blame, is it any wonder if young people can no longer tell right from wrong, but see everything through a kind of haze?" He said many of the attitudes that took root in the 1960's and 1970's were very tolerant. "I admire tolerance...but if taken too far it does destroy standards. I believe there is a danger of that. "Many fashionable attitudes are light years away from the common sense instincts of the British people -- and those we now have to challenge. "And with our campaign to go Back to Basics, that is what we will be doing -- in our schools, criminal justice system, our welfare system and in the field of social work." On Northern Ireland, Mr Major repeated that so long as the majority wanted to remain within the UK they had a rock-solid constitutional guarantee that they could do so. "We also sent a clear message to the men of violence -- `If you lay down your arms -- and prove you mean it -- then the way will begin to open for Sinn Fein to come to the negotiating table.' "We have thrown down the gauntlet of peace. So now the onus is on Sinn Fein to pick it up. There is no excuse and no justification for them not to choose the path to democracy." The Prime Minister added: "I do not know whether the coming year will bring peace in Northern Ireland. But I hope and pray it does." He claimed that in local government Labour and Liberal Democrat councils were getting away with monumental waste and incompetence, and said this year's elections to the European Parliament were especially important. "We must send a signal that we want to carry on with the kind of agenda in Europe that Britain has been pushing. "After June 9, I want to see more Conservative MEPs representing Britain's interests in the European Parliament. That is why we will fight these European elections harder than we ever have before."
