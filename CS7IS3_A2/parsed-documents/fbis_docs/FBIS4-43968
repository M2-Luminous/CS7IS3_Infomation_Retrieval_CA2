According to government spokesman Dieter Vogel, the police will take part in a civilian operation by the Western European Union [WEU], which is also to be supported by the administrative authorities in Mostar. The WEU police contingent will be made up of a total of 200 police officers. The cabinet approved Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's view that a stronger international police element was necessary for the success of the European Union [EU]-appointed administrator, SPD [Social Democratic Party] politician Hans Koschnick, Vogel said. The precondition for the start of the EU's administration in Mostar and sending the police was the complete demilitarization of the town under the supervision of the UN Protection Force, Vogel said. The police would only work "in safe surroundings." If the security situation did not meet the strict requirements of the EU, then the administration would be suspended and the personnel withdrawn. Germany will make 50 new 20-tonne low-loaders available to the United Nations for "urgently required" heavy goods transport in war-torn Yugoslavia. The United Nations will also be given 16 German experts to deal with the opening and starting up of the airport in Tuzla. The German Government is also willing to get involved in aid flights with Bundeswehr aircraft once the airport is open.
