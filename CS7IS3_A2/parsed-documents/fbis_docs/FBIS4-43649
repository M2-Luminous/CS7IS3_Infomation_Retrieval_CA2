The proposed law was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives last month, but still has to be passed by the Senate. Under the law, Washington would pull a large part of its troops out of Europe if the NATO allies were not to agree to pay 75 percent of the costs. In Washington, the Dutch defense minister told U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry he found the proposals unacceptable. Minister ter Beek said the planned burden-sharing was anything but fair.
