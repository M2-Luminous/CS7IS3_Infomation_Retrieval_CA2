Seeking the reasons for such "hysteria," Lipovats notes that FYROM is a "small, new country of people with little historical background that has tried too hastily to acquire an identity by abusing the symbols of a neighbor [Greece] with an ancient history." Lipovats argues that the "Slavo-Macedonian majority" in the FYROM is not politically homogeneous, with only part of it being "chauvinistic and anti-Greek" while the majority still views Greece favorably. The Greek Government's "feckless" policy toward the Macedonia issue in the last four years has reinforced the intransigence of certain elements of the FYROM's population; in addition, what Lipovats terms the "foolish" talk about an "Islamic arc" and an opposing "Orthodox arc" has led to Greece's isolation within the European Union (EU) and pushed the FYROM to seek support from Turkey. Contending that the resulting confusion has encouraged "backward, conservative, and anti-European forces" in Greece, Lipovats writes that the "so-called national consensus" on the FYROM has created an "unholy alliance between church and state based on the abuse of both history and religion." The violence of the Greek attitude on FYROM, manifested through newspaper articles, rallies, and political pronouncements, is unrelated to the reality of the FYROM issue, which is of "limited and undramatic" importance, Lipovats concludes. Andrianopoulos Accepts `Macedonia' as Geographic Unit A brief commentary in the 10 April Athens weekly KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA states that New Democracy (ND) luminary Andreas Andrianopoulos praised Bulgaria for recognizing FYROM as the "Republic of Macedonia" based on the argument that this "is a mere geographical term and, moreover, its inhabitants are not Macedonians but Bulgarians." Andrianopoulos is reported as saying that Greece "could have taken the same tack, remaining unconcerned about the name issue and recognizing Skopje's geographical entity, but reserving the right to take action in response to possible future talk about the `unredeemed nation of Macedonians.'" "It is not coincidental," Andrianopoulos is quoted as saying, that the Macedonians "have not uttered a word about Bulgaria." Deal Advocated on Macedonia Name Issue An article in the 9 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA cites ND deputy and former Minister of Education Yeoryios Souflias as saying that Greece should negotiate with the FYROM on a composite name that would include the term "Macedonia" followed by a geographical definition. The article reports that at a recent speech in Salonica, Souflias said that "instead of aspiring to the most desirable, it is time to move in the direction of the most achievable."
