Chokechai Aksaranan, president of the Federation of Thai Industries, said the move would directly benefit Thai business. The fact that Thailand and Vietnam are geographically close will help transport of goods such as consumer products and construction materials which Vietnam wants very much, he said. Thailand will be in the most advantageous position to be a springboard for investment in Vietnam. Mr Chokechai expects more Thai investors to seek joint ventures with Americans to invest in Vietnam because of the United States' higher technology. A Thai Petrochemical Industry Co executive, Prachai Leophairatana, said the lifting of the embargo, if it occurred, would greatly expand business in Vietnam because of the flood of foreign capital into that country. The end of the sanctions will enable new investors to enter Vietnam and this will be a good time for Thai businessmen to sell their products. As Mr Prachai is in the petrochemical industry dealing with plastic and cement, he noted that this would be a good chance to sell building materials to Vietnam. In supplying construction materials such as cement, the country with the best advantage will be the nearest because transport of the commodity costs a lot. In the short term, Thai investors will be in a better position than others, but in the long run, if Thai investors do not adapt, they will be disadvantaged particularly in terms of competition in marketing and technology, he said. Thirachit Satirotwong, a member of the Federation of Thai Industries, said Thai businessmen had prepared for a long time and sent several teams to explore investment opportunities in Vietnam. He expects more investment if the embargo is lifted. A United Gommunication Industry (UCOM) executive, who declined to be named, said that UCOM recently approached Vietnamese authorities to join an iridium project to link Indochina with the rest of the world. Vietnam had agreed but could not join officially because of the embargo, he said. The lifting of the embargo will clear the way for Vietnam to take part. The $3.3-billion iridium system is a worldwide, digital, satellite-based cellular personal communications system designed mainly to provide commercial and governmental links through mobile phones within a country and abroad. He said sole agents of American products in the region, particularly in Thailand, would directly benefit from the lifting of sanctions. As most American products have Thais as their sole agents in the region, particularly telecommunications products, their markets will expand. Although competition is expected from Hong Kong and Singapore agents for American products, the early dominance of Thais in the Vietnamese market will be an advantage. Americans would not directly invest in Vietnam for reasons of history, he believes. Also, the size of the market is not large, about 60 million, and most people are poor. Business would probably be done through barter. Rigid regulations on money transactions would not attract American investors, he said.
