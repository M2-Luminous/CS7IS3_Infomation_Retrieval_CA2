FR940926-2-00098 FR940926-2-00079 [Docket No. 94-26; Notice 2] AM General Corporation, Mootness of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance AM General Corporation of Livonia, Michigan determined that some of its vehicles failed to comply with Paragraph S5.3.1.1 of 49 CFR 571.108, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, ``Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment,'' and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573 ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports''. AM General also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq. ) (now 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120) on the basis that the noncompliance was inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. Notice of receipt of the petition was published on April 13, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 17635). The reader is referred to the notice for further information. No comments were received. This notice announces NHTSA's determination that the petition has been mooted. The noncompliance reported was with the photometric requirements for a single test point on rear identification lamps. Representatives of NHTSA contacted the petitioner to verify that a noncompliance existed, and learned that the petition had been based on petitioner's assumption that a noncompliance existed because a small portion of the lamp was obscured. Petitioner then performed photometric tests on the lamps and found that their light output exceeded the minimum requirements by 100% at the test points concerned. Because the lamps do, in fact, comply, petitioner is under no legal obligation to notify and remedy a noncompliance and its petition is moot. (49 U.S.C. 30118, 30120; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 49 CFR 501.8) Issued on: September 21, 1994. Barry Felrice, Associate Administrator for Rulemaking.
