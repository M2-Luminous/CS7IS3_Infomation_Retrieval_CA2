FBIS3-54593 "drnes019_r_94002" FBIS-NES-94-019 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Jan 1994 India Pakistan's Rejection of Peace Proposals Viewed BK2701144994 Delhi All India Radio Network in English 1430 GMT 27 Jan 94 BK2701144994 Delhi All India Radio Network Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] India today denounced Pakistan for its reported rejection of New Delhi's six proposals on resolving bilateral issues. In response to a query, the External Affairs Ministry spokesman said in New Delhi today that though India has not yet received any formal response, it has the Pakistan Foreign secretary's statement in the press rejecting the proposals. He said if it is true, it is the final proof that there is no truth in Pakistan's claim that it only provides moral, diplomatic and political support to separatists and terrorists in Kashmir. He said Islamabad's refusal to discuss the proposals and the confidence-building measures gives a lie to their claim that they are not supporting terrorists on Indian soil. On the other hand, it has acknowledged that it will continue to send infiltrators and mercenaries in Kashmir to support terrorist activities. The spokesman said if Pakistan genuinely wanted peace and dialogue, then there should be no objection to the proposals which also included a draft agreement on maintaining peace and tranquility on the Line of Control.
