The URNG said this "abominable incident" undermines the human rights agreement signed with the government. According to a URNG communique published in Mexico City, the magistrate's assassination "bluntly reveals the opposition that exists within government sectors, particularly within the Army, to the Global Agreement on Human Rights," which was signed in Mexico City on 29 March. [passage omitted The URNG also demanded that the security corps and the Guatemalan Army be purged "of the assassins opposed to peace and human rights" and deemed that "thorough measures, not just publicity and cosmetic measures" are needed. Meanwhile, the guerrillas also called on the United Nations, the mediator in the peace talks between the government and the URNG, to send a preparatory mission for the verification of human rights to Guatemala "without delay" as established in the agreements signed in Mexico City.
