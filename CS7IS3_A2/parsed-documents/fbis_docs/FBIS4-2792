Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, pointed out in his speech: Grasping the "222 project" is one of the important moves of municipal economic work to be carried out this year, because it affects the overall situation of Tianjin's economic development, reform, development, and stability. It is necessary to proceed from Tianjin's industrial reality, concentrate efforts on grasping major enterprises and major products that affect the overall situation at all levels and rapidly turn them into key enterprises and competitive products in an effort to invigorate Tianjin's industry and promote a sustained, rapid, and sound development in the entire economy. Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave an important speech at the rally. Li Huifen, member of the standing committee of the municipal party committee and vice mayor, attended and addressed the mobilization rally. Zheng Zhiying, member of the standing committee of the municipal party committee and secretary general, attended the rally. Responsible comrades of the municipal economic commission offered suggestions for carrying out the "222 project." The first light industrial bureau, Chinese medicinal herbs enterprise group, and the communications broadcast company introduced their ideas and measures for implementing the "222 project." In line with the plans defined at the second enlarged session of the sixth municipal party committee and the second session of the 12th municipal people's congress, and keeping in mind the work ideology of carrying out package reform with breakthroughs in key areas, the municipal industrial sector will implement the "222 project" this year. The main substances are: The municipal authorities will grasp two major items; the municipal economic commission will grasp 20 major products; and all districts, counties, and bureaus will grasp 200 major products. A good job in organizing efforts to implement the "222 project," supporting the development of a batch of major products with high level, large scale, and good efficiency, realizing rapid development, and rapidly forming an atmosphere are of great significance in invigorating Tianjin's industry and promoting a rapid economic development in the municipality. While touching on the targets which we must attain in carrying out the "222 project," Gao Dezhan pointed out: Through grasping the "222 project," we should attend to Tianjin's pillar industry and form a number of products which have great influence domestically and internationally. This is the orientation of Tianjin's industrial development. To grasp the "222 project," we must grasp the new and important economic growing point and invigorate the number of economic units in reserve. To grasp this project means to deepen and develop the work of ending deficits and increasing profits. Specifically, we should grasp major tax and profit delivering households and key financial revenue earning units because they are the priorities of the work of increasing profits. Grasping this project means to materialize the package reform with breakthroughs in key areas. We should turn these enterprises into examples of reform, management, and development, use typical examples to bring along the ordinary enterprises, and promote the whole municipality's industrial development. To grasp the essence of the "222 project" means that we must seize the priorities, turn them into competitive products, promote development, and revitalize Tianjin's industry. The hope of Tianjin's industry lies in whether we can successfully carry out this project. In order to grasp the "222 project" well, we must further improve the plans and implement measures; give special emphasis to some items and develop them step by step; concentrate energy on managing several major affairs, push key enterprises forward, dynamically grasp one group of products after another, and make Tianjin's industry enter the path of a well-rounded cycle. Gao Dezhan stressed: The main objective of grasping the "222 project" should be manifested in two aspects. One is to raise economic efficiency, and the other is to intensify the development momentum so that enterprises have efficiency at present and development momentum in the future. By the end of 1995, the automobile industry should form a capacity of producing 150,000 cars and create 2 billion yuan in profits and taxes by 1996. By the end of 1996, the steel pipe company should attain the designed production capacity and realize 1 billion yuan in profits and taxes. The 20 varieties of key products developed by the municipality on a priority basis will involve 39 enterprises. This year we must realize 2.6 billion yuan in profits and taxes and break the record of 3 billion yuan by 1995. The 200 varieties of key products grasped by districts, counties, and bureaus should produce 3.3 billion yuan in profits and taxes this year and break the record of 4 billion yuan by 1995. In this way, by 1996, all enterprises that involve in the "222 project" will increase their profits and taxes by 100 percent over 1993 and reach 11 billion yuan in profits and taxes. It will be arduous to realize the aforementioned objectives and tasks. We must fulfill responsibility, mobilize the people deeply, fight to win or die, adopt practical and effective measures, and resolutely accomplish the "222 project." Gao Dezhan urged: To successfully carry out the "222 project," we must have new ideas and new methods and enter the path of regarding raising economic efficiency as the central task, relying on scientific and technological progress, and enhancing the quality of laborers. This work should be carried out throughout the main line of reform. It is necessary to regard reform as the motivation, cultivate the ideology of relying on reform to promote development, proceed from reality, and strive to successfully carry out the work in 10 aspects, such as deepening reform, expanding the degree of opening up, readjusting the structure, conducting technological transformation, strengthening management, developing products, building leading bodies, training staff and workers, building work shifts and groups, and building spiritual civilization. Enterprises across the municipality should attend to these tasks. Major enterprises should exert greater efforts to their work, seek more rapid progress, and achieve better results. It is necessary to persist in proceeding from reality, give different guidance to different cases, suit the remedy to the case, comprehensively manage enterprises, and grasp each and every enterprise until good results are achieved. Gao Dezhan pointed out at the end of his speech: The key to grasping the "222 project" well is to make earnest efforts to do practical things. Enterprises should improve their internal skills and all departments should start up the green light. At present, all enterprises must make overall plans and arrangements, start to plan what items they should grasp and how to grasp as quickly as possible, and step up efforts to carry out the items, and must not remain in the stage of discussion. They must study practical methods and pay attention to actual results. All enterprise leading bodies, cadres, and workers must have a good mental attitude, further enhance spirit, immerse themselves in hard work, and be determined to fight well this battle to tackle the most difficult problems. All departments in charge of comprehensive work, pertinent departments, and administrative law enforcing departments should try by all possible means to do practical things for enterprises. The questions raised by enterprises are the key points for doing practical things. We should conscientiously implement the system of assuming responsibility over a certain work target, give strict evaluation, give awards and punishment, and implement this project firmly. In the course of carrying out the "222 project," we must discover and solve problems in a timely manner, hold coordination meetings regularly, and turn this practice into a system. As long as the whole municipality, from the higher to the lower level, reach an identical view, clarify the objectives, strengthen leadership, adopt effective measures, and make concerted efforts to grasp the "222 project," Tianjin's industry will be revitalized, and will create brilliant achievements. In the mobilization speech, Li Huifen touched on three issues: First, fully understand the importance and pressing need of successfully carrying out the "222 project"; second, adopt effective measures to accelerate the pace of implementing the "222 project"; and third, fulfill responsibility and render good service. [passage omitted] Responsible comrades of all committees, offices, districts, counties, bureaus, and relevant departments attended the rally.
