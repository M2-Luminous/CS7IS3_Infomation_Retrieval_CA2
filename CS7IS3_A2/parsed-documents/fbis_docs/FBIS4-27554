Nokia Vice President Jouko Hayrynen told KYODO NEWS SERVICE he expects Japan to become a trendsetter in Asia's mobile phone market as seen by the boom that followed the government's decision to allow makers to retail instead of lease their products. Helped by the deregulation, the number of mobile phone suppliers in Japan has since doubled to more than 25. Nokia, the world's second-largest mobile phone maker after Motorola Inc. of the United States, will finish preparations for volume production of models tailored to the Japanese market by the end of this month, Hayrynen said. Hayrynen said the Japanese mobile phone market is estimated at 1.3 million to 1.5 million units this year, of which about 50 percent will be digital machines.
