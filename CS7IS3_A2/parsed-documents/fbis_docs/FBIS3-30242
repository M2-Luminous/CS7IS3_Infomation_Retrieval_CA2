Lexa's Documents"] [Text] Bratislava--Ivan Lexa, head of the Government Office, has informed TA SR that officers from the Slovak Republic Police Force returned his travel documents to him yesterday evening and told him that, after "reevaluating the situation, there are no longer any reasons for holding on to them." In view of the fact that my documents were seized--on written authorization--a month ago on account of "the nature of my criminal activity" and that the legal proceedings being taken against me in accordance with Paragraph 103 of the Criminal Law are continuing, I do not understand the current course of action, said Lexa. At the same time, he described this situation as a manifestation of the rash behavior and excessive initiative coupled with a lack of professionalism displayed by the law enforcement agencies a month ago.
