[The reason for keeping these three officials in their posts is based on] the recognition that now is the time to determine the future course of the finance and tax systems, because the examination of a major tax reform by the ruling coalition parties will reach its peak at the end of June, and it will seek to pass the [tax reform] bill within the year. Saito will be the first vice minister to serve for two years since Yoshihiko Yoshino (1953), president of the Japan Development Bank, who held the post six directors before Saito. Also in the field of international finance, Kosuke Nakahira (1963), deputy vice minister for financial affairs and who has held his post for a year, and Takatoshi Kato (1964), chief of the International Finance Bureau, will remain in their posts and work on finding a way out of difficult situations such as the increasingly strained relationship between Japan and the United States. Eisuke Hamamoto (1961) will retire voluntarily from the post of National Tax Administration Agency director general, which is a vice-ministerial-level post. Then, Banking Bureau chief Nobuyuki Teramura (1961), who has dealt with the management problems of financial institutions for two years, will be promoted to Hamamoto's post. Those who entered the ministry in 1963 are the focus [of the ministerial reshuffle]. Yoshimasa Nishimura, director of the Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy, is certain to be promoted to Banking Bureau chief. Also, Takeshi Komura, director of the Secretariat, who seems certain to be the next Budget Bureau chief after Shinozawa, is expected to remain in his post. There is a possibility that Financial Bureau chief Masami Ishizaka and Securities Bureau chief Sohei Hidaka will resign. If either of them quits, the vacant post will be filled by Koji Tanami (1964), deputy vice minister of policy coordination. Economic Planning Agency [EPA] It is strongly believed that Tsutomu Tanaka (1959), administrative vice minister of economic planning, will remain in his post because there is a need to grasp the outlook for the economy. In that case, the probability of Coordination Bureau chief Makoto Kobayashi (1961) remaining in his post also is high . Should Tanaka resign, Kobayashi is likely to succeed him, thus making Kobayashi the first official from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in eight years to become the Economic Planning Agency's [EPA] vice minister. In addition, Planning Bureau chief Atsushi Yoshikawa (1962) will succeed Kobayashi as Coordination Bureau chief, and Shinpei Nukaya (1963), the National Land Agency's Planning and Coordination Bureau chief, will be appointed to the post of the EPA's Planning Bureau chief. Yoji Wakui (1964), director of the Secretariat and who was from the Ministry of Finance [MOF], is expected to also remain in his post. Defense Agency Administrative Vice Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama (1961), who was from the MOF, is certain to remain in his post, and the personnel changes in the Defense Agency as a whole will be minor. Naoaki Murata (1962), Bureau of Defense Policy chief, and Noboru Hoshuyama (1963), director of the Secretariat, are the candidates to succeed Ichiro Yoneyama (1961), director general of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, who is going to retire voluntarily. If Hoshuyama becomes director general of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, Yasutomo Mitsui (1964), Bureau of Personnel chief, or Masahiro Akiyama (1964), Bureau of Finance chief, will be appointed to the post of director of the Secretariat. Then, Defense Councillor Ken Sato (1966), who was from the MOF, is talked about to replace either Mitsui or Akiyama. Ministry of Home Affairs [subhead] Shigeichi Mori (1959), administrative vice minister of home affairs, will retire voluntarily, and Local Finance Bureau chief Toshio Yuasa, who entered the ministry in the same year as Mori, is certain to succeed him and push forward with the tasks, such as decentralization, which Mori has been dealing with. Yasuhiko Endo (1963), director of the Secretariat, is likely to become the next chief of the Local Finance Bureau. However, because his appointment to the post would shorten the record of the number of years required to climb to that position by as much as four years, there is a possibility that Hiromasa Yoshida (1962), chief of the Local Administration Bureau, will be appointed to the post instead. Also, Takahiro Kiuchi (1961), director general of the Fire Defense Agency, is expected to retire voluntarily. Makoto Taki (1962), chief of the Local Tax Bureau, is the person most likely to succeed Kiuchi as director general. Ministry of Health and Welfare Many people believe that Administrative Vice Minister Teijiro Furukawa (1960) is going to retire voluntarily and that he will be succeeded by Akira Suetsugu, director general of the Social Insurance Agency, who is a year younger than Furukawa but who entered the ministry in the same year. Hiroshi Tada (1962), chief of the Health Insurance Bureau, is likely to become the next director general of the Social Insurance Agency. Also, Nobuharu Okamitsu (1963), director of the Secretariat, will probably take over the post of Health Insurance Bureau chief. In order to rejuvenate the post of director of the Secretariat, Pension Bureau Chief Takehiko Yamaguchi (1965) has been named as a candidate, among others, for the job. Moreover, the possibility remains of Tada jumping to the post of administrative vice minister. Furthermore, Furukawa is a candidate for the post of the next deputy chief cabinet secretary (administrative). Ministry of Labor In accordance with the Labor Ministry's practice in recent years, there is a strong possibility of Administrative Vice Minister Yukinori Wakabayashi (1960) retiring voluntarily, and Labor Relations Bureau Chief Kunihiko Saito (1961) succeeding the vice minister. If [the Labor Ministry's personnel appointments] follow their usual pattern -- director of the Secretariat to Employment Security Bureau chief to Labor Relations Bureau chief -- then Employment Security Bureau chief Tokio Nanase (1964) will be appointed to the position of Labor Relations Bureau chief, which is the post for vice-minister-to-be officials, and Noriomi Soya (1965), director of the Secretariat, will be appointed to the post of Employment Security Bureau chief. However, there is still a possibility of Labor Standards Bureau chief Shintaro Ishioka (1962) being appointed as Labor Relations Bureau chief. In this case, the Employment Security Bureau chief and others beneath him will remain in their posts. Ministry of Transportation Administrative Vice Minister Michihiko Matsuo (1960) is certain to remain in his post, and the reshuffle of the ministry will be a minor one in connection with the retirement of Tsuguo Iyama (1961), director general of the Maritime Safety Agency, who has held his post for two years. Either Civil Aviation Bureau chief Yasutoshi Tsuchisaka (1963) or Railways Bureau chief Yutaka Hatano (1963), who is a contemporary of Tsuchisaka, is likely to succeed Iyama. Transportation Policy Bureau chief Minoru Toyoda (1962), who is at the top of the bureau chiefs, will probably remain in his current post and wait for the promotion to the post of administrative vice minister next year. Environment Agency The office of administrative vice minister of the environment is customarily held by officials from the MOF and the Health Ministry. Administrative Vice Minister Atsuo Yagihashi (1961), who was from the MOF, is likely to retire voluntarily with the passage last November of the Basic Environmental Law adorning the last days of his career. In that case, Planning and Coordination Bureau chief Hitomi Mori (1962), who was from the Health Ministry, is likely to succeed Yagihashi as administrative vice minister.
