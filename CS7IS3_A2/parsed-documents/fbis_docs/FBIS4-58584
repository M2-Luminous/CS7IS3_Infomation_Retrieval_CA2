But the meeting ended in disarray after most deputies walked out before a special committee assigned with drafting a statement on the issue finished its work. The House did not adopt the statement draft by the committee and it was considered to reflect the views of only those who signed it. About 20 deputies signed the statement despite efforts by Islamic Action Front (IAF) deputies who chased their fellow parliamentarians across the corridors of Palriament to get their signatures. House Speaker Tahir al-Masri did not sign, which condemns the agreement as a "deviation from the commitment to a comprehensive solution and a subjugation to Zionists and American pressures." The statement also said Jordan, which "did not give up Arab rights despite the pressures and temptations, is not responsible for the concessions (in the Cairo) Agreement." The IAF deputies, however, criticized the government for attending the signing ceremony of the self-rule accord because that made it "a witness to the sale of Palestine." "We condemn the agreement and we condemn those who attended the signing ceremony," IAF spokesman Hamzah Masur told the JORDAN TIMES. Mr. Mansur expressed the IAF's disappointment with the reported change in the government's position regarding attending the signing ceremony, saying "we were saddened by the change." But Deputy 'Abd al-Karim al-Kabiriti said: "No one can outbid the Jordanian position (on the Palestinian issue) which was manifest in His Majesty King Husayn's recent speech during the celebrations of the completion of the restoration work on the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem." Mr. al-Kabariti said the Jordanian position is in harmony with that of the Jordanian people and the Kingdom's participation in the peace talks was part of a national strategy stemming from the fact that "we have to negotiate so that we will be players and not a playing field." Deputy Tujan Faysal attributed the failure of the House to adopt the statement condemning the Cairo accord to the unwillingness of some deputies to "anger the government, the United States, Egypt or even (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzaq) Rabin," but other deputies saw in Mrs. Faysal's statement a distortion of the stand of the House. Most of the 20 deputies who spoke during the meeting were opposed to the agreement and no one has the right to question the position of the lawmakers, said Deputy 'Abd al-Ra'uf al-Rawabdah in reaction to Mrs. Faysal's statement. Parliamentary sources said most of the deputies walked out of the meeting in protest against giving the floor to IAF deputies and other opponents of the agreement while others were excluded. While some lawmakers said the House failed to adopt the statement due "to outside pressure," others said that the self-rule agreement is a Palestinian affair signed by the representative of the Palestinian people and hence their refusal to sign the statement condemning it. Mr. al-Kabariti stressed the urgency of formulating a national strategy to counter the negative economic impact of the agreement on Jordan, reiterating rejection of partial deals that could threaten "our economy and our national unity." Other lawmakers said the "PLO has burnt its bridges with the Palestinians of the diaspora and become subordinate to Israel" by signing the self-rule accord. They echoed Mr. al-Kabariti in saying lawmakers should focus on the impact of the accord on the interests of Jordan. The House, which cannot discuss the issue during its current sessions because it is constitutionally restricted to the items on the agenda during extraordinary sessions, will hold another meeting today to further discuss whether it will adopt the statement condemning the accord. Islamic Action Front deputies told the JORDAN TIMES they would try to get the signatures of more than half the members of the legislature on the statement so that it becomes an official document of the House. But Parliamentary sources expected the IAF to fail in its bid because most of the deputies who walked out on Wednesday's meeting has taken a decision not to show up for Thursday's meeting "in continuation of their protest against not being given the chance to speak."
