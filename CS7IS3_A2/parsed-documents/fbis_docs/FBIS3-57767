He called for the maintenance, and possibly the strengthening, of sanctions against Serbia as "the only solution for making the belligerents lay down their arms." Analyzing Belgium's six-month term as president of the European Community, Claes, accompanied by Prime Minister Jean Luc Dehaene and Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt, admitted that "despite all the initiatives taken, we were not able to get things moving." Last week's meeting in Brussels between the Bosnian warring factions and the 12 EC foreign ministers "was a great disappointment," he said. The fact that the ceasefire agreed to by all factions at that meeting was not respected "puts their representativeness in doubt," he added. "The different parties seem to be more inspired by a dialectic of war rather than peace." "It has been clearly proven that the Serbian faction, and notably Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, continues to have an overwhelming responsibility in this tragedy," Claes said. The foreign minister, warning that military invention by the West could lead to an internationalization of the conflict, called for more pressure against the belligerents instead. "More violence will not solve things," he said. Asked about the decision of several EC countries to establish diplomatic relations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Claes said Belgium would "follow their example" after it gives up the EC presidency. Greece, which will take over the presidency from Belgium on January 1, "is ready to accept this decision," Claes said. The presence of European diplomats in Skopje "could make the Greeks accept a compromise" over the name and the flag of the Macedonian Republic, he added. Greece has refused to recognize Macedonia's independence and establish relations as long as the republic keeps its current name and flag, which includes symbols claimed by the Greek people.
