A newly issued regulation binds the Czech buyers of such shipments to take them over still on foreign countries' territory, Marie Seborova told journalists today. Seborova, director of the Czech Environment Inspection Office, said that the measure would prevent situations similar to that occurring at the railway station in Decin, North Bohemia, a few days ago. Twenty-two railway carriages loaded with dangerous waste were detained and side-tracked there in May. The trouble culminated when German customs officers refused to take the carriages back, citing administrative reasons. Metallic scrap is allowed to contain a maximum of two percent of non-metallic waste. Both experts from the firm buying the scrap and laymen can distinguish whether or not the limit was surpassed, Seborova said. Eleven carriages to be returned to Germany are still waiting in Decin. Environment inspectors fear the exporter may attempt to transfer the returned waste on another border crossing back to the Czech Republic, Seborova said.
