FBIS4-6449 "dreas077_l_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-077 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Philippines Killing of Former NPA Leader Analyzed Killing of Former NPA Leader Analyzed BK2104015294 Manila MANILA BULLETIN in English 12 Apr 94 p 22 BK2104015294 Manila MANILA BULLETIN English BFN [By Wilma N. Yamzon] [Text] The admission of the killing of former rebel official Leopoldo Mabilangan alias "Ka [Comrade] Hector," by a leader of the Melito Glor Command of the New People's Army (NPA) confirmed that the Netherlands-based National Democratic Front (NDF) has lost its control over the communist movement in the Philippines, political analysts said. They added that not only did the pronouncement by NPA leader Gregorio "Ka Roger" Rosal clear the government of any involvement in the killing, but also showed that the Ramos Administration is serious and sincere in pursuing a lasting peace in the country. The Melito Glor Command under "Ka Roger" claimed responsibility for the assassination of "Ka Hector" over the weekend, saying that the former NPA leader had "sinned against the people." But former NDF leader Satur Ocampo said the admission of the killing must be checked first "before pointing an accusing finger to the NPA." At the same time, Senate President Edgardo Angara urged the government to continue the investigation of the death of "Ka Hector" to find the truth behind the assassination of Mabilangan. Lawyer Jose Malvar Villegas, spokesman for Region 4 (Southern Tagalog) of the Lakas-NUCD-UMDP [Lakas ng Bansa -- Power of the Nation-National Union of Christian Democrats; UMDP -- expansion unknown], said the success of Ka Hector in bringing back his former comrades' confidence in the government through the putting up of cooperatives showed the NPA's support is waning among the people in Southern Tagalog region. "The growth of cooperatives in Laguna, Batangas, and Quezon through Ka Hector's initiative was a big blow to the communist movement in those provinces," Villegas said. He contended that if Mabilangan was killed because of his "crimes against the people," he should have been slain even before he surrendered to the government. "But the fact that he was killed just now, indicated that Ka Hector was assassinated because the NPA was alarmed by the successful inroads he was making among the people and rebel comrades through his cooperative movement in the provinces," Villegas said.
