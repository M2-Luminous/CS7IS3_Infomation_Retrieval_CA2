But Both Count on Electors' Votes"] [Text] Filling Ukrainian television airwaves and newspapers, President Leonid Kravchuk, Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch, and his first deputy Vasyl Durdinets spoke about one thing -- the need for holding elections for a new Supreme Council of Ukraine. More explicit was Leonid Kravchuk, who stated that "agitation against the elections is agitation against the state." Statements of this sort are quite explainable for two main reasons. First, today's state leaders have realized the need for a new additional legitimation of the old political system of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic led by party nomenklatura in a new political guise. This legitimacy can be lent to the present "party of power" only by new elections in accordance with a formally new election law. Second, the mentioned law gives the party of power political and legislative advantages at the time of elections owing to which each branch of this "party" -- pro-president and pro-Soviet -- wants to win the elections, eliminate its rivals, and establish its own vision of development of the state. Leaders of the opposition came up with a totally different assessment of the past year and the new one. Vyacheslav Chornovil, chairman of the People's Rukh of Ukraine, stated that "despite all the actions of leaders of the state it has not yet collapsed. Despite the anti-people majority in the pseudo-parliament, despite the senseless decisions by the Kuchma government, to say nothing about the despicable Kravchuk-Zvyagilski government, we are still holding out." In the opinion of Vyacheslav Chornovil, today too, a majority of Ukraine's population would vote for independence but not the sort of independence offered to them by the present leaders of the country. Vyacheslav Chornovil also said he did not see the next year as being happy. The Rukh leader once again said that the election campaign was difficult because, he stated, the "`party of power' is straining every muscle not to let reformers come to power once again." According to Vyacheslav Chornovil, Ukraine's new parliament will hardly be worse than the present one, and quite probably it is this parliament that will raise the question of forming a government of reforms. Vyacheslav Chornovil assessed the chances of creating such a government as being 50 to 50 percent. "Even if the government jump-starts reforms, in the new year we will already be able to sense some of their results like, for example, a sharp decline in the rate of inflation. Even if there are resolute reforms, stabilization of the living standard and progressive changes in the economy are possible only by the end of the year," the Rukh leader summed up. Ivan Zayets, chairman of the parliament opposition, has stated that through the fault of the "party of power" last year was a "year of deceleration" when the main mistake of an independent Ukraine revealed itself -- no political reform of power had been carried out -- which, according to I. Zayets, halted the processes of the state's organizational development. "We should implement the second stage of the national-democratic revolution -- to follow up the declaration of independence with decommunization and decolonization. The year 1994 will be crucial. I think we will after all be able to hold the elections, to pass a new constitution and progressive laws. Democracy should win out at the elections, and this will pave the way to reforms. The second half of 1994 will be a time of genuine reforms which would start the mechanism of self-regulation of the economy," Ivan Zayets has stated. Volodymyr Lanovoy, former first vice premier for questions of economic reform and now general director of the Center for Market Reforms, spoke on the same subject in more restrained terms. He stated that Ukraine needed a government of reformers that would carry out reforms, and only then "will Ukraine see in the next New Year with a different mood."
