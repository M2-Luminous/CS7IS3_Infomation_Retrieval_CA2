They say there is no way they can resign and revert the result of last June's election and the presumed winner, Moshood Abiola, seems bent on setting up an alternative government on the anniversary next Sunday [12 June]. There has been a wave of arrests of leading politicians, including former senators and members of the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO and the clampdown has continued. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports: [Begin Odunfa recording] At least, five leading members of the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, were arrested yesterday as the police launched a massive clampdown on pro-democracy activists nationwide. Those arrested were Chief Anthony Enahoro, veteran nationalist and leader of NADECO, who was picked from his home in Benin; former civilian governors Chief Christian Onoh of Anambra State, picked up in Enugu; Alhaji Balarabe Musa of Kaduna State, picked in Kaduna; Alhaji Yahaya Abdulkadir of Sokoto State, picked up at Lagos Airport; and Air Commodore David Jang, retired, who was arrested in his home near Jos. Simultaneously, other teams of policemen raided the homes of other politicians in Oshun and Oyo States in Western Nigeria but the politicians had gone into hiding. The arrests have come in the wake of increasing defiance of the military government by the politicians who are insisting on the immediate restoration of full democracy, through the formal installation of the winner of last year's presidential election, Chief Moshood Abiola. Reports today say that members of the dissolved Ondo State legislature met secretly yesterday in Akure and resolved to formally reconvene the House in open defiance of the military. Legislators in Katsina and Kano States in Northern Nigeria, and those in Oyo in the west are reported to be planning similar meetings. The man at the center of it all, Chief Abiola, is daring the military government to arrest him. Addressing a public lecture in Lagos last night, Chief Abiola said that he was ready to sacrifice his life in the struggle to make his victory at last year's election a reality. However, the military government is unyielding. The vice chairman of the Provisional Ruling Council, Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya, told a gathering of traditional rulers in Eastern Nigeria yesterday that installing Chief Abiola as president would create a new set of problems which he did not specify. The head of the Anglican Church in Nigeria, Archbishop Abiodun Adetiluye, has condemned the current spate of arrests. He says it will only aggravate tension and cause Nigerians to dislike the military the more. In an open letter to the head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, the primate said, my dear general, now is the time to go. I appeal to you in the name of God, please listen to the voice of reason and go. [end recording]
