However, he does not consider himself Siberian, because his family, which had been evacuated to Irkutsk, returned to Moscow six months after he was born. After graduating from high school Vyacheslav Trubnikov enrolled in the Institute of International Relations, upon graduation from which he entered an intelligence school. He regards himself as an "absolutely professional" intelligence officer: "I have no other specialty, no other profession. It is my full-time job, and one that I truly love. I feel that the choice I made has proven to be 100 percent correct. Despite the difficulties and demands of this profession. Despite the fact it leaves almost no time for family. It is a way of life." V. Trubnikov's wife is also a graduate of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. Unfortunately the Trubnikovs' oldest was killed in 1989. Their daughter is in the tenth grade. Vyacheslav Trubnikov speaks English and Hindi. He spent 15 years in South Asia, in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan. He considers himself an Indophile to the core. In his free time, if his eyes do not hurt too much, he likes to read and watch movies. In his opinion, interviewing an intelligence officer is a thankless task: "Your job is to get as much information as possible, and mine is to say as little as possible." [Poleshchuk] The country has just gone through an election, and what happened, happened. Your service is not directly involved in domestic affairs. Nevertheless, one would assume that your officers stationed outside of Russia received instructions from the Center to keep up with the reaction "over there" to events here... [Trubnikov] Of course. [Poleshchuk] Could you give a summation of what people are saying about these events? Are there perhaps some nuances of which not everyone is aware? [Trubnikov] At this point I would not venture to say that there is a stable, unambiguous opinion abroad about the things that have happened here. But the responses and statements that we are currently collecting tell us one thing: in the opinion of people abroad the democratic process is taking hold in Russia. These were genuinely free elections, according to outside observers; they were democratic and most likely expressed the will of the people in its most concentrated form, quite aside from the issue of what that will is. The outside world may or may not like the outcome of Russia's election, but the most important thing is that our democratic process is working. That is what I can tell you at this time. I do not wish to go into any more details right now, because the assessments vary widely. We need to wait for the final results. [Poleshchuk] Foreign intelligence, like other intelligence services, is there to protect the interests of the state... [Trubnikov] National interests... [Poleshchuk] ...national interests, regardless of current political factors. But is it really possible for your organization to remain "above the fray" at this time of intensive political struggle in Russia? Is political neutrality and non-participation in the parties and movements that exist in our country today mandatory for those who work for or want to work for the Foreign Intelligence Service? [Trubnikov] It is rather difficult to answer that question. Why? Because it is impossible to live in a society and attempt to remain apart from it. Of course, each of us has his own political sympathies and antipathies. Living among real people, any intelligence officer is definitely going to have his own internal guideposts. Otherwise we would probably not go vote. But the intelligence service did vote. [Poleshchuk] Am I correct to say that the leadership was not interested in who voted and how? [Trubnikov] Not only was it not interested, that is not a determining factor in the work of an intelligence officer. There is one determining factor: patriotism. Regardless of one's own political sympathies or antipathies. An intelligence officer is a person who guards the state. The current state, no matter what kind it is. Therefore no one would think of inquiring who voted or how they voted. [Poleshchuk] Fine, then here is a question -- one, I hope, that is purely out of the realm of fantasy -- but here it is: if, God forbid, the country began to slip back into the past, something that people fear so much, what position would intelligence take? [Trubnikov] That is a hypothesis, and I am not very inclined to discuss hypothetical scenarios. My absolutely firm conviction is that a return to the past is impossible. The country has made its choice. No one wants to go back to the past. Nor does the intelligence service. [Poleshchuk] Who receives information from you nowadays? [Trubnikov] We have a very broad range of recipients and consumers. From the president on down to structures that work on our economy. But all of them are, of course, state structures. We do not provide information to the private sector. We base that on what is in my opinion a very important principle: we are living off the taxpayers' money. Taxpayers pay for the state. Therefore we work for the state. If some private structure wants to enjoy the fruits of intelligence efforts, then it should create its own intelligence service, maintain it and pay for it. [Poleshchuk] Are there any cases of that happening? [Trubnikov] Well, in any event in the West any more or less upstanding corporation has its own intelligence service. And similar structures are being created here. Structures whose job it is to protect the interests of a specific economic association, financial group, bank... Incidentally, there are former members of intelligence and counterintelligence agencies working for these. [Poleshchuk] As you are aware, 20 December was Intelligence Officers' Day. This year state security celebrated its 73rd birthday -- not a major anniversary, but still a date... [Trubnikov] That is definitely our holiday, because 73 years ago a foreign department was established as part of the All-Russian Cheka. We are not the kind who forget where we come from. And we never intend to repudiate our own past. Fighting with monuments... That is paganism, and we are opposed to that. The Queen of England, for example, is not bothered by the monument to Cromwell. And for some reason France continues to celebrate the day the Bastille fell. Therefore we continue to remember our holidays and, of course, to celebrate them. [Poleshchuk] Does your service have any awards, badges or certificates? [Trubnikov] Yes, we do have what is, in my opinion, a fairly limited range of badges and incentive insignias. Currently our highest award is the badge "For Service in Intelligence." That is what we award our personnel for actual results. But I should note that intelligence officers are no strangers to state awards, either. In 1993 the intelligence service received, if not ten, then approximately ten state awards. For absolutely specific cases not connected with any dates or anniversaries. So the country does notice us. However, we do not proclaim it or make a big fuss about it, and we present the awards right here where you and I are sitting now. [Poleshchuk] It has not been all that long since the Foreign Intelligence Service became a separate intelligence branch. Has the Russian intelligence service formulated a new doctrine yet? [Trubnikov] That is an exceptionally complex question, and an exceptionally serious one. Intelligence doctrine cannot be in the forefront or be "ahead" of foreign policy doctrine or military doctrine. Therefore we are still formulating it in its final form, because only now do we have a security doctrine, a foreign policy doctrine and military doctrine. I am not inclined to go into great detail about intelligence doctrine. You can well understand that in a situation when our country is at a crucial point, when it is going through a so-called "transition period," doctrine, whether intelligence doctrine or otherwise, cannot be firmly stated very far in advance. The situation in the country is changing too rapidly. Therefore I would put it this way: we have a document that formulates the basic principles of our operations during the transition period away from confrontation, which was typical of the cold war era, toward a doctrine of partnership. [Poleshchuk] You said that intelligence doctrine lags somewhat behind other doctrines. We have a military doctrine and a foreign policy doctrine. However, as you are aware, attitudes toward them vary. To what degree do you have to accept as a given things developed by other ministries and agencies? [Trubnikov] We accept everything that is law as a given. Intelligence cannot perceive anything that is legitimate in any other way. We are in the service of a legal government and a president who was elected by the people. For us legitimacy is the definitive concept. Regardless of our personal political leanings. Of course, we can express our thoughts on various aspects of our foreign policy, and we do so. In any event, the fact that the intelligence service has made two public reports is an indicator that we want to be heard. Both on the issue of the spread of weapons of mass destruction and on the issue of NATO expansion, and what that could mean to Russia. We express our point of view as we deem necessary. But that does not mean that we are casting doubts on various principles of military and foreign policy doctrine which have been unambiguously approved by a legitimate authority and are a guide for action. [Poleshchuk] As you are aware, the first parliamentary inspection of Foreign Intelligence Service operations was conducted in the summer of 1993. What is your view of the outlook for parliamentary monitoring of the intelligence service? [Trubnikov] The issue of parliamentary monitoring has remained on the agenda, thank God. That is an absolutely essential element in the life of today's intelligence service. For us it was a very serious psychological test, to have outsiders come into our "house." The intelligence community had a very mixed reaction to that. We hide from each other things that have suddenly become the subject of discussion and investigation by deputies in parliament. At the initial stage we had a problem getting used to it, but when we tallied up the results of what had been done, we concluded that the parliamentary commission's work enabled us to look at ourselves from the outside. For the first time in the history of our country's foreign intelligence service. When the KGB existed, the inspection administration oversaw our expenditure of funds, etc., but that was our own in-house inspection. This time we for the first time found ourselves the focus of attention by people in whom the people's confidence had been placed. I can say that on the whole the commission proved itself to be a very mature commission. There was not a single unnecessary question. Every intelligence officer had an opportunity to go to the commission in complete anonymity and say whatever he felt needed to be said. Our deputies were able to obtain exhaustive information regarding any violations or problems. But there were no such cases. I hope that the new members of parliament will establish similar commissions for defense and security, or a subcommittee on intelligence. [Poleshchuk] Everyone knows that the Foreign Intelligence Service has made significant cuts in the number of its stations abroad. Is the optimization process over? And, in the same connection, what are your comments on a report by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS concerning impending deep personnel cuts in the intelligence service and serious structural changes in the Foreign Intelligence Service? [Trubnikov] I want to say one thing. First of all, no dramatic events are occurring in the intelligence service. No dramatic cuts are occurring in the intelligence service. Nor will they. The normal process of retirement and resignation is occurring, just as in any other state structure. Only one station was closed in 1993. No targeted cutbacks have been carried out, nor will they. As for changes within the intelligence service, they have occurred, are still occurring and will continue to occur. Some sections -- due to the fact that we are being given new assignments -- will be reinforced and assume leadership roles. Other sections may be cut back. [Poleshchuk] The information you mention could in principle have appeared in any other popular newspaper. Would you characterize it as a classic leak? [Trubnikov] Everyone has their source of information. If you believe that source, then by all means go ahead and report it. But I have become accustomed to repeating and I repeat once again: anything pertaining to intelligence, if you want to have authentic, reliable information, can come only from inside the intelligence service itself. And never in the form of a leak. Ideally this would mean a legitimately posed question and an exhaustive answer up to the limits to which intelligence regards it as essential to reveal itself. [Poleshchuk] Often journalists, specifically those from our newspaper, are accused by the authorities of using so-called "dubious information sources" in our work. I would like to see the faces of members of the presidential press service or Mr. Shumeyko's staff if they -- purely hypothetically -- were to learn the names and the positions of those "dubious sources" that are providing us with exclusive information. But that is true, as a matter of fact... I agree that information about foreign intelligence, like information about any other intelligence service or any other agency, is best obtained from an official primary source. But, firstly, not everyone has as good a press service as you do. Secondly, an overwhelming majority of our officials were raised on hatred of cunning journalists and are unwilling to talk to us. Unless, of course, they get paid good money for it, or if they themselves have a vital need to do so. Incidentally, of late we have not had any particular need to seek out "sources." They come to us... And we know that they are fully competent and well-informed. What are we supposed to do: refuse to work with them? [Trubnikov] I can say with absolutely certainty, as I myself once worked under a journalistic cover: there is no great difference between a journalist and an intelligence officer when it comes to getting information. Now, the means and methods that an intelligence officer can use and the degree to which a source's reliability are verified and the source studied are a different matter... In that regard an intelligence officer stands head and shoulders above a journalist. Because first there is the process of studying the source. When you do conclude that a source is reliable, then you can accept information from that source. Not the other way around. Intelligence obtains information and makes use of it through closed channels, without bringing it before the court of public opinion. Intelligence can make mistakes. But perhaps no one except the consumer will ever find out. A journalist's mistake will be public knowledge the next day. He takes a much bigger risk. I would put it this way: a normal journalist should use normal information sources. [Poleshchuk] Good advice, but hard to follow in our business... Do you personally have enough time and energy to read newspapers, which, as you are aware, are one of the main sources of open intelligence information? [Trubnikov] There is very little time left over for that. [Poleshchuk] And what do you as a professional see there? [Trubnikov] Unfortunately, the more I read the more disillusioned I become by the things I am reading. There is a great deal of one-day sensationalism, a great deal of half-baked information, information that does not even answer the questions of "why?" and "to what end?" People splash something across the page without the slightest notion whether they have done good or ill. I do not envy my Western colleagues, because there is hardly any point in other countries' intelligence officers looking to our mass media for information. Much sensation and quite a lot of unreliable information. Much speculation. But an intelligence service is used to dealing with facts. And when the press so rarely provides actual facts it is very difficult for intelligence to work with it. More likely our press misleads them and keeps them busy with nonexistent problems. [Poleshchuk] The Foreign Intelligence Service's operations are regulated by an appropriate law. Can you tell us whether that law currently takes into consideration all the nuances in the operations of such a sensitive organ as foreign intelligence? Will some passages in the law require revision or amendment? [Trubnikov] I am glad that you asked that question. We are presently discovering that real life is much richer than one could possibly set forth in any regulating document. And it seems to me that foreign intelligence is already prepared to ask our legislators to reconsider some points. [Poleshchuk] What, specifically? [Trubnikov] Well, at least the degree to which the law on military service applies to foreign intelligence. For example, a person has achieved a certain title and position... He can easily be dismissed from the army, because younger replacements are following close on his heels. But how can we take a unique specialist, say one with unique language knowledge, and dismiss him simply because he has reached some maximum age?! Most likely the director of the Foreign Intelligence Service needs to be given some additional authority and the right to extend the intelligence service of a unique specialist for several years. There are also other things that intelligence could recommend as amendments or additions to the current law. [Poleshchuk] I have heard that the Foreign Intelligence Service has established a new administration that will interact with intelligence services in foreign countries. Is it true that that administration maintains contacts with the stations of foreign intelligence services active in Russia? [Trubnikov] Yes. [Poleshchuk] Are these direct contacts? Does an agent come to you... [Trubnikov] Yes. [Poleshchuk] Has that ever been done before? [Trubnikov] It is a recent phenomenon. Just like the fact that the heads of some of our stations abroad go to the heads of local intelligence services. And find things to talk about. The same thing happens here. [Poleshchuk] To the man on the street that sounds incredible... [Trubnikov] I understand how any interaction with another intelligence service might sound like treason to the man on the street. But we regard that interaction as one aspect of our intelligence efforts. We must get used to the fact that some things which were inconceivable only two or three years ago are now possible and are proving their worth. Therefore the operations of that administration are beneficial to intelligence. [Poleshchuk] That is most likely one of the most sensitive administrations, if that is the right way to phrase it... [Trubnikov] Definitely. Precisely that word "sensitive" is very appropriate here. [Poleshchuk] I would have given a lot for the chance to attend a meeting like that and observe this game... [Trubnikov] The thing is, there is very little about this that resembles a game. In this business either you say something or you say nothing. In contrast to diplomats, whose skill is being able to say a great deal and yet have said nothing. [Poleshchuk] But how great the risk is! Suppose you say the wrong thing, or say too much... [Trubnikov] Well, that's what common sense is for. And a clear understanding of who it is that is sitting across the table from you. In matters like this everything is based on mutuality. We are not about to bare our souls to a partner who is not giving us anything. [Poleshchuk] You have established an economic security department. Why is it necessary, and with what issues does it deal? [Trubnikov] For Russia today the issue of economic security is, of course, our #1 issue. The anything-goes situation that exists in our foreign economic relations, the raw materials that are leaking out, the capital that is fleeing the country -- all these things have prompted intelligence to address these issues. We make sure that our foreign partners are not pulling a fast one on us. Tempting offers and unique contracts are flooding in, but often we are dealing with con artists. It is foreign intelligence's job to let state structures know in time that these are not the people with whom they want to be dealing. [Poleshchuk] The CIA structures its relations with other countries on the basis of a so-called "system of concentric circles." Countries with a place in the "inner circle" enjoy the greatest trust with regard to access to intelligence information. Those countries include, for example, England, Canada and Australia. The CIA reviews countries' positions in the various "circles" every three years. In your opinion, in which of those circles does Russia fall today? [Trubnikov] That's the CIA's business, which circle they put us in. I am convinced that Russia is the kind of state that cannot be made to fit in any "circles." In any event, we have not attempted to make a place for ourselves in any of them. But it is absolutely clear that we would not be in the closest "circle." [Poleshchuk] In late August 1993 IZVESTIYA, citing the Swedish newspaper SVENSKA DAGBLADET, quoted the head of Sweden's security police, who said that according to information in his possession Russia's foreign intelligence service long ago stopped trying to recruit new agents among Swedish military personnel or the personnel of state institutions and private companies. This give him reason to state that Russian foreign intelligence activity has dropped off in a way not seen since World War II... [Trubnikov] Let that be on the conscience of the Swedes and their counterintelligence service. I think that any smart intelligence service should make its presence absolutely invisible. I am not inclined to attempt to dissuade anyone from believing anything. I can only tell you that nothing unusual is going on in the Foreign Intelligence Service's work with regard to any particular country. [Poleshchuk] A strong response around the world greeted the Foreign Intelligence Service's open report entitled "The Prospect of NATO Expansion and Russia's Interests," which was made public in late November of this year... [Trubnikov] In any event -- and I say this based on my own experience and conversations that I have had with our partners abroad, Europe included -- that report generated interest because it indicated to our partners in very concentrated form the necessity of reckoning with Russia's national interests. That was our main objective. [Poleshchuk] Will you continue to publish a series of open Foreign Intelligence Service reports? [Trubnikov] The series will definitely continue. At this time I am not prepared to announce the subject of our next report, but it is already begging to be published. Anyway, it could pertain to our economic interests. [Poleshchuk] How soon might that be? [Trubnikov] Everything depends on the degree of our readiness to express our opinion on a given issue. Information that can become public knowledge without damaging its source is a very tricky matter. We could express a very strong opinion on something tomorrow and thereby put our sources at risk. We are not going to do that. We are only going to express our opinions when our sources can be absolutely sure of their safety. [Poleshchuk] How important is it to ensure a source's safety? [Trubnikov] That is the most important issue in any intelligence service's operations. The reliability of secret communications and maintenance of the source's cover is the main thing that guides any source. If he sees that the intelligence service is not able to keep its secrets, then the source will quit. [Poleshchuk] It is no secret that agent recruitment also involves dirty methods: blackmail, bribery, threats... [Trubnikov] In the overall picture those methods comprise only a fairly narrow part of the spectrum of methods and means utilized by intelligence. Intelligence services prefer to work with people on an ideological basis. That makes for the most reliable, high-quality and long-term sources. As for sources recruited by dirty means, they comprise only a tiny fraction of the entire agent apparatus. [Poleshchuk] Last year several Foreign Intelligence Service officers went over to the other side. The Foreign Intelligence Service openly acknowledged those cases. This year there has not been a single report of that nature. Does that mean that there were no incidents? [Trubnikov] Yes, that is true. If you are talking about treason. [Poleshchuk] That naturally pleases you... [Trubnikov] That pleases us. But, on the other hand, that also alarms us. The traitors of 1992 were the end result of efforts directed against us by Western intelligence services over a long period of time. These were not people who just happened to leave. They were mainly agents. These were people who had been in our ranks and who were recruited a long time ago. Yet the time chosen to activate them was 1992. They believed that we were in a very difficult situation, that these betrayals would make us look bad, and that our intelligence service could be dealt with easily. Maybe even at the hands of legislators or the public. These were not incidents, they were a fully intentional plan to undermine Russian foreign intelligence. But we survived. [Poleshchuk] You said that, on the one hand, you are pleased that there have been no incidents of treason by Foreign Intelligence Service personnel this year, yet that on the other hand you find that alarming. Why? [Trubnikov] It is alarming in the sense that no one has halted their efforts against Russian intelligence. Therefore our own security is currently our top concern.
