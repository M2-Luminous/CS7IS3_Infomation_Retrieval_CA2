FR940526-0-00028 FR940526-0-00011 8 CFR 204.5(m)(1) currently states that petitions for professional religious workers and other religious workers must be filed on or before September 30, 1994. For the sake of clarification, 8 CFR 204.5(m)(1) will be amended to provide specifically that aliens must obtain permanent resident status through immigration or adjustment of status on or before September 30, 1994, to qualify under the special immigrant religious worker category. The Service's implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provision for post-promulgation public comment, is based on the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3). The reason and necessity for immediate implementation of this interim rule is as follows: Immediate promulgation of this interim rule is necessary to remove any ambiguity regarding the September 30, 1994, sunset date well in advance of the statutory deadline, thereby reminding qualified religious workers other than ministers and sponsoring religious organizations of the need to complete the permanent residence process if they wish to immigrate pursuant to section 203(b)(4) of the Act. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule merely clarifies a statutory deadline for a limited number of aliens to become special immigrant religious workers. Executive Order 12866 This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, Section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process under section (6)(a)(3)(A). Executive Order 12612 The regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Executive Order 12606 The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that she has addressed this rule in light of the criteria in Executive Order 12606 and has determined that it will have no effect on family well-being.
