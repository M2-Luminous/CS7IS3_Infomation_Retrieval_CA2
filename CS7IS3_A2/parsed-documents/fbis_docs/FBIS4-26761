Western diplomats said this reflected the growing power of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in foreign affairs, normally the preserve of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Communist Party's International Liaison Department. The diplomats said they were particularly surprised by the involvement of the regional commanders in "military-style diplomacy". Until recently, it was usually senior officers from PLA headquarters who went on overseas trips. But on Wednesday, a "friendship delegation" led by the Commander of the Chengdu Military Region, General Li Jiulong, left Kunming for a tour of Burma and Laos. A day earlier, General Wang Ke, Commander of the Shenyang Military Region, departed for North Korea. The heads of the various branches of the PLA also have been unusually active in diplomacy. Air Force Commander General Cao Shuangming and the Vice-Chief of the Navy, General Chen Mingshan, are touring Egypt and Tanzania respectively. In the past month, senior generals including the Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Zhang Zhen, and Defence Minister General Chi Haotian have also made aggressive statements about Taiwan. For example, while meeting a Zambian delegation earlier this week, General Chi said it was absolutely not permissible to propagate the scenario of "one China one Taiwan". Political sources said the "PLA lobby" had played a role in the unusually strong language used by the Chinese media over the past month to attack the "pro-independence" stance of Taiwan President Lee Tenghui. Apart from Taiwan, advice offered by the top brass has affected the leadership's handling of issues such as North Korea, sovereignty disputes over the Spratly Islands, and Sino-American relations. Western diplomats said the PLA, which had a long tradition of friendship with North Korea, wanted to use China's influence with Pyongyang to exert pressure on Washington. The sources said, however, the fact that so many generals were out of China was a sign that the leadership was confident of political stability in the near term. Meanwhile, several members of the Politburo, including President Jiang Zemin, Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji and Qian Qichen, have gone on provincial tours in the past fortnight. The sources said the leadership was "reasonably assured" that patriarch Deng Xiaoping's health would hold up until the Fourth Plenum of the Central Committee set for autumn. A major mission of the trips by the politburo members is to canvass the support of regional leaders for the economic programme which will be tabled at the plenum.
