According to Seoul radio reports, today, approximately 30,000 members of the National Federation of General Student Councils, who are students of approximately 130 South Korean universities, held meetings to express their resolve to stop the National Assembly from ratifying the treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique's opening of the agricultural market and waged demonstration struggles. They also jointly boycotted class [tongmaeng hyuhak]. In Seoul, students of approximately 20 universities, including Korea and Hanyang Universities, held meetings to express their resolve and sternly denounced the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique for a nation-selling treacherous act. The students denounced that the final implementation plan to open the agricultural market, which the Kim Yong-sam ring had presented to the GATT, resulted from its full acceptance of the U.S. brigandish demand [kangdojok yogu] and strongly demanded the withdrawal of the plan and the renegotiation of the Uruguay Round [UR]. After the meetings, the students took to the streets and waged demonstration struggles. The demonstrators repeatedly chanted slogans such as "Let us stop the National Assembly from ratifying the opening of the agricultural market!" The nation-selling treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique sent approximately 20,000 combat policemen of approximately 170 companies to Seoul streets to suppress the students. However, the students defiantly continued their struggles. Radio reports also say that university students, who are members of the National Federation of General Student Councils, joined in struggles in Pusan and various other regional cities.
