Lambeck report: "Presidential Elections: Nervousness Within CDU Is Growing"] [Text] Bonn -- In spite of intensive efforts to win over the electors of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] before the vote by the Federal Assembly in Berlin on Monday [23 May], the CDU leadership is not certain that its candidate Roman Herzog will received the majority of votes. Against the backdrop of increasing nervousness -- also because of the votes of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] -- Juergen Ruettgers, the manager of the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] Bundestag group, admonished his own party in an interview with DIE WELT: "Every vote will be decisive in Berlin. No experiments should be made in the election of the head of state." The statement by Saxony-Anhalt FDP leader Peter Kunert that there is a tendency in the new laender that "speaks clearly in favor of the candidate of Johannes Rau, the Social Democratic Party of Germany," caused quite a stir. The CDU/CSU leadership has made it clear that "if Herzog fails, the coalition will break apart, and we can forget the rest of the election year." The CDU/CSU Bundestag group, which is particularly skeptical of the FDP, stated: "If Rau should be elected, a completely new situation will arise." Last Monday CDU/CSU Bundestag group leader Wolfgang Schaeuble made the following skeptical statement at the meeting of the CDU Executive Committee: "No decision is made until all votes are counted." The CDU/CSU leadership is particularly concerned about the voting behavior of the electors from the new laender. They are unpredictable, and it is not clear for whom they will vote. There were rumors in Bonn that the SPD is trying to "buy" electors by promising them positions in their east German home towns. In view of this, the critical position of former Transportation Minister Guenther Krause (CDU) is to be assessed as less significant. The leadership of the CDU/CSU Bundestag group does not consider this a "Bonn issue." This became clear during a meeting between Roman Herzog and about 50 east German CDU deputies in the basement of the government building in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on Thursday evening. Deputy Bundestag group leader Clemens Schwalbe from Saxony-Anhalt assured Herzog of the following amid the applause of the delegates: "You can rely on the east Germans next Monday." Krause did not attend the meeting, during which beer and fish specialties were served. The east German CDU delegates vehemently rejected any suspicion that one of them is preparing a stab in Herzog's back. Ulrich Klinkert from Saxony-Anhalt stressed: "Those who speak of the east German delegates as a wavering front are not realistic." Participants in the meeting, which lasted well into the night, spoke of a "breakthrough for Herzog." The candidate succeeded in creating a humorous atmosphere. He referred to Humphrey Bogart's legendary final scene in "Casablanca." When he was asked what he thinks of the criticism voiced by Saxon State Minister Arnold Vaatz, Herzog humorously quoted the final sentence from the famous film: "This might be the beginning of a wonderful friendship."
