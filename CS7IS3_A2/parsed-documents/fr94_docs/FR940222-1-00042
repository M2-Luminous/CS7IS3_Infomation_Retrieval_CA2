FR940222-1-00042 FR940222-1-00008 2. Beginning in 1985, as the basis for payment to risk HMOs and CMPs. 3. As the basis for calculating payments for an earlier model of risk HMO that was repealed when the current HMO and CMP risk program was enacted. 4. Before 1986, as a guideline for cost HMOs. 5. As the basis for a proposed absolute cost limit for cost HMOs and CMPs promulgated to be effective in 1986, but never implemented. In HCFA Ruling 89&hyph;2, we indicated that the courts ``have construed the authority to set cost limits under section 1861(v)(1)(A) [of the Act] to support generalized cost limits applied on a presumptive basis.'' We considered two options. First, we considered using 100 percent of the AAPCC as a guideline, as we had done before promulgation of the 1985 regulation establishing the AAPCC as an absolute limit. Second, we considered using 100% of the AAPCC as a presumptive limit. Application of a guideline simply triggers a closer scrutiny of the claimed costs. Use of a presumptive limit with an exceptions process provides a clearer standard for determining the amount of payment. We expect that a presumptive limit will provide incentives for more efficient operation, because overpayments will be determined unless the organization can document that additional payments are appropriate either (1) because of a sicker than average enrollment or (2) because of extraordinary circumstances. For this reason, we believe the use of a presumptive limit better serves the intent, articulated in section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act, of using Medicare monies only to pay for the efficient delivery of needed health services. B. Options Considered for Methodology for Calculating Exceptions for a Sicker Than Average Enrollment We considered four options for a methodology to use in estimating what portion, if any, of an organization's presumptive overpayment was attributable to inefficiency. Two of the options addressed only part B costs, and administrative costs. The other two approaches addressed the full range of costs for Medicare enrollees. First, we considered setting absolute limits for the organization's administrative and part B costs based on fee-for-service payments. The final overpayment or disallowance would have been the amount by which (1) the organization's aggregate payments for part B services exceeded Medicare's aggregate payments for the same services and (2) the organization's relative administrative costs exceeded Medicare's relative administrative costs. This approach did not address our concerns about the inappropriate utilization of part A services and would not have recognized the efficiencies that can be achieved by using outpatient services rather than inpatient services, as most prepaid health care organizations do. Second, we considered calculating averages of volume and price for part B services, comparing the organization's average price and volume with the Medicare fee-for-service average. The final overpayment or disallowance would have been based on whether the organization exceeded Medicare averages for price, or volume, or both. The disallowance for overpayments on the price side would have been the amount by which the organization's average price exceeded Medicare's fee-for-service average. The disallowance for overpayments on the volume side would have been in the form of reductions to allowable administrative costs, using the rationale that we should not pay 100% of administrative costs to an organization that is not managing care, as evidenced by its higher volume. Both of these options would have required organizations to document all services on an individual basis. However, they focused only on part B and administrative costs. They did not take into consideration the entire range of services. We believe that HMOs and CMPs and HCPPs that furnish inpatient hospital services should be held accountable for all of the Medicare-covered services received by their Medicare enrollees, whether furnished by the plan or obtained from other sources. For this reason, we considered the two following options, both of which use an outlier-based approach. The first option looked only at the organization's outlier costs in relation to outlier costs in the comparable fee-for-service area. We realized that we could not limit our review to outlier costs because outliers are, by definition, not representative of the relevant costs by which HCFA may judge whether a prepaid health care organization is efficient or inefficient in comparison with the fee-for-service sector overall. The second option was the one described in this preamble. We concluded it was the best approach for three reasons.
