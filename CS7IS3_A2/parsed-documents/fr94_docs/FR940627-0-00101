The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. The habitats of the plants included in this final rule have undergone extreme alteration because of past and present land management practices, including deliberate alien plant and animal introductions, agricultural development, and military use (Frierson 1973, Wagner et al. 1985). Competition with alien plants and degradation of habitat by feral pigs are considered the greatest present threats to the three taxa. All of the three species are threatened by competition from one or more alien plant taxa. Schinus terebinthifolius (Christmas berry), an aggressive tree introduced to Hawaii before 1911 as an ornamental, has had particularly detrimental impacts (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). This fast-growing alien plant is able to form dense thickets, displacing other plants, and also may release a chemical that inhibits the growth of other species (Smith 1985). As early as the 1940s, Christmas berry had invaded the dry slopes of Oahu and it is now replacing the native vegetation of much of the southern Waianae Mountains (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Christmas berry is gradually invading other areas of the Waianae Mountains as well, and now threatens to occupy the habitat of the three endangered plant taxa (HHP 1992a2, 1992b2 to 1992b4, 1992c5). Psidium cattleianum (strawberry guava), a pervasive alien tree in the southern Waianae Mountains, is distributed mainly by feral pigs and fruit-eating birds (Smith 1985). Like Christmas berry, strawberry guava is capable of forming dense stands to the exclusion of other plant taxa (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Populations of Diellia unisora and Gouania vitifolia are immediately threatened by competition with this alien plant (HHP 1992b3, 1992c5). Clidemia hirta (Koster's curse), a noxious shrub first cultivated in Wahiawa on Oahu, spread to the Koolau Mountains in the early 1960s, where it is now rapidly displacing native vegetation. Koster's curse spread to the Waianae Mountains around 1970 and is now widespread throughout Honouliuli (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Culliney 1988). This species forms a dense understory, shading other plants and hindering plant regeneration. At present, Koster's curse is the major threat to Cyanea grimesiana ssp. obatae (HHP 1992a2). The native vegetation of the leeward ridges of the Waianae Mountains is being replaced by Melinus minutiflora (molasses grass), another aggressive alien plant species. Molasses grass ranges from the dry lowlands to the lower wet forests, especially in open areas with sparse vegetation. This fire-adapted grass produces a dense mat capable of smothering plants, provides fuel for fires, and carries fires into areas with native woody plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). One population of Diellia unisora is vulnerable to molasses grass (HHP 1992b2, 1992b4). Passiflora suberosa (huehue haole), a vine that smothers small plants in the subcanopy of dryland habitats (Smith 1985), poses an immediate threat to some populations of Diellia unisora (HHP 1992b2, 1992b3). With its major infestations in the Waianae Mountains, it is also a probable threat to the only known extant population of Gouania vitifolia (HHP 1992c5).
