The official considers the surrender of Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales who last Saturday turned himself in to one of the representatives of the Office of the Prosecutor General in Palmira, some 400 km southwest of Bogota, to be "an isolated case." Arrieta reiterated: "I do not think that the most powerful members of the Cali Cartel are about to surrender to justice." Late in 1993 the lawyers of the powerful Cali Cartel began to contact Colombian justice officials to negotiate the cartel members' surrender in exchange for legal benefits such as a reduction in sentences and house arrests, but the government rejected this. Arrieta said that the remodeling work being done in the Palmira jail is almost finished, and this is where the leaders of the organization responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine shipments to the United States will be sent. He mentioned that Urdinola "is not an important man" within the cartel and that the authorities were fully aware of his "desperate plans" to surrender to justice. According to the Colombian media quoting reports from state security organizations, the surrender of important Cali Cartel members -- including leader Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela -- is imminent.
