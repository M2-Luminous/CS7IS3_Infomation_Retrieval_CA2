FR940223-2-00023 FR940223-2-00020 Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [Case No. F&hyph;067] Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Granting of the Application for Interim Waiver and Publishing of the Petition for Waiver of DOE Furnace Test Procedures From Goodman Manufacturing Company AGENCY: Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, DOE. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Today's notice publishes a letter granting an Interim Waiver to Goodman Manufacturing Company (Goodman) from the existing Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for the company's GMN series central furnaces. Today's notice also publishes a ``Petition for Waiver'' from Goodman. Goodman's Petition for Waiver requests DOE to grant relief from the DOE furnace test procedure relating to the blower time delay specification. Goodman seeks to test using a blower delay time of 40 seconds for its GMN series central furnaces instead of the specified 1.5-minute delay between on-time and blower on-time. The Department is soliciting comments, data, and information respecting the Petition for Waiver. DATES: DOE will accept comments, data, and information not later than March 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments and statements shall be sent to: Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Case No. F&hyph;067, Mail Stop EE&hyph;43, room 5E&hyph;066, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;7140. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Cyrus H. Nasseri, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Mail Station EE&hyph;431, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;7140. Eugene Margolis, Esq., U.S. Department of Energy, Office of General Counsel, Mail Station GC&hyph;72, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586&hyph;9507. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94&hyph;163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95&hyph;619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100&hyph;12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA 1988), Public Law 100&hyph;357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776, which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, Subpart B. The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the waiver process. 45 FR 64108. Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures. 51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986. The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive, temporarily, test procedures for a particular basic model when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according to the prescribed test procedures, or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is the subject of the waiver. The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary. On November 29, 1993, Goodman filed an Application for Interim Waiver regarding blower time delay. Goodman's Application seeks an Interim Waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the burner and starting of the circulating air blower. Instead, Goodman requests the allowance to test using a 40-second blower time delay when testing its GMN series central furnaces. Goodman states that the 40-second delay is indicative of how these furnaces actually operate. Such a delay results in an energy savings of 0.6 to 1.0 percent. Since current DOE test procedures do not address this variable blower time delay, Goodman asks that the Interim Waiver be granted.
