Given the widespread belief that the PASOK congress will be the last under Papandreou's leadership, potential successors will make no moves likely to threaten the prime minister's position. They will focus instead on shaping the balance of power most favorable to each of them, Liyeros continues. For this reason, the battle will mainly center on the composition of the new central committee. Meanwhile, alliances are forming to promote the chances of each candidate. One of the main factions, composed of Finance Minister Yiorgos Yennimatas, Environment Minister Kostas Laliotis, and Industry, Energy and Technology Minister Kostas Simitis, has attracted a number of high officials. Vaso Papandreou, PASOK deputy and former EC commissioner, is among them, but is not yet viewed as an equal partner by the others, Liyeros affirms. The Yennimatas-Laliotis-Simitis "axis" is counterbalanced by Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis. While his influence on the party apparatus is "significant," it is insufficient to ensure him "first place" in the succession battle, for many see him as a "black sheep" for founding his own party--now disbanded--after being proscribed by PASOK in the 1980's, Liyeros writes. Another pole of attraction is Interior Minister Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, who has "impressively" strengthened his bases of support within the party apparatus after his election as PASOK central committee secretary. Since Tsokhatzopoulos until recently was not considered a potential successor to Papandreou, it was believed his power would wane with the prime minister's exit from active politics. This widespread impression has now given way to the belief that the interior minister is attempting to firm up his position both within the party and the government, with a view to claiming the PASOK leadership. Minister to the Prime Minister Andonios Livanis, Papandreou's "closest aide, completes the square," Liyeros writes. Having played a "determining" role in the cabinet appointments, he has attracted significant support both from the PASOK parliamentary group and the party apparatus. While Livanis nourishes no leadership ambitions, he will play a principal role in the struggle for succession because of his ability to influence the prime minister, as well as a large group of "Andreists," Liyeros contends. While relations between Arsenis, Tsokhatzopoulos, and Livanis are not "excellent," the three share Papandreou as a point of reference and will surely conform to his wishes as long as he remains in power, only breaking ranks on the succession issue, Liyeros contends. Although the Yennimatas-Laliotis-Simitis alliance had attempted until recently to limit Tsokhatzopoulos' influence in the party, it seems they have had "second thoughts," Liyeros continues. The three officials are attempting to reach an understanding with the interior minister in order to "isolate" Arsenis, and thus will not oppose his immediate reelection as central committee secretary. Nevertheless, their long-term goal is to elect a party chairman and secretary of their own choosing, with Tsokhatzopoulos remaining a "figurehead" as deputy party leader. PASOK party members gathered around the trio will surely support Yennimatas for party chairman and Laliotis for secretary when the time comes, Liyeros contends, adding that the sole uncertain factor is Yennimatas' health, which may not allow him to run. An intermediate solution may then be sought with the support of such PASOK luminaries as Minister to the Prime Minister Anastasios Peponis and deputy Apostolos Kaklamanis, Liyeros concludes.
