FBIS4-68351 "jpusr047___94013" FBIS-USR-94-047 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 4 May 1994 RUSSIA POLITICAL AFFAIRS Official on Secret Communications Official on Secret Communications 944F0595C Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA in Russian No 14, 8-14 Apr 94 p 8 944F0595C Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Article by Rodion Morozov under the rubric "Company Secret": "FAPSI Avoids Chance Liaisons"] [Text] In our times perhaps only children have not heard about such things as "government communications," "the Kremlin circuit" [kremlevka], and "the dialing circuit" [vertushka]. However, even those who use the services of special communications usually do not surmise how they operate and in what way the confidentiality of conversations between its subscribers is ensured. Secret communications are what the name says. Nonetheless, certain things may be learned about them anyway. An OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent was assisted in this by a colonel of the FAPSI [Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information], who naturally wished to remain anonymous. [Colonel] In conventional terms, the entire telephone network may be divided into a few categories: the first, the second, and the third. The regular urban network is the third category; operational networks used for in-house communication between employees of special, classified establishments, for example, the General Staff, are the second category. In this instance, a certain degree of protection for communications is employed. Communications of the first category are so-called "government" communications--ATS [Automatic Telephone Exchange]-1, ATS-2. Similarly, ATS-1 has a narrower circle of subscribers than ATS-2. Previously a man who held the position of deputy minister at a minimum, and not just any deputy minister, was supposed to have ATS-1. Besides, other types of special communications exist: HF communications (high-frequency)--for long-distance conversations, satellite communications.... Naturally, various degrees of protection are established depending on the status of the subscriber position. For example, there is a type of communication--previously it was called Metal--which envisions restricted access to telephones. That is to say, the telephone is "enclosed" in a box and sealed; the seal needs to be broken first in order to make a call using it. The telephones are opened only in extreme situations; the president, the minister of defense, and some other individuals are supposed to have them "by virtue of rank." I remember the horrible panic that we had and how everybody hustled when this communications line was damaged. [Morozov] Do faults occur on government communications lines, too? [Colonel] Of course. On occasion some excavator would begin to dig where it should not, and sever the cable. Do not worry, repair complications do not influence subscribers in any way: They do not have to wait until we patch up faults. Some other network is used in all such situations. [Morozov] Could you tell us about ways to protect special communications? [Colonel] There are quite a few ways. For example, highly pressurized air is pumped into a cable. When a "malefactor" tries to tap the cable, we learn about this virtually right away. Electromagnetic manometers are installed at all of our switching centers; as soon as air pressure within the cable drops, an alarm is activated. A command is given right away, and an operations group moves out toward the leak. Besides, such a thing as encoding devices exists. If information is classified, secret, it is encoded first: The telephone is connected to the scrambler, and all the words turn into absolutely unintelligible, untranslatable "garble." After passing through the descrambler at the receiving end, the "garble" turns into words once again. This is why if someone tries to tap the line it will make no sense at all: Years will be needed to decode even a few sentences. A precaution such as noise masking [zashumlenie] is also used. A cable has, say, 20 cable conductors; five carry information, and noise from a special generator is piped into 15 cable conductors. As a rule, noise masking is used for sections of cable between the telephone and the coding machine. Why is this necessary? I will give a very simple example. Imagine that you sitting in your office and typing. Each typewriter key (the typing plate with a letter) is located at a certain distance from the sheet on which you type. Consequently, different time intervals for keystrokes are characteristic of different letters. This is why if a sensitive microphone is installed in your office, a wiretapping service will subsequently easily reproduce, word for word, what you typed by using a special program. (This is why typewriters on which secret information is typed are screened in a special way in certain offices.) The same is the case with cable. With the use of special equipment the signal may easily be read, even from a distance of a few dozen meters, off an unprotected section of the cable which carries uncoded information. Subsequently, this signal may be transformed into information. With noise masking, the likelihood of this is reduced to virtually zero. [Morozov] Have the general economic difficulties affected your service? [Colonel] Very unfavorably. Previously we were served on a priority basis: How else, these were the needs of government communications! At present, they fill on a priority basis the orders of those who pay the most. The things we have at our disposal are gradually growing obsolete, but there is nothing with which to buy new equipment. For a while people were held back by the hope that "everything will change for the better soon." Later, that was it, the hope was gone, and people fled in every which direction, one after the other. Officers who had served for 15 years quit. They abandoned everything and went--without retirement benefits, without anything. At present, many people understand that the things that are happening may be called the beginning of the end. [Morozov] The end of communication? [Colonel] Perhaps so. I recall now how we rejoiced at first when we were removed from the Committee for State Security to be a separate structure--the Federal Agency, and then under the president. Some hazy prospects began to emerge. There was talk about merchants--those who are capable of paying big money--also becoming our clients and this, correspondingly, affecting our salaries. No sooner had we started dreaming then they hit us with a tonne of bricks: Really, guys! These are government communications, and you are turning them into a commercial venture! Now we have a feeling that we have been left high and dry: There is neither the money nor the prestige. After all, previously there was the system, and whatever they might say, this system needed us, and it took care of us. We were respected, which is important. We would come to a ministry and say: "I am such and such, from the USSR KGB." They would accompany you, show you around, and look you in the eye.... What about now? Our prestige has ultimately dropped, and not only ours but that of all former services of the committee. So, many people would like to go back now. However, where is the system now?
