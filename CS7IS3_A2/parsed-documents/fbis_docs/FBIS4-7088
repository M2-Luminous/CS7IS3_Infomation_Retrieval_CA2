The Central Committee of the African Party of Independence of Senegal in a statement April 7 said the United States totally reversed the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-USA contact in New York and was going to resume the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and deployed "Patriot" missiles in South Korea. A statement published by the participants in the international chuche idea seminar on independence, peace and friendship on April 10 denounced the U.S. imperialists for massing their huge Armed Forces in South Korea and around the Korean peninsula, vociferating about the resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, and branded it as a brazen violation of the sovereignty and dignity of the Korean people and as an act of provocation to stifle the socialism of Korea. It urged the United States to cancel the plan to resume the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises that poses a big threat to peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the Far East. "If the U.S. imperialists and the reactionaries take the road of unleashing another war on the Korean peninsula, we, together with the followers of the chuche idea all over the world, will fight on the same trench with the Korean people with arms in hand," the statement stressed. The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement on April 6 said that the United States must immediately stop its moves to stifle the system of socialist Korea and renounce its policy hostile to it, and the United Nations Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency must not follow the United States any longer, discarding the double standard and partiality. The Denmark-Democratic People's Republic of Korea Friendship Association in a statement said the U.S. clamor about "nuclear threat from North Korea" is completely groundless. The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula can be resolved only when all the nuclear weapons of the United States are removed from South Korea and such aggressive war exercises as "Team Spirit" stopped and all the U.S. forces withdrawn from there, the statement stressed.
