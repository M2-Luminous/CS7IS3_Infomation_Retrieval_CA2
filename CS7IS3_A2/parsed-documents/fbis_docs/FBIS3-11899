Narasimha Rao a message from President Fidel Castro. During the meeting, the prime minister showed interest in Cuba's current situation and said relations between the two peoples will always be special, despite the difficulties the two countries are facing. Rao said he will support any bilateral initiatives to reinforce ties, and he thanked Robaina for Cuba's donation to the Mahastra earthquake victims in September. Robaina said he felt compelled to visit India during his tour of the continent, because India is a country that has maintained historic friendly ties with Cuba. In terms of international affairs, the two leaders agreed on the need to keep working to reinforce the Nonaligned Movement and to attain greater cooperation among developing countries. At the end of the meeting, the Cuban foreign minister held a news conference at which he said his country opposes any form of interference in India's internal affairs, and he expressed support for India's position on the Kashmir issue. He also underlined India's role in the Nonaligned Movement and the fact that India's opinion and position are highly regarded among the member-states. Robaina, who arrived in New Delhi on Thursday, has met with India's top leaders on numerous occasions. Robaina's talks with Rao were preceded by an official meeting between the Indian and Cuban delegations studying economic, scientific, and technical cooperation between the two countries. The host delegation was headed by Salman Khursheed, minister of state for external affairs, and included the ministers of health, agriculture, commerce, fisheries, food, and science and technology. The two sides agreed on the need to increase bilateral trade because both countries intend to make large investments in various areas of their respective economies. Trade between Havana and New Delhi fell 50 percent following the collapse of the socialist bloc with which both nations traded actively. Currently, India is conducting a children's immunization program for which the nation needs anti-meningococcal vaccines produced in Cuba. India also showed interest in agriculture, specifically Cuba's experiences in tobacco and apiculture. During the talks, the two sides agreed to conduct exchanges and transfer technology on the manufacture of reinforced ships [barcos de ferrocemento] and other specific areas. Minister Khursheed said a business delegation will soon be created to explore in Havana the possibility of future cooperation in a number of areas. Robaina said these talks are designed to determine what Cuba would need or might offer in terms of possible future investments. During his 48-hour stay in New Delhi, Robaina talked with groups in solidarity with Cuba, as well as leaders of several political parties. He also met with more than 60 businessmen at the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of India. Robaina leaves for Malaysia on an official visit tomorrow. He will later travel to Vietnam, the last stage of his tour through Asia.
