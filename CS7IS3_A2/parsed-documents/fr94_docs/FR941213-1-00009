FR941213-1-00009 FR941213-1-00002 Issue 3_Body Belts and Body Harnesses Proposed part 1915 subpart I would allow the use of personal fall arrest systems with either body belts or body harnesses, but would limit the impact load allowed for body belts to one-half of that allowed for body harnesses (900 pounds as opposed to 1800 pounds). The July 6, 1994 notice stated that OSHA was considering whether the part 1915 subpart I final rule should bar the use of body belts for fall protection. Some commentors (Exs. 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;7 and 9&hyph;8) suggested that there is no basis for barring the use of body belts for fall arrest and that the load limits set in the proposed rule were appropriate. In particular, the South Tidewater Association of Ship Repairers and Newport News Shipbuilding (Exs. 9&hyph;3 and 9&hyph;11) stated that requiring employers to dispose of body belts and to purchase body harnesses would impose unreasonable financial burdens. Those commentors also stated that a review of their records showed no injuries that would have been prevented by having employees wear body harnesses instead of body belts; that belts had greater ease of use; and that the cost of harnesses was approximately double that of body belts. On the other hand, Tampa Shipyard (Ex. 9&hyph;8), Atlantic Marine (Ex. 9&hyph;9), and General Dynamics (Ex. 9&hyph;10) stated that they already employ body harnesses in their personal fall arrest systems. Tampa Shipyards and Atlantic Marine stated that the use of body harnesses was cost effective, even though harnesses could cost twice as much as body belts, because the additional safety factor provided by harnesses was worth the investment. In addition, General Dynamics (Ex. 9&hyph;10) stated that its systems already comply with the general industry criteria. Subsequently, OSHA promulgated a revised fall protection standard for construction, part 1926 subpart M (59 FR 40672, August 9, 1994), which prohibits the use of body belts in personal fall arrest systems after December 31, 1997. After that time, construction employees may use body belts only with positioning device systems. The Agency has found, as follows: The evidence in the record clearly demonstrates that employees who fall while wearing a body belt are not afforded the level of protection they would be if the fall occurred while the employee was wearing a full body harness. In addition, [a commentor] presented evidence of injuries resulting from the use of body belts. The best available evidence the Agency has at this time indicates that the Agency should ban the use of body belts after a reasonable period. This will allow employers to phase out their existing inventory. OSHA seeks input regarding the extent to which a phased in ban on the use of body belts in personal fall arrest systems would be appropriate for shipyard employment. Please provide information on the useful life of body belts currently in use or on the market, the impact loads imposed on employees who fall while wearing such body belts, the cost of the body belts and body harnesses that are currently available, along with other data which would help OSHA address this issue.
