"If the British Government wanted to promote its relations with Sudan it must appoint another ambassador whose task is to promote the relations between the two countries", Khalifah said. He added that we advise and not interfere with others' affairs, and confirm that the British Government has to make sure that its new ambassador to here must be a believer of all religions and qualified to work for the best of the two countries. He said that Sudan is independent in its political, economic and social decision and no power in the world can make us change our declared policy.
