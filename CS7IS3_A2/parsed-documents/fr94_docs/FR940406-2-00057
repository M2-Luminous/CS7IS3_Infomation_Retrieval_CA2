FR940406-2-00057 FR940406-2-00035 [OPP&hyph;30290A; FRL&hyph;4766&hyph;8] Sandoz Argo, Inc.; Approval of Pesticide Product Registrations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces Agency approval of applications submitted by Sandoz Agro, Inc. to conditionally register the pesticide products Sentinel 40WG Turf Fungicide, Technical Cyproconazole, and Sentinel 40WG For Repackaging Use Only containing a new active ingredient not included in any previously registered products pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Sidney C. Jackson, Acting Product Manager (PM) 21, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 227, CM #2, Environmental Protection Agency, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy, Arlington, VA 22202, (703&hyph;305&hyph;6900). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA issued a notice published in the Federal Register of September 28, 1988 (53 FR 37866), which announced that Sandoz Crop Protection Corp., 1300 E. Touchy Ave., Des Plaines, IL 60018, had submitted applications to register the pesticide products Cyproconazole 40% WG Fungicide containing the active ingredient (4-chlorophenyl)-(1-cyclopropylethyl) triazole-1-ethanol at 40 percent and Technical Cyproconazole containing the active ingredient cyproconazole-alpha-(4-chlorophenyl)-alpha-(1-cyclopropylethyl)-(1 H -1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol) at 93 percent~ (EPA File Symbols 55947&hyph;RGE and 55947&hyph;RGG) respectively, active ingredients not included in any previously registered products. The company changed the name of one of the products from ``Cyproconazole 40% WG Fungicide'' to ``Sentinel 40WG Turf Fungicide'' and amended the active ingredient to read ``cyproconazole [alpha-(4-chlorophenyl)-(1-cyclopropylethyl) triazole-1-ethanol.'' EPA also received an application from Sandoz Agro, Inc. to conditonally register the product Sentinel 40WG For Repackaging Use Only (EPA File Symbol 55947&hyph;RLA), which was inadvertently omitted from the notice that published in the Federal Register of September 28, 1988. This product contains 40 percent of the active ingredient cyproconazole [alpha-(4-chlorophenyl)-alpha-(1-cyclopropylethyl)-(1 H -1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol). However, since the notice of receipt of application for Sentinel 40 WG was not published in Federal Register , as required by section 3(c)(4) of FIFRA, as amended, interested parties may submit written comments within 30 days from the date of publication of this notice for this product only. ~These applications ~were approved on December 22, 1993 as Sentinel 40WG Turf Fungicide (EPA Registration Number 55947&hyph;132) for foliar application on turf, Technical Cyproconazole (EPA Registration Number 55947&hyph;133) for manufacturing purposes only, and Sentinel 40WG For Repackaging Use Only (EPA Registration Number 55947&hyph;156) for repackaging use only. A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain data are lacking because a period reasonably sufficient for generation of the data has not elapsed since the Administrator first imposed the data requirements, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration period and do not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional registration period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of cyproconazole, ~~~and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations which show that use of cyproconazole ~~~during the period of conditional registration is not expected to cause any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that these conditional registrations are in the public interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions, and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects to man and the environment. More detailed information on these conditional registrations is contained in the EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on cyproconazole. ~~~ A copy of the fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (703&hyph;305&hyph;5805). Requests for data must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and must be addressed to the Freedom of Information Office (A&hyph;101), 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Such requests should: (1) Identify the product name and registration number and (2) specify the data or information desired. Authority: 7 U.S.C. 136.
