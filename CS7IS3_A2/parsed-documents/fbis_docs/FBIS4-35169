Cuba will attach cargo and dump truck cabs to the chassis of conventional buses to create a "super train-bus" ["super tren-bus"] with a 315-passenger capacity, according to the official plan disclosed here. The "super train-bus," manufactured at an industrial plant on the outskirts of Havana, operates in a limited fashion in the city and is known by the people as a "camel" due to a sort of "hump" resulting from its peculiar assembly. With the new system, which covers seven main thoroughfares in Havana, the authorities expect to turn around the shrinking capacity of the 2.1 million inhabitants of this capital to mobilize. In the past three years, the Cuban transportation system has been strangled by the currency deficit and the lack of batteries, spare parts, accessories, and tires. Public transportation in Havana was reduced from 30,000 daily trips at the beginning of the decade to approximately 7,500, according to an official assessment. Some 500,000 bicycles that circulate in the Cuban capital reduced the transportation shortage but are not enough to resolve the demand of 4.2 million [figure as received] people who, according to the authorities, mobilize everyday in the city. The plan foresees adding 260 "super train-buses" by the middle of next year and refurbishing approximately 200 conventional passenger "Ikarus" buses, which were made in Hungary. The remaining bus routes that are still operating in Havana, but with growing limitations, will be reorganized so as to support the "camel" thoroughfares. The total fleet of passenger vehicles in the capital is 1,176, with an average of 437 in working condition. For next year, the goal will be to have 1,145 available, of which 916 will circulate.
