The disclosure was made at the first conference on ``the geology of uranium ore and the means of detection and exploration.'' The conference is being held this week in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. The conference aims to bring together geologists and experts in uranium exploration and to assess the recent finds of uranium. Recent discoveries have resulted in a haul of 850 tons of uranium ore, containing an estimated ratio of 0.1 percent of the substance. It is known that Egyptian experts have discovered uranium ore in three locations: Qattar, situated northwest of al-Ghardaqah; al-Musaykat and al-'Ardiyah, situated south of the Safajah-Qina road; and Umm Ara, situated southeast of Aswan. The conference, which lasts for a week, is attended by Egyptian and foreign geologists as well as IAEA representatives.
