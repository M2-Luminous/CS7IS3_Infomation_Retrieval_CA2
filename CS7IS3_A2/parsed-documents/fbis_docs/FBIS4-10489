Ernesto Samper spoke first before an audience of 500. Antonio Navarro followed; both received the same amount of applause. It was a formal setting, but there were some small quips on coastal humor. The Liberal and the Colombian Commitment candidates addressed issues such as the scope of social investments, the size of the state, job policy, and the results of the economic opening. There was a sort of unexpected referee: President Cesar Gaviria, who actually had Samper and Navarro as ministers during the first phase of his government. Navarro arrived on time, impeccably dressed in a suit and tie. He read a speech critical of the government's economic policy and against Samper's proposal. Gaviria and Samper wore guayabera shirts and left the text of their speeches aside. The president said he strengthened the Armed Forces and justice system. Samper said production will be his priority, because it is the only way to create jobs and provide integral social security for all Colombians. According to Navarro, everyone wanted to take a picture with the neoliberals four years ago, but today, he said, "no one wants to be in this picture." President Gaviria's participation was a type of testament. He did not hide the fact his government's priority was national security. He defended it by saying all other problems can be considered secondary in view of the incredible threats from violent people. That is why, he said, he substantially increased resources for the Armed Forces and also strengthened the justice system. At the same time the president defended his government's work in the social field. He said social investments were greatly promoted during his administration and, in addition, he reprimanded those who try to turn the macroeconomic debate into the central topic of discussion. "That is not a relevant topic, at least in Colombia," the president said. His participation was received with a certain skepticism, even irony. When Gaviria said the 50,000 people left unemployed by the state's process of modernization had been replaced by new jobs for professional soldiers, policemen, and teachers, a student said: "Aha! You are playing musical chairs." The first speaker of the evening was Pierre Mauroy, president of the Jean Jaures Endowment, which had convened the international seminar. The public listened carefully to the president's speech. Despite the Caribbean atmosphere, the guayabera shirts, and a few previous, humorous comments, the audience behaved very formally. After the president spoke there was a brief intermission. Navarro took advantage of the opportunity to say the head of state "is reading the figures backwards," because according to him the number of people with jobs has increased, but its quality has dramatically dropped. According to Samper, we cannot speak of security if we have not yet spoken about production, social investment, and jobs, "lots of jobs." Gaviria emphatically said his government has not been a neoliberal one. He mentioned the subsidy policies for housing and the policy of administrative decentralization, which has turned over abundant resources to the municipalities so as to provide them with drinking water. Navarro said later it seemed like a paradox how four years ago everyone wanted to be a neoliberal. Samper also said he believes the neoliberalism pendulum is on its way back. The president was dismissed with a thunderous applause. The fact the president did not bring a written speech forced Samper to leave his behind as well. His speech was eight paragraphs long, and even though its main points were an important part of his presentation, he always made reference to, with a good dose of humor, other topics that were not included. He said, for example, Kissinger was once paid $1 million to get a lion and a lamb to live together in the same cage. Kissinger did it. They asked him how, and he charged another $1 million to answer the question. When he finally revealed the secret, he said he had simply put into the cage one lamb after the other so that the lion would devour them until he was exhausted. "That is not the peace we want for Colombia," according to Samper, for whom reconciliation must be achieved via a good dose of productivity, which can generate another good dose of jobs, a total of 1.5 million, according to his estimates, for the next few years. The political debate ended with a handshake and with Navarro's promise they would see each other again before the runoff elections and with Samper's promise there would not be a runoff election, "because I will win by a knockout."
