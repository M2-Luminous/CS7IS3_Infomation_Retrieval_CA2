We hereby relay this document to you; please implement it accordingly. Delegating import and export powers to commercial and material supply enterprises is one important measure to deepen circulation restructuring, expand opening up, augment the vitality of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and quicken pace of developing tertiary industry. All localities and related departments may select some large and medium-sized commercial and material supply enterprises that fall in line with the conditions of the experiment based on the opinions of the three ministries on the implementation of the measures on a trial basis in different stages and batches in an active, sure, and steady way. The State Economic and Trade Commission, MOFTEC, and the MIT should promptly summarize experiences in delegating powers to commercial and material supply enterprises on a trial basis and earnestly resolve enterprises' problems which surface in unfolding exports to push the smooth progress of this work on a trial basis. PRC State Council 4 November 1993 ANNEX Several Opinions on Delegating Powers of Import and Export Operation to Commercial and Material Supply Enterprises Based on the spirit of the "Resolution of the Central Committee and the State Council on Quickening the Pace of Developing Tertiary Industry" and the State Council's requirements on selecting large and medium-sized commercial and material supply enterprises where conditions are mature to delegate import and export operational powers to them on a trial basis, we hereby set out several opinions on this issue as follows: I. Principles for Delegating Powers of Import and Export to Commercial and Material Supply Enterprises 1. Delegating powers of import and export operations to commercial and material supply enterprises on a trial basis aims chiefly at deepening restructuring of circulation, expanding opening up, and augmenting the vigor of large and medium-sized state-owned commercial and material supply enterprises to quicken the development of tertiary industry. 2. First, it is necessary to select a small number of commercial (including commercial, grain, supply and marketing) and material supply enterprises, with comparatively satisfactory economic returns and a certain foundation in import and export work, to delegate powers to them on a trial basis. 3. To enable work in this aspect to be conducted in an active, sure, and steady way, when determining an enterprise to conduct import and export operations on a trial basis, it is necessary to conform with the actual conditions of China's commercial and material supply enterprises; at the same time, it is imperative to take into consideration the present conditions of China's foreign economic and trade structure in conducting examination and approval and strictly abide by the stipulated conditions. 4. While chiefly examining an enterprise's own conditions, it is imperative to give appropriate consideration to the distribution of trades and regions in selecting enterprises for the experiment. 5. Commercial and material supply enterprises granted powers of import and export operation (limited to experimental commercial and material supply enterprises as follows) should achieve a basic balance, and the scope of their import and export operations should be unanimous with the approved scope of their domestic operations. In principle, experimental commercial and material supply enterprises should refrain from operating in commodities imported with central foreign exchange in unified joint operations stipulated by the state. Commercial retail enterprises are not to participate in wholesale operations for imported commodities or act as agents for imported commodities; an enterprise's import volume should not exceed the annual sum of hard currency it brings in. 6. Experimental commercial and material supply enterprises should take up the task of bringing in hard currency issued by the state and handing over hard currency to the central treasury, report and submit statistical materials to responsible economic and trade departments according to the regulations, and accept guidance and supervision of the departments in charge of import and export operations, while subordinating themselves to the coordination of related import and export commercial chambers. Experimental commercial and material supply enterprises enjoy the same treatment as foreign trade enterprises in state import and export policy. 7. In principle, powers of import and export will be directly delegated to those commercial and material supply enterprises who apply for the experiments; in general, no other foreign trade companies will be examined and approved. II. Conditions Which Experimental Commercial, Material Supply Enterprises Must Fulfill 1. They must be economic bodies with the government and enterprise separated, operating on their own, and assuming sole responsibility for their own profits and losses. The core enterprise of the enterprise group must implement unified control over enterprises in its inner circle, and general companies (including joint companies) should do likewise regarding those enterprises directly under their jurisdiction. 2. They must own permanent operational sites as well as the installations and funds needed for unfolding import and export operations, and they must have complete and healthy internal organizations and professionals in foreign trade and technology corresponding to import and export operations. 3. Material supply and commercial wholesale enterprises directly under departments and in the coastal areas should import a minimum of 1 billion yuan of commodities each year, and material supply and commercial wholesale enterprises in the hinterland must import a minimum of 300 million yuan. 4. With regard to those material supply and commercial wholesale enterprises mainly operating in electrical machinery products directly under the jurisdiction of departments and in the coastal areas, they must accomplish a minimum annual import and export volume of 600 million yuan, and the minimum annual import and export volume in the hinterland must be 200 million yuan. 5. The minimum annual import and export volume of commercial retail enterprises must be 300 million yuan. 6. Generally, the export volume should not be less than one-third of the aforesaid import and export volume. 7. Taking into consideration the realities of China's commercial and material supply enterprises, when their import and export volumes fail to meet the aforesaid standards, their marketing volumes may be regarded as their reference figures for the initial stage of the experiment. 8. Regarding those commercial retail enterprises who specialize in Chinese commodities and stores which have already opened in the former USSR, Eastern Europe, and other peripheral countries, powers of barter trade may be delegated to those which have established such enterprises in those countries. III. Procedures For Application, Examination, and Approval 1. Applications for local enterprises should be sent to the State Economic and Trade Commission, MOFTEC, and the MIT by economic commissions and economic and trade commissions (foreign trade administrations) of all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities with individual listings in plans. 2. Applications for enterprises directly under jurisdiction should be sent to the State Economic and Trade Commission, MOFTEC, and the MIT by the various responsible departments. 3. Materials which should be included in the application are: A report on the feasibility of the enterprise operating in imports and exports, the opinions of the responsible administrative department on the enterprise, the operational conditions of the enterprise in the previous two years (State Statistics Bureau or local statistics bureau's original statistics) and its actual results in imports and exports, the enterprise legal person operational license, the enterprise's actual funds situation, and a catalogue of the import and export commodities of the applicant enterprise. 4. After the MIT receives the applications from various localities and departments, it will set out its opinions on its preliminary examinations to the State Economic and Trade Commission, which will examine the applications of enterprises sent by departments and localities, then it will submit its opinions on those enterprises that fall in to line with MOFTEC's conditions, which will examine and give its official written reply.
