The explosion at Alico's office on 119 Kifisias Avenue was caused by a 3.5-inch rocket launched from a construction site across the road. The explosion at Nationale Nederlanden's office on 131 Kifisias Avenue was caused by a timed explosive mechanism. The caller who made the claim on behalf of the 17 November organization also said that a few days ago, a British aircraft carrier was selected as a target by the organization but the launching mechanism failed. Around the same time as the explosions in Kifisias Avenue, a blast occurred by a parked car at 3 Kanaris Street, Stamata, Attiki. The investigating authorities believe this explosion is not related with the two bomb attacks on Kifisias Avenue.
