Is this so because AN "converted" to the League's position that the prime minister should be elected directly? [Fisichella] We did not submit at all to the League's will. In fact, the MSI's long-standing presidentialism eventually allowed for two different possibilities: either the direct election of the head of state or the direct election of the prime minister. Both options have been taken over by AN and, personally, I have been advocating the usefulness of electing the premier directly for the past 10 years, at least. [Di Caro] However, Urbani, one of the people involved in drafting Forza Italia's platform, stated a rather different view to CORRIERE, suggesting that the prime minister be elected by parliament, and speaking of a "soft" form of presidentialism.... [Fisichella] Urbani said that the matter must be carefully considered. I am saying the same thing. So far, the two groups have met, a method rather than the substance has been agreed on, we have cleared the ground for constitutional reform. This is an important result, because the League and AN were the two groupings that were furthest apart. [Di Caro] Far apart, particularly as regards federalism. Or have you also reached an agreement in this respect? [Fisichella] I am saying that, if we want to achieve common objectives in government, we must all avoid setting impossible conditions. One of the impossibilities would have concerned asserting a double sovereignty: Well, on this count I found no objections. As for the rest, we did not speak of cantons or republics. In any case, also within the League there is more than just one project. In this respect, [League Chairman] Rocchetta said that the League is federalist also internally.... [Di Caro] To return to Urbani, he also said that the 12 macroregions mentioned in the Agnelli Foundation's project could be a starting point. [Fisichella] I repeat, we must meet and talk things over. If, on one side, they are proposing the existing 20 regions and, on the other side, they are demanding three, then perhaps the 12 macroregions may be a possible solution.
