A representative sample of 400 people of all races throughout the province was interviewed earlier this month. The poll found that the National Party [NP] and its leader, F.W. de Klerk, had quite favorable images among the Western Cape electorate as whole, and they are the strongest among coloreds. Sixty-one percent of all potential voters see the NP favorably, as do 74 percent of colored voters. The ANC [African National Congress] and its leader, Nelson Mandela, have fairly unfavorable images in the same area except among the African minority. Both major party candidates for provincial premier are unpopular. Only 12 percent think the NP's Hernus Kriel would make a good premier, while 21 percent think the ANC's Allan Boesak would. The poll found that the issues having the most impact in the Western Cape campaign concerned group identity and economic benefits. These include fears of how an ANC government would treat coloreds and whites, and whether coloreds identify with whites or with blacks. Overall, the survey found that 37 percent of potential Western Cape voters say the National Party could best handle what they consider the most important issues. Twenty percent named the ANC, 7 percent the Democratic Party, and 2 percent the Pan-Africanist Congress.
