"It is our concern to restore economic stability in the country," he said in a 15 minute speech. "We have called on our people to end mass action." Mr Mandela said the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP] would seek to meet the needs of the people, who were forced in the past to resort to mass action to ensure their demands were attended to. He said the RDP was a massive programme but would go a long way towards securing stability. Business had a vital role to play in this programme and building the country's future strength economically. The government would create a legislative environment based on free enterprise so commerce could thrive. "The JSE has an important role to play in the reconstruction and development of our country. We say the economy of the country must be built on sound market principles. If you look at our programme there's not a single sentence about nationalisation," he told the 300 brokers on the JSE floor. Mr Mandela's speech was greeted by muted applause from the traders, despite his assurance the market was vital to raising new and substantial capital. However, on his way to the executive offices of the JSE to meet with JSE President Roy Andersen, the ANC leader was cheered by brokerage messengers and other staff.
