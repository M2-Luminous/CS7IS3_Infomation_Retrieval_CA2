At their meeting in Brussels, the EU foreign ministers selected a number of top names in European electronics to join a working group assigned to develop a European data network strategy. The 19-member working group, headed by EU Inustrial Affairs Commissioner Martin Bangemann, will be reinforced with five top executives in European key positions: Jan Timmer from Philips, Heinrich von Pierer from Siemens, Carlo de Benedetti from Olivetti, Pierre Suard from Alcatel, and Peter Bonfield from ICL. The working group has been commissioned to prepare the implementation of the EU white paper recommendations for economic growth in the area of computer-based data networks. The group includes representatives from all EU countries. Other members are former Volvo CEO Pehr Gyllenhammar and IBM Europe's Managing Director Hans-Olaf Henkel. Agreements in Baltic Countries The EU Foreign Ministers have decided to authorize the Commission to negotiate free trade agreements with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. According to sources at the Commission, the final agreements may vary with respect to differences in the economic development phases between these countries with, for instance, Estonia maintaining no customs protection. The EU aims to follow up the free trade agreement with association agreements, seen as preliminary stages of membership for these East European countries. It is intended to include a declaration to this effect in the preamble to the free trade agreements. The Commission's authorization for negotiations with the Baltic states was still being hampered only last year by Germany's wish to start discussions concerning a broader European agreement with these states. Such an agreement would, however, have required ratification by member states and would probably also have postponed the implementation of the free trade agreement to next year. To solve this problem, it has now been decided that there will be an interim free trade agreement as an initial step to an additional association agreement. The foreign ministers announced that the EU would like to establish closer relations with Ukraine. They were concerned, however, about the fact that this country has not yet signed the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The Commission has been authorized to negotiate a partnership and cooperation agreement with Ukraine. Negotiations on a similar agreement between the EU and Russia have already been going on for a long time. The lack of results is due, among other things, to the EU's refusal to accept essential reductions in the rights of foreign banks in Russia. Universal Mail The foreign ministers confirmed formally earlier resolutions made by the Council of Ministers in December concerning so-called universal postal and telecommunications services. The EU aims to ensure basic postal services in the context of postal markets being opened to competition. In the next stage, the Commission will define the concept of "universal services" and other regulations for postal services. In the area of telecommunications services, the EU aims to ensure consumers a guaranteed minimum level of service at a reasonable price. This means in practice that the telephone companies would obviously be able to subsidize domestic calls using revenue from the more profitable long-distance communications.
