FR940610-2-00029 FR940610-2-00025 Golden Field Office; Grant Award to University of Wisconsin AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its intention to award a grant to the University of Wisconsin for continuing research efforts in support of the DOE Office of Building Energy Research programs. The Wisconsin project seeks to develop and improve solar heating and cooling systems for building applications. ADDRESSES: Questions regarding this announcement may be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Golden Field Office, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden, Colorado 80401, Attention: John K. Lewis, Contract Specialist, 303&hyph;275&hyph;4739. The Contracting Officer is John W. Meeker. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed basic research will contribute to the DOE mission by assisting in the development of solar heating and cooling technologies for use in buildings. Successful completion of this research would advance the goal of commercialization of solar heating and cooling systems. Deploying these technologies will reduce energy use in buildings which, in the U.S., accounts for about 40% of annual national energy consumption. The proposed research effort has four major objectives: (1) Provide support to the Solar Rating and Certification Commission (SRCC): (2) further develop the TRNSYS program to include state-of-the-art solar component models; (3) investigate new and innovative solar heating systems; and (4) increase the capabilities of TRNSYS and expand the current base of TRNSYS users. DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary to satisfactorily complete the current research. DOE funding for the Grant is estimated at $275,000 and the anticipated period of performance is twelve (12) months. Issued in Golden, Colorado on May 27, 1994. John W. Meeker, Chief, Procurement Team, Golden Field Office. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14195 Filed 6&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
