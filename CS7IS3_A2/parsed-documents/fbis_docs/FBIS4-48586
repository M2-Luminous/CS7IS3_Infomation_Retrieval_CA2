Although Dr. Banda was toppled in last week's elections, the election results also showed that Dr. Banda and his Malawi Congress Party [MCP] are still a powerful force in the country. With five seats still undeclared, the MCP has won 52 seats and will be the second-largest party in Parliament after Mr. Muluzi's United Democratic Front, which captured 84 seats. Dr. Banda also came second in the race for president. Fuelling the fears of guerrilla war are reports that at least 2,000 armed members of the MCP youth wing, the Young Pioneers, are in hiding in Mozambique. President Muluzi, who once commanded the Young Pioneers when he was an aid to Dr. Banda, said last week he was very concerned about these armed young men hiding in Mozambique and that he expected that they would be a source of violence. He said his government would seek their immediate return home by appealing to Mozambique's government and the Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] movement, whose camps the pioneers are alleged to be using as a repayment for Dr. Banda's staunch support for Renamo in the 1980's.
