Those summoned were the same people who attended the previous meeting: Narcis Serra, Manuel Chaves, Joan Lerma, Jose Bono, Joaquin Leguina, Ramon Jauregui, Jesus Quijano, Joaquin Almunia, and Rosa Conde, although Basque Socialist Party Secretary General Jauregui, who is on a visit to Argentina, was absent yesterday afternoon. Some 10 days from the start of the congress, which will be held in Madrid 18-20 March, Gonzalez and the renewalist leaders, who account for 70 percent of the delegates to that meeting, analyzed in greater detail the contents of the 7,200 amendments to the framework report. The amendments were reviewed in order to see which deserve to be incorporated into [congress] resolutions and which should be watched in order to prevent approval of proposals that point to alleged discrepancies between party aims and government policy -- a temptation to which, in the opinion of those present, the Guerraists could succumb. To this end, in addition to the opinions the report writers, Felipe Gonzalez asked Joaquin Almunia, Alejandro Cercas, and Jose Rodriguez de la Borbolla, among others, to assess that document, several of those present told LA VANGUARDIA. The PSOE secretary general, who still has not met with the Guerraist leaders although he speaks daily with Organization Secretary Jose Maria Benegas, took note of the opinions and the names which the renewalist leaders had suggested to him for membership of the presiding committee--which will direct the congress proceedings. [Renewalist leaders aalso suggested] possible chairmen of the reporting committees, rapporteurs, and even of people who could be on the future Executive Committee. Thus the list of candidates for the presiding committee which Gonzalez will present to the 888 delegates will include Sevillian Amparo Rubiales for deputy chairman, in addition to Lerma for chairman. The Socialists' top leader hopes there will be a consensus for this proposal, and that the election of the presiding committee -- the first vote of the congress -- will not serve as a pretext for confrontation between the sectors.
