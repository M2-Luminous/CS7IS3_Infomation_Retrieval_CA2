On the basis of this dual observation, on Wednesday [8 June] the Commission presented its Communication on establishment of an EU action plan to combat drugs. The plan was presented by Commissioner Padraig Flynn. The Commission intends for the plan to provide a new basis for cooperation making it possible to profit fully from the new possibilities offered in this field by the Treaty on European Union. The treaty makes specific mention of drugs and drug addiction in the new provisions on public health and under cooperation in judicial and home affairs (third pillar). The proposed action plan covers the three key elements proper to the global approach needed with drugs, namely, action: (i) for the prevention of drug addiction; (ii) to combat drug traffic; (iii) for international cooperation. The communication also examines how to best ensure the coordination and coherence of actions at each level. The Commission's ideas in each of these areas are summarized below. 1. Reducing demand. Under Article 129 of the Treaty of Maastricht, the Commission will adopt (probably next week) a specific communication and a draft directive on the First Community Programme of Actions to Prevent Drug Addiction, falling in the domain of public health. This programme will be designed to: (i) encourage and facilitate activities for high-risk groups in particular situations; (ii) promote the identification, development, testing, and use of best practices to ensure the dissemination of information and to provide counseling for the target groups; (iii) promote education and training initiatives in order to develop prevention strategies; (iv) support work on early detection and counseling for drug users; (v) promote social rehabilitation and reintegration. 2. Controlling drug traffic. This question requires action conducted in the Community context and in the form of cooperation as prescribed by the third pillar. At Community level, actions for the deflection of precursors and psychotropic substances and under the money-laundering directive have already led to considerable results. The Commission recommends boosting this action through: (a) implementation of existing instruments (development of electronic mail networks to speed information-sharing, training, etc.); (b) the promotion of cooperation with third countries, using the model of Community legislative instruments and other international agreements (negotiation of specific accords, participation in international initiatives, technical assistance for the development of legislation and administrative structures, information exchange, etc.); (c) the evaluation of the practical implementation of these measures. Title VI of the Treaty of Maastricht offers new possibilities for action at EU level in areas traditionally falling under intergovernmental cooperation, particularly containing an institutional obligation for police, customs and judicial cooperation in these areas of common interest. On this basis, the Commission invites the Member States to implement the Action Plan on Drugs and Money Laundering and the Priority Working Plan 1994 adopted by the Justice/Home Affairs Council in November. These measures include: (i) implementation of the ministerial agreement on the Europol Drug Unit and conclusion of the drafting of the convention establishing Europol in its totality; (ii) the development of a strategy which includes reinforced controls at the EC's external frontiers; (iii) implementation of measures to promote police cooperation. Under Article K1.4 which provides for measures to fight drug addiction which straddle Community competences and the third pillar, the Commission makes suggestions for supplementing actions under way at present, namely: (a) interdisciplinary exchanges between officials and professional organisations involved in reducing the demand and supply of drugs; (b) creation of a European forum for exchange and multi-city cooperation; (c) cooperation in the field of drugs and their relation to crime. 3. International actions. In the Commission's view, the EU should supplement the action plan with an external aspect, making use of Community instruments and the new possibilities offered by the CFSP (common foreign and security policy). At Community level, action should focus on the following areas: (i) continuation of EU participation in international efforts (UN programme for international drug control, the Council of Europe's Pompidou Group, etc.); (ii) at bilateral level, reinforcement of national and regional strategies, in cooperation with certain countries or regions presenting a particular risk due to their proximity with the Union; 4. Coordination. The Communication underscores the importance of maintaining and improving coordination at the level of Member States and the EU, namely in the following contexts: (i) coordination in and between Member States (national coordinators and Coreper should have an important role to play); (ii) the European Observatory of drugs and drug addicts set up in Lisbon (it can contribute to the political decision-making procedure through the important role that it will have to fulfil in matters of information and analysis, in connection with its related network of national centres); (iii) multidisciplinary aspects (information, research and training are considered priority themes, with the possibilities of improving the coherence of their implementation being examined).
