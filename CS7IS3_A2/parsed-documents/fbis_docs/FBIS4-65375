The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent reported from New York that the extension given to the Turkish side expires tomorrow [17 May], when pseudo Prime Minister Haki Atun returns to the occupied areas from Ankara. Turkey is expected to clarify some points of the 21 March UN document, which, according to the Turkish side, has been modified. U.S. officials said the Turkish explanations constitute no dramatic development or new proposals. Asked whether the Greek side will accept them, the same officials said they do not intend to suggest something that will not bear fruit. Discussing access to Famagusta, the U.S. officials said there will be no Turkish troops or armed Turkish Cypriots near the road linking the free areas with the fenced-off area. A UN official denied reports that the procedure will be suspended for two months, stressing that a negative report will be issued if there is a negative Turkish reply. Referring to the adoption of alternative ways to implement the UN resolutions, a Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent reported that there is a shift in views at the UN Security Council, something that may delay a decision until 15 June, when UNFICYP's [UN Forces in Cyprus] mandate is expected to be renewed.
