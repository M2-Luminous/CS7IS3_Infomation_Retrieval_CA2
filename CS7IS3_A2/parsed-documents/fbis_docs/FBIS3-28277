What were the recommendations' aim and background? [Sejima] After the end of the Cold War, the world witnessed the breakout of the Persian Gulf war and a series of isolated conflicts and faced a number of tasks such as environmental and human rights problems. The world has entered an era of multipolarization and diversification. In Japan, meanwhile, the bubble economy has continued to burst and domestic politics and economy have gone into a period of instability. With these as the background, my basic understanding was that there was a need to strengthen the diplomatic power. As a way to invigorate the Foreign Ministry, to begin with, it was proposed to strengthen its international intelligence ability, its capability to draw up comprehensive foreign policies and functions of diplomatic establishments abroad, and, at the same time, to increase the number of diplomatic personnel by 1,000 in several years. Although I tackled the administrative reform problem aiming for a slim government, I had a different idea about the Foreign Ministry, feeling that the present status would not do. [Sotooka] Do you mean that the present intelligence capabilities are insufficient? [Sejima] For example, the number of Foreign Ministry personnel is half that of the United Kingdom and one-third that of the United States. A young diplomat in charge of an area covers eight countries by himself. As things are, it is impossible to cover the whole world. Diplomatic establishments abroad are still dependent on an outdated communications system. That has to be modernized. Furthermore, collection and analysis of information at the ministry proper lacked coordination because they were handled vertically from the bottom up. Coordination is indispensable to intelligence capabilities. [Sotooka] What international intelligence capability does Japan need? [Sejima] A nation's intelligence power is dependent on four factors. The first is that a nation is not internationally isolated. It has to have more allied and friendly nations. The second is that close relations should be firmly established between the Foreign Ministry bureau that handles information and other government agencies. The third is that intelligence capability at diplomatic establishments abroad should be superior in both quality and quantity and it has to supplement private intelligence. The fourth is that a network of international communications should be firmly established. Japan's diplomatic response was superb before and after the Russo-Japanese War. When the war became inevitable, Japan signed the Anglo-Japanese Alliance Treaty, posted an envoy in the United States early enough to feel out the possibility of U.S. intervention when the time for ending the war came, and dispatched Korekiyo Takahashi in Europe to raise money for war expenditures. Immediately after the victory at the Battle of Mukden, war termination was sought. However, in World War II, Japan was isolated internationally because it had withdrawn from the League of Nations and its intelligence capabilities were extraordinarily weak. Weak intelligence capabilities were apparent in the fact that Japan overestimated the strength of Germany and Italy, while it underestimated that of the United States and the United Kingdom. [Sotooka] It is feared that strengthening intelligence capabilities will lead to big power status. [Sejima] There is no need to be aware of big or small power. Even if a nation wants to be a small power, it is necessary to strengthen its intelligence capabilities. During World War II, I took special note of information in countries between the Soviet Union and Germany, such as Finland, Sweden, and Poland. Their information was highly reliable, because their national existence depended on the information. [Sotooka] What is your understanding of relations between national security and intelligence? [Sejima] Japan has to maintain national security and the lives of the people and it is important for Japan to become a nation that can be trusted by the world. On the average over the past 20 years, Japan has been importing 600 million tons of resources and raw materials annually and exporting 70 million tons of products that have competitive power. The nation's foundation rests on peaceful exchanges with the world. Without winning the trust of others, both imports of 600 million tons and exports of 70 million tons cannot be carried out successfully. Japan's foundation rests on peace and diligence. Realistically speaking, I think that Japan should be a defense-oriented nation. It has a wonderful peace Constitution and it requires little national investment for armaments. In the present world, a military offensive operation demands nuclear weapons, but I am against possessing nuclear arms. Meanwhile, in mankind's history of war, a defense-oriented nation won a war only when its intelligence capabilities excelled. There has never been a case of passively winning a war. Information must be obtained to maintain independence. Speaking of the people as a whole, their regard for information is still low, I think. [Sotooka] Please define intelligence capabilities from the standpoint of your work in intelligence from the wartime to the post-war period. [Sejima] Intelligence capabilities has four processes, namely, collection, judgment of reliability, judgment of situation, and response. In the collection stage, a certain amount of information is required. However, the most important is how the situation is assessed. If affected by response and favor, judgment will become blurred. When I worked in the field of drawing up military operations, situations tended to be judged in favor of responses, in the end. At the consultation meeting, such ideas as setting up an independent organization and training 10,000 intelligence officers were introduced. However, a government must be slim and it is doubtful whether increased quantity of information will do. After all, personnel increases would be a waste. In other words, whether calm and thoroughgoing judgment can be made or not depends on the quality of the people in charge.
