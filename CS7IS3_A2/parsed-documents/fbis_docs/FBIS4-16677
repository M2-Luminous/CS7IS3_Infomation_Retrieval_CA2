And Hurt Itself Badly"] [Text] Whatever people say, signs of market relations (both positive and, alas, more clearly, negative signs) are still appearing in Russia, attesting to complex processes in the economy. Let us take the production slump, for example. Whereas at the beginning of last year the shortage of supplies of raw materials, semimanufactures, and fuel was the predominant cause of stoppages, in the first quarter of 1994 quite a different factor is already coming to the fore -- demand. That is, the most important thing today is whether the output of a given enterprise is in demand. This would appear to be entirely a market trend. But this is what is alarming. Month after month passes, but many "drowning" enterprises have no intention of engaging in structural restructuring and do not have survival plans. More and more new sections and shops and entire plants are falling prey to paralysis. There were lengthy stoppages of individual production processes or of an entire plant at 3,800 enterprises in January, at 4,300 in February, and at almost 5,000 in March. Losses of worktime exceeded 60 million man-days. The most alarming thing is the scale of the crisis. The fall in production is increasing every month: The physical volume of production fell 23.1 percent in January (compared with the same period last year); 24.1 percent in February; 27.4 percent in March. There has not been such a collapse in all the time of implementing the reforms. If we compare the situation with 1989, we will see a striking picture: Production of industrial output has been more than halved and now stands at just 49.6 percent. You cannot envy our government, since Russia seems to be crossing a dangerous, critical line, approaching the large-scale destruction of its industrial potential. This is largely connected with the snowballing crisis of nonpayments. Operational materials just received from the Russian State Committee for Statistics attest that the problem is being exacerbated, jeopardizing the country's economic security. As of 1 January creditors' defaulted arrears amounted to 16 trillion rubles [R]; as of 1 February -- R20 trillion; as of 1 March -- R25 trillion. The fact that nonpayments are increasing at a faster pace than inflation attests to a deepening crisis. Meanwhile, many millions of Russians are feeling this problem very directly in their family budget. In Russia, contrary to common sense, the flawed practice of nonpayment (or incomplete payment) of wages and other payments is assuming an increasingly wide scale. Thus, it turns out that someone has worked in a shop for two weeks, he goes to the cash desk and sees an announcement: "In connection with the fact that the state has not settled up with the enterprise for the state order, the plant has no money, and wages for this month will be issued later." Is this not absurd, is it not humiliating? Millions of Russians live without wages for three weeks, for a month, for two months. They sell things, get into debt.... I had hoped that, in connection with the fact that there had been a considerable transfusion of money into the economy in February (R1.6 trillion), the notorious knot of nonpayments would be untied little by little. But no, it turns out that everything is the other way around -- the defaulted wage arrears are not diminishing but increasing. As of 1 January, they totaled R766 billion; as of 1 February -- R1.681 trillion; as of 1 March -- R2.085 trillion; as of 1 April (according to preliminary operational data) -- R2.374 trillion. In other words, during the first quarter the total of wage debts increased more than threefold, noticeably overtaking the rate of inflation. The situation is becoming dangerously explosive. The miners' pickets outside the White House are being replaced by nuclear scientists, students.... Will we live to see the day when working people of all the 30,000 enterprises where workers are owed wages will rise up? In an attempt to avoid this and to strengthen the legal base, on 10 March 1994 Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued the edict "On Liability for Violations of Citizens' Labor Rights," which instructs the Prosecutor's Office to pay "special attention to preventing cases of delays over paying wages." But the edict has essentially never worked. First, as frequently happens, there is no sufficiently clear mechanism for implementing it; second, in our crazy economy it is by no means always possible to find the specific guilty persons; third, what can the Prosecutor's Office or a court (which, in any case, are swamped with cases) do if an enterprise is up to its eyes in debt? In order to ease the acuteness of the situation at least in some way, specialists propose temporarily, pending the elimination of the nonpayments crisis, to introduce a procedure for reserving certain funds for wages in the accounts of enterprises (let us assume four to six times the minimum wage for each working person). The idea is as follows: Let us say that money has come into a plant from a client, the necessary sum is at once transferred to a special account, and it is not allowed to spend the money on anything but wages -- neither on taxes nor for other purposes. According to Valeriy Kolosov, Russian Federation first deputy minister of labor, the Ministry of Labor sent similar proposals to the Ministry of Finance, and the acting minister of finance apparently supported the idea, but the matter went no further than this.... Maybe this was because the wages of Finance Ministry employees are never delayed? Nobody today can say exactly which part of the wages has not been paid through the fault of the state (by "clamping down" on budget funds -- for the state order, grain sold to the state, etc.) and how many debts have arisen because of clumsy commercial and economic activity. If, let us assume, a nonstate firm is a potential bankrupt and credits [nachislyayet] its working people with money which it cannot pay, this is, after all, a matter for the firm itself -- think, bustle, restructure yourself, find your niche on the market. But when the state starts engaging in deception -- that beats everything, as the saying goes.... So I ask: For how much of the debt of more than R2 trillion is the state responsible? No idea. How is it possible to manage the country without knowing such very important, fundamental things? In any case the government is obliged, finally, to vigorously set about resolving these very painful problems. Industry bears the lion's share of the wage arrears (according to preliminary operational data -- R1.332 trillion). What awaits these enterprises? Will state debts be paid, will the process of effective structural restructuring, clearing up of finances, and bankruptcies of drowning enterprises begin? We cannot go on swimming with the tide, hoping that somehow everything will be all right of its own accord. The disease is intensifying and going deeper, and without effective treatment it could turn into a great calamity. Analyzing the first quarter's results and observing the government's passivity, you catch yourself thinking: Are the premier and his team capable of providing such effective treatment? If so, it would be a good thing to demonstrate this in practice. I will remind you, incidentally, that, as the State Committee for Statistics bears witness, there are already 4.4 million unemployed in Russia today (according to the International Labor Organization classification). But taking into account those who are not fully employed, the total potential for unemployment stands at 8.8 million people (11.7 percent of the economically active population). This is another alarm signal.... In conclusion I will cite a fact which can be viewed in two ways: The share of the labor remuneration fund in the overall volume of monetary incomes has fallen from 65 percent (in the first quarter of last year) to 59 percent in January-March 1994. That is, the role of wages has diminished somewhat. This is because, first, the new rich are passing huge money through commercial banks, making a sizable profit, and, second, many Russians are increasingly actively seeking somewhere that they can earn a bit extra, in addition to their main occupation. This "bit extra" almost compares (in size) with their wages. On the one hand this is good: The population's enterprise and activeness attest to a change in the stereotypes of thinking, to a gradual adaptation to the conditions of market economics. But there is another side here too: Inadequate wages, not paid on time moreover, accustom people to doing hack work and working at half stretch in their main job, in order to make a bit more on the side.... On the whole, the average monthly real wage, calculated with due regard for the consumer prices index, fell 4 percent in the first quarter of 1994 (compared with the same period last year) and 3 percent in March (compared with last March). By comparison with the drop in production, we received even more than we earned. This presages a new surge of inflation in the second half of April and in May. No, stabilization of the standard of living and an increase in it are possible only by way of reviving the economy and an effective structural policy. No other artificial methods will be able to lead to success....
