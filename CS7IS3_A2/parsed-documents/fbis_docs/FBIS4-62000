The president requested a second debate on the law on local authorities adopted on 5 May. Ulmanis regards as unacceptable the provisions of paragraph 93 of the law, which allows for the dismissal or removal of an elected official from his post by the sole personal order of a minister. In his opinion, only the Cabinet of Ministers can dismiss or remove an elected official from his post. The Saeima Presidium agreed to a second debate of the law on local authorities, allowing the Commission on State and Local Administration and the Judicial Commission to rule that the Commission of State and Local Administration will assemble the proposals received and prepare the laws adopted together with the proposals for a second debate in a plenary session of the Saeima.
