Provincial election candidate Welcome Mthimkulu has alleged that the KwaZulu policemen were ready to hand the ANC canvassers over to the mob outside. He said that a number of white policemen, however, had taken them to a safe place until they could be removed to Eshowe. Two people were killed in the clash, eight are still missing, and the ANC has called on the Transitional Executive Council and the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] to launch a search for them. Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi was forced to interrupt his [Orange] Free State election campaign yesterday to intervene in the conflict in Ulundi. Dr. Buthelezi persuaded the crowd to disperse after it had gathered outside the police station. The ANC supporters and IEC monitors were subsequently taken in armored vehicles to Eshowe.
