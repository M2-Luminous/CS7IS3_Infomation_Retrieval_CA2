FR940831-2-00131 FR940831-2-00098 Federal Aviation Administration Acceptance of Noise Exposure Maps and Request for Review of Noise Compatibility Program for McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas, NV AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its determination that the noise exposure maps submitted by Clark County, Nevada, for McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada, under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&hyph;193) and 14 CFR Part 150 are in compliance with applicable requirements. The FAA also announces that it is also reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program that was submitted for McCarran International Airport under Part 150 in conjunction with the noise exposure map, and that this program will be approved or disapproved on or before February 15, 1995. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of the FAA's determination on the noise exposure maps and the start of its review of the associated noise compatibility program is August 19, 1994. The public comment period ends October 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joseph R. Rodriguez, Federal Aviation Administration, San Francisco Airports District Office, 831 Mitten Road, Burlingame, California 94010&hyph;1303, Telephone 415/876&hyph;2805. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for the McCarran International Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements of Part 150 effective August 19, 1994. Under Section 103 of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations, and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport. An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses. Clark County, Nevada submitted to the FAA on March 9, 1994, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation which were produced during the McCarran International Airport Part 150 Study conducted between May, 1992 and January 1994. It was requested that the FAA review this material as the noise exposure maps, as described in Section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program under Section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by Clark County, Nevada. The specific maps under consideration are Figure 11 ``Noise Exposure Map: 1992 with Existing Land Use'', and Figure 12, ``Noise Exposure Map: 1997 Existing and Approved Land'' in the submission. The FAA has determined that these maps for the McCarran International Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination is effective on August 19, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in Appendix A of FAR Part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program. If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted on a noise exposure map submitted under Section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions of Section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under Part 150 or through FAA's review of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto the maps depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps, or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under Section 103 of the Act. The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under Section 150.21 of FAR Part 150, that the statutorily required consultation has been accomplished.
