A ranking government official in Beijing said that this year, work will be done to standardize trading policies for same industries in different parts of the whole country. He also disclosed that China will change some special economic zones [SEZs] into internationally recognized free trade zones. Over the past few years, the central government in Beijing differed from provincial authorities in foreign trade and investment policies, resulting in the withdrawal from China of some foreign investors who did not like the ambiguous policies; on the other hand, some foreign businessmen reaped huge profits from the special and preferential policies granted to them by local government departments. The official, who asked to remain anonymous, said he did not want to see either such situation happening in China. China hopes to restore its status as a signatory to GATT in 1995, so it is an urgent duty this year to standardize the trading policies for the same industries in different parts of the whole country. The official disclosed that China will change some SEZs into free trade zones, which are acceptable to the international community, so that they can be recognized internationally. The official pointed out that except in the free trade zones, foreign businessmen will enjoy equal treatment when engaging in a same industry in any other parts of China. The new policy will benefit the vast interior. In recent years, the interior lagged far behind the coastal region in attracting foreign capital. By the end of 1993, 120 countries and regions had invested in China, and the investments went mainly into energy, light industry, electronic industry, mechanical spinning and weaving, clothing, metallurgical industry, construction materials, and real estate.
