FBIS4-54440 "dreeu083__a94054" FBIS-EEU-94-083-A Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Hungary's Kuncze: Border Change Not `Realistic' Hungary's Kuncze: Border Change Not `Realistic' AU2704133094 Prague CTK in English 0849 GMT 25 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2704133094 Prague CTK English BFN [Excerpt] Bratislava April 25 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] The problems concerning recognition of the inviolability of the current (Slovak-Hungarian) borders and the position of ethnic minorities are "artificially inflated, while in both cases it is possible to achieve agreements and guarantees which would bring about a satisfactory solution," Gabor Kuncze, a candidate for premiership of the Hungarian opposition Union of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), tells the left-leaning PRAVDA. It is not at all realistic to consider a possible change in the borders. Therefore, there is no sense in hampering the development of relations, Kuncze says, adding that Slovakia should make a step forward regarding the ethnic minorities. "We do not believe that it is correct to refer to safeguarding the individual rights in this respect. In the sphere of minorities the individual rights can be ensured only by means of collective rights. For example, the use of the minority language cannot be applied individually if it has not been resolved on the collective basis of education in that language, its use in culture and administration. I believe that it is possible to discuss culture and language autonomy and a measure of autonomy in self- administration," Kuncze states. Kuncze rejects "frightening the voters" by arguing that it will not be possible to form a government coalition and that the elections will be repeated in September. "I consider the voters wise enough to send the parties to the parliament so that it could be possible to form a competent government coalition. I do not think the elections will be repeated," he says. Asked whether he can imagine becoming premier supported by the Hungarian Socialist Party, Kuncze replies that he does not deal with "occultism and prophecies."
