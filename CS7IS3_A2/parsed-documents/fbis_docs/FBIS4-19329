The decree states that 35 Italian Armed Forces members and technical experts will be sent to Hebron in response to an agreement on the issue reached by Israeli and Palestinian authorities March 31, on the basis of United Nations Resolution 904. The scope of the mission, in which Italians will join 60 Norwegians and 35 Danes, will be "to provide all necessary guarantees for the Palestinian people of the occupied territories," a cabinet office communique said. The observer mission, dubbed Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH), will last a minimum three months, and was set up after a Jewish settler shot at least 30 Palestinians dead in a Hebron mosque February 25.
