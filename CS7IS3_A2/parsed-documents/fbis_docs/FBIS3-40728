The Rajya Sabha activities were postponed until 1430. The opposition members of both houses gathered around the seats of the majority members to show their opposition to signing the Dunkel proposals and demanding that the prime minister come to the House to clarify the situation related to Dunkel. In the Rajya Sabha, after the morning noise, the question-answer period began, however, nothing was achieved in the Lok Sabha. The opposition members accused the government of insulting the Parliament by signing the agreement without taking them into confidence. The opposition disrupted the questions session in the Lok Sabha by making noise and raising slogans. After 20 minutes of pandemonium, Vice Chairperson Mallika Arjunaiya postponed the House activities until noon. As soon as the meeting began, the opposition members demanded that the prime minister should attend the meeting. They raised slogans in support of their demand and gathered around the chairperson's seat. Jaswant Singh was the only BJP member present in the House. The members said that the government had sold out the nation by signing this agreement. The statement of Mukul Vasnik, minister of state for parliamentary affairs, that the Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji was ready to clarify the whole situation in the House did calm the opposition members. However, the opposition members continued to demand that Mr. Rao must make a statement. Mr. Vasnik said that making all this noise will not help anyone. The opposition leaders continued to raise slogans such as "revoke the Dunkel agreement" and "stop selling out the nation." Later, the slogans asking for resignation by Narasimha Rao also echoed in the House. These members standing in front of the chairperson's seat were saying that the Dunkel agreement was an agreement to accept economic slavery. The government, they said, had made agreement against the nation's economic interests, and this government does not deserve to stay in power. The vice chairperson repeatedly said that the commerce minister was ready to make a statement during the questions period. He said that the prime minister could not come to the House for some reason, however, the opposition members were adamant about the prime minister's attendance. Mr. Vasnik, the parliamentary affairs state minister, said that it was the opposition that had asked the commerce minister to make a statement, and now it is refusing to hear him. He asked the vice chairperson to set a time for the statement. Janata Dal's George Fernandes said that India by signing this agreement had become a U.S. colony. He wanted to know what the Parliament was for now. Mr. Pranab Mukherji had some discussion with the vice chairperson during that time. Somnath Chaterji of the CPI (M) said that the whole nation and the House was angered by the government's action.
