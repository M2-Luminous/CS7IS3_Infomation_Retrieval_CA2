In its reaction to Thursday's night terror attack in Cape Town, the AVF called on the government and State President F W de Klerk to stop shadow-boxing with mere election statements, as though the country was in a peaceful election campaign. "Instead it should not evade its responsiblities to uphold law and order even if the TEC seems to have the de facto power," said Mr Maninger. Government negotiator Roelf Meyer could use this opportunity to prove his past statements that implementation of the TEC did not rob the government of its power. "It is clear to us that since the TEC has come into effect there is a definite increase in violence. We believe that this is possibly the result of the fact that the same organisations actively conducting terror operations against political opponents are perhaps also playing a major role in the decision-making process within the TEC." In view of the increasing violence, Mr de Klerk's recent electioneering attacks on his political opponents were not only pathetic and fake but reminded the AVF of Nero playing the fiddle while Rome was burning.
