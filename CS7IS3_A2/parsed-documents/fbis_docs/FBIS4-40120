Savchenko: "I Will Sing Someone Else's Song"] [Text] And so it is done. On 3 June the Crimean Government finally put its ministers in key posts--the Ministries of Administration of State Enterprises, Agriculture and Food, and Economics and Finance. For these positions the Supreme Council approved the previously acting ministers Anatoliy Franchuk, Serhiy Nikolskyy, Andrey Chernyavskyy, and Lyudmila Zaytseva. This was preceded by long discussions on the draft law "On Making Changes and Additions to the Law of the Republic of Crimea and On the System of Central Organs of State Power of the Republic of Crimea." The work, which was essentially to have been completed in the commissions, spilled over into the plenary part of the session. With incredible stubbornness the deputies defended one or another ministry or state committee, wanting to expand the government at their own discretion, no matter what. Many of the deputies were concerned most of all by the fact that the government could turn into a closed type of society since the number of ministries and state committees would be limited. Ultimately the document prepared by the Standing Commission of the Supreme Council on State Construction, Legislation, Legality, and Law and Order was adopted with corrections and additions. We turn the floor over to the deputies: V. Brodin: I voted for the law on making changes and additions to the law on the system of central organs of state power. We must make it possible for the government to function. And the fact that the document was not properly prepared is not its fault. The deputies should have been given both the structure and the personnel composition of the ministries and committees beforehand. In 14 days we will return to the document on the structure of the government. L. Grach:There is a situation in which a polarization process, which will not submit to any kind of normal analysis, takes place in the parliament's work. Those who shouted the loudest and defended the Constitution were zealously flouting it today. Naturally, I voted against it. The entire national economy of the Crimea was signed away. This means that in three or four months we will have a lamentable condition in the Republic, and in this case responsibility for the state of affairs will be born by the parliament, which made it possible to flout the Constitution. These are two mutually exclusive opinions we heard during the recess after the voting. And when the session continued it turned out that certain deputies still did not understand the entire essence of the document for which they had voted. This is what happens when there is confusion and haste. One must assume that in two weeks, although this is an extremely short amount of time, the session will again return to the question of the government, but this time with carefully prepared documents. This meeting of the session revealed another extremely serious and unfavorable aspect: There is no mutual understanding between the legislative and executive powers. In order to push the government to adopt the decision, President Yu. Meshkov spoke repeatedly at the meeting. "A failure to solve the problem of the government will place the economy of the Crimea in an even more difficult position which could be characterized as catastrophic. And instead of accepting the government in the form in which it is functioning and can function and endlessly improving on the law on the government, you are putting us back where we started. Be consistent. If you are responsible to the voters, you should follow their orders." These words from the president convinced a large number of deputies and they supported him. The time itself requires rapid, resolute measures. The more so since for several months nobody has actually been doing anything about the economy and economic activity in the Republic. The new Crimean Government, which undertook to correct the reforms, must see the deputies as allies who will evaluate it for its actual activity. The deputies, who have met the government halfway, must be consistent in their subsequent decisions as well.
