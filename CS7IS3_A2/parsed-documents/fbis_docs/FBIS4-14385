Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat chaired the meeting. AL-BILAD learned that Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', head of the PLO Economic Department and head of the Palestinian delegation to the Paris economic talks with Israel, lost his temper after a flare up over differences with Fatah Central Committee member Hani al- Hasan, who protested against Abu-'Ala's hasty verbal presentation of a report during the meeting. After al-Hasan's protest, Quray' openly threatened to not go back to Paris. He tore up the file of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, an indication that he is abandoning his pursuit of this issue. An argument immediately erupted between Fatah Central Committee members Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, and Hakam Bal'awi. According to AL-BILAD's information, during the heated discussion, Hani al-Hasan said the head of the Israeli delegation briefed the Israelis in a televised seminar about the proceedings of the Paris negotiations, explaining the economic and political gains the Israeli side has achieved, especially on the subject of Palestinian currency, part of which will be kept in the Israeli Central Bank's reserves. Al-Hasan said: This is a very serious issue that cannot be discussed in this way. All the provisions of the economic agreement should be laid down on the table and distributed so the members of Fatah Central Committee can closely examine them. The sources said another strong verbal exchange occurred during the meeting when al-Hasan said the pro-Labor Party group within the Palestinian revolution leadership had implicated President 'Arafat in affairs in which the Fatah Movement should not have been involved. According to AL-BILAD sources, Fatah is expected to hold another meeting when 'Arafat concludes his current tours.
