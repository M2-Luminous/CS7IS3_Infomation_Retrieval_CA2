A part of the shipment was detected on a tank truck, and another on the deck of a boat. These confiscations prompted the capture of at least five presumed drug traffickers. In Hermosillo, Sonora, PJF agents seized a shipment consisting of a ton and 560 kg of cannabis indica on a tank truck presumably abandoned on the corner of 30th and 40th Streets. Based on the investigations, it was determined that the vehicle, with Federal Public Service plates 910-UD, owned by the Trans-Gas Company, had been left on the aforementioned site for three days, possibly awaiting the arrival of someone to retrieve it. For the tank's inspection, part of the fuel that it contained had to be extracted first, so as to search the inside. There, 166 packages of the drug, distributed in sacks, cardboard boxes, and plastic bags, were discovered. [passage omitted]
