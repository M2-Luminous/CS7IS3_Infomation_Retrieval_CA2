The Families Against Intimidation and Terror [FAIT] handed in a letter at the American Consulate in Belfast pressing the president to make any lifting of the ban conditional on Mr. Adams using his influence to stop the terrorists banishing people under threat of death. The organisation urged Mr. Clinton to write to Mr. Adams "asking him to use his considerable influence with the IRA to have this practice stopped and the existing expulsions lifted, so that those living in exile may return." It asked him to bring the plight of those exiled by the terrorists to the attention of the Senate "urging them to lift the ban on Mr. Adams as a matter of urgency, as soon as the Republican movement lift the expulsion orders on Irish men and women." In the past year alone FAIT has dealt with 35 cases of forced expulsion involving 63 people -- 28 individuals and seven entire families.
