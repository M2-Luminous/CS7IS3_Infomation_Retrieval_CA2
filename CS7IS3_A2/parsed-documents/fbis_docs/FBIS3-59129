Sixty-seven small, shallow, operationally induced cracks have been discovered in the ferruginous pipes of the feed-water system filled with mildly radioactive water, a spokesman for the Schleswig-Holstein Energy Ministry confirmed in Kiel today. The cracks, which were caused by extensibility corrosion, are to be repaired through restoration work. Three cracks had already been discovered in the welding seams of the austenitic steel of the nuclear reactor during a series of special surprise tests carried out within the framework of fuel exchange of fuel rods last September. The plant, which is situated east of Hamburg, has been shut down since August 1993. The test of 876 seams in the ferruginous system was ordered when a leak was discovered in the feed-water system. The nuclear plant of Brunsbuettel, which is just as important for the production of electricity for Hamburg, was also shut down in the summer of 1992 because of numerous cracks. The restarting of both reactors cannot yet be foreseen, according to the ministry.
