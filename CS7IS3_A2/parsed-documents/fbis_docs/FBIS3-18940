Almost exactly four years ago this day, that is to say still before the restoration of German unity, we met for our first round of talks. Since then these regular meetings between representatives of the business community, the trade unions, and the federal and laender authorities have helped to analyze pressing problems regarding the development in eastern Germany and to initiate solutions. The comprehensive structural changes are still fully under way. Out of almost 10 million jobs more than 3 million have been lost -- with all the hardships unemployment causes for those affected. People have had to adapt to completely new living circumstances at breathtaking speed. Four decades of separation and such differing living conditions have left deep marks. In the history of a nation 40 years is a short period. Yet, for millions of people, this period constitutes a considerable part -- the best years in many cases -- of their lives. Thus, it is all the more important today to give the people a concrete perspective for their future. Looking back at what we have achieved so far, we can say that on our path to completing the economic and social unity of Germany we have made good progress despite all the difficulties. We have been able to disconnect to a large degree the economic development in the new laender from the recession in western Germany. This year we expect the economy in the new laender to grow between 6 and 8 percent in real terms. More than 600,000 businesses have been set up and thousands of enterprises reprivatized, which shows that the will to independence has developed very dynamically in the new laender. I would like to express my gratitude and respect to the entrepreneurs in the new laender. Their courage to embark on the course of self-employment with great resolution, particularly in this era of great changes, deserves our great respect and our strong support. The Federal Government is firmly determined to continue its policy of massive investment promotion at a high level. Since unification, government promotion has led to a total of about 190 billion German marks [DM] in private investment. Rapid investment is the key to success for developing eastern Germany. Existing enterprises must be modernized and new competitive enterprises established. This is the really promising path to create lasting jobs in eastern Germany. The necessary economic reconstruction is supported by private investors to a significant degree. Investment and purchasing promises, which the west German economy provided within the framework of the solidarity pact, also have been helpful. In my view it is of particular importance that in the coming year there will again be a sufficient number of places for apprentices. I do not want to elaborate on this issue today. Nevertheless, I hope we will all try as hard as we can in this connection. There will be talks with the economic associations and the trade unions in due course to produce another large-scale private training initiative. It does not make any sense to panic again and to call for public funds in this regard. I am sure we agree that a sizable contribution by the German credit sector will be essential in order to achieve the difficult restructuring of the east German economy. I am starting from the assumption that the promise of an additional DM1 billion, provided by the credit sector within the framework of the solidarity pact for the privatization of those Trust Agency enterprises that are capable of being salvaged, continues to apply and will be implemented. This is also a question of the banks' credibility. I am well aware that taking over Trust Agency enterprises may be quite difficult. Nevertheless, I would be glad if, despite these difficulties, the talks between the banking sector and the Trust Agency were to lead to positive results in the next few weeks. Ladies and Gentlemen, those who travel frequently to the new laender -- as I do -- and visit enterprises and factories there can be convinced that what is being built there are state-of-the-art production plants -- also by international standards. I am thinking, for example, of the new computer plant in Thuringia, of Europe's most modern automobile plant, new, highly efficient printing centers, or a factory for the construction of a new generation of aircraft engines. Every investor who comes to eastern Germany also takes the most progressive technology and latest know-how there. Public as well as private investment per capita is meanwhile higher than in western Germany, and investment activities are still increasing in the new laender. For 1994, the Ifo economic research institute expects investment spending to increase by 15 percent to a level of more than DM160 billion. This is investment in the future of all of Germany. It is the declared objective of the Federal Government to support as strongly as possible development of independent and competitive industry in eastern Germany. In the course of our talks, Minister Rexrodt will present an interim balance in this connection. For the successful establishment of modern economic structures we also must create the bases for an efficient energy supply that is adequate for eastern Germany as economic center. One important subject in this connection is the privatization of the east German electricity enterprises and of brown coal production. I would like to ask the representatives of the Trust Agency and the electricity producers to discuss this issue in the course of our meeting. In this connection I would like to welcome most warmly the representatives of the U.S.-British group that bought Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle AG. We expect that the billions that will be invested in the energy sector will also provide an essential contribution to the upswing in eastern Germany. Enterprises in the new laender should benefit from the orders for this investment to as large a degree as possible. Ladies and Gentlemen, we are one country. Germany will only prosper when we all prosper. Hence, overcoming the recession in the western laender is also of the utmost importance for the continuation of the upswing in the new laender. There are many signs that indicate that the economic recession is bottoming out and that recovery is gradually starting. The recession, has, however also laid bare structural problems whose elimination must no longer be put off. Necessary reforms have been neglected for decades. This applies to such important issues as railroad and postal reform, which we have now set in motion. These structural problems in the west are problems of the old FRG. They have nothing to do with German unity. On the contrary, the profound structural changes in the new laender are, at the same time, also increasing the chances for renewal in western Germany. Ladies and Gentlemen, one result of the recession and structural problems was that more than 4 million people in Germany have so far lost their jobs. This is depressing for me and for all of us. Nobody must remain indifferent when people become unemployed. Our most important joint duty is to secure employment and to create jobs. What we need now more than ever is the readiness to change our way of thinking and to act. The political, business, and trade union communities all have the obligation to meet their responsibilities and to help secure employment and create new jobs. With its report on securing the future of Germany as an economic center, the Federal Government last September presented a clear action program for more growth and employment. The public reaction to the report has been more than encouraging. The Federal Government with great energy and swiftness began to implement measures to improve Germany as an economic center that were contained in the report. In addition, in January, we agreed on an action program for more growth and employment. These measures are also being implemented. With these steps, once more, we are increasing the pace to secure the future of Germany as an economic center. These are important decisions needed to set the course for creating several hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the short and medium terms. In six months, more than two-thirds of the almost 90 measures that the Federal Government still envisaged for this legislative term have been implemented or successfully launched. The Federal Government is firmly determined to advance the implementation of further difficult measures even during the election campaign period. This will force us to make further efforts. I know that more and more people understand that these measures are indispensable. I would like to invite all of you to embark on this course together and act accordingly!
