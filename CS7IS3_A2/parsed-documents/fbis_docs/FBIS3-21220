MEL developed the new laser method for softening ceramic surfaces and combined this method with a machining technology with a diamond needle to perform cutting with the depth precision of a micron. In the previous chemical treatment, a ceramic sample was immersed in a liquid that tended to unnecessarily soften the entire surface. In contrast, with the new technology, only a desired part of the surface is softened and cut. This technology is expected to widen the application range of ceramics into the advanced material field including x-ray mirrors. According to Hiroko Hibi, the research engineer at MEL who was carrying out the research, the ceramics used were silicon nitride and silicon carbide. The laser was a krypton fluoride excimer laser with a frequency of 249 nm (1 nm is 1/1,000,000,000th of 1 m). Each of the hollow, disk-shaped samples of silicon nitride and silicon carbide, approximately 4 cm in diameter and approximately 8-mm thick (the diameter of the hollow interior being approximately 1.5 cm), was irradiated by a laser at each of three different energy levels; i.e., frequencies of 5, 10 and 20 Hz, and the ceramic surface was softened. At the same time, the sample was rotated and its surface was cut for 20 minutes with a diamond needle whose tip had a radius of curvature of 0.1 to 0.15mm. As a result, with the laser with a frequency of 5 Hz, a groove with a width of slightly less than 0.2mm and a depth of approximately 7 � was made on the surface of the silicon nitride disk, and a groove with a width slightly more than 0.2mm and a depth of 40 � was made on the surface of the silicon carbide disk. The cutting width and depth are said to be controllable by adjusting the needle size and the cutting time. In contrast, the lasers with frequencies of 10 and 20 Hz cut grooves 5-10 � deep on the silicon nitride disks and 10-20 � deep on the silicon carbide disks, but the groove widths were as wide as 1mm, which was too wide. Thus, the laser with a frequency of 5 Hz was considered to be the most suitable for machining. At the higher frequencies, surplus laser energy tended to soften the surface more than necessary, apparently resulting in excessive cutting. Without the aid of the laser, it was practically impossible to machine these ceramic disks. The hardness of a 100-percent silicon nitride ceramic piece was 17 gigapascal (giga is million, and pascal is a pressure unit); whereas its hardness was reduced to 1.2-1.9 gigapascal after laser irradiation. Laser irradiation causes silicon nitride and silicon carbide to change into softer silicon dioxide and silicon. The energy for this softening change is estimated to be at least 0.005 J/mm[.sup]2[/] for silicon nitride and at least 0.012 J/mm[.sup]2[/] for silicon carbide.
