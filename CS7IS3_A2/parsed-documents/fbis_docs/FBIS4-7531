I consider also the affair with resident-agent Ames recently discovered in the ranks of the CIA to be evidence of this. I believe that his arrest was prompted by the Russians themselves." This was stated in an interview by Jaroslav Basta, former deputy chief of intelligence and current chairman of the Independent Screening Commission, who engages in the study of the development of secret services. "It is something similar to the Kozeny-Wallis affair, when Mr. Kozeny informed on Wallis in such a way that the case could no longer be processed by intelligence means but only by penal ones." [Stanek] What does it have to do with the Czech Republic? [Basta] According to the postwar statistics, the KGB had its "moles" in every security service. Under the circumstances existing in the Czech Republic since November 1989, it is completely impossible for someone like Ames not to sit in the Czech secret services. If the Czech secret service has not discovered any agent so far, it means either that we are an exception or that we are incapable of finding him. [Stanek] What makes our small country so interesting for the KGB now? [Basta] Intelligence services are working in anticipation. Their main task is to detect future dangers and possibilities. It is advantageous for Russia to be here if it has imperial aspirations, which has been demonstrated more than once. Moreover, it is possible to have cover firms in the Czech Republic, or firms making money for espionage. In this context, I remember how Ames drew attention to himself--his expenses were higher than his income. It is customary in the United States to examine the financial situation of all government employees, and not just of the secret service staff. The common practice in the Czech Republic, on the other hand, is that only disagreeable people are checked. Hence, no one cares whether a prominent person purchased a Jaguar like Mr. Ames, or how much the house in which he lives cost. [Stanek] Why would the Russians eliminate their own resident-agent? [Basta] The KGB needs to improve its reputation. It is a part of the revival of the empire. I cannot but recall the words uttered by Zhirinovskiy as he burst in at the conference on the KGB in Moscow last May and attacked its participants for aggression against the KGB, which, in his opinion, belongs to the best tradition of the Russian empire and the Soviet Union. By the "Ames action," the KGB immediately improved its reputation at home, because it demonstrated--look, the supreme boss of the U.S. counterintelligence against Russian intelligence was in fact our man; that is the kind of person we can recruit. Shortly thereafter, the Russians also came up with the exposure of the British spy. [Stanek] Was it worth it to them? [Basta] The Americans had suspected Ames for three years, which would present the possibility of Ames being recruited back to the U.S. side, or the Russians could have thought that this was in the works. As far as Ames's arrest goes, there was no need for FBI agents to go through the waste baskets. They could have foisted well-prepared disinformation upon him, for instance, and waited until it appeared on the Russian side. That would suffice for his condemnation. In the end, it was not the FBI but, rather, the Russians who won this discreet game. [Stanek] Immediately after Ames was exposed, KGB head Golushko resigned, allegedly for health reasons. How do you feel about this? [Basta] Although Russian intelligence officially disclosed that Golushko's resignation had nothing to do with the Ames affair, Nikolay Golushko is, after Vadim Bakatin, the second KGB head who came to the organization from without and had to leave. The similarity between their fates is also in their start following a failed coup. It seems that the immunity ability of the KGB and its successor organizations remains completely unhurt. If such a person as Golushko leaves, it does not mean anything good for our future. Every such event brings up the question of whether something like that is also possible here.
