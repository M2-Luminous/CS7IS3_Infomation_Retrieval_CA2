U.S. Embassy staff in the Saudi capital greeted the evacuees, also including British, German, Dutch and Egyptian nationals, at Riyadh airport, the sources said. The United States said Friday it would evacuate non-essential diplomatic personnel from Yemen and advised other U.S. nationals to leave the country because of the fighting between northern and southern forces. In Washington, State Department spokesman Christine Shelly said the U.S. had issued a travel warning for American citizens and was making arrangements for those in Yemen to leave. Officials expect as many as 1,000 of the estimated 5,150 U.S. nationals in Yemen to leave soon, she added.
