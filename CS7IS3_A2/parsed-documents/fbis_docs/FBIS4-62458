The publication includes a number of statements which need to be clarified as follows. First: In February 1993, the command of the Tallinn Naval Base, with the permission of higher authorities, concluded an agreement with the Estonian "Bankers" firm on the disposal of scrap metal from two decommissioned hovercraft minesweepers. The decommissioning was carried out over two months at a dock in Kopli harbor. Provisions of the agreement, including those concerning payment, were fulfilled by both sides. According to a representative of the user of these ships, there were no radioactive substances in the units or systems of the minesweepers. That is to say, information contained in the above-mentioned article concerning "components with radiation levels of 200 Roentgen per hour" does not correspond to the facts. The command of the Tallinn Naval Base has not received any complaints from any side with regard to this. Second: A statement by the paper concerning a collection point for scrap metal, which was allegedly opened on the Naval Base under the authorization of the Tallinn garrison chief, does not correspond to the facts, as well. Third: The publication points out that "the background radiation in the Mine Harbor exceeds natural radiation levels by 40 times." Obviously, this statement has its origin in the following real fact. In March 1994, workers on two decommissioned minesweepers in the Mine Harbor of the Tallinn port unscreened remote-controlled pickup units with one radioactive "Cesium-137" unit in each. This caused a brief period of excess natural background radiation. On 22 March, the screens of the pickup units were reestablished; on 30 March, they were dismantled and stored in a special depository at the Paldiski garrison. The ensuing measurements, which were taken in the Mine Harbor by naval specialists along with representatives of the Estonian side, did not detect any excess levels of natural background radiation. The distortion of real facts and the dissemination of corresponding "sensations," which take place in various Latvian and Estonian media, do not assist in the normal, planned process of withdrawing Russian troops and naval forces from the territory of these republics.
