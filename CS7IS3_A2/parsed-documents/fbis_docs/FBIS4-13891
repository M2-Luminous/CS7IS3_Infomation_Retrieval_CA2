In a statement issued today at the end of its meetings in Baghdad, the symposium denounced the serious violations of international laws and humanity that are committed against children and women, especially during armed conflicts. The statement said that discrimination and the unfair treatment of women represent basic injustices and violations of the human rights accepted by all international charters and norms. The statement condemned using food and medicine as a tool for political pressures on world peoples to influence their political choices and to undermine their right to freely choose their future and their political and economic systems away from external intervention. The symposium welcomed the UN General Assembly adoption of a declaration on ending violence against women in the public and private sectors and to stop all forms of trade in women. The symposium emphasized that countries should join the agreement on eliminating discrimination against women and abide by its rules in their national legislation and in implementation of these rules. The symposium recommended giving priority to funds that are allotted for covering the needs of women and children over repayment of foreign debts when introducing infrastructural adaptation measures the World Bank imposes on Third World countries. The symposium emphasized its faith in the principles of the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and its commitment to the objectives of the Nairobi strategy on improving women's conditions by the year 2000 and on equality and development. The international symposium on human rights for women, which was held in Baghdad on 20-22 April, was attended by 22 Arab and foreign countries.
