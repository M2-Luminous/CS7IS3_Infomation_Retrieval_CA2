Lawmakers voted 253-67 for the resolution on amnesty which comes into effect at the moment of publication and is to be implemented in six months. The amnesty covers, besides businessmen convicted in Soviet years, also organisers of the 1991 abortive Soviet coup, the leaders of hard-line opposition revolt last October in Moscow, as well as organisers of the hard-line demonstration last May which clashed with police. The leaders in question include former Soviet top officials now facing trial, arrested former parliament chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov and former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, as well as diehard opposition members Viktor Anpilov, Ilya Konstantinov and others. "This is the beginning of a civil war in Russia", Sergey Yushchenkov, chairman of the Duma Committee on Defence commented. He accused Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin of promoting such a vote by ignoring many lawmakers who wanted to speak against it. Rybkin told the Duma before the vote that the amnesty was necessary to "escape from suspicion, gloating expectations of certain changes and possible settling of accounts". "We are destined to accord to get out of the crisis", he said. "The Duma is firmly convinced that Russia needs civic peace, accord and construction to get out of the crisis. Russians await from us such an accord and interaction between the president, the Federation Council, the State Duma and the Constitutional Court", he added.
