Kull said that another reason to join NATO is that despite making some positive statements, Russia has not damaged [as received]to prove the friendliness and democracy of its foreign policy. "Russian statements in connection with the Lithuanian wish to join NATO sound a bit nervous, and, in fact, strengthen the wish to join," Kull said. "It appears that Russia does not consider NATO as a friendly alliance. Although Russian military doctrine stresses that Russia has no enemies, including NATO, it still is against other states joining NATO," Kull said. Kull said that it must be considered, how real and possible the widening of NATO is at the present moment. "The Lithuanian application will most probably have no results at the present moment, for NATO has not managed to determine its future and identity in the changing world," Kull said. Vello Saatpalu, head of Riigikogu foreign committee, who returned from the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly political and security council committee session in Brussels, said the Lithuanian application was a "good shake to the dispersing Western Europe", admitting, however, that Estonia and Latvia were not yet ready for a similar statement. "We have still several conflicts with our Eastern neighbor, but the step will have to be taken in the future," Saatpalu said.
