Crimean Supreme Soviet deputy Aleksandr Kruglov has been elected its chairman. Political instability is leading to economic instability. The U.S. dollar, the West German mark, and the Russian ruble have surged in value. Dollar bills are being bought at the rate of $1 per 50,000 karbovanets. Large-denomination Russian bank notes (they are especially valued) go at 1:25. The people, repeatedly cheated by the state and "fed" by rumors about the introduction of the Ukrainian hryvna, are actively dumping coupons and sweeping everything off the shelves.
