In order to find out its aims and objectives our correspondent turned to a long-time RDRM supporter, Air Force Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, former commander in chief of the CIS Armed Forces, a political figure who ran on the movement's ticket in the 12 December elections. [KURANTY] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, what are the main aims of the RDRM's second congress? [Shaposhnikov] First: We need to sum up the results of our work in the period between the congresses and during the election campaign. To make an analysis. Second: to determine our program for the immediate future. The program should be specific. Metaphorically speaking, our aims and objectives should be more "down-to-earth." [KURANTY] Can organizational changes be expected? [Shaposhnikov] I am not a leader of the movement. To some extent I would like some changes to take place, but without the movement's evolving into a party. I categorically oppose a strict hierarchy or party centralism. [KURANTY] What are the main methods the RDRM employs to raise its effectiveness? [Shaposhnikov] We have a fairly large number of sympathizers. At present, to pursue our political line we need to strengthen our vertical structures somewhat.
