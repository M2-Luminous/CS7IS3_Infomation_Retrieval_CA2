A Small-Caliber Show to be Held In Vladimir"] [Text] The "Rosvooruzheniye" state arms company held a news conference in Vladimir yesterday devoted to a firearms and small-caliber artillery weaponry show from 24 to 28 May. While rather representative delegations of potential foreign buyers are expected to be on hand at the show, "Rosvooruzheniye" representatives seem to be worried by other problems. Russia has two fairs selling its arms -- in Nizhniy Novgorod (heavy combat equipment) and in Vladimir (small arms). As was announced at the news conference, the May exhibition in Vladimir will showcase many of the latest models of small and special arms including models not yet mass-produced. They are mainly portable submachine guns (in particular the "Vikhr" and the 9A-93 model) superior to the Israel's Usi, as well as individual weapons of an "enhanced stopping power" -- the "Gyurza" pistol, and the "Udar" 12.7mm revolver. Right there at the show (it will cost 170 million rubles) one would be able to buy sporting guns made in Tula and Izhevsk plants. The troubles involved in arranging the show are much less than the anxiety clearly plaguing the "Rosvooruzheniye" company. The point is that the government decree of 8 May 1994 grants weapons manufacturers the right to independent external economic activity. According to Colonel Aleksandr Semenov, deputy chief of the "Rosvooruzheniye's" regional policy administration, the decree does not rule out cooperation between the company and the manufacturers as regards marketing, looking for customers, and pricing. However, Mr. Semenov said, the "Rosvooruzheniye" is yet to make sense of the decree whose issue came for the company as somewhat a surprise. "Rosvooruzheniye" representatives were more specific talking in the press conference lobby -- they thought the government decree clashes with the president's edict under which the company was set up. According to one guess, the decree was just a "tranquilizer" given to the arms manufacturers many of whom "reacted rather nervously to the setting up of a state monopolist in the shape of the "Rosvooruzheniye."
