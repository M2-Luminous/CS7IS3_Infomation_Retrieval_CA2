Orimulsion is a new fuel developed by Venezuela that can be burned to generate electricity directly. This natural bitumen is obtained at our Faja del Orinoco site. [Begin recording] [Moreno] Could you tell us Pro-Venezuela's reasons for rejecting the discriminatory actions against Orimulsion by the United States and the UK? [Martinez] We are presenting a strong protest to the U.S. and UK Governments, through their respective embassies in the country, for the discriminatory treatment given, in the case of the United States, to the reformulated gasoline we export to that country, and in the case of the UK, for the unfriendly actions of the government against Orimulsion. The UK took an internal policy problem to the European Union and requested that Orimulsion, a new fuel developed by Venezuela, be inaccurately classified. [end recording]
