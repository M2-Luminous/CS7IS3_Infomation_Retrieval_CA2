This is because certain ministries and agencies seem to have turned to be negative about deregulations following the inauguration of the minority government. We cannot allow them to take such negative attitudes. On 13 May, the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan [Keidanren] handed over to Prime Minister Hata a request calling for carrying out drastic deregulations for 196 items in seven areas of business such as land and housing, information and communications, goods distribution, and agriculture. We believe Keidanren must have perceived such a negative atmosphere within ministries and agencies. The government sets deregulation measures as a main pillar of its market-opening package -- aimed at stimulating the sluggish Japanese economy and its appetite for imports -- scheduled to be worked out in June. Deregulatory steps are preconditions for rectifying trade imbalance; creating more transparent, open markets; and maintaining domestic demand-led economic growth. The prime minister, after a meeting with Keidanren on 13 May, in which he was strongly urged to take deregulatory steps, called a first meeting with his select ministers including foreign and finance ministers and confirmed with them a stand of positively coming to grips with the issue. As reflected in this issue, politicians are required to take leadership also in the area of deregulations. It is expected that deregulation can help create new business chances, thus leading to stimulating the nation's economy. On the other hand, it is painful for certain business circles which have long enjoyed their vested right and for authoritative ministries and agencies to promote deregulation. It is statesmen's role to promote deregulation while breaking down the resistance of bureaucrats. Foreign nations are taking increasing interest in Japan's deregulatory steps. At the meeting of select cabinet members, Foreign Minister Kakizawa said European nations and the United States are calling for various deregulation measures including the easing of the Building Standards Act and the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law and the expediting of customs services at airports. At an Office of Trade Investment Ombudsmen meeting held on the same day, a deregulation proposal was presented calling for easing 21 regulations, including one that limits driving licenses for large motorcycles -- which is very difficult to obtain -- to help foreign-made products get access the Japanese market. The proposal also says the time required for obtaining import permission for cosmetics and perfumes should be shortened. If the government fails to come up with full deregulatory steps in spite of growing calls for deregulation, Japan will be exposed to foreign nations' harsh criticism. Of course, deregulation is not meant only to meet requests of foreign nations. In fact, more emphasis should be placed on boosting Japan's economy. Deregulation is a prerequisite to boosting the domestic demand in Japan, which is required to reform its economic structure. It is unavoidable for Japan to carry out deregulation no matter what the political situation is. When handing over its written deregulation request to the prime minister, Keidanren asked the government to adopt three principles: 1) "zero-base principle" -- that requires the review of all existing regulations; 2) "sunset principle" -- that requires the abolishment or review of newly introduced regulations at least five years after introduction; and 3) "openness principle" -- that requires the holding of open hearings when new regulations are introduced. We believe these are very important. It is hoped that the government will come up with a deregulation package in light of Keidanren's requests. For example, the demand for mobile phones has drastically increased recently, thus leading to a short supply of products. In addition, there is a plan afoot by some local towns to brew their own beer. It is apparent deregulation on mobile phones and brewing businesses are contributing to boosting the demand for mobile phones and local towns' brewing plans. There is a lot of business chances in the Japanese market. The government should not nip such business chances in the bud. Carrying out deregulation is also urgently required in view of encouraging the private sector to stand by itself.
