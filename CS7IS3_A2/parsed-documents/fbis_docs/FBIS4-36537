Within the framework of my meetings with senior officials in this fraternal country over the past two days, this morning I met with His Excellency Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. After conveying condolences to the martyrs of the recent massacre during the barbaric Zionist aggression against Lebanon, we discussed regional and international issues, and bilateral relations. We agreed on the need to expand and deepen bilateral relations and joint cooperation in various spheres. Regarding developments and events in the region, especially the repeated attacks by the Zionist enemy on Lebanon, our views were completely identical. We agreed that the Zionist enemy cannot influence Lebanese policy or the resistance by the Lebanese sons through attacks, threats, and evil acts. The resistance is fully supported by the Lebanese Government. If the Israeli attacks and threats have any effect, it is only to strengthen the unity and cohesiveness of the Lebanese people and Lebanese Government in their steadfastness against the Zionist enemy. This was stated by His Excellency Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri who said: We support the resistance. Resistance is the Lebanese people's legitimate right and the government will support it. [Correspondent] We are grateful that you have helped Lebanon. There are reports that there were Iranian victims among those killed in the Israeli raid on a Hizballah position in the Ba'labakk area. Are these reports true? [Khonsari] This is not true at all. This is the first time that I have heard that. [Correspondent] Is there any new information about the fate of the abducted Iranians? [Khonsari] I have no knowledge of this. Of course, we expect the Lebanese Government to pursue the right course and follow up on the fate of these hostages, particularly as they were Iranian diplomats kidnapped on this land. We have no accurate knowledge of their fate. The entire Iranian people and Iranian Government, certainly the families of these brothers, are always waiting to hear positive news about the fate of these brothers and the necessary measures to free them. [Correspondent] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani says that the abducted Iranians are in Israel? [Khonsari] One possibility is that they are alive and prisoners of the Zionist enemy. [Correspondent] Are there plans for you to conclude agreements on developing bilateral relations with the Lebanese Government? [Khonsari] We, the Islamic Republic of Iran, are ready to have comprehensive cooperation in all the spheres that Lebanon desires. [Correspondent] Thank you.
