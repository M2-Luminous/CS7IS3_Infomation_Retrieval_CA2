Hadas, who has the rank but not the recognition of ambassador, is the first Israeli diplomat accredited to the Holy See and his appointment is the result of the agreement last December 30 for mutual recognition, but not yet full official, diplomatic relations. The visit by the Israeli diplomat, observers pointed out, was one of courtesy given that he has yet to present letters of accreditation. This, they added, explained why there were not official addresses and official Vatican sources did not comment on the event. Born in Argentina of Polish parents, in 1931, Shmuel Hadas is married with two children. He emigrated to Israel in 1954 and has held diplomatic posts in Mexico, Colombia, Bolivia and Spain. He has also represented Israel at several international forums, included the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). In related developments today, the official Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, voiced satisfaction for the latest positive developments in the negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It is the position of the Holy See, he recalled, to favor, in the Middle East as elsewhere else in the world, negotiations which lead to solutions which respect the rights of men and peoples, including Israel's right to security and the right of Palestinians for a state.
