An editorial published today by the weekly TRABAJADORES insists Cuba mainly needs that workers everywhere to discuss in depth issues dealing with the financial reorganization, among other vital issues, given the difficult situation that currently prevails. "It is time for all of us to realize the specific political and educational responsibility that corresponds to the labor movement within the struggle for survival and afterwards, when we fully enter a different world in many ways," it states. The article gives continuity to other reflections included in the newspaper concerning the role that must be played by workers in the island's economic reorganization process, given the worsening of the U.S. blockade and the loss of its main trade partners in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It urges workers to analyze ways to counter the excess of circulating money and solve the budget deficit; decide whether or not unproductive enterprises should be subsidized; decide if it would be appropriate to implement a tax on salaries -- among other current topics of interest for all the Cuban people. The publication says: Acquainting himself with the mentality of a society owner will enable each worker to implement the principle of "I am the revolution." It adds: Nothing can be so demoralizing as laziness, indolence, negligence, careless work, lack of control on costs and expenses, the brazen squandering of resources, and the defeatism which imbues the atmosphere in certain work centers. Assuming its role as official paper of the Central Organization of Cuban Trade Unions, the weekly strives to prepare approximately 3 million workers for imminent changes in the country's economic and financial system and, in fact, propose possible solutions from their work posts. What actions can we carry out to encourage discipline and work morale? How can we produce more, or better, with less costs? Where can we reduce personnel? What policy should we follow with excess personnel? What can we do to reduce or eliminate subsidies? These are some of the issues on which it urges workers to meditate.
