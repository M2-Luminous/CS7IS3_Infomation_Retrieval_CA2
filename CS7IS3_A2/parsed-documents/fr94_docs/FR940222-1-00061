SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The flat-tailed horned lizard ( Phrynosoma mcallii ) is a small iguanid lizard restricted to flats and valleys of the western Sonoran desert. Its maximum length, excluding the tail, is about 8 centimeters (3 inches) (Stebbins 1985). The range of the flat-tailed horned lizard includes portions of Riverside, Imperial and extreme eastern San Diego Counties, California; northeastern Baja California, Mexico; Yuma County, Arizona; and northwestern Sonora, Mexico. An estimated 34 percent of historically occupied flat-tailed horned lizard habitat has been lost. About 95 percent of remaining optimal habitat in California is threatened by one or more factors. Various human activities threaten 36 percent of the remaining habitat in Arizona. The flat-tailed horned lizard and its habitat are also being adversely affected in Mexico, but to a lesser degree. The Service published the proposed rule detailing these factors in the Federal Register on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62629). The Service has scheduled a public hearing on Tuesday, March 22, 1994, in response to formal requests from the public. Those parties wishing to make a statement for the record should bring a copy of their statement to present to the Service at the start of the hearing. Oral statements may be limited in length, if the number of parties present at the hearing necessitates such a limitation. However, the length of written comments or materials presented at the hearing or mailed to the Service are not limited. Written comments will be given the same weight as oral comments. Written comments may be submitted at the hearing or mailed to the address given in the ADDRESSES section of this notice. The comment period closes on April 22, 1994.
