The total volume of imports by the BLEU was 12.4 billion Belgian francs [BFr] from January to October 1993, as against BFr10.9 billion for the 10 corresponding months of 1992 (up 13.6 percent). The total volume of exports by the BLEU to China for the same period was BFr20.5 billion, compared with BFr10.6 billion (up 94 percent). At the end of October 1992, the balance of trade was around BFr300 million in China's favor. One year later, it was BFr8.1 billion in the BLEU's favor. The BLEU's performance is particularly striking because the total trade between the European Union and China shows a deficit to the detriment of the Twelve. In 1993, the BLEU exported mainly machinery and electrical equipment (worth BFr8.9 billion, in other words a trebling), base metals (worth more than BFr3.6 billion, in other words four times as much), chemical products (worth almost BFr2.5 billion, in other words a drop of 40 percent), and plastics (BFr629 million, in other words a drop of 30 percent). The Chinese exported to the BLEU mainly textile products (BFr3.8 billion, in other words an increase of 80 percent), chemical products (BFr1.5 billion, in other words an increase of 17 percent), vegetable and food products (BFr1.2 billion, in other words a drop of 38 percent), and minerals (1.1 billion, in other words a drop of 1.7 percent).
