FR940404-0-00080 FR940404-0-00021 50 CFR Part 651 [Docket No. 931243&hyph;3343; I.D. 032594B] Northeast Multispecies Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Emergency interim rule, extension of effective dates. SUMMARY: An emergency interim rule in effect through April 2, 1994, to protect overfished stocks of haddock is extended from April 3, 1994, through June 30, 1994, because conditions warranting the emergency still exist. The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) extends the 500-lb (226.8-kg) possession limit of haddock for all vessels permitted under the regulations governing the Northeast Multispecies Fishery and for all vessels in possession of haddock from or in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), except for scallop dredge vessels, which are prohibited from possessing or landing haddock; and the closure of the area known as Closed Area II. Extension of other measures contained in the emergency rule is not necessary, since these were permanently implemented on March 1, 1994, under Amendment 5 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The intended effect of this rule is to provide protection to depleted haddock and cod stocks. EFFECTIVE DATE: Section 651.9 paragraphs (a) (11) and (12), (e) (33) and (34); and ยง651.27(b), as published on March 1, 1994 (59 FR 9872), remain effective from April 3, 1994, through June 30, 1994. Section 651.21(b)(3)(i) is temporarily suspended and ยง651.21(b)(6) is temporarily added effective April 3, 1994, through June 30, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the Environmental Assessment (EA) supporting this action may be obtained from Richard B. Roe, Regional Director, National Marine Fisheries Service, One Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, MA 01930. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan A. Murphy, Fishery Policy Analyst, Northeast Region, NMFS, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9252. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under section 305(c) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act), the Secretary promulgated an emergency interim rule (59 FR 26, January 3, 1994) that implemented cod and haddock protective measures for the Northeast multispecies fishery for the period January 3, 1994, through April 2, 1994. The emergency interim rule implemented: (1) A 500-lb (226.8-kg) possession limit of haddock for all vessels permitted under 50 CFR 651.4 and for all vessels in possession of haddock from or in the EEZ, except scallop dredge vessels, which are prohibited from possessing or landing haddock; (2) an early closure of the area known as Closed Area II, except for lobster pot vessels and scallop dredge vessels; (3) an expansion of Closed Area II by 20 minutes longitude to the west and 15 minutes latitude to the south, along its existing western and southern boundaries, intersecting with the Regulated Mesh Boundary line; (4) a suspension of the closure of the area known as Closed Area I, except for vessels using sink gillnet gear; (5) a prohibition on transfer of fish at sea; and (6) a ban on pair trawling in the multispecies fishery. With the agreement of the New England Fishery Management Council, the Secretary extends the emergency interim rule under provisions of section 305(c)(3)(B) of the Magnuson Act because conditions warranting this emergency still exist. The 500-lb (226.8-kg) haddock possession limit, except for scallop dredge vessels, which are prohibited from possessing or landing haddock, and the closure of Closed Area II, are extended from April 3, 1994, through June 30, 1994.
