During a special inspection, TCU personnel discovered that Proagro is not supervised. Ademar Guisi, the TCU rapporteur for the case, was surprised at the results of the inspection. He said: "Proagro is totally uncoordinated, disorganized, and is not supervised. This has turned Proagro into a veritable Pandora's box." Proagro, which is managed by the Central Bank, was created to cover farmers' debts to banks whenever bad crops occurred due to acts of nature. TCU personnel found various irregularities, such as payment for nonexistent liabilities. Most of the diverted funds went out this way. [passage omitted]
