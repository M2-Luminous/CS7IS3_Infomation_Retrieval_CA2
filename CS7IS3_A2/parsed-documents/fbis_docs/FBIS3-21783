This marks the beginning of the activities of the committee headed by People's Deputy Viktar Piskarov, former interior minister. The committee's working bodies comprise people who formerly worked in law enforcement agencies, as well as physicians and scientists from the four founder-states. These are different people but they have things in common: High professionalism and an understanding of the relevance of the problems to be resolved by the committee. This is why the multifarious directions of the International Committee's activities include a comprehensive education project, and the drafting of concepts and programs on preserving the genetic health of the nation. The committee will be rendering assistance to medical and scientific institutions and industrial enterprises for implementing antinarcotic projects.
