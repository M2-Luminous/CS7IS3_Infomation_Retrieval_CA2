To what dangers did the political report refer? There are four dangers: -- The most outstanding danger is the possibility of being left further behind economically. We are already behind when compared to our neighbor countries. We will be left further behind if we do not perform well in leadership, management and in many other tasks. This could lead to lagging economic development, low efficiency, and backward industry. This will make our life more difficult, jeopardize political stability, and limit our ability to consolidate national defense and security. -- The risk of being disoriented from socialism will happen if we are not able to overcome the deviations in the lines and policies as well as in the implementation of those policies and lines. The aforesaid achievements proved that we basically have been moving in the right direction. At the same time we have nurtured many deviations that are not acceptable in socialism. On the ideology front, the struggle against misguided and hostile viewpoints is slow and shows a lack of profound awareness about the dark scheme and sabotage activities of hostile forces, which are aimed at scrapping the party and socialism. A low level of vigilance prevails. Deviations from socialism have led to the birth of straying trends denying the revolutionary achievements on culture and literature and arts, claiming that literature and arts should be separate from the political lines of the party. In the economic context, the state-managed and the cooperative economic sectors are slow to renovate and consolidate. The state-managed economic sector has not played well its leadership role in both production and distribution. In many localities, cadres do not exercise thrift to save more for national construction, thus causing big losses and waste to the state and collective properties. We have to do our utmost to avoid this danger, not only at the level of grassroots management, but also at the levels of policy making and orientation. Errors made in the phases of guiding or steering the implementation of lines and policies may lead to wrong lines and policies. -- The danger of corruption and authoritarianism. Corruption has become a national disaster, a hot and urgent issue that is wearing down our people's confidence. Authoritarianism makes the party and state distant from the people. It can produce actions that run counter to the interests and aspirations of the people thus damaging the trust of people in the party and state. -- The plots and activities of "peaceful evolution" initiated by hostile forces constitute a major and serious danger. To prevent and counter "peaceful evolution," we have to fight this violent subversion plot, which is a class struggle, a struggle between capitalism and socialism at a very complicated and decisive stage. This struggle has a vital meaning to the survival of our party and political regime, and to the independence of our country. The four dangers have, between themselves, inter-related and dialectical relations. Successful suppression of one danger will limit the development of the others, and vice versa. The danger of "peaceful evolution" has effected, and is effecting vigorously internal dangers. Elimination of internal dangers means the failure of the "peaceful evolution" plot of hostile forces. We will firmly grab our opportunity to develop advantages and strength. We are capable and we will repel all four dangers 5. What is the background of our achievements? The party midterm national conference has affirmed that the most basic, vital reason for our achievements is our party's determination to maintain a leadership role, reject pluralism and a multiparty system, safeguard our independence, and innovatively set up lines and policies that suit the rules and realities of Vietnam. This will successfully motivate the comprehensive strength of the national unity bloc and expand international cooperation. Our party is a party of the worker class, the representative for the interests of the worker class, the laborers, and the people as a whole. This reality has been proved through the great victories scored by our people under the leadership of the party. Taking advantage of the current complicated situation in the world, the reactionaries, those hostile forces attacking us, are attempting to overthrow our regime in various ways. The most dangerous of them is the call for pluralism, a multiparty political system, and the legitimization of the opposition and reactionary forces. Realities in other socialist countries showed that the practice of pluralism and multiparty system is the prelude to a loss of leadership by communist parties, to the fall of people's governments, to the demise of social order, and to the growth of ethnic hatred and a difficult life for people. In order to obtain further successes in our renovation, our party has to continue to develop Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought, especially Lenin's thought on the new economic policy and state capitalism. The party has to work out innovative transition models and intermediate steps that suit our concrete circumstances in order to firmly bring the country to socialism. II. The New Development Stage and Major Tasks In evaluating achievements and analyzing weaknesses, the conference has come to an important assessment: In spite of the shortcomings we need to overcome, there have been important achievements created. We need to create the premises for the country to shift to a new development stage, one of industrialization and modernization. Those premises include many elements in both stature and strength, in both physical and spiritual contexts, as well as in economic, political, cultural, and social fields from both inside and outside the country. The conference determined the transition phases to the new development stage. We have not had all the premises yet, and we should not hastily advance to the new stage. We have to advance carefully as we continue to solve remaining issues. This way we will avoid economic crisis and create more premises for industrialization and modernization.
