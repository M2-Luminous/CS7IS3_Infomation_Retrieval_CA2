"Every day we listen to the threats of Croatian leaders that they will take Krajina by force. We do not underestimate these threats, although in most cases they are caused by internal instability in the Republic of Croatia and by the fact that President Tudjman himself is trying to mobilize Croats politically and in general, hoping to remain in power in this way," Vojnica told a TANJUG correspondent. He added: "The fact that they are arming themselves with fighter planes and helicopters is also not unknown to us." "We have convened a session of the assembly for 1 July and one of the items on the agenda -- apart from revisions of certain laws relating to the system -- will be an initiative of the assembly's defense committee; that is, our stand that the RSK army must be given its place in a system which would guarantee its citizens peace and stability and which would guarantee that Croatia's threats will not be realized," the RSK parliament speaker declared. He added: "The priority task of the RSK assembly and government is the defense system and the consolidation of ties with Serbia, Montenegro, and the Srpska republic." Commenting on RSK prime minister Borislav Mikelic's visit to Italy, Vojnica said: "The aim of the visit is to examine economic ties and exchange views on issues of mutual interest. We do not intend to bypass the issue of the provisions of the Ossimo Agreement. We support Italy's stands on the revision of the Ossimo Agreement; this has now become a public issue in Italy. We are against manipulation by anyone where Yugoslavia is concerned and where the guarantees that existed earlier are concerned. Everything has been disrupted, no one recognizes Yugoslavia, and horrific sanctions have been imposed upon it."
