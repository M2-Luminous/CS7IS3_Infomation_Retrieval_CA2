Here is the chronicle of chaos in the offing. "We have in our hands all the winning cards for success." So said Algerian Minister of Interior Salim Saadi on 23 March. Quite obviously, his remarks have more to do with saber rattling or the Coue method than they do with an even slightly realistic assessment of the situation. Furthermore, to give his speech a degree of credibility, he was speaking in Blida, the center of Islamic fundamentalism. Prior to his speech, it had been necessary to make a three-day sweep of the "city of roses." Official result: 100 dead. By what miracle was it expected that the inhabitants, whom fear or conviction had led to side with the Islamists, would rally to the Army once the minister's speech was over? Alain Juppe, the head of French diplomacy, is closer to the truth when he talks about "catastrophic deterioration." Losses in human life were estimated at about 15 per day at the start of this year, but they are much more numerous today. ACHARK AL-AWSAT, which, along with AL-HAYAT, another Arabic daily in London, provides the best coverage of the war, counted 1,000 dead in the month of Ramadan alone. The targets are police officers, judges, journalists, and women, with deaths being announced every day. There are also the anonymous victims of reprisals carried out by the "ninjas." According to Amnesty International, "the security forces commit murders and carry out summary executions every day with complete impunity." For their part, the guerrilla fighters have passed to a more advanced stage. One Western diplomat says: "With growing boldness, they are carrying out planned operations." It is not rare for groups of 120 or 130 fighters to attack Army units consisting of barely 40 or 50 soldiers. The demoralization among loyalist troops is shown by the mass desertions, particularly among conscripts. According to French intelligence reports, the ANP [People's National Army] can count on only 40,000 men, whereas the Islamic army can muster 10,000! That being the case, one can understand why the generals prefer to withdraw to their barracks even if it means abandoning entire regions to the enemy (see the map, which was originally published in LIBERATION). <graphic> <annot> Key: 1.

All hope of settling the crisis has disappeared. That hope increased at the end of January, when Liamine Zeroual took over as head of state. A former general who is minister of defense as well as president, he seemed to be in the best position to seek a compromise with the rebellion. And in fact, he was soon talking about "serious dialogue" and "leaving no one out." Discreet contact was established with the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] leaders in prison, especially Abbassi Madani and Ali Benhadj. General Tayeb Deradji, his go-between in those contacts, publicly mentioned the possibility of their release: "If it can put an end to the violence, why not?" Meanwhile, two other Islamic leaders were released. Besides, what was known of the FIS attitude was not unreasonable. It wanted the leaders of the armed rebellion to be included in the negotiations and asked that its leaders be released in order to talk to them. Of course, the whole problem would be to agree on a return to the electoral process and on the transitional period. But nothing seemed impossible, provided that the crisis was dealt with politically instead of by the "total security" approach that had been in effect for two years. A few days later, the scaffolding had collapsed. President Zeroual's policy of dialogue had hardly been sketched out before being violently combated within the Armed Forces. The offensive began on 8 March. International Women's Day provided the occasion for denouncing plans to negotiate with the Islamists. Picking up on the fact that "Zeroual" rhymes with "seroual" ("trousers"), one not-too-subtle banner called upon the president not to drop his pants [that is, not to lose his nerve]! That slogan was taken up by a daily newspaper close to the "eradicators." The funeral of the great dramatist Abdelkader Alloula in Oran on 16 March turned into a demonstration against "dialogue." In his funeral oration, Prime Minister Redha Malek, a supporter of "eradication," agreed completely. Three days later, the daily EL WATAN attacked President Zeroual by name. It said in substance that his policy lacked military support and was a long way from doing so. And that it was leading the country into disaster. The article in EL WATAN was a first. The press, whether captive or diversified, had never before been seen attacking a president who is not only an Army man but also minister of defense to boot. It goes without saying that the newspaper was not demonstrating journalistic prowess. The explanation is of another kind altogether. In the greatest secrecy and for three days running--16, 17, and 18 March--the heads of the Armed Forces conferred on the strategy to be adopted regarding the Islamic rebellion. Clearly, the policy of dialogue advocated by Zeroual was no longer supported by everyone. His fiercest opponent, General Mohamed Lamari, chief of staff and commander of the special forces, seemed to win out. The group broke up without reaching a decision. Publicly, however, the president talked about dialogue. The riposte came in the columns of EL WATAN. That exchange--also unprecedented--was an extremely serious matter. The "military institution"--"the most democratic place in Algerian society," according to Remi Leveau--is in the habit of settling its differences by consensus. By making them public, it was in great danger of settling them by other means. Putting it plainly, the cohesion of the Armed Forces was at stake. Steps were quickly taken to limit the damage. And again by innovation. On 20 March, the general staff published a communique stating its support for Zeroual. The prime minister did the same. Paradoxically, those gestures underscored the president's weakness, since the fact is that a boss does not need the support of his subordinates. Their purpose was to remind people that Liamine Zeroual had been made chief of state to carry out the policy of the Armed Forces, which now rule out any impulse toward negotiation in place of all-out war. To make sure that everyone got the point, EL WATAN did it again, followed this time by all the publications reflecting "democratic" opinion. What is more, it was learned on 21 March that the chief of staff, Major General Mohamed Lamari, had been given signing authority by Gen. Liamine Zeroual, minister of defense and chief of state, with respect to "all acts and decisions, including ministerial orders." One detail missed by commentators was that that provision had been part of a presidential decree dated 5 February. This means that as soon as he took office, and even though he continued to head the strategic Ministry of Defense, the new president had wasted no time putting someone else in charge of that ministry. It is true that Boumediene and Chadli, as chiefs of state and ministers of defense, had also signed such decrees. But the delegation of authority granted by them to the secretary-general of the ministry was purely administrative and could be revoked at any time. The circumstances in which delegation of authority was granted this time and the personality of the man to whom it was delegated show that something entirely different is involved: Zeroual is the official president and minister of defense, but the military strong man is Maj. Gen. Lamari. The fact that such a situation is being pointed out--and revealed--at this precise moment shows which side the "military institution" is on. That is not all. On the 22d, the big demonstrations held in Algiers and other cities turned into a protest movement against Zeroual and dialogue. The climax came at a press conference held by the minister of interior in Blida the next day: on 23 March. Let us remember that date. If, God forbid, Algeria sinks into chaos because of a general civil war, Salim Saadi's speech will have been largely responsible. He likened the Islamists indiscriminately to the Khmer Rouge: "A small group of uneducated fanatics who have been joined by delinquents, ex-convicts, crooks, drug addicts, and a good many young people from families whose conduct during the struggle for liberation was not honorable." Okay. But what is to be done with them? Very simple: "Apply radical therapy to stamp out for good this evil, which is eating away at Algerian society and poisoning its existence." Why has the said therapy not worked so far? Simply a mistake in dosage, Dr. Saadi replies. "Now that we know the correct doses to administer to combat this evil,...." From now on, as another minister of interior said during the first Algerian war, the only negotiation is warfare. How did Algeria reach such a point? What chance does that strategy--which is not a new one--have of succeeding? Part of the answer will be found in the big escape from the fortress in Tazult (former Lambese) on 10 March. That breakout was undeniably a turning point in the war, if only because it provides a more accurate idea of the balance of forces. The operation was carried out by the MIA [Armed Islamic Movement], a strong presence in the region. But it is not impossible, as some sources claim, that it was planned in cooperation with the GIA [Armed Islamic Group]. It is estimated that in all, between 450 and 500 fighters took part. And of those, 150 took the prison by storm. With the help of accomplices on the inside, they got in almost without firing a shot: only four guards were killed. Before the operation, other units had taken control of strategic points in the village of Tazult and on the main roads. The number of escapees varies depending on one's sources, but it was certainly higher than 1,000. A selection process took place: Islamic militants--some 700 of them, including 400 sentenced to death or life imprisonment--were freed as a matter of priority. Common prisoners were allowed to choose. Only about 100 chose to run. And they accounted for most of the fugitives killed or arrested: 24 and 114, respectively, according to official reports. The Islamists were immediately taken by car, truck, or bus to various regions. Most of them reached their destinations. Vehicles used in the escape were found in Annaba, Skikda, and Guelma, three northeastern towns. The operation had lasted one hour and 15 minutes. The joint investigation conducted by the Ministries of Defense, Interior, and Justice revealed serious dysfunctions. Among other things, the general alert was declared in various cities at 1915. But in Batna, 40 km from the prison, nothing was done until after 2200. And Batna happens to be the home of the Armored School (8,000 men) and the rapid intervention forces of the police and the Gendarmerie. It was eight hours before the first reinforcements, from Khenchela 200 km away, arrived. The warden had submitted reports in 1992 asking that a cordon be set up outside the prison. Other, more recent, reports dealt with preparations for escape. There was no follow-up to any of those reports. It is understandable why the tripartite investigating committee produced not one but three reports in which each ministry tried to cast the blame on the others. Theoretically, it was in order to come up with a calmer assessment of the Lambese affair--and of the increasing deterioration of the military situation it illustrated--that the generals held a conclave in mid-March. Their conclusions reflected their search for a scapegoat and their relentless pursuit of the same course of action despite the evidence. It is not by abandoning the policy of dialogue--which, it hardly needs stating, was never begun--that the Islamic rebellion is going to be put down. Moreover, total warfare is not something new: the Armed Forces have not tried anything else since the start of the conflict--with the success that we all can see. The only thing new is the call-up of reservists that was announced by Salim Saadi in Blida. He was echoing certain statements by "democrats" calling for the organization of armed militias. Was he simply boasting? Whatever the case, if such a call-up took place, it would do nothing to change the course of the war. The number of reservists is estimated at 150,000 men. By what miracle would their state of mind be any different than that of the conscripts, most of whom flee the war when they do not swell the Islamic ranks? It is certain that their mobilization would be a gift from heaven for the rebellion.
