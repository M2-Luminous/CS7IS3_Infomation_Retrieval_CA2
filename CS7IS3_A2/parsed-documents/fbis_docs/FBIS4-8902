Speaking at a trial to the smugglers of 120 tons of arms discovered at the Maribor airport last summer, Bavcar said that the Slovenian Interior Ministry had sent to Slovenian border authorities permits for free passage of arms for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Slovenia's retired intelligence service number two man Janez Piber confirmed in court that Slovenian President Milan Kucan and Bavcar had introduced him to Hasan Cengic, who had been authorised by Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic to obtain arms. Piber said he had been told to assist Cengic even before the outbreak of armed conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
