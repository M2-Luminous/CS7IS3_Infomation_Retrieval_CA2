Kim Hong-yol, chief of naval operations, and Chairman Kim U-chung of the Daewoo Business Group attending. Mrs. Kim Song-ki, wife of Minister Kim [as received], cut the ribbon for the launching of the 1,200-ton vessel in accordance with naval tradition. The submarine, capable of a maximum speed of 22 knots per hour, is twice as fast as North Korea's W(Whisky)- and R (Romeo)-class craft. The newly built submarine, the navy said, can conduct independent operations for two months with 30 crew and torpedoes and mines aboard. The other three submarines that have already been launched are the Changbogo, Yichon and Choemuson. With the four submarines, the South Korean Navy will be able to effectively protect the country's sea routes through utilization of a three-dimensional strategy involving the air, sea and submarines. The Navy said the submarine's launching will serve as momentum to secure South Korea's marine power in the 21st century while providing a counterbalance against North Korean underseas operations. The new submarine was named after Pak Ui, a Choson Dynasty military officer who attacked Tsushima Island where Japanese pirates were rampant. The Daewoo shipyard began constructing the diesel- propelled vessel in June 1991 with design and technology offered by Germany's HDW.
