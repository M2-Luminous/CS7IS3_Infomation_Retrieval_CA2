The U.S. Government has taken the position that "it is undesirable to provide economic aid to Iran that has been supporting terrorism and has been uncooperative in the Middle East peace process." In response, the Japanese Government is refuting the U.S. request, asserting: "The yen-based loans are to be used for projects unrelated to Iran's military buildup and there is no problem with Japan's resumption of the yen-based loans to that country." But the Japanese Government has yet to make the U.S. Government fully understand. According to a concerned official, the U.S. request was made in late March by American officials with the U.S. Department of State and the National Security Council (NSC) to the Foreign Ministry. The Japanese Government decided last May to resume the yen-based loans to Iran for the first time in 17 years after concluding that "Iran has a great influence in the Middle East and that Japan's economic aid to the country will bring political and economic stability to the region." The loans are expected to amount to 150 billion yen and are to be used for the construction of a dam on the Karun River in southeastern Iran. The yen-based loans are to be provided in three installments because of the large amount. Japan was committed last year to approximately 38 billion yen in the first installment. A Foreign Ministry source says: "At the time, the Clinton administration did not have its Middle East policy team in place and the administration did not raise any objection to Japan's commitment." The Clinton administration has made clear its critical attitude toward Iran as it has shaped its policy toward the Middle East. The U.S. Government is said to have asked the Japanese Government to defer providing the second and third installments of the loans on which Japan is to decide this year. The Japanese Government stresses: "It is not desirable to halt the yen-based loans to Iran halfway." The U.S. Government is said to be unhappy with the Japanese Government, claiming: "Japan is the only nation among the G-7 industrialized nations that is trying to use the Official Development Assistance (ODA) to provide massive economic aid to Iran." Anthony Lake, assistant to the president for national security affairs, has just written an article entitled "The Containment of Iran" in FOREIGN AFFAIRS, an influential foreign affairs journal in the United States. There is a possibility that the "Iran issue" will become a focal point at the talks of industrialized nations (the Naples summit) to be held this July.
