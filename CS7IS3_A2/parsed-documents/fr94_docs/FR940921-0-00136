FR940921-0-00136 FR940921-0-00016 96. Section 86.1306&hyph;90 of subpart N is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §86.1306&hyph;90 Equipment required and specifications; overview. (a) Exhaust emission tests. All engines subject to this subpart are tested for exhaust emissions. Petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled, Otto-cycle and diesel engines are tested identically with the exception of the systems used to measure hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, methanol, formaldehyde and particulate; petroleum-fueled diesel engines require a heated, continuous hydrocarbon detector and a continuous nitrogen oxide detector (§86.1310); methanol-fueled engines require a heated hydrocarbon detector, a methanol detector and a formaldehyde detector; either a heated or a non-heated continuous hydrocarbon detector may be used with natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel engines; gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle engines are not tested for particulate emissions (§86.1309). Necessary equipment and specifications appear in §§ 86.1308, 86.1309, 86.1310 and 86.1311. * * * * * 97. Section 86.1306&hyph;96 of subpart N is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §86.1306&hyph;96 Equipment required and specifications; overview. (a) Exhaust emission tests. All engines subject to this subpart are tested for exhaust emissions. Petroleum-, natural gas-, liquefied petroleum gas-, and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle and diesel engines are tested identically with two exceptions. First, the systems used to measure hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, methanol, formaldehyde and particulate depend on the type of engine being tested; petroleum-fueled diesel engines require a heated, continuous hydrocarbon detector and a heated, continuous nitrogen oxide detector (see §86.1310); methanol-fueled engines require a heated hydrocarbon detector, a methanol detector and a formaldehyde detector; either a heated or non-heated continuous hydrocarbon detector may be used with natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel engines; gasoline-fueled, natural gas- fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle engines are not tested for particulate emissions (see §86.1309). Second, if a gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled engine is to be used in a vehicle equipped with an evaporative canister, the test engine must have a loaded evaporative canister attached for the exhaust emission test. Necessary equipment and specifications appear in §§86.1308, 86.1309, 86.1310 and 86.1311. * * * * * 98. Section 86.1309&hyph;90 of subpart N is amended by revising the section heading and paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(4) to read as follows: §86.1309&hyph;90 Exhaust gas sampling system; Otto-cycle engines. (a)(1) General. The exhaust gas sampling system described in this paragraph is designed to measure the true mass of gaseous emissions in the exhaust of either gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled or methanol-fueled Otto-cycle engines. In the CVS concept of measuring mass emissions, two conditions must be satisfied; the total volume of the mixture of exhaust and dilution air must be measured, and a continuously proportioned volume of sample must be collected for analysis. Mass emissions are determined from the sample concentration and total flow over the test period. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (4) The flow capacity of the CVS shall be large enough to eliminate water condensation in the system. This is especially critical in the case of methanol-fueled engines and may also be of concern with natural gas- and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled engines; see ``Calculation of Emissions and Fuel Economy When Using Alternative Fuels,'' EPA 460/3&hyph;83&hyph;009. * * * * *
