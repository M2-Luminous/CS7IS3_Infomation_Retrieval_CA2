FR940429-1-00004 FR940429-1-00002 Additionally, due consideration has been given to the following comments received in response to the original notice: Two commenters suggest that issuance of the proposed rule is unnecessary. The commenters contend that the criteria for issuing a regulation under Federal Aviation Regulations 39.1 (14 CFR 39.1), specifically that the addressed condition ``is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type,'' has not been met. These commenters also report that their experience to date does not support the need for issuance of this proposed rule. One of these commenters suggests that the occurrences of overheated PSU's appear to have been limited to only a few units and, possibly, to only one non-U.S. operator that is operating in a unique environment. The commenter questions whether there were any other factors that could have effected the failure of these units, such as missing or improperly installed insulation blankets, previous maintenance performed on the subject units, etc. The FAA does not concur with the commenters' suggestion that this rule is unnecessary. Results of the investigation of the failure scenarios, as performed by de Havilland, revealed that the ingress of moisture through the PSU connectors is a situation that is not unique to a specific airplane or operator; it is a situation that is common to all Model DHC&hyph;8 airplanes due to their common design. It is true that the one non-U.S. operator that experienced the failure does operate in a high humidity environment, which may have contributed to creating the worst corrosion/overheat incident reported to date. Operation of any aircraft in that type of environment increases the chance of moisture ingress that could lead to corrosion on the printed circuit board or connectors, and to an excessive overheat condition or a potential fire hazard, should such corrosion go undetected. Although the commenters may not yet have experienced a severe corrosion problem in their current operating environment, there is nothing restricting Model DHC&hyph;8 aircraft from being operated in an environment that is more conducive to a moisture ingress and corrosion problem. The FAA concludes that, based on the design of the Model DHC&hyph;8, the addressed unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of this same type. One commenter requests that the proposed compliance time of 300 hours time-in-service or 30 days (whichever occurs later) for the initial inspection be extended to at least 600 hours time-in-service. The commenter considers the proposed compliance time to be too stringent, especially in light of the fact that the PSU circuit board overheat problem was first reported four years ago, in 1990. The FAA does not concur. The addressed overheating problem is the result of corrosion of the printed circuit board pins and connector interfaces. Since corrosion is an agent that acts over time, it is important that operators assess the severity of the corrosion on each applicable airplane as expeditiously as possible; therefore, the initial inspection interval of 300 hours time-in-service, as proposed, is appropriate. The FAA does consider that operators who have performed the initial action within the last 12 months should be provided ``credit'' for such action and has revised the proposed initial compliance time to provide such credit. Two commenters suggest that the proposed repetitive inspection interval of 600 hours time-in-service is too conservative and should be extended. These commenters request that the interval be changed to at least 12 months. The commenters state that the addressed corrosion situation results from condensation-induced moisture collecting on the connector; however, since a water dispersing dielectric grease (a corrosion inhibiting compound) is applied after the initial inspection, it would serve to protect the area from any further corrosion for some time. One of these commenters considers that any significant changes in the corrosion status of the circuit board would be insignificant at the proposed 600-hour interval (which equates to approximately 60 days for most affected operators). One of these commenters indicates that it already has completed the initial inspection of its fleet of 22 Model DHC&hyph;8's and its findings have revealed that the corrosion is minor and is not rapidly generated. The FAA concurs with the commenters' request, based on the information provided. The notice has been revised to specify a repetitive inspection interval of 12 months. One commenter requests that the proposed rule provide a description of the overheat damage for which inspection is made. The commenter notes that there is a distinction between normal in-service discoloration and overheat damage. The circuit board produces heat through its normal operation, which causes a discoloration of the circuit board's coating. Overheating would cause the board to show exposed fibers and/or melted parts. The FAA concurs with the commenter's request. A note has been added to the proposed rule to describe the appearance of overheat damage. One commenter states that the economic impact data presented in the preamble to the NPRM was not completely accurate. This commenter notes that the number of work hours necessary to perform the proposed inspections is two work hours per aircraft, not per PSU, as the notice indicated. The FAA acknowledges this correction, and has revised the economic impact information, below, accordingly. The FAA estimates that 133 Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. The proposed inspections would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspections on U.S. operators is estimated to be $14,630, or $110 per airplane, per inspection. The proposed modification would require approximately 2.25 work hours per PSU to accomplish, at an average labor cost of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $61.50 per PSU. Each airplane is equipped with between 18 and 26 PSU's. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed modification on U.S. operators is estimated to be $185.25 per PSU, or between $3,334.50 and $4,816.50 per airplane. The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. However, the FAA has been advised that the proposed initial inspection has already been accomplished on approximately 22 airplanes; therefore the future economic impact of this proposed rule is reduced by at least $2,420. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
