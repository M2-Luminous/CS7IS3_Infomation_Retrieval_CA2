Discussed at the meeting was the task of the Central Committee of the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon for making this year a year of great national unity. Paek In-chun, chairman of the North side headquarters, recalled in his report that the great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year address set before all the compatriots in the North, the South and overseas the task to unite under the banner of great unity of the whole nation and accelerate the cause of national reunification through a nationwide struggle. He stated that the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon, side by side with the Pomminnyon organisations in South Korea and overseas, will wage a vigorous struggle for the achievement of great national unity, highly assessing the proposal of the overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon to set this year as a year of great national unity for national reunification and launch a powerful movement for this unity as an entirely just and timely initiative. The present situation urgently demands Pomminnyon smash the separatists' acts of confrontation against reunification and create a favorable climate for reunification in the 1990s, the reporter said, proposing measures to that end. He called for vigorously waging the movement for great national unity in hearty response to "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country," a great political charter of national unity, so as to pave the way for national reunification this year. The report was followed by speeches. A resolution was adopted at the meeting.
