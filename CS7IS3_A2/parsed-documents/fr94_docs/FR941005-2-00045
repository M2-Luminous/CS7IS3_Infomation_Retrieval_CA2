Under the procedural regulations that apply to exception proceedings (10 CFR Part 205, Subpart D), any person who will be aggrieved by the issuance of a proposed decision and order in final form may file a written notice of objection within ten days of service. For purposes of the procedural regulations, the date of service of notice is deemed to be the date of publication of this Notice or the date an aggrieved person receives actual notice, whichever occurs first. The procedural regulations provide that an aggrieved party who fails to file a Notice of Objection within the time period specified in the regulations will be deemed to consent to the issuance of the proposed decision and order in final form. An aggrieved party who wishes to contest a determination made in a proposed decision and order must also file a detailed statement of objections within 30 days of the date of service of the proposed decision and order. In the statement of objections, the aggrieved party must specify each issue of fact or law that it intends to contest in any further proceeding involving the exception matter. Copies of the full text of this proposed decision and order are available in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, Room 1E&hyph;234, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20585, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., except federal holidays. Dated: September 27, 1994. George B. Breznay, Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals. Petroleum Products, Inc. Charleston, WV, Lee&hyph;0087 Reporting Requirements Petroleum Products, Inc. filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;782B, the ``Resellers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering this request, the DOE found that Petroleum Products was a certainty firm and therefore could only be granted relief if it were experiencing extreme hardship. The DOE determined that it was not. Accordingly, on July 5, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied.
