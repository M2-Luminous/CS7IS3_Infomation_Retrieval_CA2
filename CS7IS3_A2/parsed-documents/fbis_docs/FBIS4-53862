FBIS4-53862 "dreas100__a94014" FBIS-EAS-94-100-A Daily Report 11 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Shinseito Members Increasingly Critical of Ozawa Shinseito Members Increasingly Critical of Ozawa OW2105002194 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 11 May 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2105002194 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]--whose members have begun to criticize party Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa because of the Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] secession from the coalition after formation of the lower house parliamentary group, Kaishin [Innovation]--held a standing executive council meeting on 10 May. At the meeting, the council tried several times, including a decision to reshuffle its members, to tranquilize the criticism. The meeting, which was held in the morning of 10 May, decided to assign former Home Affairs Minister Akira Fukida and lower house Dietman Ichiji Ishii as standing executive council members to replace Moriyoshi Sato, director general of the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agency, and Shigeto Nagano, former justice minister, who resigned from the justice minister's post over his remarks that the "Nanjing massacre was a made-up story." Both Fukida and Ishii joined Shinseito after it was formed. It is pointed out that some Shinseito members were "becoming `anti-Ozawa'" because, in addition to the fact that the coalition became a minority government as a result of the SDPJ's secession, they were not informed of a plan to form Kaishin. Some of the party members are even worried that the situation "may develop into a repeat of the situation Keiseikai (the Takeshita faction) of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] was in when it split" into two groups after a fierce strife within the faction. The decision to assign Fukida and Ishii as standing executive council members was also designed to pacify the dissatisfied party members" (according to a close associate of Ozawa), and, at the same time, to "make the party's decisionmaking process more open" (according to a senior Shinseito official). Moreover, other party members who seceded from the LDP to form Shinseito, were also complaining about Ozawa. At the party's 27 April general meeting the SDPJ immediately split from the coalition, the party's backbone figure and young members roundly criticized Ozawa, saying that "it is important for us to say whatever we want to say and be understood and the secretary general is not an exception" (according to Norio Sugiyama, former director of the lower house Budget Committee). On 6 May, Koichiro Aino, former Economic Planning Agency director general, said: "It [decision to form Kaishin] was a very careless blunder unbecoming of Ozawa. The party needs to establish an official decisionmaking organ." At the executive council meeting, Ozawa said: "We are in this situation because of the (the SDPJ's) unexpected secession from the coalition. It is a time for us, who play central roles in the government, to strengthen our unity." However, it seems that this remark is aimed at tightening the unity [taga] that loosened following the confusion over Kaishin's formation. On 9 May, Aino met with Ozawa and apologized for the criticism aimed at the executive department, saying: "I am afraid we put you in a lot of trouble." It seems that the situation within the party has calmed down for the time being. At the 10 May news conference, Ozawa said that "no blunders were made in the past." Nevertheless, some party members are saying that "we now can say whatever we want to say, thanks to Ozawa's careless mistake" (according to a senior party official).
