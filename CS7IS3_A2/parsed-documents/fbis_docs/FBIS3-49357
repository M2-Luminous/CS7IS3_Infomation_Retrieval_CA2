He was reacting to the question whether his absence from the Warsaw meeting of the Visegrad defence ministers, planned for Friday [7 January], was connected with any statements on the agenda of the meeting. Secretary of State to the Slovak Defence Ministry Ivo Urban said on Wednesday [5 January] that the defence ministers' meeting should coordinate the joint approach to the admission in NATO and the joint strategy before its forthcoming meeting. "I refused to attend the first planned meeting already as I did not deem it purposeful to work on a joint strategy of the Visegrad Four regarding their relations with NATO," Baudys said. "The formulation about the joint strategy towards NATO countries is very unclear for us," he said. Baudys added that if the Warsaw meeting were to be devoted to the issue again, he believes that the first deputy minister of defence is skilled and informed enough to be able to present the views of the ministry. "We do not want to create any new groupings," Baudys said.
