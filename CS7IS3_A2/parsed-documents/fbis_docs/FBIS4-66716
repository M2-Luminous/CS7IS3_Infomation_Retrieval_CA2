And all said and done it is the CPI which is the main Communist formation in that sprawling and strategic State of the heartland of India. What happens to it is of the greatest relevance to all Communists there and throughout the country. What has happened is that practically the entire veteran leadership of the CPI in Uttar Pradesh has collectively decided to join the Samajwadi Party led by Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav. These leaders include Mr. Mitra Sen Yadav who was at the time of his leaving the CPI the secretary of its Uttar Pradesh unit, an MLA [member of Legislative Assembly] from Fiazabad, just adjacent to Ayodhya. Joining him are Mr. Guru Prasad, for long the assistant secretary of the Uttar Pradesh unit of the CPI and for some time the all-India president of the Agricultural Labourers' Organisation of the CPI and Mr. Ramchander Baksh Singh, the veteran leader from Banabanki district and the sole CPI representative in the UP Legislative Council. The most important of the rebels is Dr. Z.A. Ahmad. There are, of course, reports that he may not quit the CPI though he has not so far denied that he is with the rebels. He has, however, made it absolutely clear on many occasions that his sympathies lie with Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav, whom he believes represents the wave of the future for defeating the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and advancing towards the emancipation of the oppressed. Dr. Ahmad is no ordinary leader of the CPI. It would be appropriate to recall just who he is. Coming from a highly placed family in the undivided Punjab he became a Communist in London in the early 1930s where he worked successfully for a doctorate in the London School of Economics. He, along with Sajjad Zaheer and Hiren Mukherjee, were the first of the "England returned" Communists to be followed a decade later by Mohan Kumaramangalam, Indrajit Gupta, Nikhil Chakravarthy, N.K. Krishnan and others. On returning to India he plunged into the freedom struggle and soon drew attention to himself as that rare phenomenon of a highpowered intellectual who was also a mass worker. On top of it all he came from a distinguished Muslim family and was an ardent secularist, patriot and radical. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru took him to the AICC [All India Congress Committee] headquarters in Allahabad as one of his secretaries when he was the president of the Congress. Among the other secretaries of Panditji was Dr. Rammanohar Lohia. The two learned lieutenants of the then Congress president got on well together since both strongly supported their leader's combining patriotism and nationalism with socialism. Dr. Lohia was just the opposite of what he later became. He was then a Nehruite. Dr. Ahmad was right from those days a convinced proponent of the need for Congress-Communist unity and also of the need to pay special attention to weaning the Muslim masses away from the influence of communalism. Dr. Ahmad went on to become one of the tallest and best known leader of the then single CPI. He was a member of its all-India leadership from the forties and has been there in one or another official position for over half-a-century. It has to be said to his credit that he never accepted the official thesis of the CPI that the Muslim League and its demand for Pakistan represented the freedom urge of the Muslims and their desire for equality with the Hindus though in a distorted form. He never accepted that the content of the demand for Pakistan was just though the form was perverse. Much the most important characteristic of Dr. Ahmad was, however, his belief and personification of that belief that the Communists should also be Congressmen. All through his political life he has worn khadi and a Gandhi cap. He represented the very important tradition which is still alike in Uttar Pradesh of radical and revolutionary nationalism, i.e., of Congressmen who accepted Communism in one or another form and of Communists who accepted the Congress whatever its form. It is on the basis of this belief that he staunchly opposed the anti-national and so-called "Left" revolutionary line of Mr. B.T. Ranadive in 1948. He equally staunchly opposed the anti-Congress, obsessively anti-Nehru and "casteist socialism" of Dr. Lohia. The tragedy of Dr. Ahmad, however, began, in the mid-1950s when for personal and factional reasons he opposed P.C. Joshi's call for a National Front of Congress, Communists and all progressives. From then onwards in one or another way he did his best to deny his past and to remain a Communist leader on the basis of accepting anti-Congressism in howsoever a sophisticated form. So down the slippery path he went till he landed up as the drum beater and pillion rider of Mr. V.P. Singh whom he portrayed as the new Messiah of the secularists and the downtrodden. He accepted what he had so valiantly fought in the "first fine careless rapture" of the passionate idealism of his Communist youth. The CPI leaders and veterans who have gone or deciding to go to the Samajwadi Party have been motivated by various impulses. High on the list is the authoritarian behaviour of the Central leadership of the CPI which forced its UP unit to align -- unsuccessfully in the matter of seats, as it turned out -- with the Janata Dal of Mr. V.P. Singh. The MP [Member of Parliament] unit had wanted to ally with the Samajwadi Party because, in their view, it was the party most capable of defeating the BJP and also because it was not completely anti-Congress as demonstrated by it conduct during the no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha. The so-called "young" leaders being encouraged at the Centre and in the States by the small coterie which functions as the effective all-India leadership of the CPI also cause concern and even a measure of revulsion among the veterans. The most influential factor behind the decision -- of the CPI veterans in UP is, however, their lack of courage in breaking with anti-Congressism. They are trapped by the decades of anti-Congress campaigning within and outside their party that they have done. It is a Frankenstein which they cannot fight but have to obey. Their anti-Congressism, however, is of a somewhat subtle variety. It is an anti-Congressism which postulates an alternative to the Congress which is also not with the BJP and can even ally with the Congress but which, in any case, not with Right reactionary or counter-revolutionary formation. On no account can they prove even to themselves that the Samajwadi Party is more anti-imperialist, more nationalist and more secular than the Congress. As for being more effective than the latter in combatting the BJP this is true at the present moment in Uttar Pradesh. Elsewhere it is the Congress which undeniably occupier that preeminent position. Would Dr. Ahmad and his colleagues of UP advise that counterparts in other parts of India to join with the Congress on the basis of that logic? In Andhra Pradesh, for example, it cannot be claimed that the TDP [Teluga Desam Party] is more capable of rallying the secular forces than the Congress. Nor can the same claim be made for the DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] in Tamil Nadu. The erstwhile CPI veterans cannot blame their critics who change them with joining the Samajwadi Party for the sake of seats and other perks of power. They can answer their critics to some extent, out any rate, if they advocated what can be called the criterion of "anti-rightist effectiveness" as the basis of party and personal behaviour. This would clearly imply that allying with the Congress is a legitimate choice for communists. It would have important positive consequences for political alignments in the context, in particular of the elections due at the end of the year. There is, however, a more basic point that needs to be made. The Samajwadi Party is not just an anti-BJP party. It is a specific type of anti-BJP party. It bases itself in reality, whatever be the figleaf rhetoric, on backward casteism and Muslim communalism. This is becoming clearer with every passing day. What else is the meaning of the caste clashes that are taking place in Uttar Pradesh and the rift that is so clearly developing between Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mr. Kanshi Ram? The situation in Uttar Pradesh has developed quickly only confirmation that one fragmenting force cannot be relied upon to combat another. In the end both conflict with modern and progressive nationalism which alone can be the basis of our country and people's advance.
