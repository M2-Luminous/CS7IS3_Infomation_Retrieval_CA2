The head of Shanghai International Securities' corporate finance division, Ni Xinxian, said the sluggish market was contributing to the change of heart by China's biggest petrochemical firm. "The company and the underwriter have decided not to go ahead with the proposal given the present market conditions," he said in Shanghai. "The decision has nothing to do with the company's fundamentals," he said. The China Securities Regulatory Commission which was also involved in what would have been a pioneering move in the country, agreed to the decision too, Mr Ni said. He said the shares earmarked for tender would not be issued until next year. Whether the scheme would revive would depend on market conditions, he said. But he did not say how the shares would be issued if they were not allocated through tendering. Shanghai Petrochem's second tranche of 450 million shares was intended to be offered in two batches: 320 million shares were to be allocated to A shareholders at 2.4 yuan (about HK$2.14) a share and 130 million shares through tender. The tender system has come about to address weaknesses in existing offering systems for allocating A shares, such as an unlimited issue of subscription forms and a share allocation linking allocations with bank deposits. The former results in investors paying a high cost for share purchases and the latter results in subscription money long being frozen. Mr Ni said the existing offering systems were a result of the underdeveloped banking system in China, which posed difficulties in settling payment of initial public offers. However, it is believed the falling stock market made it difficult to discover the price of shares offered through a tender system. Potential investors are reluctant to make offers for fears of further falls. The continuous slump in the price of Shanghai Petrochem's A shares also means that mainland investors can buy cheap stocks already available in the market, and it is unnecessary to use a tender to establish market interest. The market price of Shanghai Petrochem had fallen below the subscription price for shareholders. Petrochem's A shares closed at 2.05 yuan on Friday, compared with 2.54 yuan in mid-April and 5.76 yuan on its debut close on the Shanghai stock exchange in November last year. Concerns have also been raised over the feasibility of importing the international tender practice to China. However, Mr Ni said: "For a company such as Shanghai Petrochemical, which has launched an H-share offer in Hong Kong under the book-building system, we shouldn't have any worries." The new initial public offering method comes at an unfavourable time. The A share indexes on the country's stock exchanges are sliding fast, offering no hope for the tender to operate in an effective manner. An excess of new listings have been a key factor in the market's slump this year, with large counters such as Shanghai Petrochem suffering the most. Mr Ni said the portion of 320 million new shares offered to shareholders in April had been fully subscribed. But no official announcement has been made on the level of subscription. Shanghai Petrochem announced on Friday that the share sale had been completed, and that 200 million shares would be listed on June 20. The 200 million shares represent those subscribed for by the public. The remaining 120 million shares, subscribed for by company employees, would be listed on July 4. Shanghai Petrochem offered 550 million new A shares last year following a $2.65 billion H-share offer in Hong Kong in July, giving it a listing in the territory.
