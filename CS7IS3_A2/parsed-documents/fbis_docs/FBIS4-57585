Right now, Cuba has such an installation under construction and it is fostering an extensive program for sustained progress in the nuclear field on the basis of the promotion of general progress in the nuclear field in area countries. Under the administration of the Executive Secretariat for Nuclear Affairs [SEAN], Cuba's nuclear program and the implementation of this technology for peaceful purposes, include quite a few achievements in various economic and industrial fields. Cuba makes these achievements available to other countries of the continent through ARCAL [Regional Cooperation Arrangements for the Development of Nuclear Science and Technology], a program sponsored by the Atomic Energy Organization, to contribute to the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy in the region. Cuba has participated in 12 projects since it joined ARCAL in 1987. Let us listen to Daniel Codorniu, deputy coordinator of Cuba's SEAN: [Begin Codorniu recording] To give you an example of the projects being developed, I will tell you that there is one that has to do with the utilization of nuclear technology for animal feeding and reproduction. This has to do with everything related to immunoanalyses for the development of livestock. This project is now in its fourth year. Last year, Cuba, in the framework of this project, conducted seminars on the diagnosis of brucellosis using nuclear and related technology. Four Latin Americans, not counting Cubans, participated in this seminar. Another project being developed is one on the development of nuclear techniques to study environmental contamination. Lately, this project has also received a lot of support in view of recent global awareness of the need for protection of the environment. From the analytical and chemical points of view, nuclear methods are very precise and very effective. Last year, within the framework of this project, we held a seminar in Cuba on the subject of the utilization of nuclear techniques on the environment. Three Latin American scholars participated in this seminar and benefitted from it. [end recording] One of the most important projects of the ARCAL program in Latin America involves the industrial utilization of radioactive isotopes as tracers to further improve the quality of industrial processes. As in previous cases, Cuban experts and technicians are obtaining precious experience in the implementation of these techniques and plan to pass it on to other regional countries through meetings, scholarship, and specialization courses in the future. [Begin Codorniu recording] This year, 1994, we plan three important regional projects within the framework of ARCAL. One project involves a regional seminar on nuclear progress and instrumentation. One objective of this seminar is to share with other Latin American countries experiences -- especially Cuban experiences, although those of other regional countries will also be presented -- regarding progress in developing equipment for nuclear programs. That seminar will be followed, right here, by a final meeting on nuclear instrumentation. This is a five-year project that has concluded. The coordinators of this project will come from all countries involved in it. The participating countries will take advantage of the seminar to analyze the results of the project. One of the most positive aspects of this project, in our opinion, is that it has enabled the acquisition of spare parts by Latin American countries. We are going to have another regional seminar from 28 November to 11 December. This seminar will be an advanced course on the synthesis of modern radiopharmaceutical products. As you know, one of the main objectives of our current program -- and this is also an objective of other Latin American countries, each focussing on its own development and national policies -- is to produce in our country the radioactive substances necessary for the program. Radiopharmaceuticals, as you all know, are the substances used by doctors who practice what we call nuclear medicine to make medical diganosis. By 1995, the work of the Cuban nuclear program will be directed toward research to complement research already being done in agriculture. One aspect of this research, which has a broad participation from all the research centers in the country, has to do with the combined used of nuclear and hydrotechnology for improved agricultural production of items important to Cuba, such as rice, sugarcane, and beans. We firmly back this program. We are calling for very active participation by our center in this program, which is being planned on the basis of coordinated research, that is, on the basis of the idea that various research centers in various countries of the region tackle one single problem from various angles. For example, the problem of how to produce more and better rice, suitable for the various regions of Latin America. Various research centers of the region would then have specific tasks in that program and their information would be shared, so that regional resources may be utilized in a more rational way, realizing, for example, that my laboratory may have some techniques that Mexico does not have and Mexico may have things that I do not have. This way we could complement each other. Another very interesting program we believe Cuba could participate in is the improvement of vegetables and the handling of soil and water resources using nuclear techniques. This program is very much linked to agriculture. It is like guaranteeing the best and most inexpensive -- speaking from the point of view of the cost of fertilizers, irrigation, and so forth -- growing of certain crops. Our country also has experience in the use of radioactive istopes, such as stable isotopes like nitrogen 15, to determine the amount necessary and the adequate moment for using a fertilizer or to determine, using nuclear techniques, when an irrigation effort has not been effective. This program has an objective. It has been designed in a way similar to that of Peru's, that is, through coordinated research among countries. This particular program relies, basically, on four countries. This does not mean that they will be the only ones that participate because other countries will participate also, but basically, Cuba, Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela, will be the four countries on which the program will rely. [end recording] Cuba's efforts through ARCAL in favor of Latin America and the rest of the developing countries to secure the latest information on nuclear science and technology enhance the prestige of the island. Cuba's nuclear achievements have been praised by well-known international experts. Cuba's nuclear program continues developing in the midst of shortages and limitations the country is enduring and it is expanding its ratio of action to include research that may offer new alternatives for national progress.
