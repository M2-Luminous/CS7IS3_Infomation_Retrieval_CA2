In the opinion of the Council, "if parliament approves the proposed change to the Law on Slovak Television, it will mean the liquidation of the principles of independence, nonpartisanship, and professionalism," the statement says. The amendment provides for the dissolution of the present Slovak Television Council, which is based on the principle of the civic spectrum of interests. Council members assess this step as expedient, motivated by economic and preelection considerations. Jergus Ferko emphasized the status of the Council as the steering body of Slovak Television with jurisdiction over not only programs but also the economic sphere of managing television as a public corporation. He voiced the fear that the structure of the future Council will be based on the principle of the majority representation of political parties, which would unequivocally politicize Slovak Television and liquidate its independence. "If the principle is applied of forming the Slovak Television Council on the party principle, it will be a short-term expedient measure, which will lead to permanent liquidations of the Slovak Television Council after every change in the balance of forces in the parliament. It would be a systemic step back, toward a situation that has been overcome by developments, which will only raise political tension and intensify the already serious problems of Slovak Television inherited from the past," the statement goes on to say. The Council deplored that its members had not been invited to the work on drafting a new Law on Slovak Television and to the relevant meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic Education, Science, and Culture Committee. It called this behind-the-scenes course of action illegal and unprecedented.
