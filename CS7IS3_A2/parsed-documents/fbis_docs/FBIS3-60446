In Brazil, this rate is almost 35 percent, resembling that in the African countries. However, it is known that half of all the children infected worldwide contract the virus at the time of delivery. Based on this information, researchers are attempting to reduce the number of pediatric AIDS cases. "If we succeed in obtaining a method to prevent transmission of the virus, the result will be good, because these children are still developing their immune system, and hence have less resistance to the infections caused by the disease." This statement was made by the Indian physician, Savita Pahwa, an immunologist at North Shore University Hospital, in New York. She arrived in Sao Paulo yesterday to participate in the First National Meeting on Pediatric AIDS, from 1 to 3 December, sponsored by the Association To Assist Child Carriers of HIV. According to Doctor Pahwa, there are, basically two clinical types of children carrying HIV: those who show symptoms of the disease during the first months of life, and die by age two; and those who more easily resist infections, and even survive up to age 12. She explained: "We are studying the immune systems of those children to learn the differences between them, and why some manage to live longer." Concurrently, the researchers on her team are attempting to solve what they call the virus "envelope." It consists of a layer of protein covering the virus, which determines the type of attack that the latter will make on the immune system of infected patients. According to Pawha, approximately 1,200 children have already been infected by the virus in the United States. The principal treatments used in Brazil are not much different from those in the developed countries, which use AZT alone, or combined with two other more modern drugs called DDI (dideoxynosine, in English) and DDC (dedeoxycytidine). This system changes the date for starting the use of AZT, as well as its dosage. According to Doctor Marinella Della Negra, from the Emilio Ribas Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil was the first developing country admitted to the protocol for Penta I research (the acronym for the accord regarding the European Economic Community's Pediatric AIDS Studies). That accord includes collaborating institutions in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, France, and Germany. The doctor claims: "That is one of the most modern European studies, and from now on we shall be able to gain access to its reports." Currently receiving seven new pediatric AIDS cases per week, she comments: "Three years ago, the average was two per week."
