The movement makes no secret of its intention to come to power in Russia, to restore the "single and indivisible Russia in the borders of the Russian empire," and then consider expanding it. One of the RNU declarations is devoted to the "work for training disciplined groups who support a strong, indivisible and powerful Russia for active political and, subsequently, state activity." Leader Alexander Barkashov, the leader of the RNU, was born in 1953. According to information, his grandfather participated in the repressions of 1940-50, and held responsible posts in the apparat of the VKP(b)-CPSU Central Committee. Barkashov has no higher education; his main profession is electrician. He is also coach-instructor in karate (he owns a brown girdle). He served in the special units of the army. In 1987-90 Barkashov was a member of the Central Council of the Pamyat society headed by Dmitry Vasilyev. At that time they had a falling out. Withdrawing from Pamyat, Barkashov set up his own organization in the autumn of 1990 -- "Russian National Unity for a strong, free and just Russia." Since 1991 it has been called Russian National Unity. Organization There is some structure underlying the RNU (although it is changing). It is as follows: Leader-Main Companions-Companions-associates-sympathizers. The leader is Barkashov. The companions consist of militants, members of a militarized organization within the RNU. Now they number about 600, much more than during the October events. According to press reports, 137 Barkashov militants fought near the White House. It is known for certain that two of them died -- Dmitry Marchenko and Anatoly Sursky, both officers in the reserve. It is common knowledge that RNU militants protected the coup leaders -- Barannikov, Dunayev, Achalov, Makashov. Most of the RNU members, led by Barkashov, left the White House in advance. In order to become RNU Companions, one needs absolutely unstained "racially pure Slav" ancestry (spanning at least four generations). Any mixture of Jewish, Gypsy, Caucasian or Central Asian blood is categorically ruled out. In order to join the ranks of the Companions, a candidate must take an oath. This happens after the trial period of one year, but "it may be reduced in special cases." After becoming a RNU militant, a person loses his individual identity. Although he is not permanently living in the barracks, he is still obliged to present himself when his superiors call. No considerations of personal or family character are taken into account. The militants train in shooting and in hand-to-hand combat at the bases where they spend from several days to a month. The location of the bases is kept secret, but according to some, they are in the Moscow Region -- one not far from Balashikha, the other -- near the Perlovka railway station. The militants are divided into sub-units under the command of the Main Companions. A sub-unit consists of 20 people or more. The main Companions are included in the so-called RNU Commanders Council. Apart from Companions, the organization also has Associates. They do not swear an oath and do not fight in combat formations. There are several thousand more Associates than Companions. In order to become an Associate a trial period is also necessary: for a certain period of time a person will serve as a Sympathizer, carrying out the assignments of the organization and recruiting new supporters. Among the RNU Sympathizers there are "high-ranking" generals, officials from the highest structures of the Interior Ministry and so on. `The oath of Companion-in-arms' and `Code of Honor' The oath which the Companions take has 10 points, among them the commitment "to be ruthless to the external and internal enemies of Russia and the Russian nation," "to be always ready, by order of the Chief Companion, to defend the interests of Russia and the Russian nation and fight to the last breath against the external and internal enemies of Russia and the Russian nation within Russia and beyond its borders." Moreover, for breaking the oath "Companions must treat its violators as the Code of Honor of the Companion" prescribes: with capital punishment. The Code of Honor declares that the Companion is regarded as "the plenipotentiary of the Russian nation," and therefore it is his duty to restore justice for the Russian people" "with the power entrusted to him and with his arms, not appealing to judicial or other means." For members of the organization, no laws exist except their own: "The Companion resolves any questions, guided only by national consciousness, in keeping with the powers entrusted to him by the Chief Companion, and obeys no other laws." A very important point: "A Companion must always remember that Russia has no friends," and further: "the Companion may cleanse himself of the disgrace only with blood." Members of the RNU There are quite a number of military people in the RNU: regular officers, servicemen in the reserve, those in active service. There are militiamen and those serving in the interior forces. There are also quite a few workers, students and several clergymen. Program The Russian nation must become dominant in Russia. As for other peoples, a "differentiated" approach to them is advocated. They are divided into "natives" and "non-natives." The plans regarding "non-native" peoples are not published, they are worked out in secret documents of the organization. It is known that Caucasians, Turks, Central Asians will have the right to live only on their "historic territories," "a sharp reduction of birth rate" is expected in their countries," "a reduction of their number to minimum." As for Jews and Gypsies, "they will be fully eradicated as soon as possible." Barkashovites maintain that "Jews should not be deported either to the West or to Israel, because this will only strengthen the positions of world Zionism and its subversive work against Russia." It is suggested that the laws of Hitler's Germany be introduced in Russia. In other words, mixed marriage or liaisons "causing harm to the genetic fund of the Russian nation and leading to its dilution will be persecuted by law." Russia, being a unitary state, must "as far as its administrative structure is concerned, follow the historical tradition, be divided into provinces and these provinces, in their turn, into districts and then into volosts" (small rural districts). The "existence of no autonomous territorial formations, splitting up the Russian people and weakening Russia" should be allowed on the territory of Russia. Power must be concentrated in the hands of the "Russian national leader." Democracy is declared "a naive idea which has never been carried out anywhere (since power may realistically be put only in the hands of elite). It was invented by Zionists and Masons for demoralization of the nation and the seizure of world supremacy." Propaganda The main publication of the RNU, the paper Russky Poryadok, has been published for about 18 months. After the October events the circulation of the newspaper rose -- the last issue claimed a distribution of 150,000 copies. At 100 rubles per copy it is not expensive. Its Editor-in-Chief is Kochetkov, Deputy Editor-in-Chief is Kremlev; members of the Editorial Board: Kokorev and Skirdenko; Marchenko, too, who was killed during the October events, was a member of the Editorial Board. The Editorial Board of Russky Poryadok are members of the Council of the RNU Commanders. The movement made an attempt to publish one more newspaper -- Russian Banner but the plan failed, only one issue was published. In Krasnoyarsk, the RNU publishes the paper Russian Nation (circulation about 15,000 copies), its Editor-in-Chief is Yemelyanenko. The paper is registered, just as the Russian Order (the registration number is 1184). Recently magazine The Attack was established. Apart from these regular publications, the RNU mimieographs and distributes leaflets and appeals. In the newspapers and leaflets of the RNU, reports often appear which do not correspond to reality. Instead of facts, there is only a confident tone. Thus, the paper Russky Poryadok (December 1993-January 1994) maintained that the White House was fired at by the snipers of the 6th NATO Brigade and so on. The RNU carries on its propaganda purposefully. After selecting a military unit, an enterprises or an educational establishment, it begins a "permanent contact," distributes literature there and sends agitators. Relations with other parties and movements The members of the RNU participate in the meetings and demonstrations of related parties and movements. However, the relations between them and the RNU are strained and often hostile. Barkashovites are particularly hostile to Zhirinovsky and the LDPR. They regard Vladimir Volfovich as "the agent of Zionism, who has made his way into the ranks of the national-patriotic movement with the aim of destroying it." Relations with the Church In theory the RNU is a supporter of Orthodoxy, but "it respects and restores Orthodoxy as well as pre-Orthodox Russian national traditions," using various "symbols of national self-consciousness" (octagonal star, crosses, swastika and rotating cross), and the use of "masonic, anti-Russian symbols." The RNU does not lay stress on questions of religion and the church. The main thing for a person is to be a fanatic nationalist, an advocate of "racial purity," since he will be ready for Orthodoxy any way. The Barkashovites regard the present leaders of the Russian Orthodox church "mostly as Zionist-masonic" and insist on their being removed from the posts they hold. "The time has come to decide whom you side with. And if you do not decide, we shall decide for you and give everyone his due." This is the appeal of the newspaper Russky Poryadok to the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church. Sources of financing The members of the organization pay no dues. Despite this, the movement does not have financial problems. According to information at the disposal of MN, the movement and some of its members have shares in commercial structures. Many of the RNU members are employed as guards at trade and commercial institutions. Barkashovites "maintain order" when functions of national-patriotic orientation are held and, of course, their services are not free of charge.
