Their caution is due to the slow fulfillment of the terms stated in the protocol Gasprom signed with its Ukrainian counterparts on March 10. In March, the Ukrainian negotiators pledged to solve the main problems relating to the debt within one month. The Ukrgasprom representatives who visited Moscow in early April confirmed their determination to comply with the terms of the document signed in March. Nonetheless, out of the promised amount of 100 million dollars, Ukraine has remitted to the Gasprom account 96.5 million dollars, and has not identified terms for the Russian participation in joint ownership of the underground storage facilities on Ukrainian territory. These include two underground reservoirs near the western border. Russia has already handed over to the Ukrainian colleagues a draft agreement between the two countries on this matter. Since the debt owed to the Russian supplier by Ukrainian consumers has reached 1.5 trillion roubles and its is doubtful that they will be able to mobilize sufficient resources soon, Gasprom experts believe that the problems should better be resolved at the inter-state level.
