FBIS4-47414 "jpust012___94168" JPRS-UST-94-012 JPRS Science & Technology Central Eurasia 8 June 1994 LIFE SCIENCES MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH Eye Disorders Caused by Chernobyl Accident Eye Disorders Caused by Chernobyl Accident 11111111 [OFTALMOLOGTCHESKIY ZHURNAL No.3, May-June 93] 11111111 [OFTALMOLOGTCHESKIY ZHURNAL No.3, May-June 93] CSO [Editorial Report] The Odessa periodical OFTALMOLOGICHESKIY ZHURNAL contains five articles on ophthalmic pathologies caused by exposure to ionizing radiation released during the Chernobyl accident. Studies of individuals who either participated in post-accident clean-up or reside in the contaminated zone indicate that they are at increased risk of a variety of eye disorders, including cataracts. Several of the reports indicate that radiation may be initiating a variety of ophthalmic problems in children. In 52.1 percent of 6896 children who live in the Chernobyl radiation contamination zone, researchers L. A. Sukhina, A. F. Smirnova, S. V. Chubar and Ali Zorkot found ophthalmic disorders such as refractive anomalies, chronic blepharoconjunctivitis, pigmented neoplasms of the mucosa, opacification of the lens, and edema of the optic nerve and retina. In many cases pathologies were initially detected after radiation exposure and may have been caused by it. The researchers found a much higher incidence of pathologies than were detected in a 1985 study of Ukrainian children, in which 6.1 percent had ophthalmic disorders. These findings about children are supported by animal studies. Rats chronically exposed to increased levels of ionizing radiation from the Chernobyl accident experienced dystrophic, adaptive and proliferative changes in the retina, concluded N. Ye. Dumbrova and N. I. Nesteruk. Young rats brought into the contaminated zone suffered greater changes than rats that had always lived in the zone. The cytoplasmic structures of the photoreceptor were the earliest cells affected and the most susceptible to damage. The researchers predict that individuals exposed to radiation will experience slowly or rapidly progressing dystrophic processes in the retina or exacerbation of existing pathologies. Tn a study conducted on newborn rats, N. N. Bushuyeva and N. Ye. Dumbrova found that radiation of the thymus gland causes destructive changes in the connective tissue of the sclera that may initiate the development of myopia or promote its progression. The authors propose long-term mass screening of children and adolescents in high radiation zones. Radiation from Chernobyl may also be causing premature aging of the eyes. A study of senile cataracts in Tvano-Frankovsk District has revealed a 35 percent increase during 1988-1993. M. T. Shkromida, M. A. Mosyak, R.V. Boychuk, and T. N. Senyuk found cataracts to be most frequent (9.1-9.8 per 10,000 population) in zones with the highest radioactivity levels. A higher incidence was found in the Subcarpathian and Dniester regions (8.3-9.5 patients per 10,000 population) than in the Carpathian region (3.1-4.3 patients per 10,000). Cataracts developed in younger individuals in the Dniester region than in Carpathia. Even low, legally permitted doses of ionizing radiation can lead to senile cataracts and premature aging of the lens, concluded B. Sh. Lazaretnik, Yu. V. Bakbardin and A. V. Grebennik after a comparative study of Chernobyl clean-up participants, contaminated zone residents, and control groups. They also found that these ophthalmic changes can serve as an indicator of overall accelerated senescence caused by radiation exposure and manifested as chronic degeneration and inflammation of the upper respiratory tract, and neurasthenia. This report notes that other radiation-induced eye disorders identified in previous studies of Chernobyl victims include vascular changes, alterations in the ocular adnexa, and optic nerve pathologies. These reports indicate that ophthalmic problems caused by Chernobyl will be a growing problem for Ukraine. Most of the articles propose additional research, as well as long-term screening, prophylaxis and treatment of populations in zones with increased radiation levels.
