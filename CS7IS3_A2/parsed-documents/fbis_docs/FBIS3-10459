The new acquisitions fall within an overall plan to modernize the Chilean Armed Forces' equipment, and in the FACh's case they are to replace the old Hawker Hunter fighters and other aircraft. Gen. Vega said there is still nothing definite about the purchase of Mirage fighters, although he admitted "it is a possibility the FACh is assessing." Vega made this statement after a ceremony in which he received a Spanish-made CASA transportation aircraft, model C-212, the first of a group of six to replace the Twin Otter aircraft that operate in southern Chile.
