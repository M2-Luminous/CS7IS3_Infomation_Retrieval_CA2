Tianjin first imported production technology and equipment from the Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd., of Japan in 1986 to produce a type of midget car named Xiali. During the past eight years, growing market demand and unceasing expansion of its production scale has made the auto industry Tianjin's number one profit-earner. Some 50,000 Xiali sedans rolled off the production line in 1993 alone, with output value and profits both holding first place among all of the city's industrial sectors. The flourishing of the auto industry has also stimulated development of many related local economic sectors. At present, Tianjin lays claim to the title of the country's second largest sedan producer after Shanghai, which produces Volkswagen Santanas in cooperation with Germany. Since 1990, Xiali sedan cars have been in great demand on the domestic market due mainly to the rapid development of China's taxi service, according to the manager of the Tianjin auto marketing company. With the advantage of low prices and low operating costs, Xiali sedans account for the majority of cars in taxi service. Half of the 100,000 Xiali cars already sold have been put into taxi service all over the country, and many have been bought directly by individual taxi drivers, the manager said. Tianjin Municipality has stressed further input to develop its Xiali auto industry. Innovation and extension projects are under way. By the year 1995, annual output will be increased to 150,000 and the usage rate of domestically-made spare parts will reach 85 percent.
