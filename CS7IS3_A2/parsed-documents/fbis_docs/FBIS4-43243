But this new flexibility is only one side of the coin: the new regulations are also an expression of a certain fearfulness. It so happens that the new flexibility in covering export credit risks does not resolve the fundamental problem faced by the system which is operating with losses running into the billions. In principle, the export credit system should break even. If it does not, it needs to be subsidized, the GATT principles state; but that represents a distortion of the competitive system, i.e. it is illegal. The classification of the laender into risk categories on the basis of which credit risk guarantees are set by the government is a step in the right direction. As against the previous practice of setting "uniform rates" reliable payment and customer ethics are rewarded based on the principle of "higher premiums for greater risks and lower premiums for smaller risks," while poor performance is penalized by charging higher premiums or even by refusing to extend subsequent coverage. But the other side of the coin becomes apparent soon enough. Russia, for example (or rather, customers in Russia) is in class five, without a doubt a poor payer of its bills. Last year, the German Government was forced to pay 5.1 billion German marks [DM] because Russian customers did not pay their bills. It is doubtful that this will change in the next few years. Even Rexrodt knows--and makes no secret of it--that the assumption of risks in trading with Russia is based on political considerations and not on business decisions. In line with the logic of the new flexibility, however, German exporters looking for credit guarantees for their business dealings with Russian customers would have to pay premiums of more than 50 percent because the risk of losses is as great as it is and because the risk is no longer supposed to be shared by all exporters on an equal basis. But premiums of such magnitude would quickly put an end to all export trade. This problem arises with respect to all the major problem nations of years past, e.g. the former Soviet bloc, Iran, Brazil, or Argentina. One more time Rexrodt weasled out of the problem of who must bear the economic risks for business deals with politically significant countries such as Russia or Iran, which are either unable or unwilling to pay up. Either the risk guarantees are no longer extended in which case such exports will no longer take place and the Bonn government will only assume "good," i.e. minor risks, or the government will guarantee political credit risks but does not make the exporters pay for them no matter what Germany's OECD or GATT partners may say. As long as this central problem of political risks is not resolved it cannot be maintained that the new guidelines will lead to a reduction of the Hermes-related budget risks. But if the government merely assumes "good" risks from now on, we may not need a risk insurance for export credits any more. Even now only about six percent of all exports are Hermes-insured. There is one more thing wrong with the new Hermes system, i.e. it is hard to see why the ministry chooses to keep the laender list a secret. On the face of it, this is simply the way bureaucrats work who view the public as a nuisance while forgetting all the while that it is the public that pays their salaries. Rexrodt's explanation of the bureaucratic foolishness is unconvincing. The lists cannot be made public, he says, because they must continuously be updated. Actually, it is the other way around: precisely because they are constantly updated they need to be made public so that the exporters can make proper plans. It goes without saying that the Foreign Ministry may run into problems if country A or country B is listed in a less than attractive category; but that is a matter to be dealt with not by the exporter but by the country in question. For their part, the ministry officials should have the courage to break down and realize that they are here to provide a service.
