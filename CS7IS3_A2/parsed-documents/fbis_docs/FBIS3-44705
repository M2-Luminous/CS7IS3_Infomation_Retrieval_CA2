The 12th lecture, entitled: "Strategic Steps for China's Socialist Modernization Construction," is given by Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the State Council Research Office. Wang's lecture begins with a brief explanation of the three-step strategy for China's modernization drive, which constitutes an important component of Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. According to Wang, this strategy aims, as the first step, to double the 1980 Gross National Product (GNP] to provide the people with enough to eat and wear; second, to quadruple the GNP before the end of this century to enable the people to lead a comparatively well-off life; and finally, to basically accomplish the modernization drive by the mid-21st century. Then, Wang reviews how this strategy, adopted and implemented since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, has effectively guided the Chinese economy, enabling it to grow at an annual rate of 9 percent throughout the eighties. After citing statistics showing fruitful achievements in various economic sectors, he stresses that as China continues to face great opportunities in the nineties, it is necessary to continue to exert every muscle to push the economy forward. Turning to the ongoing economic structural reform, he notes that the smooth progress in lifting price control and instituting a new distribution system has enhanced the role of market and promoted the development of diverse economic sectors. Discussing the tasks of economic development, Wang points out: Last year's 12.8 percent growth rate was higher than the originally planned 6 percent. In view of the constraints of raw materials, energy, and transportation, it will be rather difficult to keep up with last year's growth rate. In developing the economy from now on, it is necessary to concentrate efforts on efficiency, not speed. Efforts should be made to optimize structure and extensively apply advanced science and technology in agricultural and industrial production. The lecture ends at 0830 GMT.
