As deputy chairman of the city court, Nella Volzhenkina, reported, the range of complaints is very broad--from specific violations in the polling stations to demands to declare the results of the elections as a whole invalid. Among the others was a complaint from the former City Council deputy Aleksey Kovalev about the actions of the mayor of St. Petersburg with respect to exercising the authority of the legislative organ of power. The plaintiff asks that the legal acts of the mayor's office published in violation of the Constitution be declared invalid. Kovalev points out that since 22 December of last year, Anatoliy Sobchak has been performing the functions of an organ of representative power of a subject of the Russian Federation and local self-government on the territory of St. Petersburg. At the same time Article 10 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation says: "State power in the Russian Federation shall be exercised on the basis of separation into legislative, executive, and judicial. Organs of legislative, executive, and judicial power shall be independent." In keeping with the Constitution, nobody may appropriate power in the Russian Federation. Seizure of power or appropriation of authority shall be persecuted according to federal law" [quotation marks as published]. Thus, certain provisions of Edict of the President of the Russian Federation No. 2252, according to which the mayor actually concentrated the representative power in his own hands, contradicts the Constitution. Thus "laws and other legal acts in effect on the territory of the Russian Federation until the present Constitution takes effect shall be applied as long as they do not contradict the Constitution of the Russian Federation." From this it follows that in his actions to exercise the authority of the legislative organ beginning 25 December 1993, the mayor of St. Petersburg proceeded from provisions that were not to be applied and violated the provisions of the Constitution. In Kovalev's opinion, these actions cause significant harm to the economic interests of the residents of the city. The court has taken the applications under advisement. On 24 March the Procuracy of St. Petersburg sent a protest to the City Court regarding the mayor's directive of 20 March concerning changing the procedure for voting in elections to the City Assembly, according to which the voting was continued for one more day. Previously, Anatoliy Sobchak had rejected the protest sent to him from the Procuracy on 21 March regarding a similar matter. The mayor thinks that, in keeping with Edict of the President of the Russian Federation of 21 December 1993, Number 2252, "On Reform of Organs of State Power of St. Petersburg," he was instructed to the Statute on Elections to the City Assembly and schedule a date for conducting them.
