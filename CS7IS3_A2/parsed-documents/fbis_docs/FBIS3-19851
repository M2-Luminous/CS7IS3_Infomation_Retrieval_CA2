SPD [Social Democratic Party] parliamentary group chairman Wolfgang Birthler told journalists in Potsdam today that the minority government would operate on the basis of the existing cooperation agreement reached in November 1990. Only the objective of devoting even greater effort toward the creation of jobs would be added to the existing coalition paper. The Liberals intend to add further amendments following a private meeting this weekend. Both partners stressed their wish to continue their "successful policies as before" until the regular Landtag elections this autumn. There will be no fundamental break with previous government policy, Birthler said.
