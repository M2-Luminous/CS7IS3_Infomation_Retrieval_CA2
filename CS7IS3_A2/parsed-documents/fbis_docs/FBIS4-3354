"If they are sincere about human rights, then they should stop exploiting Chinese workers," he added. "They" are the thousands of foreign entrepreneurs who operate factories in Fujian to make such goods as running shoes and plastic toys. Statistics show these businesses -- many of them medium-to-small Taiwanese companies -- employed more than 400,000 Chinese last year, mostly from other provinces. Although Fujian is one of the few relatively rich provinces, labour disputes, particularly those involving foreign businesses, have surged alarmingly. In one instance, a female worker in a Taiwanese factory in Fuzhou was beaten and locked in a cage with two wolfhounds after she was caught stealing some unused rubber. Fellow workers went on strike after one of them, who helped the woman escape, was sacked. Dangerous work conditions were also common, and some factories like deathtraps. Last year, 64 textile workers were burnt to death when fire broke out in a factory at which bosses had double-locked the doors. Mr Peng described workers in a Taiwanese factory, mostly young women with little education, who sat quietly along the production line when he visited. "They just put their hands in front of us, some without fingers -- they had been chopped off by machines," he said. Another factory with 400 workers reported 36 industrial accidents -- some causing permanent injury -- in two years. And although low wages were often cited as an incentive to invest in China, some foreigners sought to maximise this advantage. Mr Peng said he knew of a worker who was paid only 60 yuan (HK$52) after laboring six months in a factory. Her manager had devised such exorbitant fees to be paid by workers each month that the woman was left with barely enough money for her train fare home. Other factories were run like military camps, said Mr Peng. Workers had to ask permission to go to toilets and in some cases, women were not allowed to close toilet doors so they would not "stay there too long". Working hours were "eternally" long, Mr Peng said. Sixteen hours a day with overtime pay as low a 50 fens (half a yuan) an hour had become almost the norm among joint ventures in Fujian, he said. Mr Peng said such abuses were limited usually to small and medium-sized factories and those which had not set up labour unions. Although Chinese law required all foreign-owned businesses to set up such unions, less than a fifth of foreign businesses operating in Fujian had set up unions by the end of last year, he said. Labour bureau director Wang Lihong said the Government was aware of the problems and had already begun provincial inspections. Section chief Huang Changshun said the inspectors would examine workers' contracts and police maximum working hours and the unlawful employment of children in foreign enterprises. "We can't sacrifice our workers' interests for the sake of foreign investment," Mr Wang said.
