Yutaka Kume, head of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, said it is not true that Japan has discriminated against foreign automakers and auto parts makers seeking to enter the nation's markets and will not do so in the future. Kume, also chairman of Nissan Motor Co., made the remark after the U.S. Government released a report Thursday accusing Japan of maintaining trade barriers against foreign companies in the automotive sector, among others. He said his industry wants to try to make the United States understand that Japan's auto market is open for foreign countries to enter.
