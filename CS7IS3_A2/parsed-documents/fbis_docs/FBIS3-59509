Many companies fear that know-how will move over to the competition. In-house work or outsourcing -- this is no longer just a question in production but also in research and development. For costs are rising there as well, because the product and innovation cycles are getting shorter and shorter. For example, while the costs of research and development in the large electronics companies were in 1980 still at about the level of net profit, they have since increased by more than a factor of two. By allocating research tasks to third parties, the costs can be reduced. "The possibilities of outsourcing are, however, only being used by a few companies," Michael Eyett, of the renowned advisory institute Prognos AG in Basel, observes. Eyett also knows the reason for the reticence: Companies are too afraid that through outsourcing, the competition will gain possession of know-how belonging to the companies themselves. At the same time, investigations carried out by Prognos AG show that companies which cooperate with other manufactures in research and development are more successful: As a rule, they demonstrate a greater share of new products, and obtain an above average growth in turnover as well as a higher export quota than do companies which are less amenable to cooperation. In addition, personnel costs for research and development are plainly lower. Still, the decision for or against outsourcing of research and development capacities should be well considered. In-house research and development does offer the company some advantages: - Control over research and development remains with the company; - Acquired know-how can be used on an exclusive basis; - The company preserves its technological independence; - The success of its own in-house research bestows on the company a positive image among the public; - Internal cooperation among the various departments functions better. But some disadvantages of in-house R&D activities must not be concealed: - High fixed and lead costs accumulate; - In-house research requires a lot of time; - And, in addition, there is still always the risk of not succeeding technically and economically. Prognos advisor Michael Eyett is not pleading the case that each research and development project should be given over to a third party. Eyett proposes that those areas which will in the future be a part of the core know-how for the company should remain in-house. Also, activities in which the company has developed technological know-how or which promise synergistic effects with available technological know-how should remain with the company. Eyett is certain that such observations will be made with greater frequency in the future: "The trend towards increasing outsourcing of research and development will strengthen in the future." The series "Technology at the Beginning of the 21st Century" will be continued in coming weeks. Planned for the next edition: Digital Television.
