Walesa remembered the sacrifice of thousands of his fellow countrymen who took part in that battle along with Allied forces in this way. [Walesa] The Polish people fought on every front during World War II. They fought, above all, for the liberation of Europe. They fought for the people of Poland only in the second instant. As early as 1939, we knew that not only Poland but also the destiny of Europe was at stake, but they did not listen to us. In this way, we had to fight to put right the errors made by others. [Borrelli] But do you not run the risk of creating a Europe based solely on business interests rather than a Europe based on those values that everyone wanted during the struggle against Nazism? [Walesa] Obviously this risk exists, but the principles will always win in the end. Some questions are of common interest. I am thinking of the question of nuclear power stations. The safeguarding of the environment must be the responsibility of everyone. Europe cannot allow situations like that in the former Yugoslavia to arise. When I hear people say that in order to allow Russia to join the security organization named "Partnership for Peace" different rules to those of other countries will be applied, I cannot see how this will work. [Borrelli] In Russia, your powerful neighbor, Boris Yeltsin's power is threatened by Rutskoy and Zhirinovskiy. Does this worry you? [Walesa] We do not constitute a desired object for Russia. If anything, you run this risk. The only solution is for Europe to extend in order to include the countries of the former communist bloc. In this way, common security and wealth are increased and uncertainties are reduced.
