By the end of 1992, up to US$11.9 billion in loans and gifts from foreign governments, including export credit and mixed loans, have been used in foreign cooperative endeavors. Zhao Xizheng, vice minister of the Ministry of Electric Power, said that the above-mentioned loans, aid, export credit, and mixed loans came from the World Bank, Japan Overseas Foundation, Asian Development Bank, Kuwait-Arab Development Foundation, Canada, France, Norway, Germany, Australia, the UK, Sweden, Russia, Austria, the U.S., Spain, Belgium, Denmark, and Finland. Through the use of this US$11.9 million, 55 projects have been completed or are now under construction, including 23 thermal power plant projects, 16 hydropower station projects, 1 nuclear power plant, and 5 power transmission projects. The total installed electric power capacity of new plant construction is up to 33,720MW, 8,000MW of which is now in operation. Foreign loans have not only accelerated electric power construction in China, but they have raised the level of construction and operational management and the economic performance of the electric power industry. The World Bank, which partly funded the construction of the Yunnan Lubuge hydropower station, was the first project partner brought into China, and the Chinese power construction units, having survived that very painful resurrection, promptly went on to build the pumped-storage hydropower station in Guangzhou at a pace of construction that is without rival. The power plants being built with foreign loans and imported facilities have been ushering in a parade of safe, economic, and sophisticated units that have enabled the Chinese electric power industry to realize an annual average reduction in consumption of 3 grams of standard coal per kWh for several years running. In addressing the future development of China's electric power industry, Zhao Xizheng said that the only way out of the money shortage that is inhibiting the large-scale development of the power industry is to find more ways to raise funds. To do this, the Ministry of Electric Power will continue to encourage foreign investments in China through independent ventures, joint-ventures, cooperative endeavors, or any other means to get electric power, and it will support local governments and electric power enterprises in securing more foreign investment. New forms of finance, such as alliance funding, and common international forms like BOT and BOOT will also be encouraged, and other new ways to secure loans must be found. In a word, there will have to be some breakthroughs in the use of foreign loans.
