[Lenskiy over video of Chinese, Russian officers viewing Su-25 taxiing, formation display by four Su-27] Colonel General of Aviation Cao Shuang-Ming, commander of the Chinese Air Force, viewed flights by Su-25 assault aircraft and Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters at Kubinka today. According to Russia's Frontal Aviation Commander Nikolay Antoshkin, the Kubinka airfield hosts up to 120 delegations a year. Some are shown aircraft to reinforce relations, others for advertising purposes. Today's demonstration of the wonders of our combat aviation combined friendship and business. The Kubinka Sky Hussars' flight is named for Kozhedub, who is also a national hero in China. What is more, our great Eastern neighbor is buying Su-27 fighters from Russia. But today the leadership of the Chinese Air Force was particularly interested in the MiG-29. Nikolay Antoshkin encouraged this interest in every possible way. [Antoshkin] This is profitable for the state and the people. If we do not sell, someone else will. [Lenskiy] Russia currently has to compete in the aircraft market with the FRG, the United States, France, Britain, and Italy. Even though specialists claim that a Western equivalent of the Su-27 will not be available before the year 2000. The Chinese delegation was particularly happy to note that one of the Sky Hussars' aircraft is piloted by a woman. Lyudmila Pukito flies a Su-25 assault aircraft. She says that there are female military pilots in many countries. Lyudmila can't understand why she is being singled out. [Pukito] But if our aircraft are made even more popular as a result, I will have served my purpose. [Lenskiy] Raising the popularity of Russian military aircraft is not cheap for the Russian Air Force. A demonstration flight on one of these aircraft costs 200,000 rubles at 1992 prices. However, the Air Force leadership believes that the game is worth the candle. Vladimir Lenskiy, Vladimir Avdeyev reporting for NTV from Kubinka.
