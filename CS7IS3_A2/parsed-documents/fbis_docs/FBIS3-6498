U.S. imports are expected to increase up to 10 percent this year because the economic recovery is fueled chiefly by rising consumption and investment rather than growth in exports, KFTA officials said. Korea's exports to the United States, which have recorded losses or less than 1 percent growth since 1989, are expected to rise as much as 5 percent to total 19 billion U.S. dollars, the officials said. Sunny skies are forecast for exports of electronics, machinery and motor vehicles, but the prospects for textiles remain cloudy due to weakening competitiveness, they said.
