[Pannella] I had asked [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli, [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, [former Socialist Prime Minister] Amato, and [former Italian Liberal Party Secretary] Zanone to constitute a pole against the alliance between [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [National Alliance leader] Fini in Rome. They did not even answer. We made a "free" offer to the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], Greens, and AD [Democratic Alliance] to provide "reformist" support against the MSI [Italian Social Movement] candidates in all the center-south. They did not even say no. In reality, they much prefer Fini who for them is not only "better than Berlusconi" but also better than Pannella. We have all heard [PDS Secretary] Achille Occhetto say that he likes Fini. What happened between 1976 and 1979, when only half of the MSI candidates became part of the "national unity" will happen again under the new legislature. This time they will all enter with flying colors. [Stanganelli] But was Achille Occhetto's comment not simply a gesture of electoral fair play? [Pannella] Fair play! In the clash against the "demon" Berlusconi, they brought a well-known respected person like [Budget Minister] Spaventa, who is undisputably a layman, into the game. Instead they put an amiable Rete member, who is entirely innocuous against Fini. Even this is a sure sign that they are now officially ready for national unity as far as the MSI leader is concerned. Anthropological and cultural unity for those who were antifascists and who could not be distinguished from the fascists for many years. [passage omitted] [Stanganelli] There is already talk of the postelection government. The Left is talking of Ciampi whom you supported some time back. What about now? [Pannella] I supported the financial bills of the Ciampi and Amato governments with loyalty, but when the Ciampi government completed its task, became a branch of the progressives and [President] Scalfaro, and misgoverned with tens of decrees, I drew my conclusions. It should be remembered that the role of the governors of the Bank of Italy was substantially to cover up for the dysfunctions and the rotten nature of our economic, financial, and banking system. The "good" Ciampi is politically innocuous, disarmed, at the mercy of the existing powers who still want him at Palazzo Chigi [government seat] or in the seat of the uncomfortable Scalfaro. [Stanganelli] A lot of people want to see your friend Scalfaro retire ahead of time. [Pannella] I think that he was and remains the only constitutional, reasonable, and honest barrier against the increasingly more corrupt politics, parties, and newspapers. They tried, and will try to lynch him and knock him down using any means possible: from [LA REPUBBLICA editor] Scalfari to the progressives, from the red magistrates to the "moderate" press, from the fascists and troublemakers to the secret service. [Stanganelli] Who do you consider to be most suitable head of government in Italy for the Second Republic? [Pannella] Contrary to what Segni and Berlusconi seemed to think, the new parliament will decide who the prime minister will be, that is the Sunday [27 March] elections will decide. Foreseeably, this means the former PCI [Italian Communist Party], DC [Christian Democratic Party], and MSI: the actors I fear will ruin our country, making it worse than before, if we are not there. Without boasting, our possible absence -- if the gray card for the proportional vote is not used to guarantee our presence -- could risk being a heavy burden. If it was not for us we would have had Arnaldo Forlani [DC] or Giulio Andreotti [DC] at the Quirinale [president's palace] in 1992. [Stanganelli] Finally Pannella, given the difficulties of your list, do you not think that you are running the risk of being expelled from parliament after almost 20 years? How will you face your second 60 years as a full-time, round-the-clock politician? [Pannella] If the voters -- of the Right, Left, center, or whoever they may be -- do not vote for the Pannella list on the gray card to make us get more than 4 percent, we will no longer be in this republic nor in parliament. For 30 years they said that if it was not for us they would have had to invent us. They can "invent" us if they like. We are not the ones that should be afraid. We have, once again, opted for solitude because as [20th century philosopher] Benedetto Croce said, in the history of a country it is sometimes necessary to have men for whom "Paris is not worth a mass." I chose seat 24 in Rome and the proportional lists because if you do not take a risk you cannot reap the benefits of things that are worth being attempted. Neither for myself, nor for the others.
