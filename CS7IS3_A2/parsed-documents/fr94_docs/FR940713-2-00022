FR940713-2-00022 FR940713-2-00017 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;638&hyph;000] CNG Transmission Corporation; Request Under Blanket Authorization July 7, 1994. Take notice that on July 1, 1994, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG), 445 West Main Street, Clarksburg, West Virginia 26301, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;638&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.216(b) of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.216(b)) for authorization to abandon two metering and regulation stations (known as the Mars and Gibsonia M&R Stations) located in Butler County, Pennsylvania, under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;537&hyph;000, pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. CNG is seeking abandonment authority in order to be able to sell the stations to The Peoples Natural Gas Company, an affiliate of CNG. CNG states that it no longer needs the measurement and regulation equipment at Mars and Gibsonia because the Stull M & R Station now performs those duties. It is indicated that Peoples is the only customer served through the Mars and Gibsonia taps and would like to purchase the metering and auxiliary equipment. CNG proposes to sell the facilities at the net book values, which are $56,571.55 for the Gibsonia and $17,211.13 for the Mars Station. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to §157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefore, the proposed activity shall be deemed authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filling a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
