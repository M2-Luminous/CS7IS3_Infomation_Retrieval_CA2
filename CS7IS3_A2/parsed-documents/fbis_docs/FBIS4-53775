FBIS4-53775 "dreas099_d_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 21 May 1994 South Korea North's Demand for Repatriation of Loggers Refuted North's Demand for Repatriation of Loggers Refuted SK2105075094 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 0700 GMT 21 May 94 SK2105075094 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [Text] The government released a statement today, through a National Unification Board spokesman, pertaining to the demand made by North Korea for the repatriation of the loggers who defected. The government statement stressed that their defection was done legally from the humanitarian standpoint, and urged North Korea to immediately stop carrying out acts that heighten tension on the Korean peninsula by raising a row on this defection. The government pointed out that the loggers, who defected recently, came to our side voluntarily, seeking their freedom and welfare. However, North Korea claimed that they had been abducted and so forth. This is totally groundless. Thus, the government called on North Korea to stop committing irresponsible acts. Earlier today, North Korea sent a telephone message in the name of Yi Song-tok, head of the North Korean side's office of the North- South Liaison Office, claiming that the ROK forcibly abducted and kidnapped the loggers. North Korea urged the South to unconditionally repatriate them to North Korea. Threatening that if the ROK fails to repatriate the loggers, grave consequences would be brought about to the overall North-South relations, North Korea claimed that the ROK would be held responsible for all consequences arising therefrom.
