The meeting participants decided that the province's guiding principle for this year's foreign economic relations and trade is to correctly handle relations between foreign exchange earnings and economic returns, to simultaneously create foreign exchange earnings and improve economic returns, to simultaneously develop foreign economic relations, foreign capital, and foreign trade, and to fulfill or overfulfill various tasks in foreign economic relations and trade. The meeting pointed out: This year, there is a need to deepen foreign trade system reform, to expedite the transformation of enterprise operational mechanisms, to gradually establish a modern enterprise system, to transform enterprises from state plan enforcers into import and export commodity dealers, to switch from state monopoly to market exploration, to bring about development amid fair competition, to form combinations between trade, industry, and commerce, to introduce the agency system, to take the development road of conglomeration and internationalization, to establish a personal responsibility system and improve it, to form a financial accounting and supervisory system, and to establish a mechanism for independent operation under which enterprises assume sole responsibility for their losses and profits, carry out self- development, and exercise self-control. In the meantime, it is necessary to cultivate a mentality of macro foreign trade, to help large and medium-sized productive enterprises, commercial sectors, and materials supplying enterprises to cater to the international market, and to further explore import and export channels. This year, a small number of enterprises with good economic results will be selected for reform experiments, and their experience will be gradually popularized. To fulfill this year's export task of $100 million, the meeting requested foreign trade departments to exercise proper control over commodity purchases, to abide by a diversified strategy, to actively explore new markets, to encourage large and medium-sized productive enterprises, commercial sectors, and materials supplying enterprises, as well as foreign trade firms to tour the neighboring countries, to establish trade networks, and to expand foreign sales. Provincial party Secretary Yin Kesheng addressed the closing ceremony. He hoped that staff members and workers in the foreign trade field would display the spirit of hard struggle and selfless devotion in developing the province's foreign trade to a higher level.
