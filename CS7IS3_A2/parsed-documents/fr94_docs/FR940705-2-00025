FR940705-2-00025 FR940705-2-00017 Department of the Navy Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report For Disposal and Reuse of Marine Corps Air Station, Tustin, CA Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;08), and pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CA Public Resources Code Sections 21000 et seq.), the U.S. Marine Corps and the City of Tustin intend to prepare a joint Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR) to evaluate the environmental effects of the disposal and reuse of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Tustin. This action is being conducted in accordance with the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, and the specific 1993 base closure and realignment decisions approved by the Congress in September 1993. The proposed action to be evaluated in the EIS/EIR is the disposal of land, buildings, and infrastructure of MCAS Tustin for subsequent reuse. The Marine Corps and City of Tustin intend to analyze the environmental effects of the disposal of MCAS Tustin based on the reasonable foreseeable reuse of the property, taking into account uses to be identified by the City of Tustin Base Closure Task Force. The Task Force has developed a Specific Plan/Reuse Plan to guide the reuse of MCAS Tustin in a variety of uses, including public and private housing, commercial, light industrial, and recreation uses. Some of the existing structures and facilities, including housing, are anticipated to be reused. A number of facilities, including the airfield operation facilities, are proposed for removal. Agricultural and vacant areas on MCAS Tustin are proposed to be developed with urban uses. Full buildout of the proposed land uses will result in a maximum of 4,601 dwelling units and about 12.3 million square feet of non-residential uses such as commercial business, light industrial, and recreational uses (about 2.1 million square feet is existing floor area on the base, and 10.2 million square feet is potential new floor area). It is also currently estimated that about 25 percent of the site would be used for public uses. The project also will include the extension of major arterials through the base including Tustin Ranch Road to Von Karman, Warner Avenue from Red Hill to west of Jamboree Road, and creation of a secondary interior loop roadway and local roadways to facilitate local circulation. The Specific/Reuse Plan will also address possible variations to the Tustin Ranch Road and Warner Avenue extensions in the event the southerly blimp hangar is removed. Alternatives to be addressed in the EIS/EIR can be characterized as follows: 1. Arterial Grid Pattern/High Residential_land uses are driven by a grid pattern of major arterial extensions. This alternative has the greatest number of residential units. This alternative also has no community core land use flexibility. The alternative could pose limitations in responding to market absorption and soil clean-up phasing. 2. Ideal Interior Loop Pattern/Low Residential_the alignment of arterial highways and the proposed looped system would be modified to show its optimum alignment if the southeast blimp hangar could not be reused, and would include possible variations to the Tustin Ranch Road and Warner Avenue extensions. This alternative would have the fewest number of residential units and would result in the highest commercial retail and office square footage, particularly at the southerly portion of the site. 3. No action_retention of the property by the Marine Corps in a caretaker status. However, because of the process mandated by the Base Closure and Realignment Act, selection of the no action alternative would be considered impracticable for the Marine Corps to implement. Major environmental issues that will be addressed in the EIS/EIR include land use, housing, utilities, noise, transportation/circulation, public services, airfield operations, hazardous materials, water resources, air quality, biological resources, and cultural resources. The Marine Corps and City of Tustin will initiate a scoping process to determine the extent of issues to be addressed and identifying the significant issues related to this action. The Marine Corps and City of Tustin will hold a public scoping meeting on July 20, 1994, beginning at 7:00 p.m., at the City of Tustin Community Center located in the Tustin Civic Center, 300 Centennial Way. This meeting will be advertised in area newspapers. A brief presentation will precede the request for public comment. Marine Corps and City of Tustin representatives will be available at this meeting to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern to the public. It is important that federal, state, and local agencies and interested individuals take this opportunity to identify environmental concerns that should be addressed during the preparation of the EIS/EIR. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit oral comments to 5 minutes. Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comment on scoping issues in addition to, or in lieu of, oral comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics which the author/speaker believes the EIS/EIR should address. Written statements and questions regarding the scoping process should be mailed to: Christine Shingleton, Assistant City Manager, City of Tustin, 300 Centennial Way, Tustin, CA 92680, telephone number (714) 573&hyph;3116. All comments must be received no later than August 5, 1994. Dated: June 28, 1994. Lewis T. Booker, Jr., LCDR, JAGC, USN, Federal Register Liaison Officer.
