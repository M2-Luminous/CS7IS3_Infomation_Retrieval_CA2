Perhaps herein lies the main essence of the ceremony in the Kremlin. Of course, far from all the signatories will collaborate with the executive branch. But the fact that they have turned up at the Kremlin points to a certain, and fairly substantial, change in the political situation in Russia after the October events and the December elections. Especially indicative is the discipline of the Federation component leaders. For all its shortfalls and bleary prospects, the drive for the adoption of the charter has allowed the presidential team to regain political initiative after the Duma- inspired amnesty. The opposition and the opponents of the executive branch had to play by the rules that were enforced on them. True, after the elections Yeltsin made both political and economic concessions to the centrists, which to a substantial extent made the signing possible. The legitimate question arises: Will a worsening economic situation not be the price to pay for the temporary political respite? The real leader of Russian centrists today is the premier, while the economic course he has pursued in the past few months can on balance be deemed successful. Although the government failed to organize anything properly, and institutional changes are moving along by themselves, and the government has never made any useful decisions, nonetheless Chernomyrdin managed sharply to reduce the rate of inflation and depreciation of the ruble. In April inflation again will be approximately 10 percent. The fall in the inflation rate, however, has to do not only with a tough financial policy but also the overcoming of the dual-power situation and the economic confusion it brought about. The reforms undertaken by Gaydar provided a certain impetus which Chernomyrdin had to follow to a certain point. And while the premier is realizing this policy, the union -- formal or informal -- between liberals (i.e., Gaydar and Fedorov) and centrists is still possible. Unexpectedly to many, another main figure in this right-centrist bloc became Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin. His role manifested itself especially strongly just before the signing of the charter, when Zhirinovskiy and the national-communists tried to use the assassination of a State Duma deputy to provoke a political crisis. The stormy debate in the Duma, however, did not go outside its walls, turning into a tempest in a teapot. The central role in this was played by the current Constitution which has sharply limited the possibility of deputy arbitrariness, which was characteristic of the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People's Deputies. Yet one cannot underestimate the significance of the policy of the speaker, who used his power to promote the charter. Incidentally, Rybkin's effective inclusion into the presidential team can also be seen as one of the results in the struggle for a civic pact. With his activity -- and what is more important, its effectiveness -- Rybkin even has pushed somewhat into the background yet another figure on which the president relies: Federation Council Speaker V. Shumeyko. The latter has already had a few setbacks: budget blocking by the upper chamber, the Kazannik case, and the Federation Council's rejection of Ilyushenko. The presidential team has conducted the struggle for the charter to be concluded very actively but mostly behind closed doors, in the lobbies, and also using material incentives -- by handing out promises to the industries. The public, ideological side of the process has been totally inadequate. The president's immediate entourage, or rather his administration, failed to produce any strong political figures capable of upholding his position in debates with opponents and rivals. Earlier, this role was played by Popov, Poltoranin, Shumeyko, Shakhray, and Gaydar, who acted as direct exponents of the president's will. Now they have receded, and the main promoter of the pact became Gaydar, whose status as a faction leader was obviously out of tune with his inherited role as legitimizer of civic peace. True, the Russia's Choice leader's activity allows to talk about the president's right-centrist, not just centrist, bloc. Characteristically, Gaydar has already come out with the idea of nominating Yeltsin in the next elections. Yet it hardly makes much sense trying to look so far ahead.
