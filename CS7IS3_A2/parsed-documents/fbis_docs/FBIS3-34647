The PLO would continue its efforts to achieve a "precise and faithful implementation" of the September 13 autonomy deal, he said. 'Arafat spoke after briefing Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali on the PLO-Israel security pact signed in Cairo on Wednesday, which overcame some of the obstacles to launching self rule.
