A company spokesman interviewed by telephone from Xian said a ninth "foreigner" who was killed in the crash early Monday had not yet been identified. The crash of China Northwest Airlines Flight WH2303, which had been carrying 146 passengers and 14 crew members, also killed three Hong Kong residents and a Taiwanese. Chinese sources said the unidentified foreigner was Swiss, but the Swiss Embassy here refused to confirm the information before formal identification. The Italian Embassy here confirmed that an Italian couple had died along with their son and daughter in the crash of the Soviet-made Tupolev-154 aircraft which was travelling from Xian to the southern city of Guangzhou. The father of the children was reported to be a professor from the Florence Polytechnical School. The embassies of Britain and the United States also confirmed the presence of four of their nationals aboard China Northwest Airlines flight Wh2303. The British Embassy added that both of its nationals aboard the flight were male but did not provide further details. The accident -- the worst in China's civil aviation history -- occurred about 30 kilometres (18 miles) southeast of Xian near the Qinling mountain range. The English-language CHINA DAILY newspaper said Tuesday that "three eyewitnesses said they heard two loud explosions in the clouds and then saw a fireball crashing to the ground." A spokesman for the airline company earlier said the plane had taken off in bad weather under heavy rain, adding that an investigation was immediately launched into the incident. A Civil Air Administration of China (CAAC) spokesman refused to comment on the disaster Tuesday. Xian, the ancient imperial capital some 900 kilometres (540 miles) southwest of Beijing, is where the terracotta warrior statues of the emperor Qin Shihuang were found, making the city a popular tourist attraction.
