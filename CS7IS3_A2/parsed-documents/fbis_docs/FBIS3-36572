Chernomyrdin. The activity of the organs of management and the government's economic policy, the message says, are leading to the winding down of Russian industry, mass unemployment, and the further growth of social tension in labor collectives. The tough financial and tax policy, the release of prices for energy carriers, and the drastic increase in charges for rail shipments have led to the point where enterprises have virtually no working capital left. The fines stipulated for defaulting on payments (over 700 percent per annum), the message stresses, are in excess of all sensible limits. Enterprises are obliged to take short-term credits at commercial banks at extortionate interest rates. As a result the labor collectives are being plunged deeper and deeper into poverty. At the same time "a small group of the financial oligarchy is earning gigantic profits." Our numerous appeals to the president and government on problems requiring immediate solution, the message's signatories stress, are not meeting with a proper response. Government instructions, given the present turnover rate among leaders, are not being fulfilled. On instructions from members of the trade union we insist on an immediate meeting with you personally, the message concludes.
