IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said his agency had received no official notification from North Korea on Pyongyang's reported rejection of IAEA inspection of their nuclear facilities. Some press reports indicated that North Korea formally informed the IAEA on Feb. 2 that they were rejecting IAEA inspection. Meyer said that the North Korean Embassy in Vienna fascimiled to the IAEA on Feb. 2 a copy of their Foreign Ministry statement of Feb. 1 on the issue of nuclear talks with the United States. But, this was part of their routine information activities, not any formal message to the IAEA on their rejection of nuclear inspection, he said. The facsimiled item did not contain anything other than the three-page full text of Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry statement as reported by the North KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, Meyer added.
