FR940426-2-00132 FR940426-2-00078 The recently issued joint FTA/Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) statewide and metropolitan planning regulations (49 CFR part 613 and 23 CFR part 450) offer an appropriate vehicle for such local decisionmaking. These regulations require a process for demonstrating explicit consideration of and response to public views, including those of private operators of transit service, during the planning and program development process provided for in 23 CFR 450.212(a)(5) and 450.316(b)(1)(v). FTA believes that these processes will afford private operators ample opportunity to express their views and comments on the development of transit programs, while allowing local officials to encourage the participation of private enterprise to the maximum extent feasible. Some commenters questioned the wisdom of FTA's proposed recision of the current policy, stating that this action would ``cause irreparable economic harm to the private surface transportation industry.'' They indicated that recision would impede the statutory goal of developing responsive and widely accessible transit services. One commenter cited a report containing data from FTA's section 15 report showing that from 1984 to 1990, contracted revenue miles increased from 2.8 percent of total mass transit revenue miles to 4.2 percent. However, a close examination of the report shows both annual increases and decreases during those years in contracted revenue miles, with no clear trend apparent. The author notes that overall, ``the numbers indicate that the extent of contracted bus service is relatively low and the trend has been stable with only modest increases.'' He also acknowledges that the report ``does not address performance areas such as safety, reliability, and overall quality of service.'' The commenter observed that contracted services, which he claims have been consistently shown to produce cost savings for local transit agencies, are still a very small share of the total market. The commenter claimed that ``the situation would be much worse without the increase in transit services brought about by the (current) FTA policies and guidance,'' but provided no evidence for this assertion. Other commenters cited reports detailing specific experiences of transit authorities with privatization of bus routes, including one FTA-funded demonstration project, that resulted in limited or no cost savings and a decrease in service quality and reliability. They stated that implementation of FTA's private sector requirements has often placed an undue and unnecessary burden on staff because of a lack of interest by private operators or their inability to provide the type of services required. Commenters opposed to the recision failed to provide substantive evidence demonstrating that the current policy has resulted in a significant increase in private sector involvement in the provision of mass transit services or assisted in the development and improvement of mass transit systems; accordingly, FTA cannot agree that recision will cause financial harm to private operators or prevent the agency from accomplishing its statutory mission. The evidence presented, even by commenters opposed to the recision, indicates that the existing requirements have been of limited effectiveness and questionable utility in furthering private sector involvement in mass transit. FTA therefore believes that its decision to allow local authorities to make their own determinations concerning private enterprise involvement without rigid Federal mandates is justified by the record before the agency, reasonable in light of the objectives of the FT Act, and responsive to the specific provisions of the statute. Several commenters opposed the recision on the ground that it represents an abrogation by FTA of its responsibility to enforce the private sector provisions of the FT Act. They claimed that without the current requirements, FTA will be unable to ensure the participation of private enterprise ``to the maximum extent feasible,'' as required by the statute. FTA strongly disagrees. As indicated above, the available data do not demonstrate that the current requirements are effective. In our view, no commenter has established a causal relationship between the implementation of the requirements and increased private enterprise participation. On the other hand, public transit authorities have cited specific examples of hardship or undue burdens caused by the imposition of the existing guidance. FTA therefore believes that it is justified in exercising its administrative and policymaking discretion by implementing the private sector provisions in a manner consistent with the statutory scheme and reinforced by ISTEA, i.e., through local decisionmaking rather than through Federal mandates. One commenter alleged that FTA did not open the comment period for this proceeding prepared to evaluate fully and fairly all the comments submitted, but rather with a fixed and predetermined purpose to ``paper'' its previously decided action. The commenter submitted as evidence of FTA's prejudgment certain statements made by the Administrator before a trade association group prior to commencement of this proceeding, indicating that the agency found the current private enterprise requirements inappropriate and burdensome and intended to seek their recision. FTA finds nothing improper in the Administrator's comments. In Association of National Advertisers v. FTC, 627 F.2d 1151 (D.C. Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 921 (1980), the court ruled that certain statements made by the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission prior to a rulemaking proceeding under the Federal Trade Commission Improvements Act did not disqualify the Chairman from participation in or invalidate the proceeding. The court emphasized that the Chairman's presentation to a trade group of his views on issues later addressed in the rulemaking was a valid exercise of his policymaking prerogatives: ``The view of a neutral and detached adjudicator is simply an inapposite role model for an administrator who must translate broad statutory commands into concrete social policies. If an agency official is to be effective, he must engage in debate and discussion about the policy matters before him.'' Id. at 1168&hyph;1169. See also, Lead Industries Ass'n. v. EPA, 647 F.2d 1130, 1179 (D.C. Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1042 (1980); and United Steelworkers of America v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1208&hyph;1210 (D.C. Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 913 (1981). Indeed, stated the court, One cannot even conceive of an agency conducting a rulemaking proceeding unless it had delved into the subject sufficiently to become concerned that there was an evil or abuse that required regulatory response. It would be the height of absurdity, even a kind of abuse of administrative process, for an agency to embroil interested parties in a rulemaking proceeding, without some initial concern that there was an abuse that needed remedying, a concern that would be set forth in the accompanying statement of the purpose of the proposed rule. Investigation and policy-making are integral to the total function just as much as decisionmaking. It is appropriate and indeed mandatory for agency heads and staff to maintain contacts with industry and consumer groups, trade associations and press, congressmen of various persuasions, and to present views in interviews, speeches, meetings, conventions, and testimony␣*␣*␣* Nat'l. Advertisers at 1176. Accordingly, FTA finds that far from impairing the integrity of this proceeding, the Administrator's remarks cited by the commenter reflect the agency's valid concern with the current private enterprise requirements.
