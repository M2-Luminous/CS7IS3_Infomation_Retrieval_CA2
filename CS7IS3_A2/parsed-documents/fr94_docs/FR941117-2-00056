FR941117-2-00056 FR941117-2-00041 Social Security Administration Social Security Acquiescence Rulings: Rescissions; Paxton v. HHS Secretary; Augmented Veterans Benefit Paid Directly to Veteran, Treatment of Dependent's Portion AGENCY: Social Security Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice of Rescission of Social Security Acquiescence Ruling 90&hyph;1(9)_ Paxton v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 856 F.2d 1352 (9th Cir. 1988). SUMMARY: In accordance with 20 CFR 416.1485(e) and 422.406(b)(2), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of the rescission of Social Security Acquiescence Ruling 90&hyph;1(9). EFFECTIVE DATE: November 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary Sargent, Litigation Staff, Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21235, (410) 965&hyph;1695. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A Social Security Acquiescence Ruling explains how we will apply a holding in a decision of a United States Court of Appeals that we determine conflicts with our interpretation of a provision of the Social Security Act or regulations when the Government has decided not to seek further review of the case or is unsuccessful on further review. As provided by 20 CFR 416.1485(e)(4), a Social Security Acquiescence Ruling may be rescinded as obsolete if we subsequently clarify, modify or revoke the regulation or ruling that was the subject of the circuit court holding for which the Acquiescence Ruling was issued. On July 16, 1990, we issued Acquiescence Ruling (AR) 90&hyph;1(9) (55 FR 28946) to reflect the Ninth Circuit's holding in Paxton v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 856 F.2d 1352 (9th Cir. 1988), that, as written, the current regulations did not support counting the dependent's portion of an augmented Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefit as unearned income to the dependent in determining supplemental security income (SSI) eligibility and calculating benefits. Acquiescence Ruling 90&hyph;1(9) applied to SSI applicant and recipient cases arising in the Ninth Circuit in which an individual received an augmented VA benefit. On November 17, 1994, we are publishing final regulations which set out our policy, under the SSI program, regarding the treatment of veterans benefits that are augmented to provide for dependents. The effect of these regulations is to clarify and make more equitable our treatment of the ``dependent's portion'' of augmented veterans benefits. The regulations state that, if an individual receives a veteran's benefit that includes an amount paid to him or her because of a dependent, we will not count as unearned income the amount paid to him or her because of the dependent. The regulations additionally provide that the dependent's portion will be counted as the dependent's unearned income if the dependent resides with the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse, or if the dependent receives his or her own portion in a separate payment from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Because these regulations address the issued decided by the Paxton court, we hereby rescind AR 90&hyph;1(9) as obsolete. The regulations make specific provisions for those individuals in the Ninth Circuit who might lose SSI benefits as a result of this rescission. Adjudicators of claims arising in the Ninth Circuit (Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon and Washington) will no longer follow AR 90&hyph;1(9), but will decide cases based on the amended regulations.
