Speaking on the final working day of a visit to Britain, the leader of the largest former Soviet Central Asian republic said the proposed conference, modelled on the 1975 Helsinki accords, would attempt to set up new confidence-building measures at a time of rising tensions in Asia. He said 27 nations had shown interest and Kazakhstan was going ahead with a preparatory conference to be attended by Deputy Foreign Ministers. Two meetings of experts had been held, and preparations were under way for a summit of heads of state. Among those invited are all the former Soviet republics of Central Asia, China, India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, North Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Russia. He hoped that Britain and other European nations could also be associated with the conference, and said Mr. Major had responded positively. Kazakhstan is one of the world's only nuclear powers voluntarily to give up its weapons, having scrapped 1,100 warheads. Britain, together with Russia and America, now has a formal role in guaranteeing the country's non-nuclear status. Much of Mr. Nazarbayev's visit here has been taken up with the rapidly expanding business links. New agreements were signed in Downing Street on double taxation, the protection of Western investments, economic cooperation, education and science. The Kazakh government is on the brink of signing a huge contract with British Gas.
