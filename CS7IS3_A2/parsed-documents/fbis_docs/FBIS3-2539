Let us ask Comrade Zhou Jue, our spokesman for the National People's Congress [NPC] session, to make some remarks. [Zhou] The Second Session of the Eighth NPC will open tomorrow. Although the current session is a regular meeting, it is very important. It is being held during an important period when our country is proceeding on all fronts in reforming its economic structure with breakthroughs in key areas, and when it is accelerating the pace of establishing a socialist market economic system. You are welcome to cover this session. I wish you success in your coverage. Now, I am willing to answer your questions that have something to do with the agenda of the current session. [RENMIN RIBAO correspondent] I am a correspondent from RENMIN RIBAO. I would like to ask the spokesman the following question: The just-concluded sixth meeting of the NPC Standing Committee examined and approved the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Investments by Taiwan Compatriots. This has caused great concern on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. What effect will the implementation of the law have on the expansion of cross-strait economic exchanges and trade? [Zhou] The NPC Standing Committee meeting recently approved the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Investments by Taiwan Compatriots. This is because cross-strait economic contacts have become closer, and Taiwan's investments in the mainland's economy have increased by a large margin. Despite this situation, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have not yet established direct postal links, direct air and shipping services, and direct trade contacts. Therefore, it is essential to enact the law on protecting Taiwan compatriots' investments. The law mainly protects Taiwan compatriots' personal safety, investments, and investment returns; it also protects enterprises funded by them in China against being requisitioned, and if these enterprises are requisitioned for public services, the method of compensation should be adopted. Moreover, the law allows enterprises funded by Taiwan compatriots here to organize business associations to protect their legitimate rights and interests. The formulation and adoption of this law fully demonstrates that we attach great importance to Taiwan compatriots' investment-related rights and interests, and also give full expression to our sincerity in developing cross-strait economic contacts and trade. I believe that the enactment of the law will surely be welcomed by the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots, and it will play a very important role in promoting economic development on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The enactment of this law provides us the most authoritative and fullest legal guarantee for protecting investments by Taiwan compatriots on the mainland. [Unidentified correspondent] Some NPC deputies from the Hong Kong region are going to put forward a motion during the NPC session, requiring the NPC to announce the dissolution and reorganization of the Hong Kong British Government's three-tier parliament after 1997. Will NPC spokesman support the motion? [Zhou] Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's 1994/1995 elections have broken down due to an uncooperative and sabotaging attitude taken by Britain. The responsibility is entirely on the British side. In accordance with the stipulations of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Britain's administration over Hong Kong will end on 30 June 1997, with China resuming the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong thereafter. The three-tier political structure which serves the British administration in Hong Kong will also inevitably end with the expiry of the term of British rule. The political framework for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be formed according to the resolution of China's NPC and the relevant stipulations of the Basic Law. Here, I would like to reiterate: Hong Kong will soon return to the embrace of the motherland. No force whatsoever can stop this. The Chinese Government and people have full confidence and ability to resume the exercise of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong on time; to implement the principle of "one country, two systems"; to carry out the Basic Law; and to maintain Hong Kong's smooth transition as well as its long-term stability. [CCTV correspondent] The NPC and its Standing Committee noticeably sped up the pace of legislation over the past year, but failure to abide by the laws and lax enforcement of laws occurred in some areas from time to time. How will the NPC Standing Committee strengthen examination of and supervision over law enforcement so as to improve the situation? [Zhou] Supervising law enforcement and government judicial organs' work is an important duty entrusted to the NPC and its standing committee by the Constitution. Over the past year, the NPC Standing Committee conducted close examination of legislation of laws, their enforcement, and government work, bearing in mind the state's priority tasks and the issues of greatest concern to the people; it successively sent 10 inspection teams to 15 provinces, municipalities, and regions to assess work in comprehensive management of public security and in dealing with the production and sales of counterfeit and substandard commodities. Various special committees also sent 27 inspection teams to assess progress in implementing 15 laws. The Standing Committee also heard reports by relevant State Council departments and the Supreme People's Procuratorate [SPP] on education, banking, foreign trade, the building of a clean and honest government, and civil aviation. For instance, after hearing a work report by the department of the Civil Aviation Administration, the Standing Committee required the department of the Civil Aviation Administration and its affiliated organizations to conscientiously strengthen control, to improve the quality of their work and personnel as well as attitude toward service, and to improve civil aviation as quickly as possible. After hearing work reports by the SPP and relevant State Council departments, the Standing Committee fully affirmed their work, in particular their work on investigating extensive, important cases, and gave them maximum support. In the future, the NPC and its Standing Committee will continue to strengthen supervision and to exercise the authority of supervision vested in it by the Constitution in a better way. [SWEDISH DAILY NEWS correspondent, in English fading into Mandarin translation] I have heard that the Chinese Government is considering abolishing the provision on counterrevolutionary crime in its Criminal Law and replacing it with some definitions of various crimes. Could you verify such a change? In addition, do your legislators have plans to discuss this matter? [Zhou] The counterrevolutionary crime stipulated in China's Criminal Law refers to crimes endangering state security. In any country in the world, crimes that endanger state security have to be punished. [XINHUA correspondent] How will quickening legislative work advance China's market economy? [Zhou] In accordance with China's Constitution, in the past year, the NPC Standing Committee has made legislative work, especially economic-related legislative work, a priority. Excluding the Constitutional amendment bill and the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region, adopted at the First Session of the Eighth NPC, the NPC Standing Committee has enacted or revised 19 laws, of which 12 concern the establishment of a socialist market economic system. These laws include the Corporate Law, Agriculture Law, Individual Income Tax Law, the Law Against Unfair Competition, the Quality Law, the Law on Protecting the Rights and Interests of Consumers, and so on. Last year, the number of laws passed by the NPC Standing Committee broke all previous records. I can tell you all that the Standing Committee has initially examined two important laws, the Budget Law and the Securities Law. During its eighth term, the NPC Standing Committee will fully implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, will quicken the legislative process, and will endeavor to complete the better part of the legal framework for the socialist market economy under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, under the guidance of the party's basic line and on the basis of the Constitution. Moreover, it will continue to establish and improve the legal systems in other areas. During its eighth term, the NPC Standing Committee plans to pass 152 laws, 53 of which deal with the socialist market economy. I can tell you all that from 1949 to 1992, the NPC and its Standing Committees passed a total of 170 laws. Enacting 152 laws during the eighth term of the NPC Standing Committee -- this is indeed an important and glorious task. [Unidentified correspondent] The NPC has just passed the "Law on the Protection of Investments by Taiwan Compatriots." At present, many Taiwan businessmen believe that this law is insufficient. Therefore, they have been voicing their hope that the two sides will sign an investment protection agreement. What is the view of the NPC regarding this issue? [Zhou] Investments on the mainland by Taiwan compatriots are a special kind of domestic investment. Therefore, protection of the investment rights and interests of Taiwanese compatriots can only be realized through a domestic law. [words indistinct] the issue of investment protection agreement. Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. The relationship between the central government and the Taiwan authorities is one between the central government and a local authority. It is out of the question that the two sides may sign any agreement. [Unidentified correspondent] NPC deputies from the Hong Kong region and those from the Guangdong region have jointly submitted a motion demanding that a special clean government work committee be set up under the NPC Standing Committee. They feel that such a committee under the NPC Standing Committee will strengthen the Chinese Government's work against corruption. Moreover, it will enhance the NPC's status. What is the view of the NPC on this motion? [Zhou] You have just mentioned that some Hong Kong deputies have suggested that a clean government work committee be set up under the NPC Standing Committee. According to the provisions of relevant laws, any people's deputies are entitled to make suggestions and submit motions, but examinations and approval must be done in accordance with legal procedures. As for the struggle against corruption, we will continue it on a long-term basis and will strive to achieve still greater results. Therefore, as the Hong Kong deputies have submitted some good suggestions or motions, they will certainly be welcomed. [Unidentified correspondent] This year China will introduce more measures to reform enterprises. The workers have become more concerned about their work prospects this year. Does the NPC have any plan to make laws to protect workers' rights and interests this year? [Zhou] Regarding the law on the protection of the working class's rights and interests, China has enacted the Trade Union Law. In this law there are explicit provisions on protecting workers' rights and interests. We have also passed the Labor Law. This is an important law to protect workers' rights and interests. [Moderator] Today's news briefing is now concluded. Thank you.
