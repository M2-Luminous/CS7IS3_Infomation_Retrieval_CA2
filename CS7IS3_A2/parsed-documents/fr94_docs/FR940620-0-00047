FR940620-0-00047 FR940620-0-00015 33 CFR Part 165 [CGD01&hyph;94&hyph;060] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone; Edward Arrigoni Fireworks, East River, NY AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone for a fireworks program located in the East River. This event will take place on June 24, 1994, from 10:30 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. and will close all waters of the East River within a 300 yard radius of two fireworks barges anchored together approximately 300 yards off of East 30th Street, Manhattan, New York. This safety zone will preclude vessel traffic from transiting a portion of the East River and is needed to protect the boating public from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective from 10:30 p.m. until 11:30 p.m. on June 24, 1994, unless terminated sooner by the Captain of the Port, New York. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LT R. Trabocchi, Project Manager, Captain of the Port, New York (212) 668&hyph;7933. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The drafters of this notice are LT R. Trabocchi, Project Manager, Captain of the Port, New York and CDR J. Astley, Project Attorney, First Coast Guard District, Legal Office. Regulatory History Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for not publishing an NPRM as well as making it effective less than 30 days after Federal Register Publication. Due to the date this application was received, there was insufficient time to draft and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking that allows for a reasonable comment period prior to the event. There was also insufficient time for publication of this temporary final rule 30 days prior to the event. The delay encountered if normal rulemaking procedures were followed would effectively cancel this event. Cancellation of this event is contrary to public interest. Background and Purpose Mary Jane Voute submitted an application to hold a fireworks program in the East River off of 30th Street, Manhattan, New York. This regulation establishes a temporary safety zone in all waters of the East River within a 300 yard radius of two fireworks barges anchored together approximately 300 yards off of East 30th Street, Manhattan, New York, at or near 40 ○44 ’19 ’ ’N latitude and 073 ○58 ’09 ’ ’W longitude. This safety zone will preclude vessel traffic from transiting a portion of the East River and is needed to protect the boating public from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding in the area. Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. No vessel traffic will be permitted to transit the East River within a 300 yard radius of two fireworks barges anchored together approximately 300 yards off of East 30th Street, Manhattan, at any time this safety zone is in effect. Although there is a regular flow of traffic through this area, there is not likely to be a significant impact on recreational or commercial traffic for several reasons. Due to the limited duration of the event, the late hour of the event, the extensive, advance advisories that will be made to the maritime community, and that traffic can safely transit to the east of this safety zone, the impact of this regulation is expected to be minimal. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons set forth in the above Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
