Ministers have compared the dreadful impact of the incident with similar incidents in the past, such as the Dayr al-Yasin massacre. There will be two main issues on tomorrow's cabinet's agenda: immediate action to be taken against the hard-core of the extreme settlers in Hebron and Qiryat Arba', and finding a long-term formula in response to the international pressure focused on Israel. In this context, setting up a state commission of inquiry to investigate yesterday morning's incidents in the Cave of the Patriarchs is under discussion. According to the justice minister and the attorney general, these two issues are fully covered by state laws, emergency regulations, and legislation applying to the territories. As for the immediate moves against what is called the Brooklyn gang and its Israeli supporters -- all from the school of Rabbi Kahana -- the steps discussed are: distancing them from the territories; deporting them; preventing their presence in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza; and applying administrative detentions. The authorities will deal with familiar individuals, whose names and places of residence are known. All the cabinet ministers agree on those steps, some even expect them to be taken within hours. In the session tomorrow, they will be briefed about action taken. As for the closure on Qiryat Arba', several ministers urged clamping a curfew on Qiryat Arba', and not to settle for a closure. Observing closure is not very problematic on a Sabbath. The question is what will happen at the end of it, this evening and tomorrow morning. Most of the ministers made determined and clear remarks today on this issues as well. The principle theme is to prevent friction between Jews and Arabs in Hebron for fear of revenge. Currently, not all the ministers agree on establishing a state commission of inquiry. Until this time, and in yesterday's cabinet session, the prime minister has not taken a stand on this issue. Justice Minister David Liba'i is leading the move to set up the inquiry team. It is the duty of the Government of Israel to document the massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs; from the historic point of view, there is no other way, those favoring the move have said. The government should not allow a situation in which such a commission is set up in response to public or international pressure. It should be initiated by the government. Ministers in opposition to this move have said that Israel is not concealing the facts. Everything that had happened in Hebron was initiated by a single person. Punitive measures taken by the security forces, will add to the understanding that the State of Israel is handling the Hebron incident without hiding anything. There is no intention to disarm the settlers. The ministers have rejected this outright. Another issue the government will be briefed about is the release of the Palestinian prisoners. Jerusalem sources said this morning that this issue has been agreed on in talks with the PLO, regardless of the Hebron incident. According to the sources, the incident will probably speed up the process. [In a recorded passage later in the same newscast, Faysal al-Husayni says in English: "If the Israelis are going on thinking that in the interim period there will be a possibility of leaving the settlers on the ground and keeping their army to protect the settlers, as they are saying, it is nonsense."] [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 26 February adds: "Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu today warned against the government readiness to make far-reaching concessions to the Palestinians because it is under pressure." The report adds that "Netanyahu stressed that he opposes taking unjustified steps against the settlers who constantly suffer from the Arab terror."
