Although the source did not deny nor confirm the news to AFP, its reporters were able to confirm that the Construccion, Barinas, Maracaibo, La Guaira, Metropolitano, Bancor, Hipotecario de Occidente banks and the Sociedad Financiera Fiveca remained closed today. Despite the fact that the banks were closed, their employees were working while hundreds of customers protested at the doors.
