"Last year, when the local elections law and the law on foreigners were discussed in Estonia, Stoel visited Narva as a political tourist and met there mainly with the leader of the League of Russian Citizens, Yuri Mishin, and former City Council chairman Vladimir Chuikin. Stoel then conveyed their opinions on to the West," the MP [member of parliament] said in an interview with BNS. Made said it was inadmissible that the CSCE ethnic minorities high commissioner again met with Mishin and Chuikin during his Tuesday's [22 February] trip to Narva. "Now when Chuikin is a departmental head at Narva Furniture Factory there is no need for Stoel to meet with him officially and discuss Russian affairs. Stoel can do this in his private capacity if he so wishes," Made said. Van der Stoel himself said his meetings with Mishin and Chuikin were "aimed at getting information from all representatives of the Russian-speaking population." "This is my task," he said in a press conference. Made in his comments said Van der Stoel had been "simply unable to say anything else in justification." Made says the Estonian Government must give up "bending to Max van der Stoel and responding to his wishes." He said the government should "restrict interference by the High Commissioner into the internal life of Estonia and his representing the interests of Russian residents in the CSCE."
