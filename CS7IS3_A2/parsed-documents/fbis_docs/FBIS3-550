[Begin recording] [Ouattara] The only way to make an Army combat-ready is to test it regularly on the field. For this reason, Ivorian troops and units of the French Army have been carrying out military maneuvers. The operation, codenamed Nzi 94, has a number of objectives: It is one of many implementations of the defense accord linking Cote d'Ivoire to France since the dawn of our independence; it is also to train the general staffs in the joint preparation and conduct of operations; and finally, it gives the troops a chance to operate together and to organize the implementation of a unified French-Ivorian command for operations in time of need. For these military exercises of national importance, after a 10-year hiatus, the chief of defense staff of the Armed Forces of Cote d'Ivoire [FANCI], General Robert Guei, has set very precise goals for his men: to train the general staff to function within a tactical framework; to test the aptitude of military units to rural life and parachuting operations; and to utilize the know-how of signal officers to integrate them in the inter-allies command structure and maneuver network. On the first day, we witnessed the parachute operation undertaken together by Ivorian and French parachutists. This operation took place under very good conditions. [Guei] I am happy that everything went smoothly. Our French brothers-in-arms have just had a 10-hour flight and joined in the thick of the operations. You have witnessed the demonstrations. They were very well equipped; the French command was keen to put them in extremely difficult conditions. In the battlefield, nothing is left to chance, and when you leave things to chance the enemy will not spare you. This is why they have come fully prepared. I wish you all the best. [Unidentified French commander] The parachute operation we have watched, undertaken by French and Ivorian parachutists, was carried out under very good operational conditions; and I am talking as a former commander of the 11th Parachute Division. These were difficult conditions because the terrain is not easy and it is hot, but this enables us to test our joint capacity for a common engagement. And I think that is what is important. For me, the operation has been positive. [passage omitted] [Ouattara] The crossing of the Zambaco bridge enabled the battalion of the Bouake Engineers Regiment to test its light crossing equipment. Their performance no longer requires any further demonstration. The naval exercise took place on the Rhin, a French TSM mobile support vessel, originally intended to maintain the different units of the French fleet in operational condition. The Rhin was built on 24 April 1961, launched on 17 March 1962, and has been in service since 1 March 1964. It has a crew of 11 officers and 67 naval officers. During the exercise, three French Mirage F-16 planes, shot at a floating object which was pulling along behind the Rhin. Between an Ivorian patrol boat, the Elephant of the Ivorian Navy, and the Rhin, shooting exercises and mail transfer took place. During air support and tactical exercises, which Defense Minister Leon Konan Koffi witnessed, troops engaged in mock confrotations and war games. [passage omitted] [Koffi] We are here to witness the confrontation between enemy troops and our soldiers and we have seen that despite a few technical radio problems the operation was carried out under very good conditions. Our forces succeeded in dislodging the enemy forces. I am happy to have witnessed this operation. [Ouattara] There was a big surprise at the end of this maneuver. On behalf of the Higher Council of the FANCI, General Robert Guei, the chief of staff, conferred on Minister of Defense Leon Konan Koffi the rank of honorary sub-lieutenant for his services to the nation.
