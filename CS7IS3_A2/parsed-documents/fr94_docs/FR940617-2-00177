FR940617-2-00177 FR940617-2-00097 6. The Board of each Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the Plans complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any fee for services charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the Board to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the Independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 7. Dividends and other distributions paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends and other distributions are paid, will be declared and paid on the same day and at the same time, and will be determined in the same manner and will be in the same amount, except that the amount of the dividends and other distributions declared and paid by a particular class may be different from that of another class because Plan Payments made by a class under a Plan and other Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class. 8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and other distributions of the classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report to the Board of the Trust, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations would be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon written request to the Funds for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or a Regional office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate or Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on ``policies and procedures placed in operation'' in accordance with Statements on Auditing Standards (``SAS'') No. 70, ``Reports on the Processing of Transactions by Service Organizations'' of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''). Ongoing reports will be reports on ``policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' prepared in accordance with SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and other distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition 8 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 8 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective action if the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing reports. 10. If any class of shares is distributed by a principal underwriter, the prospectus of such Fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing shares of a Fund may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Fund. 11. If any class of shares is distributed by a principal underwriter, the Trust will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of a Fund to agree to conform to such standards. 12. The conditions pursuant to which the amended exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Board of the Trust with respect to the Multiple Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the Trustees. 13. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares, other than AMR Class shares, in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. AMR Class shares will be offered solely pursuant to a separate prospectus. The prospectus for the AMR class shares will disclose the existence of the Funds' other classes, and the prospectus for the Funds' other classes will disclose the existence of the AMR Class shares and will identify the investors eligible to purchase AMR Class shares. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares, except AMR Class shares. Advertising materials reflecting the expenses or performance data for AMR Class shares will be available only to those persons eligible to purchase such shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value and public offering price will present each class of shares separately. The Funds need not provide such information with respect to the AMR Class shares; however, to the extent that a Fund chooses to do so, the net asset value or public offering price of AMR Class shares also will be presented separately. 14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the amended exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC approval of, authorization of, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that any Fund may make pursuant to a Plan in reliance on the amended exemptive order. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
