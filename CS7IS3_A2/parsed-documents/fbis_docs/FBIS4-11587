FBIS4-11587 "drlat083_i_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-083 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Nicaragua Replacement Chosen for General Ortega Replacement Chosen for General Ortega PA2804194194 Managua Radio Corporacion in Spanish 1330 GMT 28 Apr 94 PA2804194194 Managua Radio Corporacion Spanish BFN [From the "Trench" newscast] [Text] General Humberto Ortega's replacement is ready. Sources close to the Presidential House have learned Major Gen. Joaquin Cuadra Lacayo will be promoted to lieutenant general of the Sandinist Army. He will be the highest-ranking officer in the country, second only to the general [Humberto Ortega], of course, who does not allow anyone to be his equal. Sources very close to the Presidential House have leaked that President Violeta Barrios will announce, any moment now, the promotion of Major Gen. Joaquin Cuadra Lacayo to lieutenant general. Mrs. Barrios, as supreme commander of the Armed Forces and defense minister, has the constitutional power to grant this promotion, thus making Cuadra Lacayo the second highest-ranking officer, second to Humberto Ortega, who does not allow any officer to become his equal; that would be disrespectful. It is believed this appointment represents a message to the U.S. Government about the changes Mrs. Barrios is making to the image of her country and government. Many see this as a maneuver that is taking place with the concurrence of Humberto Ortega, of course, who has just said at the Olof Palme Convention Center that anyone trying to change the correlation of forces would provoke further destabilization, which could lead to a new Nicaraguan civil war.
