The same source added that the three Arab states can ensure indirect dialogue between northern and southern Yemenis and that they have played a mediatory role since the beginning of the crisis in Yemen. The source said this mediation aimed at safeguarding Yemen unity without using force. The same source said these three Arab states will ask the northerners to agree on a cease-fire in exchange for canceling the southerners' unilateral declaration of independence. Sanaa took this clear U.S. stand seriously. In the wake of this U.S. stand, Yemeni Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani announced that the government in Sanaa is holding contacts with some Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders to agree on holding a dialogue. Al-Iryani, who is close to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, added that his government is ready for a cease-fire in exchange for YSP's recognition of Yemen unity, which was declared in May 1990 and which has been abandoned by the southerners. Al-Iryani said: Following the secession decision, we cannot deal, hold a dialogue with, or find a place in politics for YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim al-Bid or Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, who was charged with forming the government of the new southern state. The second factor which could have influenced the Sanaa decision is Aden's reiteration today that the southern forces have regained the combat initiative from northern forces that had infiltrated over the past three weeks of the fighting. [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, who reiterated the northern forces' control over Abyan, Lahij, and Shabwah Governorates, today admitted that the objective of entering Aden by all means, which was announced by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, no longer exists. He said: There might not be a need to enter Aden, as the political solution could be reached before this. The northern minister said the Sanaa forces are maintaining their positions on the eastern front, adding that the northern forces are now preparing supply bases before moving to the east toward Hadhramaut, where al-Bid has moved.
