N. Gromov, arrived here today on a first-ever visit by a Russian naval chief. The issue of ensuring regular supply of spares for the Indian navy figures prominently during discussions between the Indian and the Russian naval chiefs, at which, matters relating to mutual interest and cooperation also figured. As is also true in the case of the Indian air force and the army, the Indian navy too has been facing problems in receiving regular supply of spare parts. The bulk of the Indian navy, about 70 per cent, comprises ships, submarines and other equipment from the erstwhile Soviet Union. This includes 16 submarines and missile boats each, and four destroyers and corvettes each.
