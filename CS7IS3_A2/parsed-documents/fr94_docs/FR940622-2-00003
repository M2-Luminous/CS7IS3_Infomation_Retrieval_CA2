FR940622-2-00003 FR940622-2-00002 [Docket A(27f)&hyph;12&hyph;94] Foreign-Trade Zone 137_Washington Dulles International Airport, Virginia; Request for Boundary Modification The Washington Dulles Foreign-Trade Zone, Inc., grantee of FTZ 137, has made a request to the Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZ) Board for a minor modification of the boundary of FTZ 137 pursuant to ยง400.27(f) of the FTZ Board regulations (15 CFR Part 400). The grantee is requesting authority to include within the zone project a privately owned public warehouse facility on a 3-acre parcel located at 110 Terminal Drive, Sterling, Virginia, within the Dulles Airport Corridor area, some 2 miles from the airport. In exchange, zone status would be relinquished on a parcel (3 acres) located within the boundary of the existing zone on the airport complex. The warehouse is operated by Victory Van Corporation, which would offer zone services as part of its public warehousing operation. No authority is requested for manufacturing or processing activity. The purpose of the change is to provide improved zone public warehousing services in the airport area while the grantee considers revisions to its longer-term zone plan. Public comment on the request is invited from interested parties. Submissions shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is July 8, 1994. A copy of the request will be available for public inspection at the following location: Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3716, 14th & Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. Dated: June 10, 1994. John J. Da Ponte, Jr., Executive Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15174 Filed 6&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS-P
