According to government provisional figures, 54,000 local residents left Hong Kong for overseas last year, putting the emigration figure below 60,000 for the first time in more than four years. "The largest factor in the drop was the relatively poor economies of the most popular destination countries," said Acting Deputy Secretary for Security Keith Kwok. On the contrary, he added, "the Hong Kong economy is still developing and growing while some who have emigrated have found it difficult to find work abroad." Statistics showed only 5,925 were able to emigrate to Australia from July 1992 to July 1993, down from 13,000 between July 1991 to July 1992. There was also a decrease in the number of people emigrating to the United States: 13,142 in 1993 against 14,882 in 1992. But emigration to Canada rose to 31,200 in 1993 from 29,900 in 1992. Over the past few years, Canada, the United States and Australia were regarded as the favorite destinations of 90 percent of Hong Kong emigrants. Most of those leaving the territory were young professionals, 30 to 40 years old.
