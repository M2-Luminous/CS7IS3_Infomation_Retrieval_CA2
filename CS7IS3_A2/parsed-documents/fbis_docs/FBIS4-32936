First, I want to remind our listeners that this will be the fourth time that chiefs of state and government from Latin America, Spain, and Portugal have met. They will meet without having been called upon by the United States and without the presence of its representatives to discuss matters of interest to our countries. Meetings like these used to be organized by the U.S. Administration. It is still clear in my memory the image of one of the latest calls for a meeting of Latin American presidents or chiefs of state held, I believe, in Panama before the revolution. I remember Fulgencio Batista, with his greasy long hair and brand new jean suit, following the traditional fashion among leaders of the political chicanery. Batista, a legion of dictators, and grandchildren of the Americans themselves were present. Today's summits are quite different from yesterday's summits. Meeting with Spain and Portugal without Americans present is somewhat of a new thing. Three Ibero-American summits were held in this manner, namely in Brazil, Spain, and Mexico. The fourth will be held in Colombia. Presidents of different political tendencies have attended these summits, but there has always been mutual respect and consensus on matters which are vital for our peoples. Fidel's words and presence have always been present at those summits. The latest summit approved a virtual sanction on the U.S. blockade against Cuba, surely an exceptional achievement. It seems these four summits have been too much for this great northern country, which has decided to sponsor a similar summit. I mean similar but not equal. I mean similar because it is also a summit of chiefs of government, and I say that it will not be equal because Cuba will not be present. The U.S. summit will be held in Miami in December, while the summit that will be held by the Ibero-American nations will discuss, to a great extent, integration. As I said, Cuba will try to promote this integration because this unity is vital in our current world. I want to remind everyone that integration means more unity, especially in the economic field. We will produce for the continent using raw material from the continent, and we will trade among ourselves. Latin America, Spain, and Portugal comprise such a large territory where there are all types of climates, all productions, and all resources. What one country lacks can be found in another, or vice versa. So, there should be no artificial borders capable of hampering this common flow. I said there should not be, but there are artificial borders, namely those imposed by the interests of the Americans which are owners of half of the continent and who are against these integrationist ties because they are not good for them. This is why they have not been invited for the previous Ibero-American summits because our language is very different. And now they are making up their little meeting in Miami, as if it were a consolation tournament, out of spite because they were not invited to the previous summits. All countries of the continent will be represented in Miami, but not Cuba, as the strange maps of the Caribbean which are currently made by the transnational companies, maps where Cuba or our archipelago are not present. But one thing is true: Although we are not on their little maps, Cuba and the Cubans do exist, live, work, and fight. We might be blockaded, but we have our own voice, out of tune, of course, with the U.S. appetites. Perhaps for this reason, we are not invited to that little party in Miami because they do not want to hear our voice live.
