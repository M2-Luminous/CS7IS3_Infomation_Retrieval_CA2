Behind the success was a major general who learned those plans and tactics by heart and knew how to deal with those who tried to implement them. As a punishment for his competence, he was assassinated five days after the killing of 'Adil 'Awad. Only a few people knew that Major General Ra'uf Khayrat was the unknown man behind many of the State Security strikes. [passage omitted] The biggest beneficiary [from Khayrat's killing] are the Muslim Brotherhood members, who described the assassination as the most holy operation since the assassination of President al-Sadat. We will not be surprised by this if we know that Major General Khayrat was among the keenest watchers of the Muslim Brotherhood activities. He considered the group, lying dormant until the right moment comes, to be responsible for much of what is happening in Egypt. Khayrat, a former aid of Major General Fu'ad 'Allam, is of the latter's school, which does not distinguish between a moderate extremist and a non-moderate extremist. He believed the Muslim Brotherhood is still very active, with its secret branches and its members ready for the moment when weapons can be brought out, especially since the organization has open channels to the outside world. That only a few people knew this fact explains why the Muslim Brotherhood members were happy at the murder of Ra'uf Khayrat, who never took his eyes off them. A few days after the incident, the extremist Islamic Group began talking once again about mediation, but this time with the support of the Muslim Brotherhood, and under a program that included several points: --Granting the Muslim Brotherhood and the extremist groups the right to go public. --Stopping military trials and arranging retrials of cases in which death sentences were passed. --Releasing all detainees. --Revoking the order to arrest 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman. --Stopping security pursuits against Islamic Group members. This time, the mediation proposal was carried by lawyer Muntasir al-Zayyat, and it is said that Mukhtar Nuh, his Muslim Brotherhood "counterpart" lawyer, will join him, along with 'Isam al-'Aryan, Fahmi Huwaydi, and leftist lawyer Nabil al-Hilali. But lawyer Muntasir al-Zayyat denied any knowledge of this. He said: "Any media coverage of the mediation will spoil it. There should be no talk about any efforts until results are attained." He explained his proposals at the lawyers congress as a "personal view of how to get out of the dark tunnel." In return, the interior minister, at his press conference, denied any secret contacts and said: "We will not negotiate with killers and criminals." When a source from the extremist groups was told that a desire for mediation reflects weakness, the source replied: "Even if this is true, we must realize that this is only a phase, after which the brothers will continue their activity. If the request for mediation is understood as a truce, then so be it." So, it is indeed an attempt to reach a truce, and it is also an attempt to recoup from the blow to the major plan worked out by 'Adil 'Awad's organization, especially since the killing of Ra'uf Khayrat failed to cause the needed confusion.
