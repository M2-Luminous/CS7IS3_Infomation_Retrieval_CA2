New Approaches to Reforming Russia's Tax System." This was the title of the article in the weekly supplement to DM [DELOVOY MIR] of 17-23 January of this year. A number of pieces in later issues of the newspaper were devoted to the need for tax reform and its possible variants. Today the managing director of the ecological-economic research area of the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of Problems of the Market, Professor Konstantin Gofman, continues the topic. Russia is in the throes of both an economic and an ecological crisis. Is a simultaneous and mutually linked approach to solving this situation realistic or, on the contrary, should the country's ecological normalization be postponed "until better times" and all efforts be thrown into economic revival? The questions are by no means idle ones. The experience of Russian reforms shows that ecological priorities in our country are secondary not only in terms of their "official" status, but even in public awareness. The warnings of ecologists remain voices crying in the wilderness. Yes, it would seem, that is true: should we care about them now? Is it perhaps actually more sensible first to feed people (even with contaminated food and water) and activate the mechanisms of "market prosperity," and only then "readjust" them in the interests of protecting the environment? It is not without reason that among ecologists in rich countries the saying is common that "poverty is the chief polluter." This problem is by no means a simple one, and there can be no simple solutions which are to be adopted. Voices are now being raised (including in DELOVOY MIR) in favor of tax reform. I am certain: this is precisely the lever which will link the needs for financial stabilization and market liberalization of the economy with the requirements of ecological normalization. But something else is also clear: this reform cannot be done in one stroke. We need a long-term program of ecologization of the tax system; that is to say, its by-stage restructuring in the following basic directions: - gradually increasing the role of taxes on the use of the natural resource potential in all tax revenue in the budgets of the subjects of the Federation and local budgets; - expanding the base of natural resource taxation by introducing taxes on using the so-called assimilation potential of the environment; - introducing excise-type ecological taxes on goods and services whose consumption involves higher ecological risk; - expanding tax benefits for enterprises and organizations incorporating production of ecologically safe items or employing closed (low-waste) technological processes, as well as for physical and legal entities located in ecological disaster zones and in ecological crisis situations; - restricting direct and indirect subsidization of types of economic activity which are natural resource intensive and dangerous to the environment. Taxation can be ecologized without reducing total revenue in the country's financial system, but it requires planned redistribution of the tax burden among participants in financial relations taking into account the tasks of economic stabilization and the social, ecological, and political priorities of society in conditions of the transition period. A reduction in taxes on labor and capital, announced in advance and carried out in stages, with a concurrent increase in the scope of natural resource taxation will stimulate structural reorganization of the economy to reduce its natural resource intensity. Rental Income's Route into the Budget: Direct or Indirect? At present the role of the tax on land and other natural resources in the state's aggregate tax income is negligible. In itself this circumstance certainly does not mean that most rental income from nature use remains at the disposal of owners or users of natural wealth. The socialization of rental income, that is to say, its accumulation in state and local budgets through the tax system, can be carried out on one scale or another even without a direct tax on nature use--through taxation of income of nature users and buyers of their output (progressive taxes on personal income and profit, excise taxes, and the like). But here rental income seems to lose its identity and mix with other income in the "common pot" of the state budget and as part of the income of taxpayers themselves after they pay taxes. However, the method of socialization of rental income--as a direct tax (payment) for nature use or through taxation of income of nature users and consumers of their output--has a definite effect on the ecological character of taxpayers' economic decisions and ultimately on the nature of society's socioeconomic development. The greater the extent to which state income is formed through land tax (in the broad sense, that is, taxes generally on natural resources) while correspondingly reducing taxation of labor and capital, the stronger the economic stimuli for developing production will be. In addition, turning land rental into the main source for financing social (state) expenditures complies with the principles of social justice, since land as nature's gift is the property of the nation rather than the product of labor and capital. Of no small importance is the fact that taxation of land leaves many fewer opportunities for tax evasion than taxation of personal income and entrepreneurial profit. And finally, the last but not the least important argument in favor of changing over to predominant taxation of natural resource potential. Such a change would mean increasing economic stimuli for full and comprehensive use of natural wealth, since nature-conservative investments of labor and capital would be relatively cheaper for entrepreneurs. The Main Difficulty What is holding things up? Why not change over, and soon, to the direct method of withdrawing rent into the budget? There are in my opinion profound reasons which rule out the possibility of transferring the focus in taxation to natural resource potential all at once. Introducing a high tax on the use of land and other types of natural resources while correspondingly reducing other types of taxation would be a "neutral" measure in relation to the budget and taxpayers. But only on one condition--if the natural resource intensity of the economic activity of taxpayers was even roughly the same for everyone. But in reality indicators of land use intensity, water consumption intensity, and volume of harmful discharges calculated per cost unit of output produced and so forth differ among various enterprises (depending on their sectorial affiliation, technologies used, and the quality of the fuel and raw materials used) by factors of 10's and 100's. That can be seen in the following table. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Differences in the Water Consumption and Ecological Stress Created by Harm-| |ful Discharges into the Atmosphere and Water Sources, calculated per unit | |of gross output* | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sectors Consuming |Water Consumption |Ecological Stress from Discharges | |Fresh Water |Intensity | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |into the Atmosphe-|into Water Sources| | | |re | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ferrous Metallurgy|0.10 |0.47 |0.45 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nonferrous Metall-|0.07 |0.45 |0.05 | |urgy | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Oil and Gas Sector|0.10 |0.28 |0.08 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Coal Sector |0.12 |0.98 |0.85 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Electricity Produ-|1.00 |1.00 |1.00 | |ction | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chemical Sector |0.05 |0.34 |0.26 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Building Material-|0.02 |0.93 |0.36 | |s Sector | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |*The electricity production sector's indicators are expressed as 1. | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The table cites certain data which characterize the scope of this differentiation broken down by aggregated sectors of the multisectorial balance of the former USSR. It is obvious that the gaps in natural resource intensity will rise many times over when changing from the sectorial level to the level of specific taxpayer enterprises. For now payment for use of the natural resource potential has little impact on the economy of enterprises, and differences in their natural resource intensity are largely nullified; while taxation, especially in the form of value-added tax, maintains the established proportions of distribution of national income. The situation changes fundamentally with the transition to taxation of natural resource potential. The disparity in the tax burden which reflects the disparity in the natural resource intensity of economic activity will in the long run undoubtedly prompt taxpayers to cut back natural resource intensive production facilities or reduce their natural resource intensity. But a "shock" transfer, all at once, of the focus of taxation to natural resource potential, that is to say, establishment of a single payment rate for land and other natural resources of the particular quality and location for everyone, would inevitably result in the emergence of enormous disproportions in the withdrawal of income from enterprises with differing levels of natural resource intensity. It is for that reason that a transfer all at once to taxation of natural resource potential while reducing other types of taxation accordingly could lead to an economic "collapse" of economic systems which in terms of its negative consequences would exceed all the well-known results of the "shock" effect on socioeconomic processes. The natural resource system of taxation is incompatible with the "nonecologized" economic structure of contemporary production and consumption oriented to the relative cheapness and availability of natural wealth. It Is for the Regions To Decide There is an important restraint on the development of natural resource taxation in the particular conditions of the Russian Federation. The receipt into the federal budget of rental income from using natural resource potential accumulated in the tax on land and other natural resources will to all appearances meet opposition from the subjects of the Federation and even provoke separatist tendencies. Consequently taxes not directly related to nature use, above all taxes on income of physical and legal entities collected at rates which are the same for the entire country, must maintain their significance as the main source of income of the federal budget. In contrast, revenue from taxes for using the natural resource potential of the corresponding territories must predominate in the income of the budgets of the subjects of the Federation and local budgets. For at least two-three years into the future, large-scale ecologically positive changes cannot be expected in the sectorial, technological, and territorial structure of economic activity. It is hardly possible within this time to fundamentally increase financing of nature protection activity from budget system capital. In these conditions a by-stage redistribution of tax pressure on enterprises seems realistic: a reduction for ecologically safe types of activity and an increase for natural resource intensive ones. Until a market for the right to land use (land ownership and rental) is formed through a system of sale auctions of this right, it would be wise to grant the subjects of the Federation the right to determine the yearly estimated value of land for the purposes of taxation. As rough estimates show, if taxation of profit is limited exclusively by the needs of the federal budget, the tax rate on profit could be reduced to one-third of the present level. And here the amount of the land tax would be increased roughly 12-fold as compared with the existing level. But of course the transition to such an assessment of land (as was said, specifically for the purposes of taxation) will not replace forming a mechanism for its market appraisal through the development of purchase and sale, security, and rental of rights to land use, but it may become the transitional link in bringing today's almost symbolic land tax rates closer to the market value of agricultural and especially urban land. The method of taxation itself is important here, in a percentage of the appraisal of the land rather than in fixed rates per unit of area. In principle this protects tax revenue from inflationary depreciation better. The Problem of Appraisal The enormous organizational-technical complications of the practical realization of this concept must certainly be taken into account. The concept presupposes a regular reappraisal of land and other taxable natural resources as often as possible, necessarily excluding from this appraisal the market value of the real estate objects existing on it (the "pre-improvement" value of the land parcel) as well as rental income from capital investments which raise the long-term economic potential of the object of taxation (investments in prospecting for and exploring mineral deposits, in long-term improvement of agricultural land, in the engineering and social infrastructure of urban territories, and so forth). All rental income of this type (according to Marxist terminology, differential rent II) is income from capital rather than from land as such, and therefore may be excluded from the tax base when the land tax is calculated. Even if all the methodological difficulties related to computing the "pre-improvement" value of land parcels are considered surmountable, it is obvious that the corresponding appraisal work will hardly keep pace with the constant and fairly rapid (as world experience shows) rise in the value of land and other natural wealth. Consequently the need for additional regulatory taxes on the profit of nature users, on the sale of land, on security transactions with land parcels, and the like will remain. Information generated by the land market is essential in order to accurately determine the value of land as an object of taxation. The trouble is that when differential rent I is completely taken from land users, the land market is inevitably transformed into a real estate market for land and ceases to generate information on the pre-improvement value of land parcels. Therefore, back in the early stages of the evolution of land taxation, there must be intensive development of land appraisal work oriented not only to the needs of city planning and agricultural land management (which was characteristic of the centralized economy), but also for the purposes of the formation, functioning, and tax regulation of the land market as part of the real estate market. This is a field of resource appraisal work which is fundamentally new to our country, and it is in dire need of scientific methods support and basic interdisciplinary research. As for enterprises of the mining sectors, here the strategic direction should be a transition from a multitude of taxation systems (excise taxes, payments for the right to use the earth's interior, and deductions for reproduction of the mineral-raw material base) to a system of unified territorial taxes on the extraction of minerals. The object of taxation should be the usable volume of balance reserves of fuel and raw materials, rather than only the volume of saleable output as it is now. Then losses and expenditures for inhouse needs as well as the amount of reserves of minerals allotted to enterprises will be "reckoned in." Tax rates should be set in percentages of the value of the tax base in current prices with a differentiation depending on the geological-economic conditions of extraction. In this case, the amount of the tax on the extraction of minerals will depend on three basic factors: 1) the level of prices for output being extracted, 2) the degree of completeness and intensiveness of the use of reserves, and 3) differences in the geological-economic conditions of extraction. This taxation procedure will encourage conservation of mineral reserves, which is extremely timely for enterprises working in favorable geological-economic conditions and at the same time ensures more complete accumulation of rental income in territorial budgets. The Payment for Pollution Since the late 1980's, Russia has been forming a unique system, with virtually nothing like it in world practice, of payments by enterprises of all forms of ownership for the discharge (run-off) of pollutants into the atmosphere and water sources and for waste disposal. Formed at the same time was a system of state nonbudget ecology funds whose basic source of capital was the payment for pollution. Analysis of the results of the practical application of this system in 1992-1993 shows that the fiscal function of payments is being performed relatively successfully overall. Thanks to the creation of conditions for financing protection of the environment from the capital of nonbudget ecology funds, independent of the budget, this sphere suffered to a lesser degree from the investment "cave-in" of 1992. While the total volume of investments in the economy declined by 45 percent in 1992, capital investments in environmental protection from all sources of financing dropped by only 20 percent. To a considerable degree the practice of exempting enterprises from payments for pollution based on the amount of capital they used to finance their own capital investments in environmental protection helped achieve this. This system must be improved by raising its incentive value. From the editorial office: The number of Russian cities declared ecological disaster zones is constantly rising. This is the topic of the article by the DM columnist, Lyudmila Biryukova, "The Sword of Damocles Has Gone into Action," published on pp 30-31. [Box No 1] The subject of this article is essentially not just taxes. It is rather the transition from the "well-traveled" but dead-end road to a fundamentally new type of socioeconomic development. The difficulties of the transition are obvious. Unfortunately, as fundamental decisions are put off and palliatives are substituted, these difficulties merely intensify. In both cases society must pass between the Scylla of the socioeconomic upheavals of the transition period and the Charybdis of continuation of the old course. But it must be resolved. [Box No 2] The author warns: We need a gradual increase in the role of natural resource taxation in the formation of state income, a role programmed for the long term and legislatively fixed, rather than an "avalanche" of restructuring of tax revenue all at one time...
