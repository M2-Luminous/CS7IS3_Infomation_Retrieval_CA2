SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The jaguar is currently listed as endangered from the border between the United States and Mexico southward including Mexico, Central America, and South America. In the United States the primary threat to this species is from shooting. Loss and modification of the jaguar's habitat may have also contributed to their decline. While no breeding population of the jaguar is known to survive in the U.S., the species is present in northern Mexico, and wandering individuals occasionally cross the border. Jaguars historically occurred in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and possibly, Louisiana and California. A minimum of 64 jaguars were killed in Arizona since 1900. The most recent was in 1986. A proposed rule to extend endangered status to the jaguar in the U.S., without critical habitat, was published in the Federal Register on July 13, 1994 (59 FR 35674).
