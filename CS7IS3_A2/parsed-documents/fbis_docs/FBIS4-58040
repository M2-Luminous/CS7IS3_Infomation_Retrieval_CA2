This is because America itself is facing a new move from within that centers on a demand to reestablish relations with Iraq and end the embargo. Taking part in this move are senior politicians, Congress members, researchers, and, above all, prominent businessmen. Some Congress members like Lee Hamilton, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the U.S. House of Representatives, and Senator David Banner [name as published] began to question the wisdom behind continuing the embargo. Moreover, the two most important newspapers in America; namely, THE NEW YORK TIMES and THE WASHINGTON POST, are talking in a new language about the embargo, demanding that it should be lifted because it is no longer justified and because of Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations. The dissatisfaction was not confined only to elements in both political and media quarters, but also included the economic quarter. Many U.S. companies in the sectors of agriculture, oil, and car and airplane manufacturing began to talk about their losses as a result of the embargo on Iraq. Former U.S. Congress member Mervin Dimely [name as published] noted that the losses are estimated at more than $2 billion in certain sectors. Therefore, preparations have begun to hold a conference organized by American companies in Washington in May. These companies called on the secretary of energy and secretary of commerce to attend the conference in order to discuss the negative effects of the embargo on the U.S. economy. Because the three powers in America -- the political, media, and economic powers -- are beginning to witness dissatisfaction and an inclination toward lifting the embargo, this means action against the embargo has begun in America as well as in other countries. Here we can say that these positive changes have taken place thanks to the steadfastness and sacrifices of the Iraqi people and to the greatness of their leader Saddam Husayn. Therefore, in order for these developments to reach a positive result, we must reinforce the base of steadfastness and broaden the rallying around President Saddam Husayn. We must move on all diplomatic, commercial, media, and organizational levels to cut short the time for achieving great changes.
