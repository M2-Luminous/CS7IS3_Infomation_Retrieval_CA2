The export structure is dominated by agricultural products, refined petroleum products, bauxite and other ores, and consumer goods. Russian exports to Greece: $437 million in 1992 and $479 million in 1993 (an increase of 9.6 percent). The export structure is dominated by oil, non-ferrous metals and motor vehicles. Russia's share of Greek exports was 1.3 percent in 1993, and 1.9 percent of its imports. There are already 70 large and 150 medium-sized and small Greek firms in Moscow. Their numbers are growing. A total of 20 Russian-Greek joint ventures have been established in Greece (primarily in Piraeus). * * * At the end of next week Brussels will witness the final and decisive round of Russia's talks with the European Union regarding partnership and cooperation. In connection with this Moscow attaches particular importance to the position taken by Athens, current chairman of the Union. But there appears to be no reason for concern: Greece has already announced its intention to facilitate the signing of an agreement without delay. Furthermore, Athens has decided to set an example and demonstrate that mutually advantageous cooperation with Russia is quite possible. Toward that end a business club has been established at the Greek Embassy in Moscow, with its official opening held yesterday. The Greeks make no secret of the fact that the signing of a cooperation agreement between the European Union and Russia would be a worthy prize for Greece's six-month chairmanship of the Union. And Greece's new ambassador to Moscow, Kiryakos Rodusakis, has from the very first days following his arrival a few months ago devoted particular attention to the establishment of contacts between business people in the two countries. He proposed establishing a business club in order to help his countrymen who are willing to take the risk of plunging into the tumultuous Russian market. That initiative garnered the support of approximately 20 Greek companies that have been operating in Russia for several years and have offices in Moscow. The time lag between words and actions proved short, and last Thursday the Greek Embassy was the scene of an official presentation of the business club (with the club temporarily headquartered in the embassy's commercial section). It was there that Mr. Rodusakis announced his intention to get Russian entrepreneurs who have or would like to have business ties with Greece involved in the club as well. According to the Greek ambassador, the business club's primary function is to fill the information vacuum that has thus far hampered expansion of economic relations between the two countries. Toward that end the decision was made to establish close cooperation both with the Russian authorities and with commercial structures. In addition, the club intends to provide information about prospects for business in various sectors of the economy. Priority will be given to those sectors in which the Greeks have considerable experience and strong traditions: trade, shipping, tourism, banking, insurance, construction, communications and the food industry. The club will place particular emphasis on familiarizing Greek businessmen with regions both in Russia (Siberia and the Volga region) and in the rest of the CIS (the Crimea, the Caucasus, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan) where the Greek diaspora is represented. For this summer the club has plans to sponsor the first international Greco-Russian congress on cooperation in Moscow, and also to open a joint business center in Russia's capital.
