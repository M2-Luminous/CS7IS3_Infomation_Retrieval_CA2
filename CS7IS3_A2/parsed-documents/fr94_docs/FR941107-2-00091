On May 10, 1990, the Commission accepted the Public Safety Plan for Florida (Region 9). On August 3, 1994, Region 9 submitted a proposed amendment to its plan that would, in part, revise the current channel allotments and extend the current application benchmark date. Because the proposed amendment is a major change to the Region 9 plan, the Commission is soliciting comments from the public before taking action. (See Report and Order, General Docket No. 87&hyph;112, 3 FCC Rcd 905 (1987), at paragraph 57.) Interested parties may file comments to the proposed amendment on or before December 7, 1994 and reply comments on or before December 22, 1994. Commenters should send an original and five copies of comments to the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554 and should clearly identify them as submissions to Gen. Docket 90&hyph;119 Florida-Public Safety Region 9. Questions regarding this public notice may be directed to Betty Woolford, Private Radio Bureau, (202) 632&hyph;6497 or Ray LaForge, Office of Engineering and Technology, (202) 653&hyph;8112.
