The incident was interpreted by Bolivian radio as an inadmissable snub, a grave insult to Bolivia, because the coca leaf is considered an element of the national culture. The U.S. vice president's attitude is due to Washington's position that the origin of the drug-addiction problem affecting U.S. society lies in the existence of the coca leaf. The coca leaf has been consumed for centuries for beneficial purposes, but now the U.S. is trying to bring about the total elimination of the plant.
