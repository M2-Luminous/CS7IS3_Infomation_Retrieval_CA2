SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA has received amended pesticide petitions as follows proposing the establishment and/or amendment of regulations for residues of certain pesticide chemicals in or on various agricultural commodities. Amended Filings 1. PP 2F4154. In the Federal Register of June 29, 1994 (59 FR 33504), EPA issued a notice of an amended petition filed by Rohm & Haas Co., Independence Mall West, Philadelphia, PA 19105 (amendment to petition filed in the Federal Register of December 30 1992 (57 FR 62334; Dec. 30, 1992)) proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation to permit residues of fenbuconazole and its metabolites in or on bananas (whole fruit) at 0.3 part per million (ppm) of which not more than 0.05 ppm is contained in banana pulp. The amended petition is further amended to specify that the residues of fenbuconazole and its metabolites are combined and expressed parent equivalent to determine the total raw agricultural commodity (RAC) residue on bananas. The Rohm & Haas Co. requests that the following permanent tolerances be established for the total fenbuconazole residues: bananas (whole fruit) at 0.3 ppm of which not more than 0.05 ppm is contained in banana pulp.
