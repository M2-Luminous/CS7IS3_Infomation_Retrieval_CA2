The minister said the trade imbalance will create "pressure from many sectors for us to stop imports," but he made it clear that the government will not back down from its policy of opening up. "An increase in exports is the only way to overcome the deficit," the minister said. "In view of the pressure that will be applied we are going to act with great impartiality." The minister made these remarks during a ceremony in which he installed Elias Baracat, the new director of the National Foreign Trade Commission. This new commission was created to study and follow the behavior of international markets. Cavallo explained that within this framework, the commission will have to be prepared "to evaluate unfair competition or dumping [preceding word in English] that could appear in our trade and to adopt the necessary measures to make the GATT agreements prevail." In this respect, he stated that the new commission must play "an important role," and he made it clear that "if it is necessary to apply any type of restrictions it will be to counterbalance subsidies or dumping [preceding word in English], but always within the framework of the international agreements on trade issues signed by Argentina." It has been reported that Baracat will work under Economy Vice Minister Carlos Sanchez through the Trade and Investment Secretariat. "With this commission we have created a foreign trade organization that is in line with the countries that have been successful in this sector of the economy," Cavallo said.
