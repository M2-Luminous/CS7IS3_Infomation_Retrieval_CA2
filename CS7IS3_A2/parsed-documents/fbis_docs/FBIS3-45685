"We hope the meeting between the deputy heads of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) scheduled to start late this month can find ways to resolve some practical issues arising from increasing bilateral contacts in recent years," Huang told the press prior to his departure for Manila to explain Taipei's policy toward Beijing to Philippine and overseas Chinese business leaders. Huang also urged mainland authorities to face the reality that China is now divided and ruled by two different governments. "The two sides should respect each other and work together to pave the way for eventual national unification," he stressed. SEF vice chairman and secretary-general Chiao Jen-ho will leave for Mainland China January 31 to meet with his ARATS counterpart Tang Shubei on how to strengthen cooperation between the two organizations and to resolve thorny cross-strait issues, such as repatriation of mainland hijackers and illegal immigrants, fishing disputes and protection of Taiwan investors. This will be Chiao's first trip to the mainland since he assumed his current post late November. Chiao was previously a vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and a close aide to president Li Teng-hui. The forthcoming Chiao-Tang meeting will be the first high-level contact between the two intermediary bodies since the ground- breaking talks between SEF chairman C.F. Ku and ARATS president Wang Daohan in Singapore last April. The cabinet-level MAC originally planned to postpone the Chiao- Tang talks to protest Beijing's recent unfriendly moves, including forcing France to stop arms sales and Lesotho to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The council, however, announced late Wednesday that it finally decided to allow Chiao to visit the mainland as scheduled with a view to promoting constructive interaction between the two sides. Chiao will be accompanied by several other SEF officials, including deputy secretaries-general Shih Chi-ping and Hsu Hui-you, legal service department director Lin Kui-mei and economic affairs department director Chang Chung-lin, on his mainland visit. SEF and ARATS officials held three rounds of working-level talks in the second half of last year, including one in Taipei, but failed to reach any agreements mainly because of Beijing's reluctance to recognize Taipei's jurisdiction over territories now under its control. SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations founded by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official contacts.
