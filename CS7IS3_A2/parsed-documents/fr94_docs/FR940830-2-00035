Date of Filing: July 20, 1993. Case Number: LEF-0074. On July 20, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) to distribute the funds which Beacon Bay Enterprises, Inc. (Beacon Bay) remitted to the DOE pursuant to a June 21, 1982 Remedial Order. Beacon Bay has remitted $100,697.87 pursuant to the order, to which $3,131.82 in interest has accrued as of July 31, 1994. In accordance with the provisions of the procedural regulations at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V (subpart V), the ERA requests in its Petition that the OHA establish special procedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects of regulatory violations set forth in the Remedial Order. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan to distribute these funds. I. Background During the period relevant to this proceeding, Beacon Bay operated 11 retail service stations in Southern California. The ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Beacon Bay on July 29, 1980. The PRO alleged that, during the period August 1, 1979, through March 31, 1980, Beacon Bay sold motor gasoline at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling price, in violation of Federal petroleum price regulations. The DOE amended the PRO and issued a Final Remedial Order on June 21, 1982, after considering Beacon Bay's objections to the PRO. Beacon Bay Enterprises, 9 DOE ¶ 83,039 (1982). On August 23, 1982, Beacon Bay appealed the DOE's Final Remedial Order to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The FERC issued a Proposed Order, on November 15, 1982, Beacon Bay Enterprises, 21 FERC ¶ 62,295 (1982), and an Order, on January 25, 1983, Beacon Bay Enterprises, 22 FERC ¶ 61,059 (1983) the two of which affirmed and adopted the DOE's Final Remedial Order. Beacon Bay has since remitted $100,697.87 to the DOE, in compliance with the Remedial Order, which is now available (the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund) for distribution through Subpart V.
