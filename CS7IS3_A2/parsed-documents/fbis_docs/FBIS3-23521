Krotov and Major Yu. Dubchik] [Text] Foreign navies make wide use of various types of passive jamming systems and equipment to protect combatant ships against antiship missiles. Interference in the radio-frequency bands is created by forming clouds of metallized fibers or foil strips, and in the infrared band by clouds of heat sources whose emission intensity exceeds the thermal background of the defended object. Packages of metallized fibers (strips) designed for different frequency bands and decoy flares are loaded into containers accommodated in the bodies of free-flight rockets and projectiles fired in a given direction and to a given range by multitube launchers. A large number of surface ships of the United States, NATO countries and a number of other states are equipped with the U.S. RBOC (Rapid Bloom Off-Board Countermeasures) and SRBOC (Super RBOC) systems developed in the 1970's with manual or automatic control of four six-tube launchers of the Mk 35, Mk 135 and Mk 36 types. Great Britain, the FRG, Denmark and Norway developed a standard modification (within the NATO framework) of the RBOC system called Sea Gnat. It has a relatively large response time (up to 10 seconds), which does not permit creating effective protection for a ship in the rapidly changing situation of naval warfare. Means for automatic processing of incoming data and for ensuring an essentially instantaneous system response are a mandatory element of modern passive jamming systems. Thus, the latest modifications of RBOC and SRBOC contain the CAMLAC (Computer Aided Master Launcher Control) computer control unit, which permits substantially increasing the effectiveness of ship protection against antiship missiles. Generalized data on shipboard passive jamming systems and equipment are given in the table.

Same as above rocket (7) As a rule, launchers are located in the forward and after parts of the ship. They have up to 12 tubes at various angles in the vertical plane (sometimes in the horizontal plane), which ensures necessary altitude and direction of free-flight rocket or projectile launches for creating decoys. Mk 4, Mk 171, Mk 182, Mk 214, Mk 216, Chaffstar and LOROC with chaff packages and decoy flares are the types of projectiles and free-flight rockets used for launchers of the RBOC, SRBOC and Sea Gnat systems. In addition, there are variants of comprehensive sets of radar and infrared means of jamming in the GEMINI unified projectile and special free-flight rockets with expendable active jamming sources. Work continues on creating new types of decoys with improved specifications and performance characteristics. This is one of the basic directions for upgrading passive jamming systems. The Mk 171 projectile is a pyrotechnic device containing packets of chaff made on a glass fiber basis with an aluminum coating. Foil strips (their length is commensurate with the half wavelength of antiship missile radar homing head signals) can cover the frequency bands from 2 to 20 GHz (more precise values are indicated in technical documentation of each lot of projectiles). The radar cross-section of a cloud from one projectile exceeds the radar cross-section of a small combatant by approximately 1.5-2 times. The propellant and secondary charges also are within the projectile body. The secondary charge operates 3-4 seconds after launch and scatters the chaff packets. The chaff disperses under the effect of the oncoming air stream and forms an extended cloud several tens or hundreds of meters from the protected object. The Chaffstar projectile creates a cloud with a radar cross-section approximately two times larger than from the Mk 171. The supply of chaff of Mk 182 and Mk 214 projectiles is enough to cover large-displacement ships. The area of a chaff cloud formed with the help of these projectiles can exceed 20,000 m[.sup]2[/] in certain frequency bands (8-12 GHz). The Mk 216 free-flight rocket and increased-range LOROC are used to simulate surface targets. They consist of a solid-propellant motor providing a maximum velocity of 270 m/sec and a time delay device (up to 20-25 seconds) for triggering the secondary charge. The place where a decoy is formed may be 400-4,000 m from the ship. Use of free-flight rockets and projectiles with decoy flares is based on a different principle. In addition to a propellant charge, the HIRAM projectile has a section with a combustible substance, a parachute and a float. The secondary charge is triggered and punctures a protective membrane 3.5-4 seconds after firing. The parachute opens under the effect of the air stream and the process of ignition of the combustible substance and formation of a cloud begins simultaneously, with intense emission in the 3-5 micron waveband. The descent rate of the projectile, with a chaff dispensing height of 60 m, is 2 m/sec. It burns around 40 seconds and may continue to burn after hitting the water because of the float. The following modifications -- HIRAM-2, -3 and -4--are distinguished by greater intensity of thermal emission and an expanded band of coverage (8-12 microns). The GEMINI combination radar/IR decoy consists of three sections -- two with chaff and one with the IR decoy. The combustion process lasts around 45 seconds. All the above projectiles and free-flight rockets are of 113-mm caliber for the Mk 33 launcher (RBOC) and 130-mm for the Mk 36 (SRBOC). The designation of the latter contains the prefix Super: Super LOROC, Super HIRAM and so on. A computer, control apparatus and auxiliary equipment are included in the automated passive jamming system in addition to multitube launchers. Multitube launchers (such as in the RBOC system) are located on fixed platforms and contain six tubes on each side with fixed quadrant elevations (one each at 45 and 75� and two each at 55 and 65�). Using six launchers, they are oriented at angles of 30, 60 and 135� in azimuth to the ship's centerline. A diagram of the structure of a typical passive jamming system and external appearance of the launchers are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 ([Fig. 2 not reproduced]). The system receives all information necessary for functioning from shipboard ELINT collection assets, acquisition radars, navigation devices and meteorological situation monitors. Launches are prepared and executed using the controlling processor (Fig. 3 [figure not reproduced]) and data display device. Information on the ship's current coordinates, wind direction and velocity, and amount of rolling and pitching enters the system along with intelligence. Information from the shipboard radar and ELINT set contains data on target parameters (bearing, range) and the type, operating frequency and kind of emission of the radar homing head. It can be transmitted to the processor both from the automated battle management system central computer as well as directly from sensors. The controlling processor figures the optimum variant for employing decoys with an indication of the specific launcher, tube numbers, and moment and sequence of launches, and provides recommendations on executing a maneuver to leave an antiship missile impact zone. The SRBOC system uses a standard, widespread 80186 processor with 64 kilobytes of main memory (its increase to 256 kilobytes is envisaged) and 16 kilobytes of on-line memory (with the possibility of expanding to 128 kilobytes) as a controlling processor. The following data are needed for the controlling processor to perform calculations: Current number of detected target (from 1 to 16) and its azimuth (0-360�); type of homing head (radar, IR or combination); operating frequency band of radar homing head (four subbands); pulse duration (within limits of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 500 or more nanoseconds); ship speed (0-50 knots); own course (0-360�); amount of roll (from -60 to +60�) and pitch (from -45 to +45�); wind direction and velocity (0-100 knots) and information on the status of the launcher and other system units. Launch controls and annunciator panels displaying information on the type of antiship missile, the direction of its approach and readiness of the launcher are located on the controlling processor panel. The control panel on the bridge duplicates the controlling processor's monitoring panel. The passive jamming system display equipment, including a screen showing the tactical situation, is located in the ship's combat information post. After a free-flight rocket or projectile with decoys is fired, its blip is shown on the screen relative to the antiship missile's movement path. Based on this information a decision can be made about changing the ship's course for more effective protection against the antiship missile. There are lockers on deck near each launcher, each containing 18 projectiles. As a rule, passive jamming systems provide different methods of creating the passive jamming and also can function at the same time as active jammers. Data input to the computer about basic specifications and performance characteristics and about the algorithm of operation of homing heads in the inventory of antiship missiles are taken into account in choosing the method. In the target search mode the homing head of an antiship missile in flight emits pulses of maximum duration in which the size of the strobe reaches several hundred meters. With transition to a target tracking mode, pulses are narrowed sometimes tens of times and their repetition frequency sharply increases, as a result of which the size of the strobe decreases to tens of meters. This circumstance affects choice of the specific method of repelling an enemy attack depending on its phase (detection of the enemy radar emission, preparation of the antiship missile for launch, target search by the antiship missile homing head, guidance of the antiship missile to the target). The first method (confusion) is effective against radars of enemy ships and aircraft operating in a search and target designation mode. The defending ship forms 5-7 decoys separated from each other by from 400 to 4,000 m. The second method (diversion) is used basically for protection against a flying antiship missile before its homing head locks onto the target (Fig. 4). One or two decoys are formed 100-400 m from the ship in the homing head search sector. Inasmuch as the algorithm of operation of the missile homing head provides for lock-on and tracking of a higher-contrast target (with larger radar cross-section), then with consideration of the principle of priority, it will select the decoy as the target for guidance. The third method (deflection) is used in the case where the antiship missile homing head has accomplished lock-on of the target and shifted to the guidance mode (Fig. 5). With this method, an extended concealing cloud is formed, whose edge envelops the protected ship (the maneuver of her departure from the impact zone is executed simultaneously). Inasmuch as the ship and chaff cloud are within limits of one strobe of the antiship missile homing head, then by shifting the geometric center of the cumulative extended target (ship and cloud) by several tens of meters, the missile path changes away from the ship. There are several versions for employing a passive jamming system together with active means: Simultaneous placement of passive decoys with several active simulative jammers hindering the antiship missile's choice of the two targets in its search stage; placement of passive decoy and active jamming which deflects in range, ensuring the antiship missile's guidance to the decoy; placement of passive decoy and active concealment and deception jamming. This precludes the possibility of the antiship missile's guidance to an active shipboard jammer. In the opinion of western specialists, passive jamming systems are an effective means of repelling antiship missile attacks and are characterized by a sufficient level of reliability, simplicity of servicing and control, possibility of installation on ships of any types, and relatively low cost. They are a mandatory element of the system of individual protection of surface combatants. The modular principle of building passive jamming systems permits constantly upgrading and modernizing their individual units.
