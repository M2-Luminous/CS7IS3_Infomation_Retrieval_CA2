Addressing a national conference of customs directors on 30 January, Qian Guanlin, director of the PRC General Administration of Customs, said: The focus of customs operation reform this year is to introduce the customs inspection system. Customs will expand the time and space of supervision and control by basing its import and export supervision and control on enterprise control and accounts auditing in order to facilitate passage at ports and points of entry, to make supervision and control more scientific and effective, and to better suit the expansion of opening up to the outside world and the development of an export-oriented economy. He pointed out: It is necessary to change the traditional concept of regarding the customs simply as a "gatekeeper" and to change the traditional mode of over-concentrating manpower, material resources, and means of supervision and control on the handling of passage at customs in ports and points of entry -- which involves only a narrow and small space and a short duration of time. It is obvious that the old mode of supervision and control can no longer meet the needs of the rapidly developing situation: In 1993, the volume of import and export goods under the supervision and control of customs nationwide amounted to 347 million metric tons, an increase of 23.6 percent over 1992; customs also inspected the luggage of 100.05 million inbound and outbound visitors, an increase of nearly 9.7 percent over 1992. It has been learned that the General Administration of Customs has received State Council approval to establish an inspection department to exercise unified control over and to coordinate customs inspection work nationwide. The measures for implementing the customs inspection system will soon be distributed to subordinate units for implementation. Correspondingly, the system of processing through customs will be further reformed. Qian Guanlin said: It is necessary to reform the system of customs declaration and cultivate the customs declaration service market. The State Council has determined that examination and approval of customs brokers will be administered by customs. It is necessary to gradully build specialized customs broker agencies into business entities bearing the nature of social intermediate organizations responsible not only to enterprises but also to customs. It is necessary to begin studying and to gradually establish a system for administering customs clearances by consignees and consignors of import-export goods, as well as by their agents; it is necessary to study and establish a customs clearance management standard based on risk analysis; it is necessary to quickly establish a customs clearance method suitable to expressways; it is necessary to study the comprehensive application of electronic data exchange; it is necessary to further expand the results of the reform of joint inspection of sea-transported goods and popularize them throughout China this year; it is necessary to revise in a timely manner customs' method of supervising and controlling mailed goods by concentrating on supervision and control, in order to move in the direction of international practice.
