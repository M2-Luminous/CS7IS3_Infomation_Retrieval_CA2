[Habash] The massacre takes us back to the heart of the Zionist agenda and its objectives. If there is a lesson to be learned from the atrocity, this must be to put the Zionist game plan under the magnifying glass, particularly at this moment when numerous forces, including Zionism, imperialism, and defeatist Arab forces are trying to cover up the true nature of the Zionist agenda. Accordingly, it is imperative for Palestinian and Arab masses to define their pan-Arab agenda and aim at weeding out that cancerous growth. [AL-BILAD] What will the PFLP's [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine] response to the incident be? Are you planning any action? [Habash] Naturally, all our comrades in the occupied territories must think up tangible reactions. Palestinian and Arab masses outside Palestine must also translate their condemnation of the massacre into action. I do not want to offer the military struggle as an alterative to the intifadah or mass and political struggle. What is called for is an integrated militlary, political, and popular plan of action.
