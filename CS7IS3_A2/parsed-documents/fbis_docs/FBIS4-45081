But for the saturation of the `India portfolio' abroad by numerous GDR flotations, VSNL would not perhaps have cut a sorry figure. So, after abolishing capital issues control at home, the Government has decided to regulate the rush of issues flooding the Euromarket in search of cheap funds. From now on, a company based in India can tap the Euromarket once in 12 months; not more than two Euro issues will be permitted to groups during this interval; and permission to tap the Euromarket will have to be used up within the stipulated quarter. Such grooming obviously clears the way for VSNL's re-entry into the Euromarket. However, it would be churlish to decry the entry regulations as interventionism, unbecoming of a regime that has donned the mantle of liberalisation. Sequencing Euroissues is essential for decent realisations. Though no formal cap has been placed, the size of Euroissues is now related to the end-uses of funds raised abroad. Besides capital goods imports and approved investments abroad -- both need funding in foreign exchange -- Eurofunds can be used to purchase domestic plant and equipment as also buildings. Foreign sourcing of funds will thus not pre-empt domestic suppliers. If the latter are given deemed export treatment, domestic sourcing of plant and equipment with low-cost funds from abroad will get a fillip. Another permitted end-use is repayment of foreign borrowings, either before the due date or on schedule. This is eminently sensible as it facilitates the replacement of high cost borrowings with alien risk capital. The new policy provides an escape from high domestic interest rates. It will help to reduce, not wholly but significantly, dependence on high cost domestic long-term funds (supporting investment) with cheap capital from abroad. However, it is the public sector enterprises that can freely access the Euromarket with equity-related instruments under the privatisation policy of reducing government ownership of equity from 100 per cent to 51 per cent. Most large private sector enterprises, in which the equity stake of the Indian controlling interest is generally small, are wary of equity passing into foreign hands. This problem has been mitigated, but not contained, by the new policy. It allows the use of 15 per cent of Euro proceeds for, inter alia, corporate restructuring. But there is no way of precluding the acquisition of new equity from Euroissues by the principals of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) based in India. To contain the take-over threat, the Government must reduce the ceiling on FII holdings in India from the current high of 24 per cent.
