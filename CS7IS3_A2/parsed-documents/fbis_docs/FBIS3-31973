Gasoline prices are hereby frozen until 31 May 1994. From that date onward, fuel prices will be adjusted monthly, considering only the sliding exchange rate, except when international oil prices exceed $17 a barrel. 2. Diesel fuel prices will remain frozen at a national average price of 7.15 cordobas a gallon until 30 April 1994. 3. An in bond [preceding words in English] store is hereby authorized for the importation of tires, spares, and other supplies for the exclusive use of cooperative transportation sectors so that, in accordance with Article 74 of the General Law of Cooperatives, they can benefit from tax exonerations established therein; exceptions to this are stipulations under Chapter 27 of the SAC [Central American Tariff System]. 4. The value added tax for local purchases of goods and services by legally registered transportation cooperatives will be reimbursed, beginning 1 March 1994. 5. Within the framework of the development of transportation enterprise cooperatives properly registered with the MCT [Constuction and Transportation Ministry] to this date, the government will provide a revolving fund, via the appropriate institution, to retain an annual market of 10 million cordobas, endeavoring to obtain the lowest possible interest rate. 6. Commercial passenger and cargo trucks, as well as taxi drivers with operating vehicles, organized under legally registered cooperatives will receive a coupon worth 1.28 cordobas for a gallon of gasoline up to a maximum of six gallons a day. This coupon system will be effective between 30 January to 30 April 1994. This coupon will be handled according to the September 1993 agreements. 7. It goes on record that there will be no additional charges to those currently established under Decree 62-93 for license plates, driving licenses, and others. The Presidency will be requested to issue a new decree to this effect, which in effect will repeal Decree 62-93. 8. It has been agreed to appoint a commission to create the National Land Transportation Council [Consejo Nacional de Transporte Terrestre]. 9. A review of the agreements signed in September 1993 will take place via work commissions for each case; likewise, the MCT communique dated 27 April 1993 will be implemented. 10. By 15 February 1994, and after studying Central American costs, a meeting will be held with the mayors' financial commission of the directors for the Nicaraguan Institute for Municipal Development [Instituto Nicaraguense de Fomento Municipal], Imifom, the Finance Ministry, and transportation representative organizations to discuss the 1994 road tax and methods of payment for the cargo and passenger transportation sector. Imifom will summon a meeting for this. 11. Once this agreement is signed, the transportation organization representatives pledge to immediately suspend the national transportation strike. 12. At the request of the transportation organization representatives, signatories of this act of agreement, all those who have been arrested for their involvement in the events linked to the transportation strike were freed, without detriment to the corresponding procedural investigation.
