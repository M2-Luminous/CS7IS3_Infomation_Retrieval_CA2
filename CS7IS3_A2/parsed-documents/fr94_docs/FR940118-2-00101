FR940118-2-00101 FR940118-2-00060 The Commission agrees that it is appropriate for Rule 108 to include a reference to Exchange Act Rule 11a1&hyph;1 since it specifically deals with transactions yielding priority, parity, and precedence. This change is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade pursuant to section 6(b)(5) of the Act 18 as it will serve to clarify Rule 108. 18 See supra footnote 12. Rules 110 and 111_Registered Traders and Restrictions on Registered Traders: These rules, which provide that only members registered as traders may trade for their own accounts while on the Trading Floor, were adopted in 1964 to restrict on-floor transactions by floor members, who, it was believed, had trading advantages due to their presence on the trading floor when market news unfolded, and due to their ability to quickly react to such information. The Exchange believes that since current communications technology makes information readily available to off-floor market participants, there is no reason to continue to so restrict members' on-floor orders. 19 19 The Amex proposes to both add and delete language from Commentary .02 to Rule 111. Amex Rule 111, Commentary .02 says that the Rule 111 provisions do not apply to transactions initiated by registered traders for an account in which they have an interest, ``unless such transactions, although originated off the floor, are deemed on-floor transactions under the provisions of these Rules.'' The Exchange proposes to delete the aforementioned quoted text from Commentary .02. The Exchange proposes to add the following to Rule 111, Commentary .02: ``However, an off-floor order for an account in which a member has an interest is to be treated as an on-floor order if it is executed by the member who initiated it.'' The Commission believes that the changes to Commentary .02 to Rule 111 are appropriate clarifying changes to the Rule, and that these changes will not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act, in accordance with section 6(b)(8) of the Act.
