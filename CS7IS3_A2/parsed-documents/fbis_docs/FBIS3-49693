"Though we are advanced in some respects..., these considerations are outdated," he says. "The potential economic success of the Czech Republic itself... would not guarantee our place in Europe and its security structures. There will be interest in our country only if we are full-fledged partners regarding responsibility towards Europe, i.e. how we work for the stabilization of the Central European region and for strengthening and expanding democracy eastward." Dienstbier says that "Americans, NATO, the European Community ... have many times indicated this. The Visegrad Group -- the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia -- is no invention of the West... It is the interest of the West in guaranteed Central European security, which is identical with our interest," he says. "Conditions in Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary are comparable with ours. These countries have identical integration goals and very similar interests," Dienstbier says. In this context, he describes the Czech Government's attitude as "arrogant and mistaken. Do we really not need allies and friends?" he asks. Of the "Partnership for Peace" program, Dienstbier says that it is an "expression of NATO's unpreparedness for a liberal transformation. However, NATO is well aware of the fact that it cannot stay in its current form. Now it is up to us what we do about the program. We must not allow it to become a palliative or a 'waiting room' used by the West while it waits to see what happens in Russia," Dienstbier says. "The project (partnership) has advantages with which it stands up to certain realistic criticism," he stresses and adds that "it provides equal changes for all. None of the countries can speak about discrimination or a new curtain falling. It is up to each individual state when it creates the necessary political, economic, and military prerequisites for its integration (into international structures)," the former federal foreign minister says. "Nor is it possible to isolate Russia or the Ukraine. Their incorporation into the democratic world is of key importance for European security," he stresses, adding that "on the other hand, however, it is impossible to give in to remnants of imperial thinking." Dienstbier believes that the shortest and easiest way of joining NATO requires the Czech Republic's political and economic stability, "our readiness to defend ourselves and be partners in the joint defense of the democratic world. Finally, we must prove that we are capable of being an active stabilizing factor in Central Europe," Dienstbier says.
