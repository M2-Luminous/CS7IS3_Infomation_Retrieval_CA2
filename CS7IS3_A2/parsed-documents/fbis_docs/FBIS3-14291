Larsen stated this in a joint news conference today attended by Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator for the Middle East peace talks; Victor Posuvalyuk, President Yeltsin's envoy to the Middle East; Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation; Uri Savir, director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry; and Ambassador Husayn Dirar from the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. The committee held its first meeting after the news conference. Larsen said the Israelis and Palestinians agreed on the entry of the police force to the autonomous regions and that the international community must support this force. Dennis Ross said the United States will send 200 vehicles for the police force within two weeks. Sha'th said the World Bank has estimated how much money the police force will need. An initial sum of $47 million is needed for the force. The final cost will be around $90 million annually. He noted that part of this cost can be met in the form of material aid. Some donor states have actually promised to give this aid. Larsen said the amount to be given by the donor states has not been decided yet. He noted that envoys from the PLO and Norway will visit the donor states to urge them to give aid soon. At the start of the news conference, Larsen delivered a statement saying that Norway called for this urgent session after consulting with the parties concerned with the peace process to coordinate the aid to be given to establish the Palestinian police force in accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles and after Israel and the PLO agreed on the early entry of the Palestinian police force to safeguard the safety and security of the Palestinians in the occupied territories. Larsen explained that the Israeli and Palestinian sides have affirmed their commitment to the peace process and have discussed the progress made regarding the formation of the police force. The Palestinian side has also discussed the force's needs in terms of equipment, telecommunications, clothes, and housing. The donor states also told the meeting what they can give to the Palestinian police force. He said that during the meeting, emphasis was placed on the quick handing over of missions to the Palestinian police. The PLO explained the need for the right coordination and mechanism in handing over such missions. Asked about the funds allocated for the Palestinian police force, Larsen said he cannot state the amounts before delegations from Norway and the PLO visit the donor states. Asked about the date of the deployment of the Palestinian force in Gaza and Jericho, Sha'th said: We are discussing preparations for the deployment of the Palestinian force as soon as possible. He said he hoped deployment would take place on the date specified in the Declaration of Principles--13 April. He also said he hoped a Palestinian force would be dispatched earlier to prepare for the self-rule authority in Gaza and Jericho. Sha'th said a Palestinian police force will deploy in Hebron but this will be outside the framework of the Gaza-Jericho talks. Agreement on this police force for Hebron will be reached within the framework of the current talks in Cairo. Asked about the armament of the Palestinian police force in Hebron, Sha'th said the police will carry personal weapons. He said no agreement has been reached on heavy weapons, such as machine guns. So we ask the donor states to finance what was agreed upon -- light weapons, houses for the police force, telecommunications equipment, and transport vehicles. He noted that Norway has delivered 3,000 police uniforms and promised to send another 7,000 uniforms soon. Uri Savir, director of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said: During the previous talks on Gaza and Jericho we were very close to reaching an agreement on the arrangements for the police force. We must now reach agreement on the police force outside Gaza and Jericho. He said: We discussed the gradual arrival of the Palestinian police force before the handover of the self-rule authority in Gaza and Jericho. Larsen declined to answer a question on the absence of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait from the meeting. Asked about the deployment of a Palestinian police force in Hebron, Sha'th said this was the result of the ugly massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. He noted that negotiations are under way with the Israeli side on the size of this force. Commenting on the same issue, Savir said: We are still discussing the issue of the police force in Hebron. In the event of an agreement, this force will be a step on the road toward achieving security and stability for the Palestinians. There are some details that are still under discussion. Asked about his tour of the region, Dennis Ross said his talks with the parties concerned with the peace process were good. The parties affirmed their commitment to establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region. He noted that the meeting in Cairo today indicates that the Israelis want to establish an atmosphere of confidence. Dennis Ross said: I can say now that April will be the date for resuming the Palestinian-Israeli talks. He noted that he is holding talks with the Russian side on resuming these talks. On the Russian role in the region, President Yeltsin's envoy said: We have reasons for our increasing interest in the Middle East. The region is our neighbor. We are interested in establishing strong relations with it. We have important economic interests in the region. Many Soviet Jews have emigrated to Israel. He stressed that his country will take steps to strengthen its relations with the Arab states. The Palestinian and Israeli sides expressed their gratitude to Egypt and Norway for helping them convene this meeting despite the short notice. They also thanked the cosponsors of the conference, the United States and Russia, whose participation on this high level is significant for all the sides.
