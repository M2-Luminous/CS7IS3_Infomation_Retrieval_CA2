Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--The Lower House of Parliament on Tuesday [22 March] condemned the U.S. abstention from voting on references to the status of Jerusalem and other Israeli-occupied territories in Friday's U.N. Security Council resolution condemning the Feb. 25 massacre at a mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron. In a statement issued on the last day of its first regular session, the House said the U.S. abstention during voting on Resolution 904 signalled a "clear change in the American stand," which had hitherto viewed Jerusalem as well as other Palestinian territories as occupied. "The Lower House of Parliament condemns the American position and calls on the parliaments of Arab and Islamic countries as well as those of countries which support just causes to protest against the American stand," the statement said. The Lower House said it "deeply regretted the weak coordination among the Arab delegations at the world body" leading to the adoption of the resolution which did not satisfy the Arab position. It was an indirect swipe at the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), which held extensive consultations with the U.S. on the wording of Resolution 904 since it was first drafted shortly after the Feb. 25 massacre. The delay was caused by American insistence on deleting parts of the draft and differences with the PLO on the phrasing and wording of the document. His Majesty King Husayn said in a recent interview that Jordan was not a party to the consultations over the draft and noted that he had launched a personal effort to come up with a joint Arab stand vis-a-vis the issue a few hours before the Security Council adopted the resolution. The king said the door would not have been open for the U.S. to abstain on parts of the resolution had the document omitted any specific reference to Jerusalem and referred to the territories that Israeli occupied in the 1967 war in a general context. The American abstention has sounded alarm bells in Jordan, which saw Washington's posture as paving the way for the eventual recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Since 1967, the U.S. stand on the occupied territories had remained constant based on the rejection of Israeli occupation of the land until Friday's vote, which cast doubts on the U.S. intentions. The American stand was viewed as an intentional precedent-setting move to eventually change its rejection of Israel's unilateral annexation of East Jerusalem. The king said he was seeking an expalantion from Washington whether there was any shift in the U.S. stand. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said after the vote that Washington did not want to prejudge the outcome of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations by adopting any position on issues involved in the conflict. Officials said Tuesday that the issue was to be raised during talks with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross who was paying a brief visit to Amman late Tuesday. "We hope to get some explanation of the American stand and what its obstention means," said one highly-placed official (see separate story). Tuesday's parliament statement also expressed regret that Resolution 904, adopted after "three weeks of delays and procrastination...only condemned the massacre, carried out by Zionist settlers aided by the occupation forces, and did not condemn the Israeli authorities responsible for the massacre." The statement called on Arab leaders to put aside their differences and convene a summit conference to discuss the "situation of the Palestinian people living under Zionist occupation" and to "shoulder their responsibilities towards Palestinians who are subjected to consistent campaigns of genocide." The House voiced appreciation "of the steadfastness of the Palestinian people and their commitment to their land and their rights" and reaffimed Jordan's support for the Palestinian struggle for liberation.
