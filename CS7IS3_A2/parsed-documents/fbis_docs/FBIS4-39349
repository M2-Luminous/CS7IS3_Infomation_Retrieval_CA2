These problems include financial support to Federation subjects, defence spending, fundamental science, education and preservation of cultural monuments, said the deputy. In his opinion, such distribution of budget means will help to preserve the defence, scientific and cultural potential of Russia. The money can be found as the "Russian Government has envisaged a number of reserves in the draft budget," he said. At the same time, the reserves should not exceed the limits of the Duma-approved spending, revenues and the budget deficit. For instance, 1,500,000,000,000 rubles can be received from cuts of the domestic debt payment. Another 3,000,000,000,000 rubles can be taken from the reduced amount of foreign drawings. It is also necessary to cut by 15 per cent the spending on state management structures, whose size has increased by eight times as compared to last year, said Zadornov.
