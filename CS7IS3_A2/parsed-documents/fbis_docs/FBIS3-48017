Within this year, the ministry will remove legal cartels on two categories of products, thus lifting ceilings on exports to the United States. In addition, the export permit system requiring exporters to get permits for exports will be abolished except for limited items exported to the United States and the European Union (EU). Japan's textile products have lost their competitiveness in face of other Asian nations' export offensives, and thus the meaning of numerical controls has diminished. The measure also has the purpose of reducing the textile industry's burdens by simplifying export procedures. The products, cartels on which will no longer be legally accepted, are secondary textile products like woolen fabric goods and cotton trousers. The legal cartel system has been in effect more than 20 years, and during that period MITI has set export ceilings each year, while the Export Cooperatives have checked export quantities and contract terms. Controls on two categories of products, exports of cotton fabric goods to Canada and fishing nets and synthetic fiber products to Canada and three other countries, were removed from the legal cartel system at the end of last year. With the additional two categories of products to the United States being removed from the system, only three categories of products will be left to benefit from the legal carteling. Meanwhile, the export permit system which will be abolished in principle at the end of this year will apply mostly to textile goods. The ministry is thinking about excluding East Europe and the Middle East from the permit system by the end of March, ahead of other countries. Exporters' papers related to obtaining permits take the ministry about two days per case to review, entailing much work for the ministry officials concerned. By 1995, regulations left on exports to the United States will be only those aimed at curbing exports to the United States through a third party, plus those governing legal carteling. The number of permit application papers reviewed will fall from about 310,000 at present to 50,000 cases in the future. According to MITI, by the series of deregulation measures to be effected this time, the products whose export quantities remain under control will drop from 95 to 28 percent in export value as far as exports to the United States are concerned. The Multinational Fiber Agreement (MFA), which sets the rules for international dealings on textile products, will be absorbed into the GATT's rules over a period of 10 years after the Uruguay Round agreement goes into effect. The Uruguay Round agreement regards self-controls on exports as being "gray-area measures" and prohibits them. This means remaining regulations will be abolished sooner or later.
