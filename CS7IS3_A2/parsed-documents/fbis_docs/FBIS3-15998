The residents of Volyn Oblast respect you as their countryman and as a man who has contributed, and still contributes, to the strengthening of our state. Notwithstanding the fact that you are registered as a nonparty candidate for a deputy seat, certain political structures (let us recall, for example, a joint statement signed by the leaders of the Socialist, Communist, and Peasant Parties) have aimed their propaganda apparatus at General Skipalskyy. [Skipalskyy] I am grateful to the leaders of the above-mentioned parties and, first of all, to Oleksandr Moroz [head of the Socialist Party], for evaluating me so highly. However, I do not care so much about it. According to current statistical data, 76 percent of Ukraine's population does not pay any attention to party activities today. I am sure that I will not go into any interparty quarrels by evaluating the activities of these organizations during the electoral campaign. I am running for a deputy's seat from my home constituency as an independent candidate. I have not come here to instruct the people -- everybody knows how we are living. I have come here to show my gratitude to my countrymen. From them I inherited my love for the Volyn region and for all of Ukraine. Here in the Volyn region, I grew into manhood. I would like to repay this debt by my dedicated efforts for the strengthening of our state. For this purpose I have chosen the Vladimir Volynskiy constituency. I know the Luboml region very well; the ancient city of Vladimir is one of our spiritual capitals. One really feels that the city was a center of the European state a thousand years ago. This has been preserved in the genes of our contemporary Volyn residents. We should make our Ukraine the same strong state. [Verbych] Therefore, we would like to hear about the essentials of your election platform. [Skipalskyy] They are extremely simple. The content of my election platform can be summed up in three words: state--order--prosperity. As of today, we do not live in an independent state. We need hard work and, undoubtedly, an appropriate political position. On the other hand, we will never attain prosperity unless we introduce proper order. Raging crime, theft, cynicism in the legal system, anarchy, and predatory robbery of the people and state -- all these evils must be urgently uprooted. In addition, it must be done ruthlessly and with purpose. Prosperity means an indispensable transition to market economy with social protection for the citizens. Prosperity means the economic independence of every individual. [Verbych] Our citizens have already sunk into the sea of smooth-tongued words. Streams of words, failing to transform themselves into concrete actions, are pouring out of the mouths of state officials and would-be people's deputies. However, it seems that the people believe neither the former nor the latter. Quite frequently one can hear opinions that deliverance lies in rule by a "firm hand." [Skipalskyy] It is my opinion, too. Our people have every reason to speak like that. A state is impossible without order in society. True, the notion of rule by a "firm hand" has been deformed due to the cult of personality, everyday wrongdoings, and bloody class slaughter. The notion of "firm-hand" rule means an appropriate order and strong authority. Without these, we will not be able to build a democratic society. Nothing happens just on its own. One cannot just wake up in the morning and find oneself in an independent state; one cannot become a different man just like that. Why, after two years of honest and persevering labor of many hard- working men, do we see that the people are living in extremely difficult conditions, worse than they have even been? Because our citizens are working for the benefit of the state. which is being robbed more and more often. But the state, I will repeat myself, does not actually exist. We have lost our positions in the Crimea, in the Black Sea Fleet. We have been working amorphously, unresolutely; we thought that history would put everything in its proper place. But history will only record all our inactivity. While fully understanding our needs, we have not been able to speak of what we must do. But just try to do it if there is no division among the three branches of power -- executive, legislative, and judicial. Not to mention the fourth power -- the media -- more precisely, the press which is filled with reproaches, tug-of-war games, and accusations... [Verbych] And very often the press is in search of sensational stories, complying, so to say, to the demands of certain forces... [Skipalskyy] We are still pursued by the inertia of class struggle. We must be directed by the policy of state building. Those who contribute to this goal should not be defamed all the time, discredited, and raised against others... [Verbych] We have to state today that among the electorate there is apathy, disillusion, and disappointment. One can often hear that the elections may not be held. That is to say, some of our citizens actually refuse to influence the path our state will take toward development. We forget that we are also to blame for today's difficult situation, because we are the ones who chose the people's deputies and the president. People say in despair: It makes no difference to us. [Skipalskyy] I do not believe that it makes no difference to them. Their hearts are bleeding and flaming. Regarding disillusion, it was also inherited from another historical epoch. However, I would not like to attribute it to the Ukrainian mentality. I am sure that the elections will be held. There is no other way for us than free elections. True, given the large number of candidates, people must select those who will really care about the state and the nation. This is the first version. The second one, extremely undesirable, is a rigorous army dictatorship. There is also a third one -- enter Ivan from the north and says: "Well, Little Russians [term used by Russians to denote Ukrainians], residents of southern Russia, if you are incapable of building the state, we will help you." [passage in quotation marks in Russian] I am afraid of a recurrence of history. There may be one more version: In order to please Europe, Russia proposes to tear Ukraine to pieces. A shadow of danger is constantly hovering over us. As you know, certain politicians in Poland adopt statements making territorial demands. Similar forces exist in Romania and Hungary. I do not exclude the possibility that Ukraine may be partitioned along the Sluch or Dnepr rivers. This is no joking matter. One must assess today's real situation. We have to think and act if we are to take care of our descendants. [Verbych] The world treats us in a peculiar way. Let us recall: The United States recognized the former Soviet Union just when communists provoked in Ukraine a famine that has no record in 20th century civilization. We also see the trends that dominate in Poland: For the first time since 1945, they put an officer from Eastern Europe on trial, and this is Ukrainian Major Lysenko. In addition, according to many political experts, the domestic situation in our state, in the wake of Meshkov's election to the Crimean presidency, will aggravate matters extremely: The trends toward autonomy will be made a major issue by certain political forces. Ukraine may face the prospect of being partitioned and divided by other states. Do you think that Ukraine can avoid a situation as that in Yugoslavia? [Skipalskyy] There will be no such case as in Yugoslavia in Ukraine; the situation is quite different. The issue of federalization is a quite different topic. This issue is urgent for Russia which still remains an empire. With regard to the Crimea, this is a result of our miscalculations. As far back as 1991, I said: The Crimea has been bridled in order to continually tug the Ukrainian horse by the head. The "elder brother" will never accept Ukraine's significant advancement in economic development. However, we must be soberminded politicians: Russia is our neighbor, and we must cooperate in order to keep interstate relations friendly. From a geopolitical viewpoint, Russia is interested in Ukraine being a friendly state. Russia has enough problems in its relations with the Muslim world, as well as in domestic matters. [Verbych] Your opponents long ago declared "war" on you. They ardently persuade: We are the very people whom the Ukrainian parliament needs. Oleksandr Oleksandrovych, in your opinion, what people should be elected to the Supreme Council? [Skipalskyy] Undoubtedly, those people who actively contribute to the building of Ukraine, who carry the burden of provocative accusations, compromises. This is being done by ideological opponents and special services of those states that are not interested in Ukraine gaining strength. Our competitors, I will repeat myself, are capable of estimating worthy opponents. Let us recall that wise Ukrainian proverb: Lightning never strikes in the rotten oats. Regarding those calumnies against me, I never yield to a dog's barking. As for my opponents, I would suggest that they hold more fair arguments. I want to become a worthy representative of the Vladimir Volynskiy and Lukoml rayons in the Supreme Council to protect the interests of Volyn residents in such a way as not to make them ashamed of my speeches and actions. Working in the legislative body, I will try to support bills intended to protect citizens. [Verbych] Oleksandr Oleksandrovych, you never were a stranger here in the Volyn region. I recall the time when there was a conflict ripening in Volodimir Volynskiy -- the Interfront was just about to be launched -- and you were the man who prevented a very dangerous clash. [Skipalskyy] What is more, our former opponents constituted 90 percent of the electors who put me forward as a candidate. My concept is to consolidate. We have to unite ourselves to build the Ukrainian statehood regardless of nationality and party alignment. Our citizens should not be forced into a class struggle, as was done by Marxist-Leninist apologists. Only one category of citizens must be isolated in our society -- criminals. Our recovery lies in the policy of statehood building, in statehood philosophy.
