In a meeting with Defense Agency chief Kazuo Aichi, Hosokawa reportedly said the revision of the 1976 national defense program outline will inevitably focus on the size of the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF). Hosokawa's remark implies that the strength of the GSDF as laid out in the outline could be reduced from 180,000 to less than 150,000, the officials said. Hosokawa instructed Aichi to take the lead in revising the basic defense policy but do it in such a way as not to cause a sense of insecurity among members of the GSDF, the officials said. Aichi reported to the prime minister the setting-up of a defense agency panel to help review the national defense program outline, adopted by the cabinet of Prime Minister Takeo Miki in 1976. The program calls for the government to maintain Japan-U.S. security arrangements to defend Japan against large-scale attacks and also to build up Japan's own defense capabilities to repel limited-scale invasions. A numerical defense table attached to the outline sets the size of the GSDF at 180,000 troops, but the actual number of personnel is 152,000, chiefly because of difficulty in recruiting volunteers. Apart from the Defense Agency's panel, Hosokawa established a nine-member consultative council last month to review Japan's basic defense policies. The Defense Agency panel will give advice to the prime minister's advisory body, officials said.
