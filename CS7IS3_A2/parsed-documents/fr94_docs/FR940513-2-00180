FR940513-2-00180 FR940513-2-00086 LP&L now proposes to have the Owner-Trustee issue the Refunding Bonds either under three amended and supplemented Indentures of Mortgage and Deeds of Trust dated September 1, 1989 or under comparable instruments (``Indentures''). The Refunding Bonds will be issued to refund the Original Bonds. In the alternative, LP&L proposes to refund all or a portion of the Original Bonds with interim funds obtained from banks or other institutions by the Owner-Trustee (``Interim Funds'') and to then issue Refunding Bonds to retire the Interim Funds. The proceeds from the sale of the Refunding Bonds and possibly the proceeds of the Interim Funds, possibly together with funds provided by LP&L, will be used to redeem the Original Bonds and to meet associated issuance costs. The 2005 Bonds are optionally redeemable on July 2, 1994 for 105.150% of their principal amount. The 2017 Bonds are first optionally redeemable on July 2, 1994 for 108.003% of their principal amount. Should Original Bonds be retired with the Interim Funds, the proceeds of Refunding Bonds will be used to retire the Interim Funds. It is not anticipated that there would be a redemption premium associated with the retirement of the Interim Funds. The Refunding Bonds will be structured and issued under the documents and pursuant to the procedures applicable to the issuance of the Original Bonds, which documents and procedures are described in the Orders, or comparable documents with similar terms and provisions. The Interim Funds would be provided through one or more domestic or foreign financial institutions (``Interim Lenders''), which would make loans to the Lessors evidenced by notes issued by the Lessors. The term of the Interim Funds would be up to the remainder of the basic lease terms under the Leases. LP&L might assume the Interim Funds upon the occurrence of certain events or if it exercises certain purchase options under the Leases. The Interim Funds would be refunded with the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds. LP&L would use its best efforts to arrange for refunds with desirable interest rates as quickly as possible after the Interim Funds are required. LP&L is obligated to make payments under the Leases in amounts that will provide for scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due. Upon the refund of the Original Bonds, amounts payable by LP&L under the Leases will be adjusted pursuant to the terms of supplements to the Leases to be entered into. A similar procedure would be used if the Interim Funds are used. Neither the Refunding Bonds nor the Interim Funds will be direct obligations of or guaranteed by LP&L. However, under certain circumstances, LP&L might assume all or a portion of the Refunding Bonds of the Interim Funds. Each Refunding Bond will be secured by, inter alia, (i) A lien on and security interest in the Undivided Interest of the Lessor that issues the Refunding Bond and (ii) certain other amounts payable by LP&L thereunder. The notes of the Lessor in evidence of the Interim Funds would also be secured. The Refunding Bonds are to be issued in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof. Interest on the Refunding Bonds of each series will be payable January 2 and July 2 of each year to commence with the interest payment date after the initial issuance of the Refunding Bonds. Interest on Interim Funds could be paid on a different basis. The Refunding Bonds might be redeemed if a Lease is to be terminated prior to the end of the basic lease term provided for therein. Similar provisions would be applicable to the Interim Funds. Instead of Refunding Bonds issued through the Owner-Trustee, LP&L might arrange for a funding corporation to issue the Refunding Bonds, in which case the proceeds from Refunding Bonds would be loaned by the funding corporation to the Lessors, which would issue notes (``Lessor Notes'') to the funding corporation to evidence the loans and secure the Refunding Bonds, and the Lessors would use the loans to redeem the Original Bonds. The terms of the Lessor Notes and the indentures for their issuance would reflect the redemption and other terms of the Refunding Bonds. The rental payments of LP&L would be used for payments on principal and interest on the Lessor Notes, which payments would be used for payments on Refunding Bonds when due. The Refunding Bonds would be secured by the Lessor Notes, which would be secured by a lien on and security interest in the Undivided Interests and by certain rights under the Leases. An alternative to Refunding Bonds issued by the Owner-Trustee would be for LP&L to use a trust structure in which the Lessors would issue Lessor Notes to one or more passthrough trusts and the trusts would issue certificates in evidence of ownership interests in the trusts. The debt terms of the Refunding Bonds would be comparable to the terms of the Lessor Notes and the indentures for their issuance. LP&L might have some Refunding Bonds or trust certificates to be sold by competitive bidding, negotiated underwritten public offering, or private placement with institutional investors. LP&L intends to arrange the Interim Funds through commercial banks or similar institutions. LP&L believes that it would be impossible to sell the Refunding Bonds or the trust certificates, or to arrange the Interim Funds, by competitive bidding in accordance with Rule 50. Thus LP&L requests under Rule 50(a)(5) an exception from the competitive bidding requirements of the rule. LP&L further requests authorization to negotiate for the sale of the Refunding Bonds or the trust certificates or for the Interim Funds. It may do so. LP&L shall not have the Owner-Trustee sell the Refunding Bonds or the trust certificates, or acquire the Interim Funds, unless: (i) The estimated present value savings derived from the net difference between interest payments on a new issue of comparable securities and those securities refunded is, on an after-tax basis, in excess of the present value of all redemption and issuance costs, based on an appropriate discount rate, determined on the basis of the then estimated after-tax cost of capital of Entergy and its consolidated subsidiaries, or (ii) LP&L shall have obtained Commission authorization.
