MLADA FRONTA DNES asked First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra how he views the Partnership for Peace project and what the Czech Republic's attitude toward NATO is. [Schmarcz] The Czech Republic, unlike Poland, for example, has very positively accepted the Partnership for Peace project since the very beginning. Why? [Vondra] I would correct this statement slightly. We tried to influence the form of the Partnership for Peace project before it was on paper. We wanted the document to be far-reaching regarding the prospects of our membership in the Alliance and to allow maximum differentiation. This is what we have strived for in the past eight months--that is, since the idea was born. However, it seemed meaningless to us to sound the alarm when it was fairly clear how the Partnership for Peace would look. Moreover, it seems to us that the project represents the maximum of what the 16 NATO countries are able to agree upon. I believe this gives us sufficient room that we can use to push for our interests. [Schmarcz] Did the Czech Republic consider getting something more from the Alliance after the elections in Russia, as Poland did? [Vondra] I believe that this would not be a realistic policy. In the final stage, we will want to joint the Washington Treaty on NATO. For this, we will need the approval of the Czech Parliament and of the 16 parliaments of the member countries. If we raise unrealistic demands at this moment, some people might propose alternatives. We must realize that the Czech Republic has no other alternative. [Schmarcz] Can you tell us what the NATO reaction would be if the situation in Russia became worse? [Vondra] It is a positive fact about the Partnership for Peace program that it opens the possibility of real military consultations in case of a threat. If the United States has clearly said, through its President, that the Czech Republic's security is in U.S. vital interests, then it means that, to a large extent, they are anticipating our membership. We were assured during the talks that, if the situation deteriorated, particularly in the East, the Alliance's open policy would have to be replaced by "the policy of containment after the Cold War." This time, we would be on the same side as democracy and the free market. [Schmarcz] When will the Czech Republic join NATO, in your view? [Vondra] If there is political will on both sides, this does not have to take much time. In any case, I would like this country to be firmly anchored to the territory on which the values of Western civilization prevail and where it is possible to protect them. [Schmarcz] Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev said that Russia could join NATO, but there are other possibilities. What are they? [Vondra] Minister Kozyrev spoke very clearly about Russian endeavors at the most recent CSCE meeting: They want to radicalize [radikalizovat] the institutions of which Russia is a member, be it the CSCE or the Council for North Atlantic Cooperation. The reason is simple: These bodies do not allow the Alliance to come closer to the individual countries, and Russian clout is greater there, of course. [Schmarcz] How do you view Russia's role in the Partnership for Peace project--in view of the rejective declarations on NATO's expansion? [Vondra] Russia will try to push for its interests, of course, particularly in its immediate neighborhood, as has been declared not only by the dark forces of Russian politics but also by Russian democrats. To a certain extent, this is quite legitimate, and I believe that our task is to keep the Czech state where it has belonged during all of its existence. I believe that we are not in the sphere of direct Russian interest, but that does not mean that we should not cooperate with Russia, in the commercial sphere, for instance.
