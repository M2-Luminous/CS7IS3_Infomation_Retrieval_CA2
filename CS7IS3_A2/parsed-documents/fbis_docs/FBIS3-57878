Durao Barroso is chairing a seminar for ambassadors, heads of missions and top-ranking Foreign Ministry officials in Lisbon. It started this morning and will continue tomorrow. The aim of the seminar is to define the main objectives of Portuguese foreign policy. Human rights and East Timor are the main concerns. Candido de Azevedo reports: [Azevedo] The Portuguese foreign policy team has been meeting since this morning at Necessidades Palace [Foreign Ministry building] with Foreign Minister Durao Barroso. For two days, ambassadors, heads of missions and top-ranking officials will be appraising 1993 and looking at the best way to achieve Portugal's main diplomatic objectives in 1994. [Begin recording] [Barroso] There are many important sectors, but our main battlefront, if you like, is Europe and the European Union: To deepen the process of European union while always affirming Portugal's permanent and specific interests in Europe. [Azevedo] Minister, I noticed that you paid particular attention to the question of Timor in your speech. At the moment is there a possibility of positive developments coming from Indonesia? [Barroso] As I said, it is too early to draw that conclusion. There was recently a positive gesture, namely the release of seven Timorese students, but the basic question is far, very far indeed, from being resolved. Only with perseverance and much patience will we be able to envisage some progress in the future regarding this matter. [Azevedo] Minister, just one more question: The question of Africa, namely Angola and Mozambique. At this stage of the peace process, do you believe 1994 could see the end of the war in these countries? [Barroso] I do not want to make a prognosis, but I want to express a wish, and the wish is precisely that 1994 will be the year in which Angola and Mozambique finally find the peace their peoples so deserve.
