The existing law on BIS is valid until the end of the first half of this year, and, therefore, a new law has to be adopted. We have asked interim BIS Director Stanislav Devaty, who defended the bill in parliament, to what extent the new laws will be of benefit to the work of intelligence services. [Devaty] Parliament has decided that the system of intelligence services should be regulated by a law. This law should apply to all intelligence services because, until now, we have had a comprehensive law on BIS only. Parliament has decided that a new concept for intelligence services will be created. New special regulations for each service should be built on this concept. Ours has been drafted. Of course, it is difficult to invent something new in the sphere of intelligence services, but we have drafted this bill using our own experience and foreign experience. [Bednar] According to the bill, the government wants to take over the control of intelligence services, apart from giving them assignments. Have you not been satisfied with the existing way of control? [Devaty] I have said it about a hundred times: I am not against control at all. On the contrary, I welcome any kind of control. In principle, I am only against control bodies having access to open cases. We have a sort of gentleman's agreement with the control body: I am willing to let them have access to any operation any time, but such an operation must be closed first. The problem is that our responsibility should be balanced. That is, if I open records on something, I must have a very good reason for it. One cannot have access to an operation in progress without having a reason or just because someone says so. Someone must bear responsibility for the operation being stopped. Deputies must be aware of the fact that it may have serious consequences if, having access to our work, they prevent a certain operation from continuing. [Bednar] Has full responsibility been transferred to the government whose task is to control you, then? [Devaty] Control should be divided between the government and parliament. As long as the government is to be responsible for the activity of the [intelligence] services, it also has to have a chance of controlling this service in some way. This is logical. Now, we have to find a balance between the government's interference in the work of the [intelligence] services and parliament's access to their activity. [Bednar] Does it trouble you that you have not been appointed BIS director permanently? [Devaty] To be sincere, it does bother me quite a lot, not so much because of myself but because it means, in fact, permanent "uncertainty within the firm." In view of the fact that I have already been two years with BIS, that this "firm" has developed in a certain way, and that we even implemented a certain concept, I believe that it does not much contribute to the security of the people who are employed there if no permanent director has been appointed. Before me, there were seven directors there. Such changes are not to the benefit of the service, in the same way that they would not be to the benefit of any other organization. [Bednar] Does this obstruct reconstruction of the service? [Devaty] We are trying to eliminate the influence of this fact on the reconstruction of the service, but we can feel that people are insecure. Each director brings his own ideas, and this means certain changes to the intelligence service, a shock. The intelligence service has been through so many shocks it needs a period of peace, in my opinion. We already have arrived at a certain model, and now we need at least two years of peace to be able to develop our activity. [Bednar] Why has the decision on the director still not been made? [Devaty] I do not know. The government, as well as parliament, have their say in the matter--still according to the old law. The fact is that I have been appointed precisely according to the law. I was proposed by the government at that time, the appropriate parliamentary committee discussed the proposal, and I was appointed by the Czech National Council Presidium. Unfortunately, they used the word "interim." Why this still is the case, I do not know.
