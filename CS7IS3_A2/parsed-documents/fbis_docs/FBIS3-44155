The president of the new parliament will be the archbishop of Kisingani, Laurent Monsengwo, who had chaired the High Council of the Republic (HCR) set up in 1992 by a national conference. His first deputy president will be the former head of the rival National Assembly, consisting mainly of supporters of President Mobutu Sese Seko, Anzulini Bembe, the sources said. The appointments were made in a parliamentary session late Tuesday, but the radical opposition had not named their candidate for premier of the central African country, prolonging a deadlock that has led to more than two years of political turmoil and economic chaos. The radical opposition coalition Holy Alliance has stated it wants the deputy chairman of the former HCR, Joseph Ileo, to be its candidate, but its self-styled allies want other candidates and said they have not been consulted by the Holy Alliance.
