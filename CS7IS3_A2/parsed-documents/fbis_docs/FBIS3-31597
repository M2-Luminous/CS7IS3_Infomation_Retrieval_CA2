In this context our correspondent asked the leader of this group Ludovit Cernak for a comment. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] How will the situation that has arisen affect the Slovak domestic political scene as a whole? [Cernak] It will affect the domestic political situation. We have to find a proper place, a place we belong to. We will have to do this, so that a normal voter would recognize whose policies are demagogic and who is genuinely interested in defending Slovakia's interests. In the medium term, given the people we have, given their ideas and their potential, I dare say I will very quickly build a nationally oriented alternative for Slovakia, an alternative that will not play second fiddle in the early parliamentary elections. [Correspondent] In what way are you going to sort out the situation of the SNS National Democratic group in the parliament? [Cernak] It is likely that the decision to expel us and to urge us to surrender our mandates will not be made in the parliament. But no matter what happens, we will retain our membership in the deputies' group we have created and we will be implementing the policy which the whole group and not only our faction should have represented. We will give the correct names to all the deeds and all the mishaps, so that the Slovak voter will not succumb to populism again, so that this voter can compare words with deeds. [passage omitted]
