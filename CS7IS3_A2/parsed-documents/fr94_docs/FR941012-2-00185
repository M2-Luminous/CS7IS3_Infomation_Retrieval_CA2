FR941012-2-00185 FR941012-2-00117 FTA urges that grantees incorporate to the extent possible the concepts of ``livable communities'' into the transit and planning projects funded with Federal assistance being made available by this Notice and funds transferred from highway programs. The Livable Communities Initiative recognizes that transit programs can be instrumental in shaping the nature of community development and represent an important tool for enhancing the vitality of individual communities and neighborhoods served by our regional transit systems. Transit facilities and stations can become energetic local activity centers providing convenient shopping, business, and educational opportunities as well as other needed social services like health and day care. They can serve as focal points for attractive mixed used development. Transit services, appropriately sized to community needs, can bind the community together and provide an environmentally attractive alternative to automobile travel and a safe and affordable means of transport for those who might otherwise find it difficult to have full access to community activities. Livable communities concepts include: (1) Careful coordination of transit planning with community development planning leading to neighborhoods where housing, schools, and parks are within easy walking distance of user-friendly transit that links residents with local social and economic services and jobs; (2) alternatives to the automobile such as transit, pedestrian, and bicycle access and operational improvements such as guaranteed ride home services, neighborhood shuttles, and user-friendly fare collection systems that encourage transit use; (3) mixed-use neighborhoods with residential areas complemented by office and commercial development, green or open spaces, and public services (also transit facilities such as major bus stops or train stations are designed to include , other enterprises that are useful to transit passengers, e.g., day care centers); (4) safe, secure, and customer-friendly streets, transit facilities, and pedestrian walkways; and (5) full community participation in the decision-making process by neighborhood organizations, small and minority businesses, and interested individuals. FTA will soon be issuing guidance on the Livable Communities Initiative. This initiative will highlight and demonstrate the benefits of livable communities by providing technical assistance along with a limited amount of funding for planning and capital grants. C. 1996 Summer Olympic Games The 1995 DOT Appropriations Act has made available $16,000,000 for costs associated with unique transportation requirements of the Centennial Olympic Games and Paralympic Games, which will take place in Atlanta, Georgia, in summer 1996. These funds will be used for the round-trip delivery costs and preparation of roughly 2,000 buses being made available by transit authorities around the country to support the unique transportation requirements of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. D. Project Management Set-Aside 49 U.S.C. 5327 (formerly Section 23 of the FT Act), allows the Secretary of Transportation to use not more than one-half of one percent of the funds made available under the Capital Program, the Urbanized Area Formula and Nonurbanized Area Formula Programs, the National Capital Transportation Act, as amended, and the Interstate Substitute Transit Program, and an additional one-quarter of one percent of Capital Program funds, to contract with any person to oversee the construction of any major project under these statutory programs and to conduct safety, procurement, management and financial reviews and audits. Therefore, one-half of one percent of the funds appropriated for fiscal year 1995 for the programs noted above, and three-quarters of one percent of Capital Program funds have been reserved for this purpose before apportionment of the funds. IV. Urbanized Area Formula Program (Formerly Section 9) A. Total Urbanized Area Formula Apportionments In addition to the appropriated fiscal year 1995 Urbanized Area Formula funds of $2,283,921,213, the apportionment also includes $24,351,386 in deobligated Urbanized Area Formula funds (including formerly Section 5 formula funds) which have become available for reapportionment under the Urbanized Area Formula Program as provided for under 49 U.S.C. 5336(i) (formerly section 9(o)). Table 2 displays the amount apportioned for the Urbanized Area Formula Program. After the one-half percent set-aside ($11,419,606), the amount appropriated under this program is $2,272,501,607. The funds to be reapportioned, described in the previous paragraph, were then added. Thus, the total amount apportioned for this program is $2,296,852,993. B.
