Portnikov, under the "Carte Blanche" rubric: "Leonid Kuchma Gets Air Time on Ostankino. Is It Better To Conduct a Ukrainian Election Campaign in Russia?"] [Text] Last Sunday, viewers of television Channel 1 could have seen two leaders of the unions of industrialists: the Russian Arkadiy Volskiy and Ukrainian Leonid Kuchma appearing on a program called "Dialogue on the Air," whose guests as a rule are heads of new independent states and other formations on the territory of the former Soviet Union. Even though the organizers of the program repeatedly stressed that it is in no way connected with the presidential campaign currently under way in Ukraine, it was clear that Leonid Kuchma had acquired a brilliant opportunity to present his program appealing to an audience far broader than that of the Ukrainian TV. It is not necessary to be a prophet in order to predict that in the next several weeks Leonid Kuchma will be a frequent guest on Channel 1. In Moscow, it appears, they now believe that it is specifically this politician who is best disposed toward Russia, the most tractable, and the most susceptible to pressure compared with other presidential candidates, and mainly compared with the present head of the Ukrainian state Leonid Kravchuk and the reformist economist Vladimir Lanovyy. This means that air time on Ostankino must become that sail which will accelerate the presidential campaign ship of the retired prime minister. This approach, however, also incorporates a serious political error. For Ukraine, television Channel 1 is a program coming from an alien territory and often, how would it be possible to say this gently, it is, if not discredited, at least received with some slight irony by consumers of political information. Naturally, the "Ostankino effect" was very well reflected in the results of the referendum on independence. There was a no more systematic critic of that decision than the TV liberated from party control, and the result? Therefore, in order to ensure the victory of Leonid Kravchuk at the polls, it is simply necessary to curse him more frequently on Ostankino TV and praise Leonid Kuchma more often. Even though true followers of the former prime minister will hardly be scared off by that. Getting the possibility of presenting his program to an audience of millions, Kuchma, however, did not reveal the existence of such a program. For almost a year he repeated the same formula: An economic union with Russia is necessary. He condemned Ukrainian leadership for isolationism, as if forgetting that it was specifically he who failed to achieve any real agreement with either Gaydar or Chernomyrdin. The reason for that, naturally, is not any personal lack of desire to reach agreement with the Russians, but the unwillingness of the former prime minister and the military-industrial, lobby which brought him to the summit of power, to reform the Ukrainian economy. It was under Kuchma that Russia, simply speaking, had nothing to talk about with Ukraine. The appearance of Kuchma on the television screen in the company of Arkadiy Volskiy, a respected politician who proposed for Russia specifically that path which was used "to reform" the Ukrainian economy, who was still not supported by the voters, demonstrated that one must not expect reforms should Leonid Kuchma regain power. In that case, what occurs? Economic union with Russia? But using what formula? The Belarus one does not appeal to Kuchma: "Nothing is working out for us with regard to them," he confessed in a disappointed way. All of the other formulas turn out to be strictly declarative. Who but Leonid Kuchma himself, who in the final days of his tenure travelled almost incognito to see Viktor Chernomyrdin with a request for help and was not understood in Moscow, could explain that better than others to Leonid Kuchma? Nevertheless, Kuchma actually did reveal his principal aim in the TV appearance, beside the illusory economic union. Preservation of big industry, indicating a lack of understanding of objective laws of economic reforms in favoring such preservation, which was noted even by the television viewers--that was expressed and belabored by the long-term party secretary of the famous Yuzhmash. There is little doubt that if he is elected president, Leonid Kuchma will preserve that industry at any cost. But what will happen to Ukraine?
