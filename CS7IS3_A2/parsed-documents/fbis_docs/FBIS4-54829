Senada Cumurovic reports: [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] Upon receiving the credentials of Dr. Johannes Preisinger, German ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Izetbegovic said: [Izetbegovic] In you, as an individual, we greet all the German citizens who, through numerous manifestations of a moral and political nature, supported our struggle for freedom, and who, through various types of help extended to our people, stood steadfastly by us. In addition to this, with this act, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has once again proven its indisputable support of our independence and sovereignty. Your country was among the first to recognize us and, in addition to this, before the Serbian and Montenegrin attack, Germany had a clear position and an authentic vision of the tragic developments if the aggression was not prevented by all the means available to the international community. The Federal Republic of Germany is currently a second home to 350,000 citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Your country has provided shelter to the greatest number of refugees and expelled Bosnians. It is not only numbers that speak of the generosity of the German authorities toward our citizens, but also the way in which our people have been received throughout your country. The economic and legal status of our refugees has been optimally regulated in Germany until conditions are established for their safe return. All this testifies to the fact that Germany is not only great in an economic and political sense, but it means that your country is also great in respect to its choice of social aims. Please convey our gratitude and respect to the president of the republic, Mr. Richard von Weizsaecker, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Bundestag Chairman Rita Suessmuth, and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Ambassador Preisinger, I welcome you to our country and wish you great success in your mission. [Cumurovic] Dr. Johannes Preisinger is the 12th ambassador in Bosnia-Herzegovina that has presented his credentials. [end recording]
