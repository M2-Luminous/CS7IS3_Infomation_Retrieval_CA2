On the contrary, the population of Vladivostok sighed with relief, he told Interfax on Thursday. "The public welcomed with applause the news that the mayor's duties will be performed by Konstantin Tolstoshein," he said. Viktor Cherepkov was removed from office on Wednesday on charges of bribe-taking. According to Interfax sources, the police had to use force to oust Cherepkov from his office. To quote Lebedintsev, policemen virtually carried him out of city hall. Legal action was started against the city administration more than a month ago. The investigators believe that they have collected enough evidence for accusing Cherepkov of bribe-taking. The Maritime Territorial Administration has appointed Konstantin Tolstoshein, the former head of the Pervorechensk Regional Administration (the Vladivostok Region) to the post of acting mayor of Vladivostok. For health reasons Cherepkov has not been questioned yet as a defendant.
