Hosokawa officially offered his resignation to an emergency cabinet meeting after he made a surprise announcement to the hastily summoned leaders of the coalition partners, coalition officials said. Hosokawa, explaining his decision to the coalition leaders, cited the stymied Diet business due to scandal charges over his two dubious financial deals. He also said a new problem has been uncovered about his personal financial management. He did not specify the issue. It is not known when the cabinet will resign en bloc, the officials said. Hosokawa, who was swept to power last August with a vow to clean up corruption, has been under attack over a shady loan from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., a scandal-tainted trucking firm, and the purchase of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone [NTT] Corp., a telecommunications giant. The row over the deals have led to a stalemate in parliament, paralyzing the deliberations on the budget for fiscal 1994, which started April 1. Hosokawa's public approval rate, which hit 70 percent immediately after he took the helm, has been plummeting in recent weeks, according to various media surveys. Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, is viewed among many coalition members as the most plausible candidate to succeed Hosokawa. Hosokawa made the announcement only two days after a media frenzy over reports on his joking about quitting, which Hosokawa strongly denied. The dogging corruption charges concerning the financial deal makings have taken a heavy toll on Hosokawa's public support and undermined his already-shaky leadership in the seven-party coalition, political sources said. Hosokawa reiterated at a meeting with the coalition leaders that he repaid the 100 million yen loan in 1982 from Sagawa and dismissed any corruption charges over an NTT share purchase, which the premier has claimed was a deal by his late father-in-law. But he said he should take the responsibility for the current Diet turmoil that has been caused by his personal affairs. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party has been boycotting the debates at the House of Representatives Budget Committee, demanding a Diet testimony of Hosokawa's former aide, who was in charge of his financial affairs when he borrowed the money from Sagawa. Revelations that Sagawa was at the center of a money-and-mobster scandal involving some LDP members helped topple the party from power after nearly four decades of often-corrupt rule, and paved the way for Hosokawa's alliance of conservative LDP splinter groups and traditional opposition parties like the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Pursuing his avowed goal of cleansing the nation's politics of corruption, Hosokawa pushed through a political reform package in January that replaces multiseat districts with a combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation seats. But his political standing was weakened after he was forced by strong opposition from within his own coalition to withdraw his announced plan to introduce a new value-added tax to replace the current consumption tax. Recent corruption allegations came on top of the tax fiasco and an aborted plan for a cabinet reshuffle, which widened the hiatus between Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Hosokawa's announcement Friday took both coalition partners and the opposition camp by surprise although speculation has been rife over his resignation. Foreign Minister Hata, head of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), told reporters he had heard nothing about Hosokawa's intention. Asked if he was surprised, Hata said, ''of course.'' Michio Watanabe of the LDP, a former foreign minister, said he was surprised at the prime minister's abrupt decision. Coalition leaders are still uncertain about the issue of Hosokawa's successor, but some Shinseito officials mentioned Hata. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said the coalition partners will immediately start discussing a replacement to avoid any political vacuum. Hajime Funada, a Shinseito executive in charge of election affairs, said he favors Hata as the person to succeed Hosokawa. "It is a natural course for our party to seek Hata's premiership," he said.
