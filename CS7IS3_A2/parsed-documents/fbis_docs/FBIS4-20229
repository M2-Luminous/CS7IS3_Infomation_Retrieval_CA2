Anguita also enlarged on the idea already expressed by him on other occasions of demanding a policy of democratic economic planning, and asserted the need to meet the challenge of transforming Spain into a federal state. The United Left-Initiative for Catalonia leader asserted that the current situation necessitates "making a decision," and added that he is convinced that on the Socialist benches "there will be somebody capable of taking up the mandate which his political force received in the polls last 6 June." In Anguita's opinion, Gonzalez's resignation, which he demanded "quite calmly but with complete responsibility," "is necessary." Anguita described a scene marked by "economic disorder, social disorder, political disorder, moral disorder, and ethical disorder." From there he leapt to the demand for Gonzalez's resignation, and immediately asserted that his group calls for "hope" and "optimism." Anguita continued in that tone, openly addressing the public, not just the house, in dwelling on his call "for courage." He then tackled the problem of the reform of economic policy, and, taking as his basis Article 128 of the Constitution ("All the country's wealth in its various forms, regardless of its ownership, is subordinate to the general interest"), he proceeded to explain the need to get under way the democratic planning of the economy. In Anguita's opinion, this means "the management of collective demand, meeting basic needs in housing, public transport, health, and education," and performing, he said, "the task of a compass and guide for private enterprise." Public Sector So that no doubts would be left about his overall view of the economy through planning, he deemed it essential to link to this "a boost for a strong democratized public sector." In this field he took specific steps in saying that a strong public sector is also necessary for the financial system, and "would begin with an immediate halt to the privatization of Argentaria, making it the financial driving force for the small- and medium-sized enterprises and cooperatives." He took yet another step in spelling out his economic proposals in asserting from the rostrum the need for "the Argentaria corporation to purchase Banesto [Credit Bank of Spain]," and rejecting independence for the Bank of Spain, a bill approved by parliament. The last feature of his economic policy was to demand "the workers full participation in business decisions which affect them, especially with respect to setting up compulsory investment funds to channel part of business profits into job creation." Anguita did not abandon his stance of radical reforms, and tackled the need to build a federal state, convinced, he said, "that building that state on the basis of the existing constitutional situation is a matter of acceptance, commitment, and supportive action." The United Left leader admitted that that federal state would entail, among other things, an extensive reorganization of local administration and turning the Senate into a house of territorial representation, and he added the concomitant of "Armed Forces based on the professional status of all their members." Anguita delved into Europe, with new proposals for complete change. He himself asserted that "a radical change" is needed in the building of Europe. He concluded with a number of proposals for transforming current political conduct, the "obscure foundations of which underpin corruption." Anguita said it is necessary to reform the electoral system, the Congress and the Senate, Justice, the National Audit Office and parliamentary oversight of public expenditure, the election of the institutions' bodies, the Economic and Social Council, the Spanish Radio and Television System charter, the public administrations, and the funding of parties.
