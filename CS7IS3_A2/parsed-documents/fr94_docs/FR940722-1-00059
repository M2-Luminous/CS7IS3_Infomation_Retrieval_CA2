FR940722-1-00059 FR940722-1-00012 14 CFR Part 91 Agriculture, Aircraft, Airmen, Airports, Air traffic control, Aviation safety, Canada, Cuba, Freight, Mexico, Noise control, Political candidates, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Safety, Smoking. The Proposed Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend parts 23 and 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 23 and 91) as follows: PART 23_AIRWORTHINESS STANDARDS: NORMAL, UTILITY, ACROBATIC, AND COMMUTER CATEGORY AIRPLANES 1. The authority citation for part 23 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1344, 1354(a), 1355, 1421, 1423, 1425, 1428, 1429, 1430; 49 U.S.C. 106(g). 2. Section 23.677 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: §23.677 Trim systems. (a) Proper precautions must be taken to prevent inadvertent, improper, or abrupt trim tab operation. There must be means near the trim control to indicate to the pilot the direction of trim control movement relative to airplane motion. In addition, there must be means to indicate to the pilot the position of the trim device with respect to both the range of adjustment and, in the case of lateral and directional trim, the neutral position. This means must be visible to the pilot and must be located and designed to prevent confusion. The pitch trim indicator must be clearly marked with a position or range within which it has been demonstrated that take-off is safe for all center or gravity positions and each flap position approved for takeoff. * * * * * 3. A new §23.691 is added to read as follows: §23.691 Artificial stall barrier system. If the function of an artificial stall barrier, for example, stick pusher, is necessary to show compliance with §23.201(c), the system must comply with the following: (a) With the system adjusted for operation, the plus and minus airspeeds at which downward pitching control will be provided must be established. (b) Considering the plus and minus airspeed tolerances established by paragraph (a) of this section, and airspeed must be selected for the activation of the downward pitching control that provides a safe margin above any airspeed at which any unsatisfactory stall characteristics occur. (c) In addition to the stall warning required by §23.207, a warning that is clearly distinguishable to the pilot under all expected flight conditions without requiring the pilot's attention, must be provided for faults that would prevent the system from providing the required pitching motion. (d) Each system must be designed so that the artificial stall barrier can be quickly and positively disengaged by the pilots to prevent unwanted downward pitching of the airplane by a quick release (emergency) control that meets the requirements of §23.1329(b). (e) A preflight check of the complete system must be established and the procedure for this check made available in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). Preflight checks that are critical to the safety of the airplane must be included in the limitations section of the AFM. (f) For those airplanes whose design includes an autopilot system: (1) A quick release (emergency) control installed in accordance with §23.1329(b) may be used to meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, and (2) The pitch servo for that system may be used to provide the stall downward pitching motion. (g) In showing compliance with §23.1309, the system must be evaluated to determine the effect that any announced or unannounced failure may have on the continued safe flight and landing of the airplane or the ability of the crew to cope with any adverse conditions that may result from such failures. This evaluation must consider the hazards that would result from the airplane's flight characteristics if the system was not provided, and the hazard that may result from unwanted downward pitching motion, which could result from failures at airspeeds above the selected stall speed.
