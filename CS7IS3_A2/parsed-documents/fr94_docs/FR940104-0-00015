FR940104-0-00015 FR940104-0-00003 Tenneco's request that the Commission clarify that the contemporaneous disclosure requirement for information regarding on-system sales and marketing information conveyed by the pipeline to its marketing affiliate applies only to the transmission of information by the transportation personnel of the pipeline and not to transmission of information by the unbundled merchant personnel of the pipeline is moot. The Commission notes, however, that standard (f), in any form, applies only to the pipeline in its relationship with its marketing affiliate, and now, because of Order No. 636, its unbundled merchant division is the functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate. B. The Elimination of the Filing of Form 592 1. Requests for Rehearing The Indicated Parties assert that the Commission erred in permitting interstate pipelines to cease to submit the affiliated transportation log (Form 592) 90 days after the Commission has determined that an individual pipeline is in full compliance with Order No. 636. The Indicated Parties submit that the information available on Form 592 may be more essential after a pipeline complies fully with Order No. 636 than it is now. The Indicated Parties state that following full compliance with Order No. 636, an interstate pipeline will be permitted to sell natural gas at negotiated prices. In this environment, the Indicated Parties argue that such a pipeline may be motivated to favor its own sales of gas as well as sales made by its marketing affiliates. For example, the Indicated Parties contend that to obtain a sale at the expense of other sellers, a pipeline could sell its gas at a loss or a very low price, but charge the full transportation rate. The Indicated Parties assert that this would allow the pipeline to avoid the correlative discount rule under ยง161.3(i), and charge all other sellers the maximum transportation rate rather than discounting to obtain the transportation business. The Indicated Parties argue that to remain competitive, non-affiliated sellers would be forced to reduce their gas prices below what they would charge if the pipeline discounted its transportation rates rather than the price at which the pipeline merchant function sells its gas. The Indicated Parties contend that the non-affiliated sellers would suffer a loss because they would be forced to sell their gas at a loss and pay the full transportation rate. The Indicated Parties assert that the pipeline, however, would not suffer the same economic detriment because it would receive the full transportation rate on the movement of its gas. The Indicated Parties submit that they and other competing merchants will be unable to monitor and detect such favoritism without the information provided on Form 592. The Indicated Parties assert that the difficulty with the elimination of the filing of Form 592 is that the Commission and the industry have no experience with the operation of EBBs by a pipeline in full compliance with Order No. 636. The Indicated Parties argue that the Commission cannot find that the EBBs will prove to be a reliable and accurate source of the information now supplied on Form 592. The Indicated Parties state that in light of this practical experience, the Commission recently requested comments on the configuration and operation of EBBs in Docket No. RM93&hyph;4&hyph;000. The Indicated Parties state that in the list of questions on which comments were requested the Commission asked whether ``any of this information [available on the EBBs can] be used to fulfill existing FERC reporting requirements?'' The Indicated Parties contend that this request demonstrates that the EBBs are an unproven means of communicating the information now available on Form 592. The Indicated Parties state that even though it had requested comments on whether it could eliminate any of its current reporting requirements, the Commission, without even waiting for an answer to its question, erroneously assumed in Order No. 497&hyph;D that the answer would be ``yes'' and eliminated one of its reporting requirements. The Indicated Parties submit that the disparity between the requests for comments and the elimination of a reporting requirement in Order No. 497&hyph;D demonstrates that the Commission acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner without substantial evidence in eliminating the filing of Form 592. The Indicated Parties assert that the Commission has failed to protect the public interest with its elimination of the requirement that pipelines file Form 592. The Indicated Parties argue that the Commission should grant rehearing and reinstate the requirement that pipelines file Form 592. Hadson also asserts that the Commission erred in eliminating the filing of Form 592. Hadson states that under Order No. 636 pipelines will be able to conduct an essentially deregulated gas merchant business under the pipeline's corporate entity and while sharing key personnel. Hadson contends that this arrangement, which it does not oppose in and of itself, nonetheless creates additional opportunities for the pipeline-transporter to favor both its own merchant division as well as its affiliates and that this increases rather than diminishes the need for public scrutiny. Hadson argues that, at a minimum, deregulating the pipeline-merchant can certainly not be invoked as grounds for a decrease in the need for public monitoring by the industry watchdog. Finally, Hadson notes that even requiring the same information to be disclosed on an EBB is materially different from requiring the information to be filed with the Commission under the Natural Gas Act since filings with the Commission are subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001 while postings on an EBB are probably not.
