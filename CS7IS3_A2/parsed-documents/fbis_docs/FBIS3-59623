Goy of the General Directorate for Energy (DG XVII), European Communities Commission, THERMIE, Brussels: "THERMIE: EC Aid for Nonnuclear Energy Technologies; Small and Medium-Sized Companies Given Preference; Goals Are Energy Conservation and CO2 Reduction"] [Text] HANDELSBLATT-TL, 23 Nov--For more than 15 years now the EC has been providing aid for the development, demonstration, and, lastly, also the first steps in introducing new, innovative, and efficient energy technologies on the market in Europe. In the process, almost 3,000 projects have so far been financially supported by the EC with a total of about 1.9 billion ECU [European currency units], initially through various demonstration programs and since 1990 through the new THERMIE (Energy Technology for Energy Control) program. The THERMIE program (EEC Council Decree No. 2008/90, ABL No. 185 of 17 July 1990) is designed for the five-year period, 1990-1994, and thus ends next year. It is provided with an average volume of about 700 million ECU; that is, about 150-170 million ECU a year are available to promote nonnuclear energy technologies in the member countries. The current debate in the Commission and the Council of Ministers on the inclusion of a successor tto the THERMIE program in the EC's fourth general research program and the effects of the budget in connection with it will decide what sort of role aid for energy technologies will assume within the Community area in the future and also, based on it, to a greater extent in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe bordering on the EC as well as the countries bordering on the Mediterranean. THERMIE concentrates on three main areas: - Financial support for projects that promote innovative energy technologies that are ready for application; - Measures for the introduction into the market and deployment of new energy technologies; - Coordination of EC-wide as well as national, regional, and local activities in this field. The THERMIE program enables the EC to provide financial support for: a) innovative projects: These projects are expected to develop new kinds of technologies, methods, or products (TMP) for which the research and development stage has been essentially completed to the point of readiness for application and to promote new kinds of applications for already known TMP. This type of project is expected to prove the technical and economic viability of new technologies by means of an initial production run on a sufficiently large scale. b) dissemination projects: The goal of these projects is to promote innovative TMP that have already undergone an initial production run, but which, because of ongoing risks, it has hitherto not yet been possible to successfully market and for which there are now really good chances of their wider application in the Community, whether it be under other economic or geographical conditions or with the aid of different technical versions. c) targeted projects: If the Commission considers it necessary and has identified an unfilled public need, that is, significant technological advances are to be anticipated through cooperation between persons or firms from at least two member countries, the implementation of special projects, which must be oriented in terms of the Commission's detailed specifications, may be sponsored on the initiative of the Commission, that is, their coordination may be financially supported (so-called "targeted projects"). Aid for Projects and Accompanying Measures The THERMIE program covers all nonnuclear energy technologies that can make innovative contributions in the sectors: - Energy conservation, that is, efficient use of energy, specifically in the subsectors: - buildings, - industry, - the energy industry, - transport and communications; - New and renewable sources of energy in the subsectors: - photovoltaics, - solar energy, - biomass, - geothermy, - small hydroelectric power plants, - wind energy; - Solid fuels, and; - Hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas). About 85 percent of the funds is earmarked for direct project aid and about 15 percent for "accompanying measures." The aid is provided in the form of a direct subsidy which does not have to be repaid even if the project is a commercial success, specifically, up to 40 percent of the costs that qualify for subsidization for innovative and "targeted" projects and up to 35 percent for dissemination projects. The projects are to be implemented within the confines of the Community, but there may be exceptions. In any case, safety provisions and those relevant to the environment in effect at any given time must be complied with. When the cost of a project exceeds an investment figure of 6 million ECU, the applicants from at least two member countries must come to document the European dimension of the project. Furthermore, while, of course, basic technical feasibility and marketability of the technologies are required, there must also be difficulties in financing because of technical and/or economic risks in realizing the projects for which subsidies are applied for to obtain aid. Projects that materialize through the collaboration of firms from several member countries, are to be implemented by small and medium-sized companies, and/or are established in economically less developed regions of the Community are given preference. The more of these criteria the applicant meets, the more chance he has of influencing the success rate of 1:4 (selected versus applied-for projects) in his favor. This is to be viewed as a reform of the present program vis-a-vis its predecessors in that support for efficient energy technologies is not limited to only those projects that have already been subsidized by the EC. But rather THERMIE also provides aid for the introduction into the market of technologies that have already been readied for market as part of national or other public programs as well as by industry alone, that is, without any public subsidy. The "accompanying measures" that are included in the THERMIE program as an additional reform are expected to in particular see to the dissemination of the results of the projects or reports on the respective technologies. They may not discriminate against any firm, but are available largely free of charge to interested parties as a service of the program and to improve market openness. The most important tasks, which are covered by the organizations for the promotion of energy technologies, the so-called OPETS, set up to take care of them, apply to: - The effecting of market studes as well as analyses of the chances of introducing innovative energy technologies and studies of the effects of environmental policy during on-the-spot operation as well as the importance of regional policy for them, and more besides, - The dissemination of reports on the projects and technologies through the collection, editing, and preparation of informational material (brochures, leaflets, technical reports, translations into the language of the country); the organization of and participation in appropriate events, seminars, and conferences; the organization of project tours for, for example, journalists and interested parties from inside and outside the country; and the development and maintenance of data banks (Sesame, etc.). - The construction of tranfer points (public and private) at local, regional, or national levels. In selecting these OPETS, of which there are, at present, 40 throughout Europe, the Commission chose a decentralized approach that could fall back on individual organizations specializing in energy sectors in the member countries. They form a network of private firms (in many cases engineer's offices), professional organizaitons, public (energy) agencies and institutes that are active on regional or national levels and can if necessary fall back on a potential total of about 3,000 energy experts. These OPETS receive financial support form the Commission for their cooperation in the amount of from 13 to 15 million ECU a year to carry out 200 actions within the framework of the THERMIE program. In addition, with the Commission's decision of December 1991, some OPETS were commissioned to establish so-called EC energy centers in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and to coordinate their activities. To date 14 energy centers in national or regional capitals of the former CEMA have launched their activities. Their job consists of in particular facilitating and promoting the transfer of knowledge and technology between the European Community and these countries. Each of these centers is headed by a director appointed by the Commission who is supported by a local representative, a number of energy experts, and the necessary administrative personnel. In addition, if necessary energy experts from the member countries are also employed in them for certain missions subject to time limits. Priming for Reproductions Recent analyses commissioned by the Commission and conducted by independent experts prove that energy savings of or an energyproduction amounting to 1.5 million tons of crude oil units (ROeE) could be obtained with the help of the THERMIE program and its predecessors through the projects themselves (first application), and especially, of course, in the areas of efficient use of energy and exploitation of renewable sources of energy. This amounts to 0.2 percent of the EC's energy needs. If we consider how the EC intends to allocate funds for this, namely by providing strong support through the THERMIE program, especially for all technologies for which a great potential for reproduction can be presumed, we get a more impressive picture of the situation. if we include those reproductions of successfully completed EC projects that have to date already been launched and are yet to be anticipated with a high degree of probability, up to 18 million tons of ROeE--and, if the at this time known potential for these energy technologies is fully exhausted, theoretically even as much as 120 million tons of ROeE--a year can be saved or replaced with the aid of renewable sources of energy throughout all of Europe. In the process, CO<sup> 2</sup> emissions in the EC could at the same time be reduced by as much as 15 percent and, of course, be applied to the current level of about 3 billion tons of CO<sup> 2</sup> emissions in the EC. An achievement, therefore, that would have to make people sit up and take notice if we bear in mind the EC's goal of stabilizing CO<sup> 2</sup> emissions in the Community at the 1990 level by the year 2000. Realistically viewed, however, we have to assume that this potential would only have a chance of coming to nearly full fruition with extraordinary efforts on the part of all those involved and substantially more favorable background conditions, which could benefit these energy technologies in, for example, the form of a constantly rising energy price level as they penetrate the market. Increased efforts are also necessary in areas other than immediate support for projects only insofar as they offer a realistic chance of attaining reduction targets as concerns CO2 emissions through combined action. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |EC-Supported Technology Projects in Energy Sector Up to End of 1992 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Number of Pro-|Percentage of |Aid Funds in 1|Percentage of | | |jects |Total |,000s of ECU |Total | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Energy conser-|793 |27.7 |359,653 |20.5 | |vation: | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Buildings |149 |5.2 |31,475 |1.8 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Industry |469 |16.4 |233,164 |13.3 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Energy indust-|95 |3.3 |57,732 |3.3 | |ry | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Traffic |80 |2.8 |37,280 |2.1 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Renewable sou-|1,085 |37.9 |371,943 |21.2 | |rces of energ-| | | | | |y: | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Solar |374 |13.0 |84,573 |4.8 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Biomass |223 |7.8 |109,361 |6.2 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Geothermy |153 |5.3 |75,017 |4.3 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Water power |152 |5.3 |37,543 |2.1 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Wind |183 |6.4 |65,449 |3.7 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Solid fuels |221 |7.7 |419,199 |23.9 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Oil and natur-|767 |26.8 |600,218 |34.3 | |al gas | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |2,866 |100 |1,751,012 |100 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Source: THERMIE. | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
