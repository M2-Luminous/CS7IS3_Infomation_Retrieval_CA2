Pujol said in reply to the minister that this meeting is not opportune right now, and told him that he deems it essential first to restore cohesion within CiU [Convergence and Union]. The brief conversation between the two political leaders took place in a room at the Ritz Hotel in Madrid, where the Generalitat premier had just presented the Blanquerna Prize to Fernando Lazaro Carreter. Political Asset Rubalcaba was present at the ceremony with the aim of conveying to Pujol the idea that the government acknowledges his full authority as interlocutor on behalf of the Catalan nationalist coalition. In short, this is a gesture aimed at the Generalitat chairman not with a formal or institutional purpose but in order to intimate to him that the government regards his leadership of CiU as a political asset to be preserved. In fact, Pujol took it this way, and, according to his colleagues, felt pleased at the explicit support given to him by the government as an interlocutor overall, and especially on such an essential point in his political program as be believes linguistic normalization to be. In this connection, the Catalan premier viewed the presence of two ministers -- Rubalcaba himself and Education Minister Gonzalo Suarez Pertierra -- at the Blanquerna Prize presentation ceremony also as an expression of support against those who criticize his conduct in the matter, so that, in the opinion of those close to him, "he felt bolstered in the sense that the presence of the government representatives and of other officials, such as Congress [of Deputies] Speaker Felix Pons, represented support for not allowing himself to be intimidated by those who question the Generalitat's linguistic policy." In government circles it is believed that the meeting will take place soon, despite Pujol's reservations about meeting with the prime minister now because of the tensions in CiU. In any event, the same circles respect the strategy which the Catalan nationalist coalition leader wishes to employ in order to reestablish his authority: Hence Rubalcaba's "when he wishes," uttered in the double sense that Pujol could go to the Moncloa Palace tomorrow or postpone it until he sees fit. The hypothesis mooted in CiU circles is that the meeting could take place at the beginning of February, by which time it is believed that the coalition will have fully recovered its internal cohesion -- something that could be resolved this very week -- although the Generalitat premier's wish is to hold the meeting with the utmost discretion in order to avoid the external pressure which would otherwise be applied to his negotiating process with Gonzalez. In addition, the government wishes to act cautiously in CiU's crisis, without doing anything that could add further elements of tension. In this connection, Democratic Union of Catalonia has proof that, during the budget debate, the government tried to meet its demands without jeopardizing the overall dialogue with the coalition, and its aim now is also that relations with CiU should operate very smoothly again.
