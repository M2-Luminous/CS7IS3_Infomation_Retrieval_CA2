Addressing the NAM conference today, Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, Iraq's foreign minister and head of the Iraqi delegation to the conference, said that Iraq proposes laying a foundation for cooperation and coordination among the NAM countries and called on NAM to study practical proposals through which the movement could contribute to reorganizing the United Nations as it currently exists. Al-Sahhaf said: Reorganizing the United Nations should be based on objective grounds that guarantees equality and respect for state's sovereignty, independence, and free choice. This, he added, would produce a new formula that prevents a few rich states from exploiting this organization for their own interests and imposing hegemony over the world. The foreign minister called on NAM to study the possibility of activating cooperation among its member states in specific fields, particularly with regard to trade and economic relations with industrialized countries. This cooperation, he added, would give NAM countries greater power because they would share interests with other countries. Responding to the speech delivered by the representative of the Kuwaiti rulers -- who issued a host of allegations and slanders that are not in harmony with the general spirit of the conference represented by the call for dialogue, reconciliation, and solving problems through peaceful means -- Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said: The Government of Iraq has fulfilled all measures requested by the Security Council in accordance with Security Council Resolutions 686 and 687. He added that this was documented in four letters circulated as official documents at the Security Council. He said: The position of the Iraqi Government vis-a-vis these resolutions still exists as stipulated by these letters, which were accepted by the Security Council, which established a permanent cease-fire on the basis of these letters. The minister noted that anything contrary to this means the existence of a contradiction between what is required by Security Council Resolution 686 and the establishment of a permanent cease-fire in accordance with Resolution 687. The Iraqi foreign minister noted in his speech that the United Nations and the UN Special Commission have admitted that Iraq has implemented all the requirements of disarmament, which is considered an important chapter of Resolution 687. He added that Iraq's fulfillment of its commitments, as stipulated by this chapter, requires that the Security Council so far because of the intransigence of one country that imposes its opinion and hegemony over the council thereby constituting a political blackmail to achieve its personal interests. [sentence as received] Regarding the issue of missing Kuwaitis, the foreign minister reiterated that Iraq has no interest in keeping a single Kuwaiti in prison and that there is not one prisoner in Iraq. He said: We released all prisoners, including members of the ruling Kuwaiti family. The issue of missing persons was fabricated by the other party, which has turned it into a political, not a humanitarian, problem. Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said: Foreign interests represent a major factor in maintaining instability in the region so as to justify their military and political presence, to make big profits from arms deals, and to impose trade deals and projects so as to invigorate their economy at the expense of stability, peace, and security in the region. Al-Sahhaf said that, contrary to certain parties' claims, Iraq is earnest and concerned about taking sound technical and legal steps to implement the Security Council resolutions and to take various initiatives so as to normalize the situation in the region. He noted that the last initiative was declared by the speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly in which he called on the Kuwaiti parliament to embark on dialogue and resolve suspended problems between the two countries. He added: However, the Kuwaiti parliament rejected this call with arrogance. Concluding his speech, the foreign minister welcomed the Republic of South Africa for joining NAM as a full member state.
