The FERM report called the introduction of higher import tariffs "a forced protectionist measure." The FERM expects that domestic producers will spend their profits on lowering production costs and raising the quality of goods in order gradually to achieve world standards in these indicators. As for the inflationary effect of the increase in import tariffs, the FERM said that the fiscal side to the new measure would "offset" the natural growth in the prices of goods, thus increasing budget revenues. Along with import tariffs, export tariffs have also been imposed. However, they are "aimed at liberalizing exports." The FERM sees this step as a transition from state monopoly to free trade. By mid-1995 it is expected fully to abolish export quotas and licenses, the institution of special exporters, and other "non-economic" controls over the export of goods. As for the tariffs, they will become "the rein that the government will slowly loosen." The result of the country's foreign economic activity in 1993 was a trade surplus of $16 billion. It is impossible to channel the entire amount to investment in production and so forth because one- third of it is spent on bringing into Russia foreign cash that ends up being kept by the population and banks as savings, and another third goes to service the foreign and domestic hard-currency debts. Hard-currency earnings have also been hit by the release of Russian commodities onto the world market at dumping prices. Budget revenues have been dented by various foreign economic benefits granted to regions, sectors, and enterprises. In 1995 most benefits may be "suspended," while expenditures on centralized imports will be halted. The general trend toward foreign trade liberalization will encounter resistance by domestic producers, however, who demand state protection and benefits, and will also meet open obstruction from government bureaucrats. For instance, Mr. Tsyplakov, government staff official dealing with foreign trade problems, said that "given the complete collapse of the economy it is a mistake for the state to give up its monopoly in foreign economic ties." Many deputies who attended the hearings yesterday shared his stance.
