Zhirinovskiy was greeted by around 10,000 citizens of Trebinje and neighboring municipalities in eastern Herzegovina who gathered around Ducic's monument in Freedom Square. Zhirinovskiy stressed that the Russian people had suffered a lot of hardships in the past years, but that the Serb people of Bosnia-Herzegovina were exposed to greater hardships. "This is the war which has been waged against the Slavs for more than a century. I represent a country which has for years defended the Orthodox world from barbarians," Zhirinovskiy said. According to him, the enemies of the Slav cause and the Orthodox world are now looking for a different weapon to use "against us." That weapon is religion, because the Catholics from Rome and the Muslims from the south are trying to destroy the Slav world, Zhirinovskiy believes. "You are standing at the very border of our Slav world," Zhirinovskiy said, recalling that there are no enemies in the north, east, and west, but, he said, the last enemy remains in the south [sentence as received]. "You Serbs are in a difficult position, you have been encircled from all sides, but they forgot that you and we are one people and that there are 300 million of us," Zhirinovskiy said to tumultuous applause. "If they created a community of nations in the west, we have to create another alliance with you, Serbs -- a Slav alliance in the east. Then peace and democracy will be everywhere and there will be no states to impose their will on us. Our East Europe is spiritually richer than the West, and if we take into account military issues, the Russian military factor is the strongest in the world," Zhirinovskiy stressed. "You received moral support from us. But if it becomes necessary we will send you thousands of volunteers. If that proves insufficient, new weapons will come from us. We will throw our enemy into the sea," Zhirinovskiy said. "We have to tell our enemies that the time has come to stop mistreating the Slavs. The time has come for the borders of the Slav-Christian world to be made secure. I am not threatening anyone, but let the Vatican know that the borders of the Catholic Church influence end in Italy," Zhirinovskiy said.
