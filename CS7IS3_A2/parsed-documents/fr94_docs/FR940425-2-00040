FR940425-2-00040 FR940425-2-00031 Mr. Dick Hann, Manager, Heating and Application Engineering, Bard Manufacturing Company, 1914 Randolph Drive, Bryan, OH 43506 Dear Mr. Hanna: This is in response to your March 8, 1994, Application for Interim Waiver and Petition for Waiver from the Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for Bard Manufacturing Company (Bard) DCC and DCL series central furnaces. Previous waivers for this type of timed blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710, January 18, 1985; Magic Chef Company, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985; Rheem Manufacturing Company, 53 FR 48574, December 1, 1988, 56 FR 2920, January 25, 1991, 57 FR 10166, March 24, 1992, and 57 FR 34560, August 5, 1992; Trane Company, 54 FR 19226, May 4, 1989, 56 FR 6021, February 14, 1991, 57 FR 10167, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 22222, May 27, 1992, and 58 FR 68138, December 23, 1993; Lennox Industries, 55 FR 50224, December 5, 1990, 57 FR 49700, November 3, 1992, 58 FR 68136, December 23, 1993, and 58 FR 68137, December 23, 1993; Inter-City Products Corporation, 55 FR 51487, December 14, 1990, and 56 FR 63945, December 6, 1991; DMO Industries, 56 FR 4622, February 5, 1991; Heil-Quaker Corporation, 56 FR 6019, February 14, 1991; Carrier Corporation, 56 FR 6018, February 14, 1991, 57 FR 38830, August 27, 1992, 58 FR 68131, December 23, 1993, and 58 FR 68133, December 23, 1993; Amana Refrigeration Inc., 56 FR 27958, June 18, 1991, 56 FR 63940, December 6, 1991, 57 FR 23392, June 3, 1992, and 58 FR 68130, December 23, 1993; Snyder General Corporation, 56 FR 54960, September 9, 1991; Goodman Manufacturing Corporation, 56 FR 51713, October 15, 1991, and 57 FR 27970, June 23, 1992; The Ducane Company Inc., 56 FR 63943, December 6, 1991, 57 FR 10163, March 24, 1992, and 58 FR 68134, December 23, 1993; Armstrong Air Conditioning, Inc., 57 FR 899, January 9, 1992, 57 FR 10160, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 10161, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 39193, August 28, 1992, and 57 FR 54230, November 17, 1992; Thermo Products, Inc., 57 FR 903, January 9, 1992; Consolidated Industries Corporation, 57 FR 22220, May 27, 1992; Evcon Industries, Inc., 57 FR 47847, October 20, 1992; and Bard Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November 12, 1992. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay. Bard's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic impact or competitive disadvantage Bard will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application. However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis. Therefore, Bard's Application for an Interim Waiver from the DOE test procedure for its DCC and DCL series central furnaces regarding blower time delay is granted. Bard shall be permitted to test its DCC and DCL series central furnaces on the basis of the test procedures specified in 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification set forth below: (i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph: 3.0␣Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103&hyph;82 with the exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures: (ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows: 3.20␣Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t^) unless: (1) the furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the indoor air circulation blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay (t^) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperature. During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within # 0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company. This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the application is incorrect. The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary. ␣␣Sincerely, Frank M. Stewart, Jr. Acting Chief of Staff Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9927 Filed 4&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
