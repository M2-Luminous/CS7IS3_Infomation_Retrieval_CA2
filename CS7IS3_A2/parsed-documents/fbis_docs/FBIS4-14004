Informed political sources told AL-MAJD that an Israel ship called "The Orient" [al-sharq] docked at 'Isa Port in Bahrain a few days ago with an Israeli consignment for certain Gulf markets. The ship's captain and crew were allowed to tour Manama. In another development, a Jewish businessman of Moroccan origin, who is married to the daughter of a ranking Moroccan politician, arrived in Morocco. He held intensive talks with Moroccan officials on backing the Israeli efforts to lift the Arab economic boycott of Israel and open public channels of communication with the rest of the Arab Maghreb states. The Moroccan side responded to this request by stressing the need to lift the political boycott first. The Israeli delegation objected to this and said no real political boycott exists. AL-MAJD has learned that the contacts Rabin's government is currently holding with various Arab countries will result in a decision by the governments of Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman to cancel the economic boycott of Israel before the end of this year.
