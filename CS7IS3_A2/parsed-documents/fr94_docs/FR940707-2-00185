FR940707-2-00185 FR940707-2-00099 The proposed rule also contains a limited exemption from the short sale prohibition for market makers. In addition, in response to concerns raised by commenters, the NASD submitted a number of amendments providing limited exemptions for options market makers and warrant market makers satisfying certain requirements, and clarifying that bona fide market making includes, under certain conditions, risk arbitrage activity. The exemptions are designed to allow short selling where necessary to conduct efficient and effective market making activities without allowing unrestricted short selling. During the eighteen-month period of effectiveness of the rule, the NASD will study the impact of the rule and its exemptions and, prior to the rule's expiration, the NASD will evaluate whether the rule and its exemptions should be extended, modified, approved on a permanent basis, or terminated. If the NASD decides to extend, modify or approve on a permanent basis any part or all of the rule, it must obtain Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. 9 9 15 U.S.C. ยง78s (b)(1). B. The General Rule and Exemptions The NASD's bid-test rule will prohibit NASD members from effecting a short sale in a security at or below the current inside bid when this bid is below the preceding best bid. 10 This prohibition applies equally to trades for customers and to trades for the member's own account. 11 The rule, however, sets forth ten exemptions. Seven of these exemption mirror the exceptions provided under the Commission's short sale rule. 12 The three additional exemptions provide an exemption for bona fide market making activity by qualified market makers, hedge transactions by options market makers registered as qualified options market makers, and hedge transactions resulting in fully hedged positions by warrant market makers registered as market makers for the warrant. 10 As set forth in Interpretation B, the NASD has determined that in order to effect a ``legal'' short sale when the current best bid is lower than the preceding best bid the short sale must be executed at a price of at least 1/16th point above the current inside bid. The last sale report of such a trade would, therefore, be above the inside bid by at least 1/16th point. Moreover, the NASD believes that requiring short sales to be a minimum increment of 1/16th point above the bid ensures that transactions are not effected at prices inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the rule. 11 In Interpretation C, the NASD provides examples of circumstances under which a member would be deemed to be in violation of the rule. For example, if a market maker moves its bid up or down and then moves it back to the original bid simply to create an up bid or down bid to facilitate or preclude short selling, the NASD would consider this a manipulative act and a violation of the rule. In addition, if a market maker agrees to an arrangement proposed by a member or a customer where the market maker raises its bid in the Nasdaq system in order to effect a short sale for the other party and is protected against any loss on the trade or on any other executions effected at its new bid price, the market maker would be deemed to be in violation of the rule. Similarly, a market maker would be deemed in violation of the rule if it entered into an arrangement with a member or a customer whereby it used its exemption from the rule to sale short at the bid at successively lower prices, accumulating a short position, and subsequently offsetting those sales through a transaction at a prearranged price, for the purpose of avoiding compliance with the rule, and with the understanding that the market maker would be guaranteed by the member or customer against losses on the trades. The NASD believes that members' activities to circumvent the rule through indirect actions such as executions with other members or through facilitation of customer orders while being protected from loss are antithetical to the purposes of the rule. Accordingly, the NASD will consider any such activity as a violation of this section. 12 In particular, the NASD's exceptions found in XX(c)(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8) parallel 17 CFR 240.10a&hyph;1(e)(1), (2), (3), (4), (7), (8) and (10), respectively. The NASD's proposal does not include the Commission's exemptions found in 17 CFR 240.10a&hyph;1(e)(5), (6), (11), (12) and (13); 17 CFR 240.10a&hyph;1(e)(9) is reserved for future use. 1. The Qualified Market Maker Exemption The NASD received substantial comment from its members that application of a short sale rule to market makers would dramatically reduce their ability to adjust inventory positions quickly, thereby lessening liquidity throughout the marketplace. Thus, the NASD provided an exemption for qualified market makers satisfying certain criteria. To be exempt from the provisions of the rule, a market maker must be conducting bona fide market making activity 13 and satisfy the criteria for a qualified market maker. The rule sets forth certain criteria for becoming a qualified market maker, which criteria change after the first year of the effectiveness of the rule. Under both the criteria applicable to the first year and those applicable to the last six months of the rule, general qualifications standards apply. The rule then sets forth separate criteria for becoming a qualified market maker for securities subject to a secondary offering, 14 an initial public offering, or a merger or acquisition. 13 A market maker executing a transaction on an agency basis would not be exempt from the rule with respect to that transaction. As indicated above, the NASD submitted three interpretations of the short sale rule. Interpretation A states, among other things, the factors the NASD will consider when determining whether certain market making activity may not be deemed bona fide market making activity and, therefore, ineligible for the qualified market maker exemption. First, the interpretation reiterates the express exclusion from the exemption for activity unrelated to market making functions, such as index arbitrage and risk arbitrage that is independent from a member's market making functions. The interpretation does, however, allow short sales of a security of a company involved in a merger or acquisition of the sale is made to hedge the purchase or prospective purchase (based on communicated indications of interest) of other security of a company involved in the merger or acquisition, which purchase was made, or is to be made, in the course of bona fide market making activity. Short sales made to hedge any such purchases or prospective purchases must be reasonably consistent with the exchange ratio (or exchange ratio formula) specified by the terms of the merger or acquisition. Similarly, the interpretation provides that bona fide market making activity would exclude speculative selling strategies that are disproportionate to the usual market making patterns of the member in that security. Furthermore, the interpretation indicates that the NASD does not anticipate that a firm could properly take advantage of its market maker exemption to effectuate such speculative or investment short selling decisions. Disproportionate short selling in a market making account to effectuate such strategies will be viewed by the NASD as inappropriate activity that does not represent bona fide market making and would therefore be in violation of the rule. 14 For secondary offerings, the NASD concluded that the time period after the announcement of the offering is so sensitive to short selling pressure that it established special time frames and eligibility criteria for primary market makers. In these situations, the stock of the issuer is currently being traded and the ``overhang'' on the market of the new stock coming into the market from the offering makes the security particularly susceptible to short selling abuse. Such short selling can adversely affect the capitalization of the issuer, particularly of smaller issuers, whose securities often have less liquid secondary markets. The NASD believes that the heightened requirements should address the concerns about short selling by newly registered market makers in secondary offerings.
