At the request of the office of the U.N supreme commissioner for refugees, Russia will participate in the operation to provide those who are fleeing the bloodsoaked Rwanda with humanitarian aid. According to a spokesman for the Russian Ministry for Emergencies, the experts will examine the routes and conditions for Russian drivers who are expected to deliver foodstuffs and medicines for Rwandan refugees. The Russian transport team has already worked in the former Yugoslavia. However, the tropical climate, health hazards, difficulties with the delivery of heavy-duty Kamaz trucks by air and unloading them require specific preparations. The Russian drivers are expected to start the deliveries this month.
