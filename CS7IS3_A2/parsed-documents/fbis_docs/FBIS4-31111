At a news conference convened during the course of the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova announced that matters have been closed 98 percent and that, apparently, they would not be reopened at today's government meeting. In the social sphere, social payments will be targeted more specifically. The IMF mission demands that the government expeditiously discuss the import surcharge with GATT. The method of its introduction in March had not been consulted and was rather unusual. Moreover, there have been several changes compared with the version approved last summer. In the memorandum, the government takes upon itself certain obligations concerning the economic development in 1995. The rate of inflation should be kept at 8 percent, but it could be slightly higher following price increases for electricity, heat, and gas. The government's intention is to keep a single-digit rate of inflation. The state budget deficit should be under 3 percent of the gross domestic product [GDP], which is 1 percent less than anticipated this year. Following the zero growth of the GDP projected for this year, the GDP should grow 2 percent next year. Brigita Schmognerova said that the 1995 targets should serve as an important signal for domestic and foreign investors. The continued provision of tax relief and tax holidays is being reconsidered. They will most likely be kept this year but should be abolished next year in the interest of the creation of a consistent environment. The need is also becoming apparent to abolish tax relief for purchases of State Treasury bills and other securities because these types of securities enjoy a preferred standing on the capital market. The effects of wage regulation, which should apply to loss-making companies and designated sectors, will be analyzed at the end of the year and, on the basis of this analysis, the continuation of wage regulation in 1995 will be considered. The intentions in the sphere of privatization are formulated quite specifically. The basic intention is to speed up the process, a fact that the IMF and the World Bank assess very positively. The government undertakes to deal more vigorously with the financial situation in the company sector and in commercial banks. This will involve mutually harmonized measures aimed at reducing interenterprise indebtedness and tackling bad loans and parallel activities by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary]. Jozef Trojak, state secretary at the Ministry of Finance, provided information on debt servicing. This year, the state budget will have to spend 23 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] on the repayment of the principal and interest (of which the Slovak National Bank [NBS] will pay Sk12 billion); next year, debt servicing will increase to Sk40 billion (of which Sk9.6 billion will come from the NBS). This growth forces us to mobilize the generation of resources. A burden from the past is the debt of Sk54 billion resulting from the division of the debts of the federal budget. It is expected that, as in the Czech Republic, resources from the National Property Fund will be used to cover this debt.
