In the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry They Don't Care About the Legality of Juridical Acts, Which Seriously Hurts the Common Cause"] [Text] It is a fact that there are many problems and shortcomings in Georgia's agriculture now, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry has contributed its "share" to this, but right now we will only discuss one defective aspect of its activity--the legality of juridical acts issued this year and last by the Ministry's officials. The Procuracy's General Oversight Administration recently examined the question, and it appears that the legality of such acts is of no concern to the Ministry's officials. The chronological sequence of orders is grossly violated, and revisions, additions, erasures, and wrong numberings are made to them regularly, on the basis of somebody's wishes or highhandedness, and so on. Most surprising is the fact that orders signed by Ministry officials have had changes made to them by lower-ranking officials. No one knows why this is. Often, orders signed by Ministry officials have comments written by other persons. Sometimes, in addition, separate documents are written which cancel juridical acts, although the reason is not given, nor are they signed. The rule is that a given act can only be cancelled by issuing a new order. Examples of such highhanded action include the cancellation of the former Agriculture Ministry's order of 27 August 1992 and the former Food and Processing Industry Ministry's orders of 5 and 7 October 1992, and so on. People in the Ministry also resort to what is known as stopping orders. And it's done in funny ways. In particular, a hand-written note is inserted in the orders book in place of the juridical act that has been removed. Unfortunately, these notes are written by technical personnel or even secretaries and typists. Officials of both the Ministry and its subsidiary enterprises and organizations often cancel previous orders with the terse note "cancelled" instead of issuing a new order. It is left vague just what the grounds were and why it all happened; just try to guess. Especially deplorable is the fact that the Ministry does issue orders, but the stipulations are not fulfilled, as a result of poor follow-through discipline. For example, a Ministry executive order cancelled the Gori Outfitting Depot Director's order and directed him to return to the proper quarters 421,000 rubles' worth of fixed assets, vehicles, and implements that had been turned over to another organization without the Ministry's permission, and to show the value on the balance sheet. According to the balance sheet it submitted, the enterprise had done everything, but in fact it had not. To this day, neither the fixed assets nor their value have been returned. The same route has also been taken by organizations under the Ministry. The Sakkonservi [Russian Gruzkonserv] Association issued an order transferring the uninstalled and unused machinery and equipment of the now-abolished Tkviavi Canning Plant from its own books to be distributed to other enterprises, but it never followed up on its order. All that fine equipment has been left out in the open; it is rusting and being stripped and wrecked. Juridical acts that are taken arbitrarily are hurting the country materially. The Ministry's executives most generously, and illegally, provided assistance to apparatus personnel. In the course of several months, they spent 9 million rubles on this. They often issued unlawful juridical acts giving lump-sum assistance by way of exception. Money was given in this way to outside persons as well. Meanwhile, the orders do not specify the type of incentive or the reasons for it. There have been many cases of using disciplinary punishment not provided for in the labor law against Ministry workers and employees. These constitute gross violations of the Code of Labor Laws of the Georgian Republic. For example, the Ministry issued an order by which the head of the Republic Association of Specialized Livestock Complexes was given a stern reprimand and a final warning--yet the law does not call for a final warning as a disciplinary punishment. Unfortunately, there have been many such cases. Ministry officials (Minister Otar Kvesitadze) and certain association executives sometimes fail to carry out court decisions. For example, the Tbilisi Mtatsminda Rayon Court's rulings calling for the immediate reinstatement of G. Burdzhanadze, the director of the Kvemo Chala Prepared Food Plant (Kaspi Rayon), to his post, were never complied with. Even though the rulings were sustained by the City Court. There are also instances of illegal orders in the case of transferring workers and employees to other jobs. Unprecedented in this regard is the use of transfer procedures to appoint Juridical Administration Head I. Lomtatidze to the post of head of the Disputes, Methodology, and Codification Department and, simultaneously, the deputy head of the Juridical Administration. This was without his consent, which is impermissible. There are too many such cases. Other violations and improprieties have also been found in the Ministry. Many orders are issued to abolish enterprises and installations without even indicating which law or normative act serves as the basis for the liquidation, whether a liquidation commission has been created, what specific measures must be taken to dismiss workers and employees legally, find jobs for them, and so on. That's what happened, for example, to the Vivariumi Scientific-Control Center for Veterinary Drugs. The land it occupied, and its buildings, were turned over to the Gldani State Farm, but the relevant documents say nothing about laying off its workers and employees or finding other jobs for them. The same thing happened in the case of the transfer of a training-methods office to the Institute for the Training and Upgrading of Qualifications of Food Industry Leadership Personnel. The disrespect which Ministry officials have for the law can be seen clearly by looking at cases in which depreciated cars have been sold to certain officials. This improper practice is rooted in the past and still persists. In July of 1992, an order was written with an enclosure by which retired and depreciated GAZ-24 vehicles were sold to certain officials. This constituted an evasion of the law, in that the vehicles were sold to persons who had been using them, whereas according to a decree of the Georgian government the right to buy such vehicles was to be given to personnel recommended by the labor collective and, as a rule, a general assembly had to decide whom the car could be sold to. Especially surprising is a recent Ministry order by which a vehicle was given as a gift to one enterprise official (?!). Some juridical acts have to do with cases of damage to the state, on the basis of which officials and materially responsible persons have been dismissed, except the question of recovery of the damages has been "left out" and no measures have been taken. There is no end to unlawfulness in the Ministry. This is due to the fact that some bureaus in the Ministry often conduct inspections and document audits in a superficial and low-quality manner and issue orders that are equally meaningless and fail to properly evaluate and react to serious legal violations. One graphic example of this is an order of 2 August which has to do with the findings of an audit of the economic-financial activities of the Ministry's Administration of Management and Service Organizations. Along with numerous legal violations it points out that four years ago the Administration (which was then the Saksopkvebservisi [Russian Gruzselpishcheservis] Association), sold the Vazi Hotel for 40,000 dollars. Of that sum, 16,700 dollars went for charity work and other activities, while the bank has blocked the remaining 22,000 dollars in its account to this day. For some reason, this order--and the audit document that was written prior to it--"failed" to observe legality of the sale of the hotel, the proper use of the money, why the bank has blocked the 22,000 dollars, and so on. In fact, other republic control departments have deemed the sale of the Vazi illegal, and the currency realized from the sale is subject to be deposited to the budget, because the building was not depreciated and was not to be sold; moreover, the government had not given its permission. As for the charity, 8.8 [as printed] pounds sterling were given, totally wrongly, to send a few students from the Foreign Language Institute to attend a London college for a month; the students have nothing to do with the Ministry. Pursuant to the duties of the republic Procuracy, a number of rayon procurators made a selective inspection of the juridical acts of certain enterprises and organizations and agricultural and agroindustrial administrations subordinate to the Ministry. On the basis of the inspections, 114 juridical acts were protested as being illegal, 21 representations were submitted, and three reports were sent to local boards. These and many other cases we have material on show clearly that in terms of ensuring the legality of juridical acts, the Ministry's work style and methods are unacceptable, and its practices are faulty and intolerable. The practice of issuing illegal juridical acts is also fostered by the fact that most orders throughout the system are prepared without the participation of a juridical service. Orders are written by various officials and even by ordinary workers. They are not stamped by officials of these bureaus or even by ordinary legal staffers. Often, in fact, they are not even aware of the issuance of particular juridical acts. The republic Procuracy has stated that the deplorable situation in the Ministry is giving rise to grave consequences and having a very destructive effect on the country's agroindustrial complex and the safeguarding of the legitimate interests of the state, society, and the citizen. In this connection, a representation has been submitted to the Ministry and the appropriate report has been sent to the Cabinet of Ministers.
