Yi told reporters that there no longer is any ground to ban the imports of codfish heads. Noting that the United States has consistently been asking for their imports, the administrator said, "We have decided to permit codfish head imports especially because the United States threatens to take a trade retaliation based on Super Article 301." Yi said that early last March three food hygienic experts were sent to the United States to inspect codfish head processing. "We have determined there is no problem so far as hygienic matters are concerned," he said. Imports of codfish heads, he said, could be made beginning some time in the first half of next year at the earliest because of the time needed in fixing domestic regulations in both countries to facilitate the exports and imports of the item. Thirteen tons and 1,013 tons of American codfish heads were imported in 1983 and 1984 before their introduction was halted altogether in the face of public uproars that the imports of discarded American codfish heads as a food were prone to hurt people's health and national prestige.
