Venizelos] [Excerpt] In his recent meeting with President Bill Clinton, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou raised President Glavkos Kliridhis' proposal to demilitarize Cyprus. According to informed sources, Papandreou did raise the Cypriot president's proposal but the U.S. side appears to insist on reaching an agreement for the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. President Clinton described the demilitarization proposal as "good" but untimely. This fact creates the reasonable impression that the Americans will not renege on their efforts for an agreement on the CBM's, something that is also strengthened by reports that the Americans avoid discussing any alternate proposals such as those made by the Cypriot Government. Joe Clark's visit to the area is also linked with the UN intention to proceed with changes to the package. [passage omitted]
