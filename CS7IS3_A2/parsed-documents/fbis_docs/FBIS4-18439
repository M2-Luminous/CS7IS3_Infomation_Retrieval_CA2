In a message he issued for the 45th anniversary of the NATO's establishment, Demirel stated that NATO is still the main guarantee regarding the security and defense of member countries. Demirel pointed out that the historical developments of the last couple of years created an optimism within public opinion and international political circles that peace and stability would be achieved in a short time. However, Demirel added, not before long a sad and realistic picture replaced this optimistic mood. This sad and realistic picture was created by the threats to Europe and its environs. These threats included policies based on annexing territories, ethnic separatism, and clashes which emerged from minority issues. Demirel indicated that all the countries are in agreement that NATO, which took significant steps toward applying itself to these new conditions, will play an important role in establishing and perpetuating peace and stability. Commenting on the NATO-Turkey relations in his message, Demirel said: Turkey's joining NATO in 1952 was an important step taken as part of Turkey's national foreign policy since its establishment. Within this understanding and awareness, Turkey has become a secure and trustworthy alliance fulfilling -- with great sacrifices -- the responsibilities stipulated by the alliance. Turkey always placed solidarity to the alliance in the foreground. Turkey will continue on the same understanding and approach.
