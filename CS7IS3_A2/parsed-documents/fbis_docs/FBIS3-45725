He warned that the consequences will be grave if the Hong Kong Government continues to act in violation of the principle of consultation set out in the Memorandum of Understanding on Hong Kong's airport and acts arbitrarily on relevant issues. At a ceremony with the principal executives of the Hong Kong airline, Dragonair, who are stationed in Beijing, Chen Zuoer responded to the Hong Kong Government's request to the Legislative Council to allocate a total HK$1.67 billion [Hong Kong dollars] to the Provisional Airport Authority, noting that the issue of Hong Kong's new airport should be dealt with in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on Hong Kong's airport. The construction of Hong Kong's airport could have started smoothly following the signing of Memorandum of Understanding by the two heads of governments in September 1991. "It really makes people worry now that the issue has gotten into such a mess. This is the last thing we wish to see." He also pointed out that a very important principle had been set out in the Memorandum of Understanding that all issues which straddle 1997 and which require the government of the future special administrative region to acknowledge and shoulder responsibility for should be solved through consultations between China and Britain. He warned the British Hong Kong Government that "its continued arbitrary acts in violation of the Memorandum of Understanding will have very grave consequences."
