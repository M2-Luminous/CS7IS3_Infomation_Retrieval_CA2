Leyla Yunusova, chairman of the Azerbaijan Independent Democrat Party, was elected chairman of the executive committee. Our correspondent met with Leyla Yunusova and wanted to pose some questions of interest to us. [Correspondent] With what goals was the new organization you represent established? [Yunusova] Up to now, there has been no society occupied with defending the rights of citizens in Azerbaijan -- not during Stalinism, voluntarism, or stagnation. We tried to engage ourselves in preservation of the law in the first stages of the democratic movement and the national-liberation movement. We wanted to establish in the initiative center of the APF [Azerbaijan People's Front] an organization for the rule of law, and established a relationship with the International Society for the Protection of the Rights of Man [ISPRM]. At that time, Yusif Semedoghlu, the lawyer Fuad Aghayev, Arzu khanym Abdullayeva, the painter Ehmed Rza and myself were engaged in this work. After the tragedy of January 1990, Ferhad Zeynally, Arif Kheyrullayev, Ramiz Rzayev and others made an effort to establish the ISPRM once again. In August of that year Nadir Mehdiyev founded the Helsinki Group for the Protection of Rights. Finally, in August 1992 the Azerbaijan National Committee of the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly [HCA] was created. At the end of all this, all other groups, with the exception of the HCA, ceased activity. As for the HCA, its activity consisted of collecting information about our prisoners in Armenian captivity. Nevertheless, there were enough problems connected with the defense of human rights in Azerbaijan and, from this point of view, the establishment of a public legal protection structure was necessary. Coming to our duties, first, we have to lay the basis for a public legal-defense organization which is removed from any kinds of political interests. In the future, we hope to turn it into an influential, multifaceted structure which preserves close ties with the international legal protection movement. Our second duty consists of educating the population, especially those directly engaged in politics. [Correspondent] You say that the organization will be a public organization and will distance itself from political influences. But you, yourself, and others in this organization are actively involved in politics. [Yunusova] You are right. But every single one of us can defend his own political interests through the political organizations to which we belong. We have selected these words of Voltaire as our slogan in the public legal defense organization: "It may be that my views are not in agreement with yours, but I am ready to defend to the death the creation of conditions for everyone to explain their own views." These are certainly not empty words. Organization members are preparing a list of prisoners. Not all of the prisoners are those who are conducting the struggle for the establishment of one, independent, democratic Azerbaijan. But, in accordance with the UN's Declaration of Human Rights, we must defend everyone's rights, and think about the political credo of individuals who need our defense. The organization is certainly a young organization, but we have presented our documents to the Justice Ministry for registration; many people are coming to our organization, and this shows how many of our countrymen are turned back from the threshold of the structure of the state and need help and protection. Unfortunately, for objective reasons we are unable to succeed in resolving certain questions. Among our commissions are: a commission for freedom of speech, for the legal defense of citizens who have lost their jobs due to political beliefs, economic freedom, and a commission on science and education. The work of the first two commissions I mentioned is quite satisfactory. [Correspondent] Could you speak in some detail about the work of the commission on freedom of speech? [Yunusova] The organization has established ties with a number of international legal defense organizations. We regularly send information to organizations like the Committee for the Defense of Journalists, whose center is in the USA, and the Foundation for the Defense of Glasnost of events violating the freedom of the press in our republic and on the rights of journalists. In November and December an effort was made to make political censorship official. The Azerbaijan Press did not publish opposition newspapers for two days following its subordination to the Office of the President. The world reacted immediately to this event: the USA State Department signed a declaration and, as we know, international legal-defense organizations made appeals to the republic leadership. Today, the world has changed; now it is impossible to sign international acts on human rights and trample on these rights behind an iron curtain. In concrete terms, our commission has prepared a document on interference by political censorship in every opposition newspaper and a number of independent newspapers. This document, which is in the nature of an accounting, has made it possible for us to examine the dynamics of strengthening political censorship against certain publishers at definite times. On 15 February, we will hold a "roundtable" with the participation of chief editors from the opposition press. It will be devoted to a discussion of the situation in the opposition press in 1994. Naturally, heads of other press organs can also take part in this event. In March, it is expected that representatives of two legal defense organizations will come to our republic. It is also planned that representatives from Helsinki Watch will go to the battle zone. As for the goals of the delegations from Amnesty International and the Denmark chapter of Helsinki Watch, they are to familiarize themselves with issues of human rights of freedom of speech here. We have already begun to prepare the program for their journey.
