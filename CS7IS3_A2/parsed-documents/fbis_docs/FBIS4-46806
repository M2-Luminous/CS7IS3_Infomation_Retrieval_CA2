Akhverdyan, chairman of the National-Democratic Union's Human Rights Club: "`Criminal' Statistics: In 1993, One in Three Crimes in the Republic Remained Unsolved"] [Text] Obviously statistical analysis, and especially in the sphere of "the crime situation and the percentage of crimes solved, investigative work, and individual areas of procuracy oversight" does not reveal to the full extent the crime picture in the republic. Behind each incident of crime there are concrete human lives. Nevertheless, statistics allow us to follow the development of very alarming trends and, as a natural reaction, take at least the necessary preventive measures to avert their further acceleration. Last year Armenian organs of internal affairs registered 13,081 crimes. For the first time over the past five years, we see a decline in the number of registered crimes (1988--6,324, 1989--8,415, 1990--12,100, 1991--13,109, 1992--16,251). One has to admit that in the years past, "good" reports were the goal. Many crimes, especially on everyday level, essentially were concealed and were not registered. That is, nobody ever had the real picture. To a certain extent this phenomenon, but on a relatively lesser scale, is present today as well. As we can see, in many respects the year 1988 was significant for us. The peak of national awareness, manifestation of a high degree of organization, affected even the crime situation. Armenia had not had such a low crime rate since 1980. The subsequent lawlessness does not need any comment. Its causes have been described many times: Social disintegration has lead to the total impoverishment of almost all population strata and brought about a crime boom. In such analyses, the custom is to quote the crime rate per 100,000 persons. This indicator does not lend itself to measurement, however, because of the endless stream of emigration. According to official data, 300,000--and to unofficial, 800,000--Armenians already have left their homeland. Naturally, the decline in the total number of crimes over the year is closely related to, and actually is caused by, this sad reality. The migrants, some of whom undoubtedly belong to the well-off population strata, had been an attractive target for criminals. So to a certain extent emigration created unemployment of a sort among the petty-crime brotherhood. Not to mention the fact that, according to some reliable sources, emigration processes decimated the local criminal world as well. At the same time it should be noted that the crime coefficient per 100,000 population in Armenia has always been lower than the analogous indicators across the former Soviet Union, although, in our opinion, we should now discard comparative arithmetics. Each republic has its own internal political and social situation; it is hard to find a "counterpart" in a chaos, and does not make sense anyway. Unlike the year before last, the geography of safe cities and regions has expanded. Their number reached 35. Yerevan's Shengavitskiy Rayon and Dilizhan remain "hot spots" (the crime rate has reached 136 percent (!?), as well as Spitakskiy, Sevanskiy, and Stepanavanskiy Rayons. Amazingly, this list includes border regions: Tavush, Tashir, Krasnoselsk, Goris, and Megru. While overall crime declined, there has been a sharp increase in the number of grave crimes registered by criminal investigation departments (especially increased theft of personal property)--from 4,526 to 5,602. This trend was registered in republic's 42 cities and regions. So, in reality the safe status of the cities is very much a matter of conventional definition. The number of grave crimes fell in nine rayons, including two in Yerevan--Mashtotskiy (0.4 percent) and Sovetskiy (20 percent)--but expressed in percents they are not impressive. While in the past Yerevan accounted for more than half of the registered crimes, including grave crimes, last year the seats of criminal activities expanded beyond its boundary. For instance, the growth of grave crime has been registered in Talinskiy Rayon (115 percent), Dilizhan (400 percent), and Vanadzor (78 percent), as well as Tavushskiy (223 percent), Masisskiy (83 percent), Spitakskiy (128 percent), Stepanavanskiy (221 percent), Tashirskiy (363 percent), Akhuryanskiy (150 percent), Martuninskiy (48 percent), Vardenisskiy (74 percent), Gorisskiy (112 percent), Yekhegnadzorskiy (81 percent), Kalanskiy (60 percent), and Sisianskiy (132 percent) Rayons. Looking at statistics by the type of crime, it should be noted that the number of violent crimes decreased somewhat, including that of premeditated murder (-35), attempted murder (-13), and assault (-78). In the area of general crimes for mercenary motives, the number of thefts of state and public property dropped dramatically (-4,388), while theft of personal property increased (+1,328), including apartment burglaries (+638), robberies (+112), and muggings (+239). This does not at all mean that state property is now better protected. Everything usable already has been plundered from plants and factories. In one year the number of such crimes dropped from 6,709 to 2,321. The ordinary guy, on the other hand, essentially found himself unprotected. This is extremely dangerous, since this trend is on the increase. There is also a "pick-up" in the sphere of crimes committed for economic and mercenary motives. There also has been a sharp increase in crimes associated with the manufacture, possession, and use of drugs--from 162 to 368. Against this backdrop, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] decision to abolish the corresponding unit in its structure looks even more strange. Now it is unclear who deals with this problem or how it is dealt with professionally. As to all sorts of hints and statements that we are "all right" when it comes to the drug problem, they are groundless. Amazingly, according to city and rayon procuracy statistical reports, not a single inspection has been conducted on how the law on combating drug addiction among minors is carried out. Quite understandably, the number of traffic accidents is down--from 887 to 525, including those with fatalities--from 325 to 198. There are also fewer car thefts--from 957 to 376. There are fewer crimes committed in public transportation, which actually is not surprising, keeping in mind that practically everywhere it simply is not operating. One would think that the drop in the number of violent crimes can be considered a positive factor. Very alarming, however, is the number of unsolved cases of premeditated murder (105) and attempted murder (12). Of the former, 43 took place in Yerevan; 15, in the disaster zone; 28, in border regions. Of 68 unsolved cases of assault, 41 also occurred in the capital. Also there has been an increase in the number of unsolved mugging attacks against individuals' personal property--from 120 to 228, and in Yerevan--from 55 to 111. Five of 38 rapes in the republic have not been solved. As a whole, the number of unsolved crimes in the republic is 4,565. No matter how optimistic this figure looks--at least against the backdrop of prior years' statistics--all it says is that one in three crimes remain unsolved. In this situation there is no reason to say that law enforcement organs are fulfilling their direct functions. The overwhelming majority (3,470) are general crimes for mercenary motives. According to MVD data, last year 402 crimes were committed by minors or with their participation. In Yerevan this figure increased from 128 to 142. Of 278 criminal cases referred to court, 235 are theft of state, public, or personal property. Keeping in mind that last year in the same category of crime 3,381 incidents remained unsolved, it is simply impossible to judge the whole picture. On the whole the crime situation in the republic remains difficult and most likely will exacerbate, aided by the worsening of the socioeconomic situation of the majority of the population. Not to mention serious shortcomings and deficiencies in the work of law enforcement organs. The lack of a legislative base also makes itself felt. Law regulating the activities of the Procuracy and the MVD still have not been adopted. As to figures, the MVD provides the data that reflects quantitative indicators of the crime situation, which is not enough for an in-depth analysis of today's problems of crime suppression, Statistics must reflect quantitative characteristics of the crime situation, including information on persons committing criminal actions, the situation with respect to repeat, group, and organized crime, the percentage of unsolved crimes, and a number of other things. One thing is clear. A decline in the total number of registered crimes at this point does not allow us to say that the situation has stabilized, and even less so--that crime suppression has improved. We will cover the methods of getting out of the current dismal situation in our subsequent articles, after discussing the subject in the National-Democratic Union's human rights club.
