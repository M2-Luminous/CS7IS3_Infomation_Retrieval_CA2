The "PEOPLE'S ARMY" newspaper today quoted Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy as saying that Ukraine will demobilize another 70,000 men to bring the size of the armed forces down to 455,000 by the end of this year. Ukraine has already demobilized 200,000 people since it inherited a military force of 720,000 men in 1991 when the former Soviet Union broke up. He said the strength of the armed forces should be capped within 450,000 men, or 0.8 percent of the country's population. The figure was decided by parliament last October. The total strength should be kept between 200,000 and 250,000 men if Ukraine is to comply with relevant international agreements. The slimming operation is only one component of the restructuring plan. War industries and science and technology are also essential for the armed forces to be "lean and mean". But the minister did not elaborate.
