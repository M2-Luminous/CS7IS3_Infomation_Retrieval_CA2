After the Balkan Wars and the First World War, the geographic region of Macedonia was divided into three parts. Greece received 53 percent, Serbia received 33 percent, and Bulgaria--as the loser in the wars--received the smallest part. 2. As early as 1919 the two areas not joined to Greece were called Yugoslav Macedonia (or Vardar Macedonia) and Bulgarian Macedonia (or Pirin Macedonia) by foreign and Greek politicians, diplomats, historians, geographers, and journalists. For example, look in theIliou Encyclopediaunder "Macedonian Question." 3. In 1924, after the Asia Minor disaster and the massive population exchanges, our part of Macedonia became "Greek" not just due to the division, but also ethnographically: that is, the Slavonic minorities in Greek Macedonia became from that time, and continue to be today, insignificant. Therefore, after 1924 no serious minorities issue arises in Greek Macedonia, as it does in Thrace. 4. After the Second World War, the area joined to Serbia in 1919 became, under the name Macedonia, one of the "republics" of Socialist Yugoslavia, which was tolerated by Greece. Since then, up to today, the inhabitants of that area have, in the main, been raised with the notion that they are Macedonians. 5. The issue of not accepting Skopje, not just under the name of "Republic of Macedonia," but also under a "hybrid" name (e.g. Vardar Macedonia), began with Mr. Samaras, who managed to set the basic rules of the game (that is, making the name absolutely paramount), rules which the two large parties decided to follow. 6. Greece's insistence on not recognizing Skopje, not just under the name of "Republic of Macedonia" (something that is logical), but also under a "hybrid" name (something illogical), is at variance with basic democratic rules concerning the right to self-determination for individuals, groups, and peoples, as these rules have been formulated, for example, by the United Nations. 7. Even if we were to find friends and allies who would be disposed to "pressure" Mr. Gligorov into accepting our maximalist position (that is, forbidding the use of the term "Macedonia and its derivatives"), the latter could never impose such a solution on the Skopje Parliament. The parliament would by an overwhelming majority vote down every name not having some reference to the term "Macedonia." 8. When we maintain at demonstrations and elsewhere that "Macedonia is Greek," or, even worse, that it is "one and Greek," every rational human being could only give two interpretations to the aforementioned slogans: either we are ignoring what occurred in 1919, or we do not accept the division, and therefore have plans to annex the two areas of Macedonia that are at this time outside Greek borders. Therefore, when our political and religious leaders not only tolerate, but also passionately promote these slogans, it is not at all strange that foreigners think that we have lost our reason, or that we have imperialist tendencies vis-a-vis two other non-Greek Macedonias. The aforementioned eight informational observations cannot be ignored by arguing that Skopje has taken leave of its senses, and that its chauvinism and irredentism has taken on paranoid or ludicrous proportions, etc. Although Skopje is truely talking absurdities, that is no reason for us to talk absurdities as well in supporting positions unbecoming to a country with our cultural heritage, a country that is a member of the European Union [EU] and has behind it two centuries of democratic parliamentary tradition. Above all there is no excuse for hiding from the Greek people basic information such as that which I have just mentioned. Systematic misinformation underestimates the intelligence of the Greek people, and is based on an extremely antidemocratic, obscurantist, autarchic mentality. Above all, it impedes us in correctly evaluating the current situation. Specifically, at this time there are two basic strategies that we can follow: Strategy A: Insisting on making absolutely paramount, or monolpolizing, the term "Macedonia." This strategy can only result in the following: the continuation of the diplomatic isolation of our country; everyone recognizing Skopje under the truely irredentist name of "Republic of Macedonia;" the worldwide projection of the image of [President] Gligorov, and the support of all governments for Skopje as "victim" of Greek intransigence; the "embracing" of Skopje on the part of Bulgaria and Turkey; the dramatic rise of Turkish influence in the Balkans and western Europe; and, finally, the loss of a unique opportunity for our country to become the unifying link between the EU and the Balkans. Strategy B: the acceptance of a "hybrid name." The clear acceptance on the part of Greece that a name containing the term "Macedonia" constitutes a negotiable matter will immediately open the way for a "Pinheiro" type of solution. That is, Greece will on the one hand accept a hybrid name (e.g., Vardar Macedonia) and offer economic cooperation in return for the three well-known conditions (changes in the Constitution, a change of symbols, and an end to irredentist propaganda). In addition, Greece could request and easily attain special security provisions for her current borders. If the aforementioned points are right, one must wonder how it is possible for the government and the larger part of the opposition to insist on self-destructive Strategy A. Perhaps our politicians have gone mad? No, they have not gone mad; they are simply putting party interest, the much-vaunted calculation of "political cost," above every other calculation. Populist flagwaving would seem to triumph yet again. The Skopje question is the most blatant sign of a deep political and social crisis through which our country is now passing.
