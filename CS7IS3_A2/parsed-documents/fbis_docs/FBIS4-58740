Addressing a group of Finance Ministry director generals from throughout the country, Mohammad-Khan said it was necessary that simpler methods be adopted for collection of taxes. He said that in the past calendar year, 1372 (March 1993-March 1994) the Finance Ministry had collected rls. 4,000 billion in direct and indirect taxes and that the figure was expected to reach rls. 7,800 billion this year. Mohammad-Khan said in the past year taxes made up one-sixth of the country's budget, adding that the ratio would rise to one fifth this year. Since the country's revenue is provided through oil export, borrowing from domestic and foreign banks and collecting taxes from high income people was the best form of economic adjustment plan. He said that in the course of the 1988-94 economic development plan, non-oil exports had an eye-catching rise so much so that it reached dlrs four billion last year. The emphasis put by the first economic development plan on production instead of import served to reduce the country's imports from 15 million tons in 1988 to five million tons annually at present, he said. The finance minister predicted that the country will reach self-sufficiency in petrochemical sector by the end of this year and will no longer need to import petrochemicals. Five million tons of steel will be produced by domestic steel mills by the end of 1373 (ending March 1995), 1.2 million tons of which would be exported, the minister said. The average growth of Gross National Product (GNP) in the course of the first development plan stood at seven percent, he said. The finance minister said that during the first five-year plan a total of dlrs 107 billion were invested in different economic areas, adding that oil revenues should be diverted towards investment so as to boost the country's economy.
