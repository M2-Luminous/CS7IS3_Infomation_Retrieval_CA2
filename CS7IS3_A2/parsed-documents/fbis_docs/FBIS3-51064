FBIS3-51064 "drlat008__a94025" FBIS-LAT-94-008-A Document Type:Daily Report 12 January 1994 ANNEX Cuba Lowest Ever Child Mortality Rate Reported PA0701035294 Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 1600 GMT 5 Jan 94 PA0701035294 Havana PRENSA LATINA Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Havana, 5 Jan (PL) -- Havana health officials have reported that the child mortality rate dropped to 9.4 for every 1,000 live births in 1993 -- the lowest ever in Cuban history. A simple mathematical calculation shows that the 0.8 drop, compared to the 10.2 registered in 1992, is equivalent to the lives of 121 children. According to information supplied by the Public Health Ministry's National Statistics Directorate (Minsap), in 1993 there were 151,981 births and 1,430 deaths, which were mainly caused by perinatal problems (those that occur in relation to the birth process) and by several congenital anomalies. According to Minsap statistics, child mortality rates in Cuba have been decreasing gradually over the past 25 years. For example, the figure was 46.7 in 1969, 19.4 in 1979, and 11.1 child deaths for every 1,000 born alive in 1989. The 9.4 achieved in 1993 gives Cuba the lowest child mortality rate in Latin America -- an area that registers very alarming figures, like those in Haiti and Bolivia, which were 87 and 80 respectively, as reported in the World Infancy Status report published by UNICEF [United Nations Children's Fund].
