What are you going to do? Have you any message for the president? [Wells] I was just recently, a couple of weeks, appointed as President Clinton's special representative on the Sudan, and my brief in this job is to promote the regional peace effort that is currently under way to bring an end to the war in the south and to help smooth delivery of humanitarian assistance. And, yes, I will be carrying a letter for President Bashir from President Clinton. [Correspondent] Will your visit be (?focused on) relations or it is an informal (?visit)? [Wells] No, I hope that we can engage constructively in a dialogue as concerns the peace in the south. I have to my right here the president's ambassador to your government Donald Petterson who covers a much broader, wider range of issues and does so from day to day. My focus is specifically in terms of promoting the peace effort. [Correspondent] Have you visited any countries before you came to Sudan? [Wells] Yes, I started out in Kenya, then went to Uganda, Ethiopia, I have just come from Eritrea and now I am here. [Correspondent] You are going to visit Waw [southern Sudan] and (?rebellion) have you visited Sudan before? [Wells] Waw I have been to before, when I was just telling my friends here that my family and I made a long, lovely trip through the Sudan in December 1981. And we had some mechanical difficulties in Waw and so we spent a few days there and I remember how very generous the people were. They have beautiful melons in Waw and we bought a lot of them because, you know, not much food to buy along the way. And as we left at night, we were driving at night to avoid the heat, they saw us leaving and they pushed all these melons as gifts through our window. It was very touching. [Correspondent] In Kenya and Uganda did you find or meet John Garang? [wells] No, no I have not met Mr. Garang. I hope to meet him later. [Correspondent] Thank you. [end recording]
