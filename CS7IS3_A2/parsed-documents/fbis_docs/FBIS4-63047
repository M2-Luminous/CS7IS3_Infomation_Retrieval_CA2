In a cover letter, the prime minister notes that owing to the existing financial and economic situation, a shortage of funds and a budget deficit, it is impossible to preserve privileges for the military. It will take 90 trillion rubles [R] to implement all the measures envisioned earlier and therefore it is essential to reduce food ration compensations from R60,000 to the minimum monthly wage level (R14,620) and fully to abolish credits for housing construction programs for the military.
