FR940617-1-00074 FR940617-1-00012 Finally, the agency did not intend to restrict formulations of triclosan to bar soap. The agency has reviewed the Panel's recommendations and the footnotes in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1229) and finds that triclosan under ``antimicrobial soaps'' was erroneously marked with the reference to the footnote ``Category III only when formulated in a bar soap to be used with water.'' The use of triclosan in products for the treatment of diaper rash was discussed in the tentative final monograph for antimicrobial diaper rash drug products published on June 20, 1990 (55 FR 25246 at 25277 to 25278). The use of triclosan in products for treating sunburn will be addressed in the Federal Register at a later date in another OTC drug rulemaking for drug products for this use.

One comment stated that the Panel did not review safety and effectiveness data submitted to it on mercufenol chloride (orthohydroxyphenylmercuric chloride) 0.1 percent and secondary amyltricresols 0.1 percent as single ingredients and in combination for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation, skin antiseptic, and skin wound protectant (Ref. 1). The comment added that the agency did not discuss these ingredients alone or in combination in the previous tentative final monograph. The comment asserted that secondary amyltricresols, mentioned in the previous tentative final monograph under phenol (43 FR 1210 at 1238), is not equivalent to phenol because of chemical differences and differing antimicrobial properties, formulation concentrations, and patterns of use. The comment requested the agency to make decisions on the safety and effectiveness of this ingredient when used alone, or in combination, as a patient preoperative skin preparation, a skin antiseptic, or a skin wound protectant. The agency has previously reviewed data for first aid antiseptic uses of 0.1 percent mercufenol chloride and 0.1 percent secondary amyltricresols and found the evidence insufficient to support their safety and effectiveness either as single ingredients or in combination (56 FR 33644 at 33668). Only safety data on animals were submitted by the comment (Ref. 1); in general, these studies were conducted on a very small number of animals, did not detail methodology, and did not adequately describe results (physical condition of the animals). The submitted in vitro studies also lack sufficient detail to establish the effectiveness of mercufenol chloride.
