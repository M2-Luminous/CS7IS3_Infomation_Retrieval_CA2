Abdulatipov, first deputy minister of nationality affairs and regional policy and deputy chairman of the Federation Council, by Yelena Dikun, under the rubric "Reputation"; place and date not given: "Ramazan Abdulatipov: `I Am Sincere and Direct'"] [Text] Ramazan Abdulatipov has become famous as a politician who stays afloat under all regimes. On this score he is considered to be a worthy successor to the legendary, "unsinkable" Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan. This former chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation (and prior to this, an executive official of the CPSU Central Committee) is still in the saddle while most of Abdulatipov's old comrades-in-arms from the parliament failed to hang on at the rough turns of history: Some ended up in prison, others are in disgrace. He is now first deputy minister of nationality affairs and regional policy of the Russian Federation and deputy chairman of the Federation Council. In the words of Ramazan Gadzhimuratovich himself, the secret of his long political life is quite simple. [Abdulatipov] I have a principle: The higher I rise in my life, the more resolutely I give up displays of personal ambitions. As a politician I just do not have the right to show my hatred or even dislike toward someone; I must remember at all times that there are 300,000 voters standing behind me, as was the case in the old parliament, or as now the entire Dagestan is, and that any sharp word or action of mine will ricochet and hit them. I felt this particularly acutely after I signed in 1991 the statement of the "six," in which we warned that Boris Nikolayevich was inclined toward authoritarianism and incapable of collective work, and that a handful of courtiers held sway rather than the Supreme Soviet. To this day I believe that this statement was timely, and had both sides pondered it calmly, the one criticizing and the one criticized, the subsequent confrontation could have been avoided. However, my presentation at the time infringed on the interests of voters in a way. Following this, I began to behave in a more restrained manner, mindful that specific people stand behind me. There is one more aspect: I have endeavored not to allow myself a single insulting attack that would be an affront to the honor and dignity of my political opponents, no matter what my attitude toward those opponents is. I remember well how hard it was for my relatives when mud was slung at me right and left after the statement of the "six." Since then, as I talk to my opponent I always imagine his circle of loved ones standing behind him. Besides, I am a straightforward person. It is not the tradition of our people to settle accounts behind each other's backs. I usually express my doubts about someone's behavior and refine positions to the person's face and, as a rule, due to this I manage to find a common language with that person. Therefore, the phenomenon of my "unsinkability" is explained primarily by the fact that life compelled me to become a centrist. [Dikun] In addition to the action of the "six," you took part in creating Skokov's Accord for the Motherland committee, which was likewise of an anti-Yeltsin persuasion. You stayed in the White House until the end. Moreover, at a conference of the components of the Federation you expressed the point of view of the rebellious parliament quite definitively. What did the president forgive all your sins for? [Abdulatipov] If we were to use your terminology, "forgiveness" was, apparently, granted for the same reason--my criticism is sincere and direct, I do not weave a web of clandestine intrigues. On a human level, I like Yeltsin; his direct approach is somehow akin to that of a mountaineer, although I disagree with his political course on many points. The hadith [prophetic tradition] of the Prophet Muhammad says: "Beware of the ignorant." I have always viewed manifestations of all extremes as a sign of ignorance. If we sort this out, there were no irreconcilable differences between the economic and political approaches of the representative and executive authorities. Much is explained by the struggle for access to the president. At certain stages, Rutskoy and Khasbulatov were among Yeltsin's closest entourage, but subsequently this space was occupied by other people, and the most elementary human jealousy became a factor. The tragedy of the situation was in the fact that the people at the very "top" were unable to "arrange" their ambitions according to rank and subdue their pride. As far as I was concerned, all my criticism of the president notwithstanding, I was prepared to cooperate with him in the interests of Russia. Thus, on the eve of the Seventh Congress I brought my entire chamber to him in the Kremlin in search of an accord. I was later berated for this in the Supreme Soviet: You went and bowed down to the president, they said; why did you not summon him to the White House? I answered: "He is older than I and, according to our customs, I must go to him." During the days of the October events I did not conduct negotiations about who would surrender to whom or about our readiness to confess--not at the conference of Federation components in St. Petersburg, not in the Constitutional Court, not at the Monastery of St. Daniel. The discussion was about eliminating the extremes on both sides, about saving the parliament and the president in the existing situation. Alas.... [Dikun] After the dispersal of the parliament you went into state service--you became Shakhray's first deputy in the State Committee for Federation and Nationality Affairs (now it is the Ministry for Nationality Affairs and Regional Policy--OBSHCHAYA GAZETA). Do you intend to pursue the course of the parliament on the nationality issue within that establishment? [Abdulatipov] I have always believed that we have created many hotbeds of ethnic conflicts with our own hands. I have repeatedly told Yavlinskiy and Gaydar that in this enormous country there may not be a single model for transition to a market economy. Dozens of versions adapted to local conditions are needed--the Dagestani model, the Khakass model, and so on. Meanwhile, the economic reform was built on purely a party approach: A Gosplan [State Planning Committee] concept of who is to develop which way was issued from Moscow. As a result, all the republics began to climb out on their own. Failing to see a niche for itself in the reform, Tatarstan stepped aside and began to pursue its own policy; Chechnya began to distance itself from Russia because of helplessness. At this point people are only aware of failures. Meanwhile, we in the Soviet of Nationalities succeeded in averting a war on Moscow, which was actually declared by autonomous okrugs and oblasts, by signing the Federation Treaty with them. We have stopped the secession of many republics from the Russian Federation, including Yakutia and Bashkortostan. Incidentally, when unrest began in North Caucasus, Shelov-Kovedyayev, Poltoranin, Medvedev, and Khasbulatov went to Chechnya. I went with my group to Kabardino-Balkaria, where the situation was no better. As a result of negotiations and consultations with national movements, we succeeded in bringing back the government, scheduling new elections, and averting a split of the autonomous entity into two republics. In Chechnya, they took a revolutionary path, and the result of this is known. Right then I wrote to Yeltsin and Khasbulatov that it was not possible to proceed from the principle of revolutionary feasibility in relations with the republics. We wanted to take the "August revolution" from the White House "to the farthest outlying areas," and this would end badly. [Dikun] They say that you had an arrangement with Shumeyko about the distribution of positions on the Federation Council: You ensure votes for him during the election of the speaker, and he ensures for you, as a reward, the position of his deputy. For this reason, you argued before the deputies in favor of voting for the candidacy of Vladimir Filippovich. [Abdulatipov] We had a somewhat different arrangement, and it was not with Shumeyko. The leaders of most republics and representatives of some autonomous entities, krays, and oblasts met in my office shortly before the beginning of the proceedings of the Federation Council. I was the first one to be nominated as a candidate for the position of speaker at this conference, but I warned right away that I would not go for the position of chairman. First, I was not morally prepared for this; second, I was afraid that now, when the anti-Caucasus card is being played, it will be hard for people to see Abdulatipov's human face behind the "person of Caucasian nationality" right away. Subsequently, the candidacy of Viktor Stepanov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Karelia, was discussed, but he also declined because he was running in the presidential elections in his republic. The candidacy of Spiridonov, chairman of the Komi Supreme Soviet, emerged at the last moment, but he also did not agree to it because he had promised his voters he would work at home. In general, an interesting situation emerged in which there was no one to bet on anymore. At that point I proposed to support Shumeyko. Some of my friends of a more conservative hue even took offense at me over this and stopped talking to me. As far as my "arrangement" with Vladimir Filippovich about becoming his deputy, long before the elections I had said that I intended to seek this position no matter who becomes chairman, and asked the leaders of the republic to support me. There later was such a conversation with Shumeyko, too. Therefore, this was a play in the open.
