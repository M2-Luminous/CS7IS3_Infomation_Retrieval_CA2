It could provide dozens more. Will it get the chance? "We want normal living and working conditions. The decision is yours: If Russia and the Sakha Republic want gold, you have to give us a chance to mine it, provide us with all of the financing for the 1994 program, and make adjustments in the system of taxation. If you plan to continue ruining the gold industry of the republic and Russia, if we and our labor are no longer needed, give us a chance to leave Yakutia with dignity, allocate money from centralized funds for this purpose, and give us a friendly sendoff. We earned this by living in the severe conditions of the polar region." These blunt and resentful statements are taken from a message from the miners of the polar Kularzoloto Combine to the president and Government of the Russian Federation and the president and Government of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). This is a response to the local Ministry of Industry's decision to close the combine. Suddenly the hottest topics of discussion are the obliteration of the settlements of Kular, Severnyy, Vlasovo, and Entuziastov, the placement of people in new jobs, and their resettlement. The northerners are understandably infuriated by these developments. Once again, without consulting anyone or trying to find a compromise acceptable to all of the parties concerned, officials are prepared to abandon the common laborers to the whims of fate, leaving them defenseless against the present state of bedlam in Russia. Yes, it is true that gold mining is a costly undertaking in this region, but it cannot cost more than money, as the saying goes, and the yellow metal is the world equivalent of money--the world equivalent, but not the Russian equivalent. In its efforts to leap into the planetary market, our government is buying gold from the miners at fixed prices based on the London exchange rate, but the miners have to buy vehicles, mining equipment, and fuel at domestic "floating" prices, which escaped the government's control long ago and are now two or three times as high as world prices. What kind of profit margin can they expect under these conditions? Furthermore, that is not the only problem. Gold can only be panned in the summer in the Far North. The rest of the year is spent in preparations--the dredging of gold-bearing sand, and so forth. All of this work has to be done on credit. Enterprises have no working capital of their own, and our market-based government's tax rates have deprived the mining combines of any chance of accumulating this capital. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance and the Committee on Precious Metals have refused to provide advance financing for mining operations. It is a vicious circle. Is there really no alternative to closing the mining enterprise and stopping the extraction of the precious metal? There probably is. One possible option would entail a lighter tax burden or even total exemption from taxes. More than half of the value of the gold mined by the combines is now appropriated for the budget. If these funds could be left at the disposal of the combines, they would have a chance to catch their breath and consider ways of keeping the production capacities operating in the future. The very idea of a differentiated approach to taxation, however, sounds heretical to orthodox market advocates. In addition, there is no money for the resettlement of the Kular miners. The miners of Kular are indignant and are holding rallies. Regrettably, they have no other means of protest. It would be senseless to go on strike at an enterprise that is being closed. Will the presidents choose to listen to their plea?
