FR940912-1-00040 FR940912-1-00010 (6) Minimum steam quality of 2,765 kilojoules per kilogram. The first of three additional treatment process compliance options that are formatted as a numerical emission limitations is a requirement for 99-percent removal of volatile organic mass from the wastewater. The 99-percent removal may be achieved through use of steam stripping on other control technologies. For example, another way to achieve the 99-percent removal is through air stripping. A second treatment process compliance option that is provided for demonstrating compliance is to treat the wastewater stream to achieve a volatile organic concentration of 50 ppmw provided the owner or operator demonstrate a volatile organic mass removal of 95 percent or greater. This treatment option is provided to allow additional flexibility for the owner in demonstrating compliance with the wastewater treatment standard; treatment of wastewater streams to a concentration of less than 50 ppmw generates a wastewater stream that would require no additional control from the point at which it exits the treatment unit. This option is limited in its applicability for the reasons discussed in Section IV.F.3. The 50 ppmw limit was selected based on analysis characterizing the volatile organic concentration of wastewater streams in the SOCMI database that would be subject to the proposed standards both before and after treatment. The limit is the minimum concentration that characterizes the volatile organic level of SOCMI wastewater streams treated to comply with the proposed standards using the BDT steam stripper. The third numerical emission limitation option for demonstrating compliance is to remove a calculated mass of VOC from a wastewater stream where the mass of VOC to be removed is calculated on the basis of the annual average wastewater density and flow rate and the volatile organic average concentration in the wastewater stream. This option is designed to accommodate the control of combined streams for the reasons discussed in section IV.F.3. The proposed rule also provides an alternative treatment process compliance option for biological treatment units; under the alternative, an owner or operator must treat affected wastewater streams in a biological treatment unit that destroys at least 95 percent of the organics. The EPA is allowing a 95-percent destruction efficiency for biological treatment units as a compliance alternative for the treatment process standards in part because the Agency believes the use of these units will have the effect of increasing the overall mass reduction achieved under the rule. This results from the fact that if affected wastewater streams are allowed to be managed in a biological treatment unit, then it is fully expected that other non- affected wastewater streams would also be managed in these biological treatment units, resulting in additional control achieved or streams that may not otherwise be controlled under the regulation. The alternative for biotreatment units in this rule is also consistent with other regulations regarding wastewater treatment, such as the biotreatment provisions of the HON. 4. Vent Collection for Vapor Recovery or Destruction Volatile organic compounds are emitted from vents on enclosed or covered process wastewater collection and treatment system devices such as individual drain systems and steam strippers. These emissions are required to be vented through a closed-vent system meeting the requirements established in the rule. The closed-vent system must route these vapors to a vapor recovery or destruction device achieving at least a 95-percent destruction or recovery. This limitation is based on the average efficiency of a conventional VOC recovery devices. The option of meeting an equivalent standard (achieving an outlet concentration of 20 ppm by volume on a dry basis corrected to 3 percent oxygen or providing a minimum residence time and temperature) for enclosed combustion devices is provided as well. Because biological treatment units destroy the VOC in the wastewater, a well-operated biological treatment unit is not required to be covered and vented to vapor recovery and destruction. Instead, the proposed regulation requires an owner or operator electing to use a biological treatment unit to meet the 95 percent control requirement by demonstrating that 95 percent of the volatile organic entering the biological treatment unit is being destroyed and not emitted to the atmosphere. H. Modification and Reconstruction Considerations Under the General Provisions for modification (40 CFR 60.14) and reconstruction (40 CFR 60.15), facilities that are modified or reconstructed after the date of proposal of a standard are subject to the standard. An owner or operator of an existing facility who is planning changes in the facility that could be considered modification or reconstruction shall notify the appropriate EPA Regional Office 60 days prior to making the changes or commencing construction, as applicable. The enforcement division of the appropriate EPA Regional Office will make the final determination as to whether an existing facility is modified or reconstructed and, as a result, subject to the standards of performance of an affected facility.
