His decree published in the local press instructs the state taxation committee to bring criminal charges in cases of tax evasion, illegal exports and other offences damaging to Uzbekistan's economic interests. Prosecuting officers, the security services and interior ministry are instructed to speed up investigation into offences related to tax evasion and illegal exports so that no culprit goes unpunished. In one other decree, Karimov ordered an improvement of the country's banking system and stabilization of financial and crediting relations. Banks are told to finalize the installation of computers by 1 October. The decree also envisages the introduction of computerized postal services ensuring an automatic stock taking of available cash and prevention of illicit payment or crediting operations. Uzbekistan is planning to tighten crediting and monetary policies and bring an end to easy term government credits to different sectors of the economy. In this connection, the government has given local banks four weeks in which to study the experience gained by leading world and CIS banks before submitting proposals on how to readjust local bank operations to market requirements.
