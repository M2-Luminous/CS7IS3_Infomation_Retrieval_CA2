Two of these projects were made known this weekend. The first project, which was approved by an ample majority in Congress, foresees national elections being held separate from municipal elections. Of the two other projects, which were promoted by teachers unions through the popular mechanism of obtaining 10 percent of the signatures of those who figure on the election lists, one calls for a clause in the Constitution to oblige the government to set aside 27 percent of the national budget, or 4.3 percent of the GDP, for the educational sector. The second seeks to prevent any modifications to the pension and social security system, which is now in the hands of the state, to avoid future privatizations. If the proposal to improve the educational sector receives the required 1.2 million votes, the budget for education will increase from $380 million to $600 million. The project for reforming the educational sector obtained 430,000 signatures, which must now be checked by the Electoral Court, while the pension and social security project obtained 280,000. A minimum of 230,000 valid signatures of citizens registered to vote, 10 percent of those who are registered at the electoral offices in accordance with the Constitution, are needed to request a constitutional reform. The presentation was made on the last valid day and Electoral Court President Juan Carlos Furest has said the court "now faces a dramatic situation due to the volume of last minute projects for constitutional reform." The Electoral Court must now organize the election, and control and verify some 700,000 signatures. Furest explained that these tasks surpass the physical capability of the Electoral Court. He said the 1,500 Electoral Court employees have just finished the slow process of registering new voters and are now purging the registers of the balloting places where more than 2 million Uruguayans will vote on 19 November. The cost of the elections, which has been estimated at $5 million, will increase due to the simultaneous voting. Furest stressed that the Electoral Court will carry out its task and comply with the Constitution, but added that it will not be easy to double the work of the employees, who are working between 10 and 12 hours a day.
