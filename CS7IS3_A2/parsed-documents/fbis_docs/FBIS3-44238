[Unidentified reporter] In its communique, the Beninese Human Rights Commission refers to Article 25 of the 11 December 1990 Beninese Constitution, which stipulates that the state recognizes [words indistinct] the conditions fixed by the law, the freedom of movement, the freedom of association, the freedom to meet, the freedom to stage marches and demonstrations. The Beninese Human Rights Commission therefore states that in light of that, the interior minister's decision is arbitrary and illegal. It therefore condemns the minister's decision and calls on the government to take necessary measures to ensure that such acts are not repeated in Benin. The Independent Parliamentary Group also referred to Article 25 of the Beninese Constitution and reminded the public that such actions should not be tolerated in the country. [passage omitted]
