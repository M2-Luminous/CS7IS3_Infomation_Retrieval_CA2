The skidding of the "analytical machine" became so obvious that two parallel projects for reforming the presidential apparatus were born in the Kremlin simultaneously. One is being developed by deputy administration chief Sergey Krasavchenko. Its essence, according to Sergey Filatov, consists in that the three analytical centers under the president, headed by Nikolay Malyshev, Anatoliy Rakitov and Petr Filippov, will be reorganized as a single expert-analytical center. This center or expert council should concentrate all analytical information coming in from various research structures and work out recommendations for the president, the government, and leaders of the Russian regions. Each expert will be responsible for a particular area of activity and have a corresponding working group assigned to him. In spite of its obvious symmetry, this system does not root out the isolation of the presidential administrative structures: Along with the expert-analytical council, the corps of advisers and various directorates under the president will remain. Duplication is inevitable. The other plan for reforming the administration is being devised by independent experts from among the Presidential Council members. It rules out the horizontal subdivision of structures within the administration. This is a classic hierarchic scheme whereby the head of the "pyramid" will have several deputies with the rank of presidential aides. In their turn the deputies will have mid-level analyst personnel subordinated to them while the latter will rely on working groups supplying "raw material" and providing preliminary information analysis. In fact, however, competition is unfolding not so much between two concepts as between two figures. Journalists who are at home in the Kremlin corridors of power know very well that there are two competing camps in the presidential apparatus. These are the administration headed by Sergey Filatov, and a staff of experts/analysts headed by Viktor Ilyushin, the president's closest aide and chief of his personal office, and who was also Boris Yeltsin's associate in Sverdlov party structures. Viktor Ilyushin is apparently the most "tight-lipped" [zastegnutyy] man in the presidential apparatus, and the most influential. Mr. Ilyushin tends to favor the second scheme, whose essence lies in building a single "pyramid" of the presidential apparatus with himself sitting at its top. Strictly speaking, neither Mr. Ilyushin nor Mr. Filatov are analysts. They substantially differ in the extent of openness in politics -- openness, the need for which was highlighted by President Yeltsin at his post-election press conference. Viktor Ilyushin has perfect command of the apparatus situation but, as journalists already know, with his style of work the "presidential court" will be fenced off by a solid wall of silence and secrecy. Sergey Filatov's rejection of a deputy's chair in the State Duma rather signifies his intention to head the drive to reform the administration. According to some reports, reorganization will apparently follow the scheme proposed by him. Boris Yeltsin, too, will hardly decline his good offices and charismatic image.
