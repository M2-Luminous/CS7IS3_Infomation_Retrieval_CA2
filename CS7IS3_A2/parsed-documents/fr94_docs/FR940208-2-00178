FR940208-2-00178 FR940208-2-00093 Rules 38 to 40 Rules 38 to 40 provide for requests for extraordinary challenge committees. Rule 38, which consolidates portions of former rules 34 and 40 and which provides for request for an extraordinary challenge committee, has been amended to reflect the addition of rule 79A to the Article 1904 Panel Rules. Rule 79A provides for the issuance of a Notice of Final Panel Action which triggers the running of the time period for filing a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee. Subrule 38(1), therefore, requires that a Party file a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee referred to in Article 1904.13(a)(ii) or (iii) within 30 days after the issuance, pursuant to rule 79A of the Article 1904 Panel Rules, of the Notice of Final Panel Action in the panel review that is the subject of the Request. Subrule 38(2)(a) requires that a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee referred to in Article 1904.13(a)(i) also be filed within 30 days after the issuance of the Notice of Final Panel Action. Where, however, a Party gains knowledge of the action of the panelist giving rise to the allegation under Article 1904.13(a)(i) more than 30 days after the issuance of a Notice of Final Panel Action, subject to subrule 38(3), subrule 38(2)(b) requires a Party to file the Request no more than 30 days after gaining knowledge of the action of the panelist. There is a limitation, found in subrule 38(3), which states that no Request pertaining to a panelist's action may be filed if two years or more have elapsed since the issuance of the Notice of Completion of Final Panel Review pursuant to rule 80 or 81 of the Article 1904 Panel Rules. Rule 39 consolidates former subrule 35(a) and portions of subrule 40(1) and sets out the information to be contained in a Request for Extraordinary Challenge Committee. Subrule 39(2) has been added to provide that where a Request contains an allegation referred to in Article 1904.13(a)(i) of the Agreement, the identity of the panelist against whom such an allegation is made shall be revealed only in a confidential annex filed together with the Request and shall be disclosed only in accordance with rule 61. Rule 40, which consolidates former subrule 35(b) and portions of former subrule 40(1), provides for the materials to accompany a Request for Extraordinary Challenge Committee. Rules 41 and 42 Rules 41 and 42 provide for Notices of Appearance. Rule 41 consolidates former rules 37 and 42, and sets out the procedure for filing Notices of Appearance in response to a Request for an Extraordinary Challenge Committee. Subrule 41(1) provides for filing of the Notice and for the information to be contained in the Notice. Subrules 41 (2) and (3) provide for the submission of documents on the administrative record of the panel review not specified in the Index. Rule 42, formerly rule 43, provides that where a panelist has made a motion for an in camera hearing and has filed documents under seal in support of that motion, and where the committee denies the motion, the panelist is permitted to withdraw those documents. Rules 43 and 44 Rules 43 and 44 provide for the filing and content of briefs and appendices. Rule 43, formerly rule 38, provides for the filing of briefs and has been amended to provide for the filing of appendices along with the briefs. Rule 44, formerly rule 51, sets out the structure and content of briefs. Subrule 44(1) has been amended to add the requirement for binding of briefs. Subrule 44(1) has been further amended and subrule 44(3) has been added to clarify the structure and content of a table of authorities. Rule 45 Rule 45, which amends former rule 52, provides for motions. The new rule clarifies that a committee may dispose of a motion based on the pleadings and that, if there is oral argument, it may be heard by telephone conference call, so long as there is no disclosure of personal, privileged or proprietary information.
