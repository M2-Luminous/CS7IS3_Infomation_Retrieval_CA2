The subject was raised on 1 March in camera. The contested 18 January elected senators and those of the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion are allegedly determined to fill the vacuum at the executive level, according to Senator Amos Andre. [Begin recording] [Andre in Creole] We senators of the Republic, as a power and a state institution -- coguardians of the national sovereignty -- are working relentlessly to offer the country a government, a government issued from the country's Constitution and laws. [Reporter Jean] The country's Constitution and laws -- Articles 148 and 149, while the president of this office speaks of Article 111? [Andre] I do not want to go into Articles 148, 149, and 111. We are simply working on a solution based on the Constitution. [Jean] Will this solution take into account President Aristide's position, which you have restored, as well as the position of the international community, which Sen. Sansaricq has recent visited? [Andre] When we make a decision within the scope of the Constitution as the Senate of the Republic, it is not because it would please this person or that person, it is simply that it is a legal decision. Another aspect of the question -- since we are in a context of crisis, where political interests are at stake -- is that some political compromises must be made on both sides in order to find a solution to the crisis.
