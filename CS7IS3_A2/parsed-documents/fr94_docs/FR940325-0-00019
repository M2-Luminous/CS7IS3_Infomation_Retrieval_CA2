FR940325-0-00019 FR940325-0-00005 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing 24 CFR Parts 905 and 941 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1690; FR&hyph;3550&hyph;F&hyph;02] RIN 2577&hyph;AB34 Public and Indian Housing Development_Amendment to Calculation of Total Development Cost AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule adopts as final an interim rule, published on November 29, 1993, which revised the Department's regulations at 24 CFR parts 905 and 941 to remove donations (non-public or non-Indian housing funds) from the Department's calculation of total development cost (TDC). The Department's experience indicated that the inclusion of donations within the TDC of projects has created unwarranted delays in the development process, and, in some cases, has been a contributory reason for cost increases in the low-income housing development process. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For Public Housing, Janice Rattley, Director of the Office of Construction, Rehabilitation and Maintenance, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., room 4136, Washington, DC 20410. Telephone (202) 708&hyph;1800 (voice) or (202) 708&hyph;4594 (TDD). (These are not toll-free numbers.) For Indian Housing, Dom Nessi, Director, Office of Native American Programs, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., room 4140, Washington, DC 20410. Telephone (202) 708&hyph;1015 (voice) or (202) 708&hyph;4594 (TDD). (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 1. The November 29, 1993 Interim Rule On November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62522), HUD published an interim rule to remove donations (non-public or non-Indian housing funds) from the Department's calculation of total development cost (TDC). Before publication of the November 29, 1993 interim rule, the regulations for HUD's public housing development program and Indian housing development program (codified, respectively, in 24 CFR parts 941 and 905) provided for the inclusion of donations (non-public or non-Indian housing funds), in calculating the total development cost (TDC). The project TDC would then be compared to the published TDC limitations currently in effect, which could result in actual development costs that are less than, the same as, or more than the published TDC limitations. Under this procedure, if the project TDC exceeded 100 percent of the published TDC limitation, notwithstanding the reason for the increase over the TDC limitation or the source of funding for the increase, the Field Office was unable to approve the project TDC without authorization of the Regional Administrator or the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. This approval procedure was intended to verify Field Office processing, and to ensure that the project TDC would provide modest, non-luxury, durable housing at a reasonable cost. In actual fact, however, the TDC approval process, which did not take into consideration that donations may be the reason for, or the source of payment of, the increase over the TDC limits, resulted in unwarranted delays in the development process because of the amount of time it takes for the request to move through the system. In some cases, these delays were a contributory reason for cost increases in development of public and Indian housing. The amendments to be made by the November 29, 1993 interim rule, and adopted in final by this rule, permit HUD Field Offices to calculate the project TDC relative to published TDC limitations, and to authorize housing agencies to proceed with developments, without referral to Regional Administrators or the Assistant Secretary, where funds in excess of TDC limits are provided through donations. Where funds in excess of TDC limits will not be provided through donations, Field Offices must continue to seek authorization from the Regional Administrators or the Assistant Secretary. HUD will not provide funds to housing agencies under section 5 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 in excess of TDC limitations without such authorization. The specific sections in 24 CFR parts 905 and 941 amended by the November 29, 1993 interim rule, and adopted in final by this rule, are as follows: Sections 905.102 and 941.103 are each amended by revising the definition of ``total development cost'' contained in these sections to clarify that maximum total development cost excludes any donations. Sections 905.255 and 941.204 are amended to add a new paragraph to each section that will clarify that although donations are not included in the project TDC calculations, donations must be included in the project development cost budget. A new paragraph (j) has been added to ยง905.255 and a new paragraph (d) has been added to ยง941.204. Additionally, ยง905.255(a)(2) is amended to clarify that the ``inclusion of all costs'' discussed in this paragraph does not include donations. Additionally, ยง941.406 is amended to clarify that the total project cost refers to HUD funds. 2. Public Comments The November 29, 1993 interim rule solicited public comments through January 28, 1994. By the expiration of the comment period, only one comment was received. The commenter, a public housing agency, stated that it was in full agreement with the interim rule, and supported the amendment to HUD's regulations. Since no other comments were received on the interim rule, and since the Department intends to make no further changes, the Department will adopt as its final rule the November 29, 1993 interim rule.
