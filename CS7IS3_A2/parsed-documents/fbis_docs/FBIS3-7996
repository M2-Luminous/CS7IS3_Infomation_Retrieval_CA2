The UN Secretary General's special envoy for the region, Yasushi Akashi, meanwhile criticized the international community for its "lukewarm and negative response up to date" on the urgent need to send reinforcements to Bosnia. He said the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) needed an additional 10,650 troops immediately, 4,600 of them to be deployed in Sarajevo and the remainder to monitor a ceasefire agreement between the Moslems and Bosnian Croats in central and southern Bosnia. Cot echoed Akashi's criticism saying that NATO's readiness to send troops to Bosnia only after a global peace accord is reached "was a funny and not very courageous idea." "They can all change their mind and send troops tomorrow if they wanted," he said. "I really wish the United States could dispatch ground troops tomorrow. "What I need are troops immediately and the nations that can send send these troops immediately can be counted on one hand -- the Americans, the British and the French." He said NATO initially was considering sending 100,000 additional troops to Bosnia but the number had been reduced by half, to 50,000. "Today, I'm asking for 10,000, and if they don't want all the headway we've made in Sarajevo to fall through, we need these troops immediately," Cot warned. [passage omitted] Meanwhile in Britain, a serious clash is looming between the British Government and defence chiefs over the government's refusal to send more troops to Bosnia, the DAILY TELEGRAPH reported Thursday. Military service chiefs say the 2,300 troops there are so thinly spread that they could be dangerously exposed if the war worsens, it said.
