FR941007-2-00118 FR941007-2-00072 The Exchange believes that these revision will provide the Exchange with the flexibility necessary to evaluate the suitability of such securities for listing. The Exchange states that hybrid securities have special appeal for various investors, especially institutions. The Exchange also believes that securities admitted to listing under Section 107A of the Guide benefit investors by providing important investment, hedging, and market timing opportunities, as well as benefiting those issuers that offer hybrid securities as a means of raising capital at an advantageous cost. With respect to Section 107B, the Exchange proposes a number of changes which it believes will provide for greater flexibility in the listing criteria for ELNs and the criteria for the underlying linked stock. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to: (1) amend the definition of an ELN to encompass instruments which are linked, in whole or in part, to the market performance of a non-convertible preferred stock; (2) amend Section 107B(d) to provide an additional minimum market capitalization and trading volume tier for the underlying security of $500 million in market capitalization and 80 million shares traded in the 12-months prior to the date of listing;ยง 4 (3) amend Section 107B(d) to provide the Exchange with flexibility, subject to the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, to list an ELN linked to a security that does not meet the specific market capitalization and volume criteria; 5 and (4) amend Section 107B(f) to provide for the issuance of ELNs, subject to the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, that relate to more than the allowable maximum percentages of outstanding shares of the underlying security. 6 Finally, the Exchange proposes to clarify that issuers of ELNs have the option of specifying at the time of issuance that the issuer may satisfy their obligations at maturity of the ELN either with cash or by physical delivery of the underlying linked stock. The Exchange shall require any issuer that reserves the right to make physical delivery of the underlying stock at maturity, to publish notice, no less than 10 and no more than 20 business days prior to maturity of the ELN, of how the issuer intends to satisfy its obligations. 7 4 Currently, the underlying linked security must either have: (i) a minimum market capitalization of $3 billion and a trading volume in the U.S. during the 12 months preceding listing of the ELN of at least 2.5 million shares; or (ii) a minimum market capitalization of $1.5 billion and a trading volume in the U.S. during the 12 months preceding listing of the ELN of at least 20 million shares. 5 Depending on the proposed facts, the Commission may require the Exchange to submit a rule filing to the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act to address the regulatory issues raised by any proposed offering of ELNs that does not satisfy the market capitalization and/or trading volume requirements of Section 107B of the Guide. In this connection, the Commission notes that any proposal to list an ELN linked to a security with a market capitalization of less than $500 million would raise significant regulatory concerns for which a Section 19(b) rule filing would be required. 6 As with the market capitalization and trading volume requirements, the Commission notes that based on the proposed facts, the Exchange may be required to submit a rule filing to the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act to address regulatory issues raised by any Exchange proposal to list an ELN related to more than the allowable percentages of outstanding shares of the underlying security. 7 See Amendment No. 1, supra note 1. The Exchange believes these revisions strike an appropriate balance between the Exchange's responsiveness to innovation in the securities markets and its need to ensure the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. Moreover, the Exchange believes that these changes will not have an adverse impact on the markets for the underlying linked security in view of the requirements that the linked security must have a large minimum market capitalization and a large trading volume over the preceding 12 months. Under the listing standards for ELNs, without approval from the staff of the Commission, an ELN issuer will only be able to issue an ELN linked to a maximum of 5% of the outstanding shares of the underlying security. The Exchange believes, therefore, that the issuer should be able to satisfy all, or substantially all, of its obligations at maturity by physical delivery of the linked security. Under these circumstances, the Exchange believes there would be no need or incentive on the part of the ELN issuer to enter the market for the linked security to any significant degree in order to discharge its obligations to ELN holders at the time of maturity. Additionally, all of the other requirements for the listing of ELNs currently in place will continue to apply to the listing of ELNs. 8 8 See Section 107B of the Guide.
