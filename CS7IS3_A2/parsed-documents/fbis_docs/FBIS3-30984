Foreign Minister Slobodan Jarcevic said on Sunday he was confident that Yugoslavia's leadership would not do anything to Krajina's disadvantage while negotiating with Croatia on the normalization of their relations. The delegations of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia on Saturday had talks in Zagreb on the normalization of their relations, based on the declaration signed in Geneva mid-January. Jarcevic reiterated that these talks had included a large number of issues, ranging from humanitarian to political issues, and underscored he held the view that Croatia was responsible for the exile of 300,000 Serbs, who did not in any way violate the laws of the new Croatian government. For that reason, Croatia should be 'put before the bar of justice,' Jarcevic said. On the issue of the re-opening of communications, in particular the Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, Jarcevic repeated the already familiar conditions set by R.S.K. that had to be fulfilled first: peace must be established between R.S.K. and Croatia and Croatia must allow R.S.K. to establish foreign trade. R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 in predominantly Serb-populated parts of Croatia in response to its forcible secession from former Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce the constituent nation status of Serbs to that of a national minority. R.S.K. has been the U.N. protected area (UNPA) since March 1992 and, as planned, it will keep this status until a final political solution has been found. After the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia had signed the declaration on the normalization of their relations, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said that the declaration did not prejudge the issue of the R.S.K. final status.
