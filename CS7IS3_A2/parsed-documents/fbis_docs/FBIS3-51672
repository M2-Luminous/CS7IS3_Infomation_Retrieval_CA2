The State Council president said Gaviria did not violate the Constitution if he had the Senate's approval; otherwise, he is in a serious situation. President Gaviria has until 8 February to tell the State Council the truth about the U.S. forces' presence in Colombia and the overflights of U.S. aircraft on the country's northern coast. The 26 magistrates will then meet to study the situation and decide whether the Colombian president violated the Constitution. For the time being, it is known that neither the Senate nor the State Council have been consulted by the government to allow the transit of U.S. soldiers through Colombian territory. [Begin recording] [State Council President Amado Gutierrez] If the Senate has given its authorization, then he would obviously have no problem. [Garzon] The Senate said no. [Gutierrez] That is what we have to establish. [end recording] According to the State Council, this is the first time a Colombian president has been questioned in connection with the presence of foreign troops in our country without prior approval from the Senate. [Begin Gutierrez recording] There is no precedent for a State Council's ruling to allow the transit of foreign troops in the country. [end recording] Therefore, in order to decide President Gaviria's culpability or innocence, the State Council expects to learn from the government under what conditions the permit was issued.[end recording]
