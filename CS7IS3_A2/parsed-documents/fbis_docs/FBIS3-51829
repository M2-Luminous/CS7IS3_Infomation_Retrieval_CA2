[Suarez] Good morning, how are you? [Naranjo] Well, I woke you up early once again. We were unable to make the connection on Sunday [22 January], but here we are now. I want to convey greetings on behalf of the people from Las Tunas and from Cuba as a whole, who remember you with great gratitude. Reverend, we understand that you and singer-composer Silvio Rodriguez have been invited to participate in a day of protest against the blockade in the United States. Can you tell us something about this invitation? [Suarez] This invitation was extended by Teresa Gutierrez and former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who have planned this activity, first, to convey once again the international opinion against the U.S. blockade against Cuba; and second, to a certain extent, to stage a demonstration of support to the bill that Charles Rangel, representative from Harlem in New York, will submit within the next few days, between 10 and 12 February. He proposes free communications with Cuba, which would represent a blow to the Torricelli law, a law we have endured for so many years. The invitation is for me, together with Rev. Lucius Walker, Ramsey Clark, Teresa Gutierrez, and Bishop Gumbleton, to speak on the occasion. They want me to speak at this event. Silvio will support the cultural part of the event in addition to other activities they have planned. The invitation also includes.... [Naranjo, interrupting] I would like to ask another brief question. Have there been any difficulties concerning the issuance of visas to enter the United States? [Suarez] Both Silvio and I have requested visas from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. At first, they said there would be no problems; but then they told me that my application would be sent to the State Department in Washington and that I should have an answer in three and four weeks. So, I am waiting for an answer. [passage omitted]
