I express condolences to the Azerbaijani people and to the families, kin, and relatives of our sons and daughters who attained immortality in the struggle for our freedom, and in our sorrowful days I call on all of them to unite in the name of our martyrs. Today we must stand up for our salvation and the purity of our spiritual world, and we have to embrace our faith and look to the future to save ourselves from the quagmire of tragic incidents. In their appeals to me as president, martyrs' families and all the citizens of Azerbaijan ask for the speedy restoration of morality and justice. I swear upon all our martyred sons, who have turned this country into a sacred homeland, and upon the unwavering dignity of our gloomy-eyed elderly mothers and sisters: Rest assured, we will stop the calamity and disaster that have befallen our homeland, which is now overcast by dark clouds. O, rise my sacred people! [Signed] Geydar Aliyev
