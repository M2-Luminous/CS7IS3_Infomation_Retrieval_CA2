Leon Brittan, European commissioner for trade policy, told reporters that he discussed Japanese trade issues in a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on Tuesday. "We share a common view that Japan has a trade surplus which is too large and that part of the problem of that surplus is caused by difficulties in access to the Japanese market," Brittan said after his meeting with Kantor. The EU, which also runs a sizable trade deficit with Japan, has expressed concern that U.S. pressure on Japan to open up its markets through bilateral negotiations would come at the expense of European interests. Brittan reiterated that concern during his current trip to Washington, arguing that Japan and the U.S. should take a "tripartite approach" in their trade talks by letting the Europeans in on their negotiation process. The United States and Japan have been negotiating for nearly one year on ways to slash Japan's massive trade surplus, but the talks have run into stalemate over U.S. demands to set "numerical indicators" to measure the openness of Japanese markets. Brittan, speaking at the National Press Club in Washington, said the EU is opposed [to] the concept of setting numerical targets for specific industry sectors because that would increase government interference in the markets. Instead, Brittan said the Japanese Government should undertake specific fiscal policy commitments, describing such macroeconomic targets as "useful" in bringing down Japan's trade surplus. "With a slightly different method we might be able to reach an agreement that would satisfy all our concerns," Brittan said. Brittan also raised the Japan trade issue in an address to the European Institute in Washington on Monday, saying that the EU and the U.S. should cooperate to remove "flagrant rules and regulations" in Japan that block trading opportunities for foreign businesses. The so-called "framework" trade talks between Japan and the United States have been suspended since they broke down at the summit meeting between President Bill Clinton and former Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington on February 11. Japanese and U.S. officials say they have no idea when the trade talks will be resumed, and the uncertainty has been compounded by the political turmoil in Japan, with newly elected Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata having difficulty forming a new government.
