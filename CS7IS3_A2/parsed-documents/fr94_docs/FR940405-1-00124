FR940405-1-00124 FR940405-1-00013 (4) Is it necessary and appropriate to require employers to authorize a ``designated person'' to be responsible for ensuring compliance with an indoor air quality standard? Why? Why not? If it is appropriate to require a designated person, what training should designated persons have in order to carry out their responsibilities under the proposed rule? Should the designated person be a person who is a full-time employee who is within the facility each day? Should a designated person be on-site during each shift? Is it unreasonable to expect that due to the complexity of building systems, a single designated person within a facility can successfully oversee and ensure adequate operation of all building systems that affect indoor air quality? Why? Why not? Would it be beneficial for the designated person to receive an inventory of chemical and physical agents used by all employers on site in order to track chemical usage and storage? Information collected could include date of receipt, amount applied or used, where and when in the facility it was used, and how the remainder is stored. (5) Does the definition of the term ``HVAC system'' identify all components of HVAC systems which can adversely affect indoor air quality if not properly operated and maintained? What other components should be included and why? What components designated in the definition do not affect indoor air quality and why? (6) Is the definition of ``nonindustrial work environment'' sufficiently descriptive to differentiate them from industrial work environments? If not, what other descriptors should be included in the definition? Which types of facilities and establishments proposed under the definition as nonindustrial work environments should not be subject to this standard and why? (7) Is the definition of ``renovation and remodeling'' appropriately descriptive of such activities? If not, what modifications to the definition would more reasonably reflect industry view of the characteristics of such activities? Indoor Air Quality Compliance Program, Paragraph (c) (1) Is it necessary and appropriate to require employers to establish a written IAQ compliance program in order to assure the adequacy of indoor air quality in nonindustrial work environments? Why? Why not? (2) If establishment of a written compliance program is necessary, are the informational elements proposed to be developed under this rule appropriate and why? What is their function for successful implementation of the program? Which other written material should be made part of the IAQ compliance program and why? (3) Which informational elements proposed to be established as part of the IAQ program, if any, are irrelevant to successful building system operation and maintenance? Why? (4) Which informational elements proposed to be established as part of the IAQ program, if any, are not generally available to the employer and why? Compliance Program Implementation, Paragraph (d) (1) Which of the implementation actions proposed under this paragraph are necessary and appropriate for maintenance of acceptable indoor air quality. Why? Which are not? Why not? In this regard, specific comment is particularly sought on the need for the following proposed elements of the implementation program: (a) Maintenance and operation of the HVAC system to provide at least a required minimum outside air ventilation rate; (b) Operation of the HVAC during all work shifts; (c) Use of exhaust ventilation during maintenance and housekeeping activities; (d) Maintenance of relative humidity to below 60%; (e) Requiring HVAC system evaluation where CO 2 levels exceed 800 ppm; and (f) Requiring building system evaluation in response to employee complaints of building related illness. (g) Should the regulation prohibit the storage of hazardous substances in air transport pathways serving as return air plenums? These areas may include area-ways, plenums, chases, corridors, and mechanical rooms serving as return air plenums. Controls for Specific Contaminant Sources, Paragraph (e) (1) Will the proposed provisions addressing construction and operation of designated smoking areas assure that employees working outside designated areas will not be exposed to ETS? If so, which of the proposed provisions may be unnecessary to achieve this goal? If not, is it necessary to prohibit smoking within indoor workplaces to eliminate exposure to ETS or can the provisions as proposed be modified, or supplemented to prevent secondary exposure? If it is believed that designated smoking areas will effectively contain tobacco smoke, comment is particularly sought on the appropriateness of requiring designated smoking areas to be enclosed, exhausted directly to the outside and maintained under negative pressure. (2) Is the proposed provision requiring the use of measures such as local source capture exhaust ventilation or substitution to control air contaminants emitted from point sources where general ventilation is inadequate, feasible or effective? (3) Are the proposed provisions addressing control of microbial contamination effective, feasible, or necessary? Why? Why not? What additional provisions, if any, should be included to preclude microbial contamination for adversely affecting indoor air quality? (4) Where hazardous chemicals are used in the workplace, including cleaning and maintenance chemicals, is employee notification of their use 24 hours prior to their application, as proposed, necessary to mitigate potential incidental exposure to such chemicals? To what extent does the use of such chemicals in nonindustrial environments present a health risk to other employees, or to the acceptability of indoor air quality? Which chemicals and their uses are of particular concern in non-industrial indoor environments? (5) Are the proposed provisions specifically addressing renovation and remodeling activities necessary and appropriate and why? Particularly, are the proposed requirements to develop a work plan focusing special attention on HVAC systems, area isolation or containment, and air contaminant suppression controls necessary to limit the potential for degradation of air quality? Why? Why not? What other provisions, if any, should be included to limit the effects that renovation and remodeling activities may have on indoor environments?
