FR940825-1-00132 FR940825-1-00009 Section 114 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7414, contains provisions granting EPA broad authority to require, among other things, recordkeeping, monitoring and right of entry and inspection. It also contains provisions authorizing EPA to delegate this authority to States and, as proposed in today's rule, Tribes. Federal Facilities. Section 118 of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7418, provides that Federal facilities must comply with all Federal, State and local air pollution requirements to the same extent as nongovernmental agencies unless expressly exempted by the President. EPA is proposing to extend this authority to Tribal air pollution requirements. Financial Assistance. The provisions governing the issuance of Federal financial assistance to air pollution control agencies are set out in Title I. CAA sections 103 & 105, 42 U.S.C. 7403 & 7405. The phrase ``air pollution control agency'' for this purpose is, in turn, defined in CAA section 302(b), 42 U.S.C. 7602(b), and expressly includes ``[a]n agency of an Indian tribe.'' An ``Indian tribe'' is defined in CAA section 302(r). See discussion below under Title III/Definitions. Issues associated with the award of Federal financial assistance to Tribes are addressed in more detail in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this notice. Title II_Mobile Sources This Title contains the provisions of the Clean Air Act addressing mobile sources (e.g., automobiles, trucks, off-road vehicles). It contains provisions addressing motor vehicle emission standards as well as standards for aircraft and non-road vehicles and engines. See, e.g., CAA sections 202, 213 & 231, 42 U.S.C. 7521, 7547 & 7571. It also provides for the regulation of motor vehicle and other fuels, including registration requirements, requirements for new fuels and fuel additives as well as provisions for reformulated gasoline and low sulfur diesel fuel. CAA section 211, 42 U.S.C. 7545. Significant provisions of this Title preempt in whole or in part the issuance of State standards. For example, section 209 of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7543, precludes any State or political subdivision from controlling emissions from new motor vehicles. EPA may waive this prohibition for California, and other States may adopt California standards. CAA sections 209(b) & 177, 42 U.S.C. 7543 & 7507. Similarly, except in limited circumstances, States are precluded from enforcing controls on motor vehicle fuels that are different from those required by EPA. CAA section 211(c)(4), 42 U.S.C. 7545(c)(4). Therefore, the motor vehicle and fuel requirements in Title II generally are issued and administered by EPA unless the statute contemplates and a State qualifies for special treatment or waiver of the preemption provisions. However, some Title II provisions are administered by the States through the SIP system established under Title I. For example, States containing certain carbon monoxide and ozone nonattainment areas are required to develop and submit to EPA for approval a SIP revision establishing a clean-fuel vehicle program for motor vehicle fleets. CAA section 246, 42 U.S.C. 7586. States containing certain carbon monoxide nonattainment areas are required to develop and submit to EPA for approval a SIP revision establishing an oxygenated gasoline program. CAA section 211(m), 42 U.S.C. 7545(m). In today's action, EPA is proposing to extend this State-implemented authority to Tribes. Title III_Citizen Suits Section 304 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7604, authorizes any person who provides the minimum required advance notice to bring a civil action against: any person, including any governmental entity or agency, who is in violation of an emission limit; the Administrator of EPA where he or she fails to carry out a non-discretionary duty under the Clean Air Act or has unreasonably delayed agency action; any person who proposes to construct or constructs any new or modified major stationary source without a NSR or PSD permit that meets the requirements of the Act (described previously); and any person who is alleged to be in violation of such permit. The term ``person'' ``includes an individual, corporation, partnership, association, State, municipality, political subdivision of a State, and any agency, department, or instrumentality of the United States and any officer, agent, or employee thereof.'' Section 302(e), 42 U.S.C. 7602(e). The Federal district courts are granted jurisdiction over such legal action. In today's action, EPA is proposing that Tribes be subject to these provisions in the same manner that States are. Judicial Review of Final Agency Action. Section 307(b), 42 U.S.C. 7607(b), contains the provisions governing judicial review of final agency action issuing or approving regulations. Section 307(b) specifies in which U.S. Court of Appeals an action is to be brought and by what date a petition for review must be filed with the appropriate Court of Appeals.
