After its approval yesterday, this report became one of the UN documents condemning the savage practices of the Israeli occupation authorities in the occupied Golan, Israel's violations of basic human rights, and Israel's looting of the occupied Golan's water and agricultural resources, as well as the building of illegal settlements in the Golan. The session also approved reports on the Palestinian Arab people's situation in the occupied territories, the reconstruction of Lebanon, and cooperation among ESCWA member states on joint water resources, environment, continued development, and trade exchanges. The participants in the session elected 'Abd-al-Rahman Madani, the [Syrian] irrigation minister and head of the Syrian delegation, as first deputy at the session. The ministerial session is scheduled to continue its meetings today in order to finish discussing the topics on the agenda, led by locating a permanent headquarters for ESCWA. Jordan, Qatar, and Lebanon offered to host this headquarters on a permanent basis. The Syrian Arab delegation shared in introducing several amendments to phrases in the submitted reports. In their entirety, these amendments focused on canceling any phrase that may give the impression that there is support for the multilateral negotiations, particularly the issue of common waters.
