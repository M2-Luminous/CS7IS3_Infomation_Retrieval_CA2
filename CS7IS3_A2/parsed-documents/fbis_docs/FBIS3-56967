A State Department spokesman said the United States wished to get explanations. Explanations were given, yet some feeling of perplexity over the first response remains. Vladislav Kozyakov has been looking into the matter and has written the following: What we found surprising was the haste with which the American official spokesman expressed his displeasure with the Russian minister's statement. The State Department spokesman did not have the full text of Andrey Kozyrev's statement made at a Moscow conference on Russian policy on the territory of the former USSR. All he had was brief reports for news agencies. That, however, did not stop him from reproaching Russian policy. Moreover, the American official interpreted quite freely Kozyrev's statement about the need of a Russian military presence in the territory and even claimed it contradicted what the Russian spokesman said at the recent summit in Moscow. But where has this hasty desire to put to doubt the political course of Russia come from? This question is to the point to ask, especially in the light of the Moscow summit, which was marked by a further strengthening of the Russian-American partnership. Washington's hasty response to Andrey Kozyrev's statement can serve as a reminder that even at the current high-level of cooperation between Moscow and Washington, the American side sometimes displays signs of the past policy of double standards. The realities of today, when the CIS has emerged in the territory of the former Soviet Union and when the Baltic independent states have come into existence, have quite a few specific features. One of the most important is to preserve centuries-old contacts between Russia and its immediate neighbors. It is therefore natural that Moscow regards them as a region of primary vital interest. Incidentally, the Americans also have such a notion. For example, they include into the zone of their national interest the countries of Central America and the Caribbean basin. On these grounds, as is known, the United States resorted to military intervention, for example, in Panama, Grenada, and a number of other countries. The United States has imposed a trade blockade and used other sanctions against some of the countries of that region. As for Russia, it builds its relations with the CIS countries and Baltic states on the basis of respect of international law. And if Russia maintains its military presence in, say, Tajikistan, Georgia, or some other Commonwealth country, it does it fully in accordance with bilateral agreement. As far as the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia is concerned, negotiations on the issue are under way. At the same time, Russia is pressing for respect of human rights, the rights of the millions of Russian speakers living in the CIS countries. And Moscow says it is ready to act firmly if the rights of Russian speakers are abused. Understanding of Russia's vital interests in the countries, former Soviet republics, is essential for maintaining its partnership with the United States, as well as other countries.
