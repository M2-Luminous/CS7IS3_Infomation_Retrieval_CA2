Based on the BOFT predictions, the island's exports would increase 6.9 percent from 1993 to US$91.3 billion this year, while its imports would rise 8.23 percent to reach US$84.2 billion, due to increased market liberalization here. The same forecast indicated that exports to mainland via Hong Kong would maintain a robust annual growth of 21 percent to reach US$22.95 billion this year. The major reason cited is the strong market demand in the mainland triggered by increased Taiwan investment there. Imports from Hong Kong, however, would post a marginal expansion of 1.5 percent to reach US$1.75 billion, as manufacturing industries in the British colony are gradually hollowing out. The resultant trade surplus in favor of Taiwan would hit a record high of US$21.2 billion, the BOFR predicted. Meanwhile, exports to the United States are expected to witness only a negligible expansion rate of 0.77 percent in 1994 to reach US$23.6 billion. However, the United States would remain the largest export outlet for Taiwan-made products. Imports from the United States are predicted to enjoy a much higher growth of 10.67 percent to reach US$19.5 billion this year. As a result, the island's trade surplus with the United States would drop to a 10-year low of US$4 billion, compared with a high of US$16 billion to US$17 billion seen some six years ago. By contrast, Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan is projected to reach a new high of US$15.8 billion in the new year. Imports from Japan would increase 6.9 percent to US$25 billion, and exports to that country would grow only 2.2 percent to US$9.1 billion.
