In a public declaration, the Mapuche Meli Wixan Mapu Coordinating Board states that the campesino revolt in southern Mexico is due to "centuries of political, economic, and cultural oppression," and it indicates that "this uprising is the answer to a slow process of ethnical-cultural death." The declaration adds that Mexico's becoming a member of NAFTA "has condemned the Mayan peoples to death" because their production techniques "do not allow them to be competitive" with U.S. and Canadian markets, and this is causing "the extinction of those peoples." The Mapuche group then makes a call to the International Red Cross, the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, and the UN's human rights organization to visit the Chiapas combat zone "in order to guarantee the integrity" of the indigenous peoples involved. Coordinating board leaders Dagoberto Cachana and Alihuen Antileo announced that on 6 January the document will be handed to the Mexican Embassy in Santiago.
