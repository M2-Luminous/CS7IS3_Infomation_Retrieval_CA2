The August celebrations are also designed by reformist officials to boost their position in internal fighting in the post-Deng era, following fears for the health of the reclusive leader. The moves to promote the patriarch's status in party and Chinese history are additionally aimed at offsetting the increasing influences of the late Chairman Mao. A high-profile team led by Politburo member and propaganda chief Ding Guanggen, who is also Mr Deng's bridge partner, was recently set up to co-ordinate a series of birthday activities, according to Chinese sources. For the first time, official ceremonies on Mr Deng's birthday will be held during the day. And autographed albums and other souvenirs of the senior leader will be issued in the coming months. Meanwhile, the largest documentary ever made on Mr Deng is being shot by Central Newsreels and Documentary Film Studios under the supervision of Mr Ding and the propaganda department of the party's central committee. Mr Ding, in an internal speech, said the party central committee will provide enough cash to fund the shooting of documentaries for Mr Deng and Peng Zhen, another senior retired leader, despite attempts by many party elders to get cash for their own documentaries. Beijing sources said the liberal wing within the leadership has been preparing for the Campaign to offset the late Chairman Mao's influence in China's politics. Some reformist officials thought Mr Deng's paramount authority was abating following last year's Mao frenzy, organised by leftists to mark the centenary of the birthday of the great helmsman. Reformists wanted to capitalise on Mr Deng's 90th birthday in August in the same way. "They thought Deng Xiaoping's 90th birthday is the last good and important occasion for them to campaign for liberal ideas in China," one source said.
