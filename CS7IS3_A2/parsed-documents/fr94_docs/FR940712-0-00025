The fishery will continue until all individual vessel quotas have been filled, or November 15, whichever is earlier. August Fishing Periods in Areas 4A, 4B, and 4D The IPHC has determined that fishing period limits will not be needed during the August 15 opening in Areas 4A, 4B, and 4D. The duration of the fishing period in each area is as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1Area 4A 1Area 4B 1Area 4D Fishing period 8/15 8/15&hyph;8/19 8/15&hyph;8/16. Duration 12 hours 96 hours 30 hours. Opening (ADT*) 8:00 a.m. 12 Noon 9:00 a.m. Closing (ADT*) 8:00 p.m. 12 Noon 3:00 p.m. *Alaska Daylight Time The fishing periods are designed to provide maximum fishing time without exceeding the catch limit in each area. In the event that the catch limit in one or more of the three areas is not attained, and sufficient poundage remains to permit further fishing, the next scheduled fishing period is August 30.
