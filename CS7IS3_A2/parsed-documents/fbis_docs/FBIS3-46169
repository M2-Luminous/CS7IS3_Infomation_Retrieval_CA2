The day after Aspen resigned, Clinton nominated Bobby Inman. When Clinton nominated him, some U.S. Congressmen and the public opinion stated that Inman was fully qualified for the Pentagon post. However, in a letter to Clinton, Inman asked Clinton to withdraw the nomination because he did not want he and his family to be subjected to personal attacks. According to [word indistinct], Inman voluntarily gave up the nomination because he is involved in a company that resells military equipment illegally. When announcing Perry's nomination, Clinton said Perry taught at school, [words indistinct], and had a lot of experience in the military. He also said Perry had leadership and was honest and well versed in current affairs. Perry, 66, was born in Pennsylvania. He studied at Stanford University and received a bachelor's and a master's degree in mathematics from this university. He later received a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania. For the one year he worked as U.S. deputy secretary of defense, he silently oversaw the Pentagon's daily affairs and demonstrated his talent in management and technological affairs. It is said that Perry very rarely appears at public meetings and strongly insists that the U.S. capabilities to build military materiel be maintained. He also insists on arming the military with high-technology weapons. He became famous when he supported the (?deployment) of Stealth bombers, cruise missiles, and precision guided (?missiles), which played an important role in the Gulf war. When Clinton announced the nomination, Perry said he accepted the President's nomination at a time of great changes and challenges. The decades-long Cold War ended because of the Soviet Union's disintegration. This has not brought security and peace to the world but opened a post-Cold War phase that is more complicated and very difficult to handle. Aspen reluctantly (?resigned) because he could not do anything about a civil war in Somalia and the conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. When Perry was nominated, the Pentagon and military experts assessed him favorably, saying that his nomination would easily lead to an actual appointment. Perry must win the confirmation by the U.S. Senate before being formally appointed as secretary of defense. The post of secretary of defense is an important job that many people compete to grab in the United States. Therefore, one must wait and see whether Perry will be able to smoothly pass the confirmation process.
