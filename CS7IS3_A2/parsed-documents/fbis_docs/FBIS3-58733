During the meeting, the fate of Helmut Szimkus, the German who is under sentence of death in Iran, was probably discussed. There have been growing indications over the last few days that as a result of pressure from the German Government, Szimkus, who was sentenced for spying for Iraq, can hope for a pardon. Larijani, who belongs to Iran's Supreme Defense Council and plays a leading role in parliament in Tehran, ended a five-day visit to Germany on Friday. He headed a small delegation of Iranian parliamentarians that held talks concerning the development of German-Iranian relations with the government, the Bundestag, and companies. The meeting with Kinkel was not originally on their schedule.
