Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRUA] says: "I believe that the first session will be fairly quiet." He goes on to say: "Various commissions will be set up. One must remember, however, that the new Constitution does not give the control function to parliament. Therefore, commissions will be involved in preparing parliamentary hearings on various issues. This is the parliament's right, and I am sure that there will be many commissions on parliamentary hearings. I believe that the emergence of coalitions in the Duma will depend on the nature of questions at issue. There will be no organized coalitions in the Duma, with a unanimous vote. Is that good or bad? "Speaking about all of this, I would always urge one to compare the present body of deputies, albeit very imperfect, with the body of deputies of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet of the previous convocation. According to Vitaliy Vorotnikov, formerly chairman of the Russian Federation Council of Ministers, democrats had 22 percent of seats in that parliament. Now they have more seats, though less than 50 percent. Therefore, we are moving forward despite everything." Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist faction, is then asked for his view of the work of the new State Duma. He says: "The coordination is proceeding with difficulty. Burbulis stated recently -- it is no secret -- that they are not too keen on developing contacts with others, including us, but I believe that they are doomed to seek agreement, unless they plan to give new orders to disband the Duma by force. Not only has their position no future, I believe, but in the context of the recent changes in public opinion and in attitudes to their course, it is also dangerous for everyone. One should understand very well that we all have very little time for all this coordination because there are already mass stoppages of production. At many factories, people will only work 10-12 days at most in January, and will receive a small allowance. By spring, they will have eaten up their supplies, they will have worn out the shoes bought back in the times of developed socialism, and they may then behave in a way totally different from what some of our radicals think." In conclusion, an independent deputy is then asked for his views. He says that the independents will push the interests of their districts. There are many young people in the Duma who are keen on working but not on squabbles. Viktor Sheynis of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc says that the Duma will have two main levers affecting the state policy: legislation and the budget.
