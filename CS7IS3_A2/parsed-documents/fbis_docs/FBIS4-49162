The SEF delegation will be headed by SEF Deputy Secretary General Hsu Hui-you; and its members will consist of SEF officials, crime experts, and representatives of families of the victims, totally about 20 people. The SEF indicated that the date of departure for Hangzhou was determined on the basis of the views of relevant experts and families of the victims and after assessing the situation. It hoped that ARATS would provide the delegation with the relevant information and make arrangements for personnel who handled the case and those who performed the autopsies on the victims to explain the incident to the delegation. The SEF added that the delegation will also visit Chunan County to (?inspect) the boat, the Haijui [Hairui], and will interview relevant personnel to have a thorough understanding of the case. Meanwhile, according to Hong Kong's pro-Chinese communist paper, WEN WEI PO, Chinese communist Vice Premier Chu Jung-chi [Zhu Rongji], who is now visiting Chekiang [Zhejiang] on an inspection tour, has visited Chientao Lake to study the case as well as the measures the local authorities have taken to deal with problems arising from the case. The paper said that Chu has also instructed the local authorities to do a good job in receiving the SEF personnel and the victims' families. The report also indicated that Chu Jung-chi's inquiry about the case shows that the CPC Central Committee attaches great importance to the SEF personnel's arrival in Hangzhou, and that it also shows that the CPC Central Committee is unwilling to see the boat incident undermine the developing cross-strait relations. News reports from Peking [Beijing] also indicated that high-ranking Chinese communist authorities hoped that a lesson could be learned from the Chientao Lake incident, and that they have decided to set up a group to handle Taiwan-related contingencies. It is reported that the group members will include principal ARATS officials, and that the Chinese communist authorities hoped this new organ will be able to handle Taiwan-related contingencies efficiently and openly. Commenting on the Hong Kong report that the CPC Central Committee has decided to set up a group to handle cross-strait contingencies, SEF Deputy Secretary General Shih Chi-ping indicated yesterday that the report, if confirmed, shows that Chinese communist authorities concerned have made a thorough self-examination after the boat incident. Shih added that, in principle, the SEF agreed that a group should be set up to handle Taiwan-related contingencies as reported by the Hong Kong paper.
