Some Thoughts After the Elections"] [Text] The 1994 elections have provided a genuine criterion of specifically what the concept "political party" means for the population. It was revealed that--due to the throngs of independent candidates--voters were inclined to prefer persons who represent those political forces with whom they can identify as to convictions and personal likes. Given the lack of well-known names on the ballots of most Ukrainian election districts, for many voters a candidate's political affiliation became almost the only criterion of his convictions. Moreover--as attested to by data from pre-election sociological polls conducted by the "Democratic Initiative" Center--candidates' party affiliation was a plus for 71 percent of the voters. The information which motivated a voter identified his convictions with certain stereotypes of public opinion: the communists--with a revival of the super-state and a "Brezhnev-type" economic stability, or with "Russification," repressions, and hunger; the nationalists--with strength and order, or with hostility and rancor; the professionals and centrists--with economic reforms, or with marking time. Also of great importance for the course and end results of the elections were regional specifics--the decline of prosperity in Ukraine's traditionally industrial regions added to the votes cast for members of the communist and socialist parties. The socialists influenced voters by their special interests in solving the problems of rural inhabitants and those of Western Ukraine--a region which has traditionally favored right-wingers. Quite a few voters in Galicia and in Central Ukraine gave preference to those representatives of the national-democratic forces who advocated a path of gradual political and economic reforms. As a result, out of the 340 deputies to the new parliament, a preponderant majority (242 deputies) represent political parties. The practical activity of this past parliament indicates that--one way or another--non-party deputies still gravitate toward this or that political force. From this point of view it seems feasible to present the non-party Ukrainian people's deputies within the general context of political forces in our country's newly elected highest legislative organ. Representatives of Right-Wing, Non-Democratic Forces As expected, the right-wing political forces were unable to achieve any great success in the elections. Despite all the advertsing ballyhoo, none of the leaders or members of the extreme right-wing Docial-National Party of Ukraine could "make it" even to the second round. And of the persons supported by the associations known as the "State Independence of Ukraine," only Anatoliy Makhlay "made it" to the second round in the Vinnitsa region, but he lost therein. The Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party came though the elections with slightly better results. The leader of this party--Stepan Khmara-was elected in the very first round, and a member of this party--Roman Kuper--prevailed in the second round. A certain degree of success was also achieved by the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly]. The following three candidates of the UNA were victorious in the election "lottery": Yuriy Tym, who "captured" the votes of Chortkov's voters right in the first round, Oleh Vitovych, who "got by" the chairman of the Lvov Oblast Council--Mykola Horyn--and Yaroslav Illyasevych, who beat the well-known economist--Zoryslav Romovskyy. The practical work of the parliament will show whether Ukrainian politics will be influenced by this 0.9 percent of the deputies' seats which have swung to the right. National Democrats The best results among the right-wing parties were achieved by the KUN [Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists]. Although the leader of the KUN--Slava Stetsko--was unable (for reasons beyond her control) to take part in the struggle for a deputy's seat, three members of the KUN--Roman Krutsyk, Ivan Bilas, and Mykhaylo Ratushnyy--were elected to the office of Ukrainian people's deputy in the very first round, and in the second round three more members of this party were victorious--Hryhoriy Demyan, Taras Protseyat, and Lev Glukhivskyy. One deputy--Petro Shvydkyy--will represent the political position of the Nationwide Movement of Ukraine in the parliament; its leader-Larysa Skoryk--was not elected to the parliament. These elections turned out to be a stunning defeat for the KNDS [Congress of National Democratic Forces]--a fact which many analysts have connected with the erroneous tactic of the KNDS in supporting structures which have lost the trust of Ukrainian voters. Elections were lost by the leaders of the association--Mykhaylo and Bohdan Horyn, Mikhaylo Batih, Roman Ivanychuk, Pavlo Kyslyy, Dmytro Pavlychko, Oles Shevchenko, and Oleksandr Hudym. It is already clear that this political force has no future prospects, and even its members acting separately will not be able to create a strong faction in the parliament. Although two members of the Democratic Party--Volodymyr Mulyava and Stepan Volkovetskyy--were able to become people's deputies as a result of the very first round of elections, this party's chairman--Volodymyr Yavorivskyy--was unable to win right away. And, therefore, the parliamentary faction of the Democratic Party, which consists of five members of parliament, will not be able to play an independent role. The situation in the Ukrainian Republican Party is similar. The absence of this party's leaders in the parliament will certainly not be compensated for by its deputation of nine members, among whom the best-known are Mykola Horbal and Yevhen Pronyuk. The success of the NRU [People's Movement of Ukraine (Rukh)] in the first round of elections can be termed an event worthy of amazement. The election during the first round of this party's leader--Vyacheslav Chornovil--plus its leading activists--Serhiy Holovatyy and Les Tanyuk--as well as Volodymyr Lanovoy, whom Rukh supports, together with a continuation of the election struggle by 43 NRU members and 45 independent candidates also supported by Rukh, attests to the fact that the NRU faction in parliament will become the nucleus of the national-democratic opposition; the latter will be joined by the remaining deputies with the same orientation. The elections have dispelled yet another myth concerning the NRU--namely that this organization is predominantly one of a Western Ukrainian nature. During the second round Rukh representatives came to the fore in almost all the election districts in Kiev and Kiev Oblast, as well as in many districts of Vinnitsa, Dnepropetrovsk, Kirovograd, Sumy, Kherson, and Zaporozhye oblasts. As a result of this second round of the elections, the NRU faction--with 32 members of parliament-has clearly emerged as the largest parliamentary faction of national democrats. Despite the defeat of its leader--Vitaliy Zhuravskiy--the Ukrainian Christian Democratic Party still has two deputies' seats and sent non-party candidates to fill another three deputies' seats; they were supported by the "Ukraine" Democratic Association, which is under the leadership of Levko Lukyanenko. Six representatives were elected to parliament from the non-party organization--the Union of Ukrainian Officers. Right-Wing Centrists Even more modest were the results achieved by the once-powerful Party for the Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine. One of its ideologists--Ihor Koliushko--won the election marathon right away thanks to support from the "New Wave," which is influential in Galicia. And another two members of this party--Taras Stetskiv, who also came from the "New Wave," and Serhiy Sobolev--won a competitive struggle in a different precinct. To be sure, Sobolev would probably have been assured of support in any case not only from the PDVU [Party for the Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine], but also from the MBR [Inter-Regional Bloc for Reforms]; however, the leader of this party--Volodymyr Filenko--was not helped to win by such "double support," and he has dropped out of the parliamentary game. The Social Democratic Party of Ukraine remains on the brink of defeat, from which it will be difficult to escape. Independent Candidates Among the 108 non-party candidates who were elected to parliament, 17 have taken political stances somwehere between the left-centrist parties and the centrist, pre-election blocs. To be sure, it is quite difficult to find glaring contradictions between the former vice-premier Lanovyy and the president of the Ukrainian Financial Group, Babych. It may well be anticipated that the people's deputies who belong to this group will--in the various parliamentary discussions--be on the side of or in favor of the Rukh-type national-democrats (Holovatyy, Pynzenyk). Moreover, we cannot absolutely rule out the formation of a separate parliamentary faction or a centrist-type Inter-Regional Bloc for Reforms. Centrists The 1994 elections were not good elections for centrist political parties. The chances of the MBR to secure victory for certain of its members obviously did not correspond to its clamorous advertising activity. The leader of the MBR--Leonid Kuchma--and his "comrade in the party"--Oleksiy Dmytrenko--won during the first round; but during the second round the MBR added only 10 deputies. Moreover, the Bloc's other leader--Volodymyr Hrinev--was able to win only with great difficulty. It is possible that the MBR, together with 2 deputies from the Civic Congress of Ukraine and another 1 from the Liberal Party of Ukraine, 2 independent Crimean deputies, and 25 businessmen, whose pre-election programs were not essentially different from those proclaimed by the MBR, will be able to form some kind of centrist nucleus within the parliament. Left-Wing Centrists These political forces are characterized by a greater orientation toward supporting the state sector of the economy than is the case even with the MBR. This is true inasmuch as there are a great many representatives of the power structures among the members of the left-centrist parliamentary trend. Among these 66 deputies (19.6 percent) one can single out certain subgroups: 24 directors of large-scale industrial enterprises, 9 representatives of local councils, 19 representatives of the government and state administrations at various levels, 4 editors of newspapers, and 4 representatives of law-enforcement organs. With regard to the remaining representatives of this parliamentary group, we could relegate another 26 (7.7 percent) members of parliament--members of the Peasant Party of Ukraine who advocated the path of prudent, sensible, evolutionary changes in the former composition of the Supreme Council--to this parliamentary faction. Although many representatives of the Peasant Party of Ukraine's power structures (for the most part, chairmen of collective farms or their deputies) were supported during the elections by the Communist or Socialist parties, right now it is hard to say whether this circumstance is still of decisive importance during the parliamentary voting and whether it was useful for stimulating the electorate. Left-Wingers It would also seem obvious that it is hard to discern the difference between the left-centrists and the left-wing political forces. The grounds for such a differentiation may be seen, however, in the fact that only one representative of the Peasants' Party of Ukraine--Oleksandr Cherenkov--was entered on the lists of deputies as a member of the CPU [Communist Party of Ukraine]. On the other hand, it is difficult to see any essential difference in the political orientations of the official-left-centrists and the five representatives of the Labor Party, among whom are also several members of the Ukrainian government. Be that as it may, the left-wing forces have acquired significant representation in the parliament. Such a conclusion could have been drawn even after the first round of the elections, in which victories were gained by one of the leaders of the Socialist Party of Ukraine--Volodymyr Marchenko--and the first secretary of the CPU Central Committee--Petro Symonenko. On the whole, left-wing forces are represented by 114 (33.8 percent) of the deputies' seats. It is difficult to unequivocally assess the results of the elections for the left-wingers. Of the 29 members of the Socialist Party of Ukraine and those persons supported by that party, only 17 managed to win deputies' seats. Of the 153 contenders for deputies' seats from the Communist Party who made it to the second round, 85 were elected to the office of deputy, while another 5 members of the Communist Party of Crimea also won deputies' seats. However, such a number of contenders from the left-wing forces cannot be regarded as sufficient for a parliamentary majority. Furthermore, the elections demonstrated that the left-wing forces are quite heterogeneous. For example, the political programs set forth by members of the Communist Party of Crimea are characterized--more so than the others--by the motif of "Slavic unity," whereas the predominant majority of the Communist Party of Ukraine's deputies consists of representatives from Lugansk and Donetsk oblasts, from the Crimea, and--to a certain extent--from Zaporozhye Oblast. Such a "regional" approach by the communists may be largely attributed to a nostalgia among the voters in these regions for the times when average wages there were 20-25 percent higher than for Ukraine as a whole. * * * Although the newly elected parliament has not yet begun its work, some preliminary forecasts regarding its activity can be made already. The composition of this new parliament provides scant grounds for anticipating its ability to work effectively. Analysis of the election results from the 110 election districts bordering on those where people's deputies were elected indicates that the subsequent election of deputies will hardly make any substantive changes in the composition of the Ukrainian Supreme Council. There is no complete parliamentary majority, and the parliament will inevitably split on most of the matters to be brought up for a vote. The supporters of a certain economic course will most assuredly have to be satisfied with creating not exactly a faction, but rather certain tactical blocs for the purpose of solving particular problems. The election results attest to the fact that quite a large group of Ukrainian political figures have henceforth lost a parliamentary rostrum. Furthermore, the Supreme Council has lost such political antagonist as Filenko Fokin, Skoryk, Barabash, Altunyan and Meshcheryakov, the Horyn brothers and Kotsyuba, Charodeyev and Shevchenko, Pravdenko and Matviyenko, as well as many others. The extra-parliamentary factor of the presure which will flow from these politicians in Ukraines's public life will also have its own influence. "Compiled" specially for NORODNA ARMIYA
