Jacques Bihozagara, RPF representative in Brussels, is "not coming to Paris," his staff in the Belgian capital told AFP, reached by telephone. French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin had earlier said on French radio that Bihozagara was expected in Paris on Tuesday for talks with the Minister Delegate for Humanitarian Action Lucette Michaux-Chevry. France has launched major diplomatic efforts to try to persuade the mainly Tutsi rebel front that its plan to send up to 2,000 soldiers to Rwanda and lead a mission to protect civilians there is purely "humanitarian." But the RPF accuses Paris of arming its opponents in the mainly Hutu government army, who in turn trained Hutu extremist militias accused of the massacre of up to half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. Asked about reports of the RPF official's visit, French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Richard Duque said the French government was "available" to see him. Bihozagara was named deputy prime minister in a power-sharing arrangement cut between the rebels and Rwandan authorities last August after three years of civil war. But the government never took shape and the central African nation plunged back into bloodletting in April.
