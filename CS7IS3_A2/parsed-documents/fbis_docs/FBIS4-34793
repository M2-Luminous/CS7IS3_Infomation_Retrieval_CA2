Ideas have a face, said Sergio Ramirez at an assembly. And ideas are symbols that motivate action. Rebellion against the ideas championed by Sergio Ramirez has taken shape in the political defeat of the proposals to reform the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN). The fact that Sergio was not elected to the National Directorate is, symbolically, something akin to the expulsion of the archangel Lucifer. That is because Sergio Ramirez's great virtue, or the danger he poses, is his contribution as the visible head of the current of the "Sandinism that would return to the majorities." But the mere fact that he shook the foundations of the FSLN, regardless of his defeat, as Monica Baltodano correctly stated in a radio interview, is a precedent that can only be fully appreciated as the FSLN's future unfolds. The first sign of its implications will come with the results obtained by the FSLN in the 1996 elections. Others, more adept than he at allying themselves with those who really hold the reins of power, at the last minute jumped on board the orthodox, radical boat. They ended up with a high number of votes and kept their share of power. They clung to power without regard for the political consequences suffered by the FSLN. A party that paralyzes itself and loses the momentum of renewal places itself on the sidelines of the power game. The consequences are not something that can be foreseen with a crystal ball, but by analyzing the course of events, it is possible to predict the future clearly. And in this case, I think the prognosis is delicate and guarded. Sergio Ramirez is one of the most astute thinkers in the FSLN, and in this defeat, Sergio Ramirez revealed his true human greatness as never before. Not even when he bravely led the Group of 12, or during his tireless efforts as vice president of the Republic, did he show us the magnitude of his capacity as a politician and intellectual. Now, more than ever, he demonstrated his ability to bravely take on an inescapable proposition from which there was no shirking, and he stood firm even though it meant his ouster. His contribution, for example, to the idea that authority cannot continue to be vested in a group anointed for historical reasons, when that model has been outmoded by our present reality, and that the fulcrum of power should rest on rank-and-file Sandinists chosen in open elections, had to come at a high cost. And he paid that cost in the purge. But like everything in life, the seed has been planted, the work has begun, and it inevitably will bear fruit.
