Although, on Wednesday [4 May] none of the newly elected floor leaders wanted to make any explicit statement about the advice which they will offer the Queen, it appears that an initial investigation is inevitable. With the four parties that have, since Thursday, become "almost the same size," just as many combinations of three are conceivable. A future coalition will consist of at least three parties, now that a duo cannot count on a majority in the Second Chamber. During the election campaign, PvdA leader Wim Kok and his VVD counterpart, Frits Bolkestein, both ruled out a combination of the PvdA, the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], and the VVD, meaning that there would be just three possibilities in the upcoming formation talks. In all these coalitions, the participation of Thursday's biggest winner, Hans van Mierlo's D66, is essential. As one of the four large parties, van Mierlo made it quite clear well before the elections which coalition he felt deserved preference. "That would be purple, purple, purple, and once again purple," as a prominent D66 member of parliament emphasized on Wednesday. This arrangement, in fact, leaves little choice for the other major players in the formation. This applies in the first instance to Kok, who, as the leader of the largest party, should with reason have the initiative in forming the government. Due to van Mierlo's preference, he is more or less compelled to first set about trying to form a coalition of the PvdA, the D66, and the VVD, even though the PvdA leader has made it known that he certainly expects something more from a coalition between the PvdA, the D66, and the CDA. Also on Wednesday, Kok continued to keep his options open, repeating what he always said during the election campaign. The PvdA wants to work together with the D66 for "strong, progressive support," and to form a government with a third party. Whether this third party will be the CDA or the VVD depends on the policy that can be followed with these parties. One tough issue in particular for the PvdA leader is the future of the social security system. "We feel that policy is more important than `color,'" Kok said. Nevertheless, he will probably have to tell the Queen on Friday that she will not be able to back away from van Mierlo's wish either. Two politicians from the PvdA and the D66, will have to investigate next week whether serious coalition talks are possible between the PvdA, the D66, and the VVD. It is inevitable that these politicians will also make a courtesy call to Brinkman. However, the CDA will get a real chance in the government formation if it turns out that a "purple" coalition looks impossible.
