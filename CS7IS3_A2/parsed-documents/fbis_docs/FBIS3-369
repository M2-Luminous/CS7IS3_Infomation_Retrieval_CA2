This was revealed by Army General Abilio Kamalata Numa, chief of the general staff of the northern front, in an interview with the Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel and TERRA ANGOLANA newspaper. According to Genertal Numa, Luanda is carrying out a full military offensive, totally disrespecting the Lusaka peace talks. It wants to capture positions under the control of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in the provinces of Zaire, Uige, Bengo, and Cuanza Norte. General Numa said the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] relies on the assistance of mercenaries from different nationalities, including Portuguese marines stationed in Cabinda Province. He said MPLA-PT warships cruise along the Cabinda-Luanda corridor weekly, carrying lethal materiel. However, Commander Kamalata Numa reaffirmed UNITA's desire to continue to find peace through dialogue, but stressed that the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola will henceforth not tolerate any kind of provocation. He said UNITA was carrying out all kinds of defensive measures to defend the strategic city of Soyo. In conclusion, General Numa stressed that UNITA will not be held responsible for damage to oil installations in the event of an attack on Soyo.
