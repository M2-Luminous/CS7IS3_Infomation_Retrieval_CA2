The declaration specifies the duties of the Palestinian police as the maintenance of security and public order and ensuring peace and safety for all Palestinians within a framework of democracy, political pluralism, and the rule of law. The declaration announces that schools and hospitals have been reopened and that various government institutions have begun to function. The declaration calls on the Palestinian people to cooperate with the police to begin a new era and build a Palestinian state. One hundred and seventy-six Palestinian police cars, sent by the United States to Port Said a few days ago, crossed at the Rafah border point today. Meanwhile Israeli troops are preparing to evacuate all Gaza areas by tomorrow evening. Later today the Palestinians and Israelis will sign an official agreement transferring power to the Palestinian Authority as of Thursday [19 May]. The agreement specifies 38 different powers for the new Palestinian Authority. An official of the Palestinian Authority confirmed that the Israeli Army will complete its withdrawal from Gaza on schedule and not one Israeli will remain inside the Palestinian autonomy areas by Thursday morning. The Israeli Army placed Arabic, Hebrew, and English signs on major roads and areas saying: "Attention. You are entering the Palestinian Authority area. Entry must be coordinated with the Israeli Army." The Palestinian Authority in Gaza has begun to establish a system for data processing and statistical programs. The venture is carried out by a Palestinian-Egyptian company based in Cairo. Engineer 'Ali Nabil Sha'th, the company's representative, said that the company has opened branches in Gaza and Jerusalem and that a number of Palestinian young people have been trained in the use of the data processing equipment, which has been reprogrammed to meet the needs of the Palestinian administration.
