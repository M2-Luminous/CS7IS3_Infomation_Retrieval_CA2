The puppet prime minister openly incited "unification through Northward march" and the puppet defence minister opened to the public a new war scenario against the North codenamed New Operation Plan-5027. Commenting on this, a MINJU CHOSON analyst today says: The ill-boding military moves in South Korea are so grave that they cannot be overlooked. This shows the puppet clique is driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the dangerous brink of war. The Kim Yong-sam clique is a group of the most treacherous political charlatans and warmaniacs who depend most heavily upon outside forces among the successive puppet rulers. As long as there are such fools who stoop to any infamy against fellow countrymen for the sake of the interests of outside forces, the nation cannot avoid misfortune." Such traitors must be removed from the nation in time. If the South Korean puppets continue military provocations and unleash a war in collusion with outside forces, they will have to pay dearly. The Korean people and People's Army will deal a severe retaliatory blow at the aggressors if they dare provoke the socialist motherland. The South Korean puppets must look straight at the reality and refrain from rash acts.
