Those Hmong hilltribesmen have been living at refugee centers in Thailand for almost 20 years and have become urbanized. It is not enough to just arrange for those people to return and settle down in the countryside of Laos. UNHCR Representative to Thailand Ruprecht von Arnim proposed that an industrial zone be established in Laos where those refugees can make goods like garments or shoes. The UNHCR representative to Thailand and senior officials of Laos and Thailand are meeting in Bangkok on 27-28 June to discuss the repatriation of Lao refugees. The Thai delegation is led by Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary general of the National Security Council. The Lao delegation is led by a director general from the Lao Foreign Ministry. The meeting will try to find ways to speed up repatriation of Lao refugees in accordance with the wishes of Thailand. Thailand reiterated its plan to close Ban Na Pho center by the end of this year. There are at present about 12,000 refugees at the center which is in Nakhon Phanom. It is believed only 3,000 will leave for Laos in the next six months.
