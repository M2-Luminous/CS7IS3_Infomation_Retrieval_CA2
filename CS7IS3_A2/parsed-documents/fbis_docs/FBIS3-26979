"Constructive relations between Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are certainly essential to regional stability," State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said. Meanwhile, a senior administration official was quoted as saying that the U.S. ambassador to Athens would submit a diplomatic note to the Greek Foreign Ministry Thursday [17 February] and the Greek ambassador to the U.S. might also be summoned to the State Department. The remarks came after Greek prime minister's announcement earlier that Athens would stop the flow of goods from the Salonika port to the land-locked Macedonia, except humanitarian supplies. Washington recognized Macedonia on February 9, but using the name of "the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" in order not to anger either side. "We would certainly hope that every effort could be made to try to avoid any particular actions which might aggravate the situation or lead to some kind of an increase in tensions," Shelly said. Greece has been trying to block international recognition of Macedonia, saying the name "Macedonia" could be exploited for territorial claims against its province with the same name. About 50,000 Greek citizens protested Tuesday against the U.S. recognition of the Balkan republic. Macedonia, with a population of some two million Slavs and ethnic Albanians, declared its independence in 1991.
