The meeting was held on 24 and 25 June in Asuncion, Paraguay. A joint declaration will be released to the media. I would like to point out two aspects: The meeting was the first effort of countries of least development, like landlocked Paraguay and Bolivia, to coordinate an exchange of views and eventually develop mutually beneficial actions. The three countries expressed their support for the efforts by the Fonplata [River Plate Basin Development Fund] to improve its financial conditions and thus contribute to the development of the three countries. The three foreign ministers confirmed their full support for the continuation of the Fonplata Permanent Secretariat in Sucre, Bolivia. This issue created concern among institutions and the Civic Committee of the Chuquisaca Department which lead to a commitment by the Foreign Ministry and the government to maintain the permanent secretariat headquarters in Sucre. The declaration contains support by Uruguay and Paraguay for the continuation of the permanent secretariat headquarters in Sucre, Bolivia. [end recording] That was Foreign Minister Aranibar's comments on his recent trip to Paraguay to attend the Urupabol meeting.
