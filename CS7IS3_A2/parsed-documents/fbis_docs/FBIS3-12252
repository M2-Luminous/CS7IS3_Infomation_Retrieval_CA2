This was said by Samir Ghawshah who was speaking in Tunis at the end of the first meeting of the PLO Executive Committee in the presence of the Palestinian negotiating teams. These meetings seek to define the stand toward the U.S. initiative for resuming the negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians in Washington. The PLO Executive Committee listened to a report by Palestinian delegation head Sa'ib 'Uraqyqat on the contacts with Washington. In light of this report, the Executive Committee viewed the U.S. initiative as a formal one and devoid of any content. The PLO Executive Committee then wondered about the reason for moving the negotiations to Washington and the representation level of the delegations. It stressed that negotiations are not the Palestinians' destiny and that the Palestinian people are pursuing the intifadah in the occupied territories, as Samir Ghawshah said. Ghawshah also emphasized the PLO Executive committee's rejection of the measures adopted by the Israeli cabinet yesterday because they are insufficient and do not meet even the minimum Palestinian demands.
