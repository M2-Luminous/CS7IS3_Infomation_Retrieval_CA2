Thus spoke Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at a meeting today with representatives of the Russian-speaking population. According to him, when the last soldier leaves, Moscow will be able to step up economic, political, and psychological pressure on the Tallinn authorities and thereby provide all the necessary guarantees for not only military pensioners but the non-native population of Estonia as a whole. The minister told his fellow countrymen about the results of the meeting of the foreign ministers of the member-countries of the Council of the Baltic states which was held there. He said that the "problems of the Russian-speaking population and military pensioners raised by the Russian delegation found wide response among the other participants in the conference." The head of the foreign relations department of the Russian Federation told them about progress in the implementation of the state aid program to compatriots living abroad. He lamented that the 35 Russian departments participating in it "are not always free from the prejudices of the cost-led economy." It seems that the Foreign Ministry which he heads is no exception since the Russian Embassy in Tallinn still has no "secret" telephone link with Moscow. In conclusion Kozyrev replied to numerous questions from those present and assured them that Russia "will not leave its fellow- countrymen abroad to the mercy of fate." Also today, the foreign minister of the Russian Federation left Tallinn for Paris to attend an international conference which opens tomorrow on signing the pact on stability in Europe.
