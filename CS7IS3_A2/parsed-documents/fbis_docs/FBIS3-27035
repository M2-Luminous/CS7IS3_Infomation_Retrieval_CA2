FBIS3-27035 "drchi033_m_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-033 Document Type:Daily Report 17 Feb 1994 Military Beijing Reportedly To Buy 3 Russian Submarines SK1702054594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0531 GMT 17 Feb 94 SK1702054594 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- China, seeking to improve its naval forces, will import three attack submarines from Russia this year and send some 100 sub crew members to the Russian Navy's submarine school in Vladivostok this summer, the TOKYO SHIMBUN reported on Thursday in a Vladivostok-datelined story. The three submarines China will purchase are conventional "kilo" class ships, weighing 3,000 tons, able to cruise at 17 knots and built at the Komsomolsk shipyard in Khabarovsk in 1982, the report said, citing a ranking officer of the Russian Pacific fleet in Vladivostok. Russia will send the vessels to China for foreign exchange, with their cooperation in submarine warfare involving many naval secrets likely to influence the security of East Asian nations, the Japanese-language newspaper said. China is known to have plans to import 10 more conventional submarines and one nuclear submarine from Russia within the year, it said. The Russian Pacific fleet sold seven warships to China last year, including a ballistic rocket observation ship, a destroyer and two conventional submarines. These ships are serviceable in naval operations and China must have commissioned them for its navy, instead of using them for scrap iron, the Pacific fleet officer was quoted as saying. The Russian Navy's submarine school in Vladivostok was set up in the early 1980s to train submarine crews from countries purchasing Russian subs.
