FR940928-0-00049 FR940928-0-00019 Section 323(b)(6) of the Act also specifies that the Secretary shall prescribe test procedures for fluorescent lamps and incandescent reflector lamps taking into consideration the applicable standards of the Illuminating Engineering Society or American National Standards Institute. These test procedures have all been reviewed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in consultation with the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. DOE has determined that these test procedures will meet its needs. Therefore, today's Interim Final Rule incorporates by reference: The test methods found in Illuminating Engineering Society test procedure LM&hyph;9&hyph;88 for testing and measuring the performance of general service fluorescent lamps; Illuminating Engineering Society test procedures LM&hyph;58&hyph;1983, and LM&hyph;16&hyph;1984 and the International Commission on Illumination publication number 13.2&hyph;1974 for measuring the color rendering index of general service fluorescent lamps which is incorporated by reference in the Illuminating Engineering Society publication number LM&hyph;16&hyph;1984; and Illuminating Engineering Society test procedure LM&hyph;20&hyph;1982 for testing and measuring the performance of incandescent reflector lamps. Additionally, today's Interim Final Rule incorporates by reference the test methods found in Illuminating Engineering Society test procedure LM&hyph;66&hyph;1991 for testing and measuring the performance of medium base compact fluorescent lamps and Illuminating Engineering Society test procedure LM&hyph;45&hyph;91 for testing and measuring the performance of general service incandescent lamps. The above test procedures do not provide for a measurement of annual energy consumption and annual operating cost which are needed to comply with the Act. Therefore, the Department's test procedures include a method of calculating the estimated annual energy consumption and the estimated annual operating cost. The Department is publishing elsewhere in this issue a Proposed Rule amending part 430 to define colored fluorescent and incandescent lamps and to define the exemption from energy conservation standards for a rough or vibration service incandescent reflector lamp. II. Discussion By this notice, the Department is adding a new section to establish test procedures for general service fluorescent and incandescent lamps. These test procedures will apply to those products covered by sections 322(a)(14) and 325(i)(1) of the Act. A. Covered Product The definitions of covered products are found in section 322 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act as amended. For lamps, covered products in section 322(a)(14) include only specified fluorescent lamps, i.e., 4-foot medium bi-pin, 2-foot U-shaped, 8-foot slimline and 8-foot high output, and incandescent reflector lamps. The Department believes that covered lamps in section 322(a)(14) of the Act should also include general service fluorescent lamps, medium base compact fluorescent lamps, and general service incandescent lamps as defined in ยง430.2 of this notice, infra . Adding these lamps to the covered products would be consistent with section 324(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, which requires the Federal Trade Commission to label general service fluorescent lamps, medium base compact fluorescent lamps, and general service incandescent lamps. B. Test Procedure The Department is establishing test procedures in appendix R to subpart B of 10 CFR part 430 by reference to American National Standards Institute standards C78.1&hyph;1991, C78.2&hyph;1978, C78.3&hyph;1991, C78.375&hyph;1991, C82.3&hyph;1983, Illuminating Engineering Society standards LM&hyph;9&hyph;1988, LM&hyph;16&hyph;1984, LM&hyph;20&hyph;1982, LM&hyph;45&hyph;1991, LM&hyph;58&hyph;1983, LM&hyph;66&hyph;1991 and International Commission on Illumination publication 13.2&hyph;1974 which is incorporated by reference in the Illuminating Engineering Society publication number LM&hyph;16&hyph;1984. Any subsequent amendment to this standard by the standard-setting organizations, American National Standards Institute, the Illuminating Engineering Society, or the International Commission on Illumination, will not affect the Department of Energy test procedures, which can be amended only by the Department of Energy. This test procedure will provide, inter alia, results suitable for determining whether the covered lamps comply with the standard levels established by the Act. Although the Department's authority to prescribe test procedures under section 323(b)(6) is limited to fluorescent lamps and incandescent reflector lamps, the Department is incorporating by reference test procedures for general service incandescent lamps and medium base compact fluorescent lamps by authority of section 323(b)(2) of the Act. Data from these test procedures can also be used in the labeling program administered by the Federal Trade Commission. The test procedure for general service fluorescent lamps is a method for measuring the lumen output of a seasoned lamp (the lamp is initially burned for 100 hours) in an integrating sphere or alternatively, by intensity distribution measurements (Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;9&hyph;1988). Requirements for test conditions, equipment, instrumentation, procedures, and test report are included. The test procedure for general service incandescent lamps (Illuminating Engineering Society LM&hyph;45&hyph;1991) is a method for determining the luminous output of general service incandescent lamps based upon measurement. Three methods are described in LM&hyph;45&hyph;1991, an integrating sphere, a goniometer, and substitution measurements, but the Department is incorporating only the integrating sphere and goniometer test methods because they are more accurate. Lamps shall be tested at 60 Hz and 120 volts regardless of their voltage rating.
