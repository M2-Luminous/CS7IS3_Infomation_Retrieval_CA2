This leaves eight months for the dollar apologists to realize their bold forecasts made at the beginning of the year: That the U.S. currency could get up to 1.85 to 1.95 against the German mark [DM] in 1994. At the moment there is not much indication of the greenback taking that course. On the contrary: The U.S. central bank is forced by Washington to protect the dollar from suffering any further losses. Initially everything seemed to work out as predicted for the dollar. In Germany, interest rates are dropping, in the United States they have been on their way up again since 4 February. The U.S. economy is booming, while the German and Japanese economies are going downhill. Both these developments should have made international capital flow toward the dollar. But instead, the U.S. currency is approaching another low against the yen (lowest exchange rate so far: 100.35 yen), and it has dropped to DM1.65. The Clinton Administration will have to realize -- and this might come as a key experience to President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen -- that markets do not go by the White House's solemn promises. A declaration for a strong dollar, like the one Bentsen made at the end of last week -- the government is not planning to use the dollar/yen exchange rate for reducing the huge foreign trade deficit with Japan -- is being ignored by the markets. Thus, the Federal Bank in New York, the executive authority of central bank policy, was asked on Friday [29 April] to buy large amounts of dollars for foreign currencies. "This is not part of our Japanese policy," a high-ranking Fed representative commented somewhat heavy-handedly. Washington does not want to make foreign trade easier for the new Japanese Prime Minister Hata. Also, Japan is doing everything it can to avoid this. Before the Hata government was even fully in office, the Ministry for International Trade and Industry rejected U.S. criticism of the Japanese market being sealed off. A survey of foreign trade barriers that was presented by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in March, is "not supported by facts." It contains "ambiguous arguments," and an "objective standard is not perceptible." That is food for the skeptical mood in the markets. The Clinton Administration is finding it hard to appear credible with its exchange rate policy. Of course, the U.S. Administration would welcome a weaker dollar, especially with regard to the export berserks, Germany and Japan, to reduce the foreign trade deficit that soared to $116 billion in 1993. A more expensive yen would be the best way to balance the huge import surplus in trade with Japan, which went up to almost $60 billion in 1993. Since a more expensive yen and a more expensive German mark would fit the foreign trade concept so well, the Clinton Administration has a hard time appearing credible in the markets and inspiring confidence. But Clinton and Bentsen also fear that a weak dollar might frighten off foreign investors. That is why they are trying to smooth out fluctuations of the dollar exchange rate by interventions to avoid disorderly conditions in the markets. U.S. exchange-rate experts do not yet want to believe in a new global speculation directed against the dollar. But: "The Clinton Administration has lost confidence," Scott E. Pardee, former foreign operations chief at the New York Fed and currently working for Japanese broker Yamaichi, said. This has contributed to the greenback losing 10 percent over the yen: At the beginning of the year $1 bought 113 yen. In relation to the German mark, the dollar lost 6.5 percent since the beginning of January. The dollar bulls have eight months left to realize their 1994 forecast. Will Clinton be able to help them, thus making U.S. policy more credible?
