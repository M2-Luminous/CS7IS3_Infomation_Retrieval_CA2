As to its safety, it is in a much better condition than a year ago," Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said in an exclusive interview with UKRINFORM on Monday. Its safety had been improved due to help on the part of many countries of the world, he remarked. "I am aware that international community is concerned about the Chernobyl nuclear plant, because it is not a problem of Ukraine only," Kravchuk said. "If (foreign countries) want to give us a real help, then appropriate funds should be alloted and we should solve the Chernobyl problem jointly," he said. "Whatever might be said about the Chernobyl nuclear plant, we cannot afford to close it down because of energy crisis in Ukraine," he concluded.
