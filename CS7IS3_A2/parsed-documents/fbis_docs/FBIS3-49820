[Briquemont] The military situation is very tense throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. While the diplomatic peace efforts continue, all warring parties want to prove in the combat zones that they are not in a weakened or inferior position. I admire the people of Sarajevo: They are suffering, they are starving, they are ill, but they do not lose their dignity. Those who live here sometimes have the impression that the people who have to bear the war and the political leaders who caused it are worlds apart. [DER SPIEGEL] At its Brussels summit, NATO again threatened air strikes if Sarajevo and the Muslim enclaves continue to be strangled. Do such announcements still terrify anybody? [Briquemont] I am tired of having to listen again and again to the talk about air strikes. The siege of cities like Srebrenica, Gorazde, or Mostar cannot be broken by air strikes. Those who do not know the local conditions had better refrain from such demands. [DER SPIEGEL] Would the UN troops and their humanitarian help also be seriously endangered by NATO's military intervention? [Briquemont] I am always surprised when I am expected to provide humanitarian help and promote the peace process inasmuch as possible, while at the same time politicians consider the threat of military force. One has to know what one wants. If one decides in favor of war, the UN troops will not be able to continue their humanitarian help under the circumstances. It is simply impossible to keep three warring parties in check and, in addition, help the civilian population with 8,000 blue helmets. [DER SPIEGEL] That is to say, you would advise UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali against asking NATO for military help? [Briquemont] How can you hope to achieve a peace agreement if you are threatening air strikes? After all, these strikes are only supposed to be aimed against one side: Everyone wants the Serbs to be given a thrashing. However, the problem is far more complicated. We are dealing with a conflict on three fronts; the idea taken from cowboy films, that is, that there always has to be a good guy and a bad guy, does not fit in with the inextricable Bosnian situation. The West cannot solve the problems with a series of threats. Those who advocate military force would have to accept the logic of war -- with all its consequences. [DER SPIEGEL] So far, the threats have not been very credible. Would the hostile ethnic groups' preparedness for peace increase if NATO were really determined to intervene with massive force, if necessary? [Briquemont] I am not sure whether this way of thinking is understood by Muslims, Croats, and Serbs. Because of their history, most of the people in former Yugoslavia are convinced that they can only solve their problems with force. The idea of solving conflicts by compromise, which is popular in the West, has not yet been generally accepted here. [DER SPIEGEL] Even the Muslims, who have always been regarded as victims so far, do not seem to be prepared to give in. [Briquemont] The Muslims have changed a lot in the past few months; they have become more belligerent. I was taken aback when I heard a representative of Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic say: We will win this war. The Bosnian Army, which was very weak when the fighting broke out, is meanwhile far better organized and equipped. [DER SPIEGEL] That is to say, you are of the opinion that Muslims, Croats, and Serbs are equally to blame for the continuation of the slaughter? [Briquemont] At present, we could quickly come to an agreement with the Serbs. They would only have to abandon some of their conquered territories. Serbian leader Karadzic has been basically prepared for it. At present, the worst fighting is taking place between Croats and Muslims in central Bosnia. I would have to have far more troops in order to be able to help and mediate there. For we would have to be present in every city and village; only in this way could the people's confidence in the UN mission be gained. [DER SPIEGEL] Is this confidence not irretrievably lost? The Western crisis managers failed as early as when the first symptoms of Yugoslavia's disintegration were shown. [Briquemont] The greatest mistake was that the West was not able to agree on a joint strategy and a joint objective right from the beginning. There is a discrepancy between the declarations of intent and the means that are provided for us, the military, for the implementation of the political resolutions on the spot. One did not know exactly what one wanted, too many contradictory opinions were voiced. Successful crisis management is not possible as long as the course is not clear. [DER SPIEGEL] Would it have been better to intervene early with force, instead of helplessly watching the war spreading in the Balkans? [Briquemont] If one had decided in favor of military intervention -- mind you, if -- all participating states would have had to be aware of what that means for them. [DER SPIEGEL] The West always flinched from these consequences. The hands of the dispatched blue helmets are tied. Thus far, about 70 UN soldiers have been killed by snipers. [Briquemont] We are confronted with one of the dirtiest wars where anything goes. Our blue helmets are in an extremely difficult situation. But there is no intervention without risk. If we participate in such a humanitarian operation, we will have to expect casualties. Public opinion in the Western countries reacts very sensitively to every loss. However, those who send us here have to prepare themselves for tragedies. [DER SPIEGEL] How could the safety of your soldiers from 22 countries be improved? Do you need more troops? [Briquemont] Reinforcements of at least 7,500 men would be necessary. Upon my request, the French and the Scandinavian countries, too, immediately sent a battalion. That means: Instead of 7,500, I got 2,000 additional soldiers. And then the European countries pretend to be generous and ask us to establish three additional land corridors in order to supply the population. We would need at least four battalions, 4,000 men, for this task alone. The United Nations is prepared to dispatch sufficient troops after a peace agreement. This is wonderful, but I would rather have these troops now, in order to be able to fulfill my mission more effectively. [DER SPIEGEL] Apparently, reinforcements will not come. Do you think that the time when the blue helmets will completely withdraw from Bosnia is near? [Briquemont] If a peace agreement is not achieved by the end of January, the responsible politicians will have to completely reexamine our commitment in Bosnia. It is an illusion to believe that the UN troops could continue their humanitarian help indefinitely if the shooting goes on at the same time. [DER SPIEGEL] For how long will you be able to hold out? [Briquemont] Personally, I am of the opinion that in any case we will have to stay until the end of the winter. It would be irresponsible to let the civilian population down at this time of the year. However, if the war flares up with new violence in the spring, we will be confronted with the question of whether we can afford to continue as before. [DER SPIEGEL] You have already thrown in the towel as commander in chief of the UN troops in Bosnia, you asked for your replacement. Have you failed with your mission, which was actually supposed to last until the end of July? [Briquemont] Nobody comes here to gain glory and success. He who hopes that is a fool. The only thing that we can achieve is to mitigate the people's misery and curb the war. I have done my best, this is only possible for a limited period. At some point everybody is going to be worn out. [DER SPIEGEL] Do you think that a one-year mission is too long? [Briquemont] UN bureaucracy conceived the duration of the mission; it has nothing to do with the reality of Sarajevo. You cannot imagine what frustrations and humiliations are connected with this job. If one has gone through half a year, it is better to pass on the baton to somebody else who can burden himself with the same hardship with fresh energy.
