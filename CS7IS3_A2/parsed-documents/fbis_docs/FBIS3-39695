The solutions, Ciampi suggested, lie in "consistent" attitudes at the next round of contract renewal talks and by the next government, which must pick up where this executive leaves off. According to Ciampi, unemployment is caused by both external and structural conditions. Tackling both involves focusing on macro-economics, such as future labor accords in which wage increases are linked to production and private industry is encouraged to invest in infrastructures. In the medium- and long-term, Ciampi continued, economic policies must follow the lines adopted by the European Commission in its job-creation plan, especially concerning investments. In Italy in particular, he added, the government must pursue privatizations and the streamlining of public administration, increasing efficiency. At the same time, the job market must be made more "flexible" while maintaining protection for workers.
