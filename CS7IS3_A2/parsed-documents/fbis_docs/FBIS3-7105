"It is time for Thailand to have an embassy there as the peace process is underway. It would be a lot easier to think about it now than in two or three years," the official said. He said Israel had developed technologies in various fields including medicine and agriculture, which Thailand could make use of. Thailand's embassy in Rome presently oversees Israel, while Israel has had an embassy in Bangkok since 1957. The official also said the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) official presence in Thailand would initially be in the form of a representative's office. "The PLO at this time cannot have an embassy as it does not have statehood yet," the official said. A final decision on the matter rests with the minister. In this way Thailand will "show its political support for the Middle East peace process now underway," he said. The establishment of the PLO's representative office was decided on three years ago but was put on hold because of the Gulf War. In addition to an embassy in Israel's Tel Aviv, the Foreign Ministry is also considering setting up consulates in China's Shanghai, Cambodia's Battambang, and Laos' Savannakhet. Thailand last year approved the establishment of a Laotian consulate in the Northeast. While Laos is considering setting it up in Udon Thani, Khon Kaen or Nong Khai, the Thai Foreign Ministry has expressed its preference for Nong Khai.
