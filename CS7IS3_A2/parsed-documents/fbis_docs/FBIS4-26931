Yesterday, eight Ming Pao reporters tied yellow ribbons outside the official Xinhua news agency and handed in a letter demanding his release. Mr Xi's father, Xi Ling-sheng, has visited his son twice. He said he was receiving "compulsory political education" but was painting and doing computer studies in his spare time. He was sharing a cell with three others. The United Democrats of Hong Kong also sent about 20 members to protest at Xinhua. "We will continue to fight for the release of Xi until he is back, and for (his) safety in the mainland," a spokesman said. Over the weekend Mr Xi, who was charged with "stealing state secrets," was given an award for outstanding journalistic performance by the Newspaper Society of Hong Kong--which regretted he was not on hand to receive it.
