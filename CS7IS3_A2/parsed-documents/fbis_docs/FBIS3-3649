The just-adopted government work report has spelled out this year's price control goal, he told a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters. Therefore, to stabilize prices is a common task of enterprises and the entire society, as well as governments and relevant departments at all levels. He attributed price increases to a variety of factors. One factor is that prices were raised to rationalize price relations and establish a rational pricing mechanism in an effort to shift to a market economy. Other factors included an overextended scale of investment in fixed assets and an excessive increase in consumption funds. It should be noted that since China initiated the policy of reforms and opening up, "we have taken a gradual approach in reforming the price system. In implementing every price reform measure, we have taken in full consideration the tolerance of the state, enterprises and the people, thus avoiding major repercussions," he said. "Practice shows that the approach is successful," he said. He listed the following measures to maintain basic price stability: -- Maintaining a basic balance of commodities supply and demand by stabilizing the production of grain, cotton and other farm products; -- Continuing to exercise macro-controls over the prices of important commodities vital to the national economy and people's livelihood; and -- Taking a series of measures to resolutely control excessive increases in fixed assets investment and the overissue of currency.
