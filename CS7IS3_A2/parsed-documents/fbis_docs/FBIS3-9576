The commentary takes issue with leaflets being distributed in Slovakia by "youngsters who identify with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]" and who "demand from the recipients of the leaflets the promise that they will vote for Vladimir Meciar." According to Gottweisova, these leaflets portray "a smiling gentleman with a dollar sign on his pocket making a telephone call to Prague, Budapest, and Tel Aviv and reporting that `the putsch against the Slovak nation and state has come off' and that they can thus come to ransack Slovakia without having to fear resistance." To "dispel doubts about the identity of this gentleman who is carrying out orders from abroad," Gottweisova continues, "he finally introduces himself as `your own Michal Kovac, alias the president.'" In her commentary, Gottweisova deplores the "wrath" of the leaflets' authors as well as their "racist connotation." She describes as "absurd" both the view of President Kovac as an enemy of Slovakia and the idea that "Vladimir Meciar's dismissal had been organized in Prague, Budapest, and Tel Aviv with the intention of destroying Slovakia."
