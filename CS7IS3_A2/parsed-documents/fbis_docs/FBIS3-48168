In a policy debate over the multilateral UR negotiations organized by the opposition Democratic Party [DP], they also called on the National Assembly to oppose ratification of the UR negotiations and the people to stage a nationwide campaign to deter the pressure to import rice. Prof. Kim Wan-pae of Chungang University said, "We should not submit the documents pledging to carry out the opening of agricultural and livestock product markets until late February, the deadline set by the GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]." "We have to appeal to the GATT and ask for more negotiations with the United States," he added. He called on the government to ask the GATT to acknowledge trade between South and North Korea as an internal exchange between the same people. "We need to resume negotiation with the United States because it is attempting to reject the imports of some agricultural and livestock materials to protect its domestic market," he added. He asserted the Assembly special committee on UR negotiations needs to be operated constantly in a bid to come forward with effective measures in this connection. He also called for revolutionary changes in the rural structure to ride the expected tough UR wave. Prof. Kim Su-haeng of the Seoul National University said the government must reflect the interests of the people in all sectors of society in the pursuit of its internationalization. "The government did nothing in connection with the improvement of the welfare of the underprivileged, only putting emphasis on strengthening the national competitiveness in international society," he said. "In a sense, further globalization will result in destitution of agricultural areas and the increase of jobless people due to the rapid change of industrial structure toward autonomization," he added. Cho Sung-u from the national emergency committee to protect the rice market said, "The UR talks have yet to be finalized. It is not true that the opening of the markets for basic agricultural products including rice is inevitable." "We have to embark on a national campaign to block rice imports by collecting signatures and money to this end," he added. Rep. Kim Yong-chin of the DP said, "As an initial step in the UR talks, we have to call on the U.S. to resume negotiation and to clarify our objections to the rice import." Kim called for maintaining the production of rice and other basic agricultural products at a proper level to prepare for the upcoming national unification era, and other short and long term developments.
