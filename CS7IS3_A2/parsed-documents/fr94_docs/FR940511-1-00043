FR940511-1-00043 FR940511-1-00011 The following table shows the total amounts of bulk agricultural product preference cargo moving out of the Great Lakes, and the amounts moving on U.S.-flag vessels out of the Great Lakes, during the years 1986&hyph;1993.

For the period 1986 through 1993, total USDA controlled agricultural export tonnage from the Great Lakes was 1,002,364 metric tons. The total tonnage carried by U.S.-flag vessels was 270,359 metric tons, or 27 percent. However, little preference cargo has moved on U.S.-flag vessels out of the Great Lakes since 1989, with the exception of the MORMACSKY trial in 1993, discussed below. At present, the Great Lakes simply do not have any all-U.S.-flag ocean freight capability for carriage of bulk preference cargo. In contrast, the total non-liner export nationwide of USDA and AID agricultural assistance program cargo subject to cargo preference in the 1992&hyph;3 cargo preference year (the latest program year for which figures are available) amounted to 6,297,015 metric tons, of which 4,923,244 mt. or 78.2 percent was transported on U.S.-flag vessels. (Source: Maritime Administration data base.) The disappearance of government-impelled cargo flowing from the Great Lakes coincides with the expiration of the Great Lakes ``set aside.'' Under the Food Security Act of 1985, Public Law 99&hyph;198, codified at 46 App. U.S.C. 1241f(c)(2), a certain minimum amount of government-impelled cargo was required to be allocated to Great Lakes ports during calendar years 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989. That ``set-aside'' expired in 1989, and was not renewed by the Congress. The 1993 results reflect a unique movement out of the Great Lakes involving a U.S.-flag mother ship and two U.S.-flag feeder vessels. Two U.S.-flag lake bulk carriers, the J. L. MAUTHE and the AMERICAN MARINER, served as feeders bringing wheat from a U.S. Great Lakes port to a Canadian transshipment point where the MORMACSKY, a U.S.-flag ocean going vessel, loaded the cargo destined to Russia. All the vessels were under the control of U.S.-flag carriers. Reportedly, the demonstration was possible as a result of commodity prices in the Midwest which favored the Great Lakes over other U.S. ports. However, the MORMACSKY experiment has not been duplicated. The high cost of U.S.-flag feeder carriage involved in such transshipment would normally allow future transshipment only if foreign-flag vessels brought the cargo to the Canadian transshipment point and resulted in the lowest landed cost.
