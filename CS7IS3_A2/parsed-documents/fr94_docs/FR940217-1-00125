FR940217-1-00125 FR940217-1-00015 Oil tanker means a ship constructed or adapted primarily to carry oil in bulk in its cargo spaces and includes combination carriers and any ``chemical tanker'' as defined in Annex II of MARPOL 73/78 when it is carrying a cargo or part cargo of oil in bulk. The proposed regulations define the following terms: New ship means a ship delivered on or after April 4, 1993. Shipboard oil pollution emergency plan means a plan prepared, submitted, and maintained according to the provisions proposed in §§151.26 through 151.28 of this NPRM for United States ships; or maintained according to the provisions proposed in §151.29(a) of this NPRM for foreign ships operated under the authority of a country that is party to MARPOL 73/78 while in the navigable waters of the United States. Discussion of Proposed Amendments The proposed regulations would apply to U.S. ships because the Act requires the Coast Guard to prescribe regulations implementing shipboard oil pollution emergency plans for ships of U.S. registry or nationality, or operating under the authority of the United States. In addition, the proposal would apply to Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODUs) only when they are not engaged in their primary mode of operation. Any fixed or floating drill rigs, or other offshore installations when engaged in the exploration, exploitation, or associated offshore processing of seabed mineral resources, which have oil pollution emergency plans approved by another Federal or State agency will be considered to be in compliance with Regulation 26. Foreign ships operating in U.S. waters must also comply with Regulation 26. Ships of foreign countries that are party to MARPOL 73/78 must have a plan approved by their flag state. Although only 10 percent of the world's tonnage belongs to states not party to Annex I of MARPOL 73/78, 33 U.S.C. 1902(c) requires that regulations be written to ensure that the ships of non-party states do not receive more favorable treatment than vessels of parties to MARPOL 73/78. In accordance with 33 CFR 151.21, these ships must comply with MARPOL 73/78, and carry evidence of such compliance issued by the government of a country that is party to MARPOL or by a recognized classification society. The Coast Guard may review the shipboard oil pollution emergency plans of these ships. Regulation 26 does not apply to warships; naval auxiliary ships; or other ships owned or operated by a country when engaged in noncommercial service. In addition, the proposed regulation would exempt barges or other ships which are so constructed or operated that no oil can be discharged from any portion thereof, intentionally or unintentionally, including but not limited to, oil discharged as the result of the ships' casualties. This exemption is consistent with similar exemptions from certain MARPOL Annex I based requirements under 33 CFR parts 151 and 155. See 33 CFR §§151.17(d), 151.25(1), 155.350(c), and 155.370(e). In accordance with 33 CFR 151.09, Canadian and U.S. ships operated exclusively on the Great Lakes or their connecting and tributary waters, or exclusively on the internal waters of the U.S. are not required to comply with MARPOL 73/78. This proposed regulations preserves the exclusion of ships operating exclusively in these waters. However, Canada recently acceded in Annexes I and II of MARPOL 73/78 and may apply MARPOL 73/78 requirements to ships in Canadian waters. Consequently, the Coast Guard is reconsidering whether Annexes I and II of MARPOL 73/78, including Regulation 26 provisions, should apply to ships operating in these waters. The Coast Guard solicits comments on the following questions pertaining to ships operating exclusively on the Great Lakes of North America or their connecting and tributary waters: 1. What will be the economic impact of requiring these ships to prepare, submit, and maintain shipboard oil pollution emergency plans? 2. Would an effective date of April 5, 1995, provide an owner of operator of a ship adequate time to prepare and submit a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan? 3. What will be the economic impact of these regulations on ``small entities,'' under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b))?
