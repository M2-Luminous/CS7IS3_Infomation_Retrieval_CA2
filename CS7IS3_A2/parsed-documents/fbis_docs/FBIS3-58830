On Friday [21 January], during the first reading of the ratification act on the "Dublin Agreement," Lintner, the state secretary in the Interior Ministry, said a "fair distribution" of refugees from the civil war zones must be safeguarded throughout the European Union and other European states. "So far, we have met with strong opposition from several West European states." Lintner pointed out that Germany has accepted some 370,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia. This is approximately two-thirds of all the refugees who fled to the European Union from the civil war zones. In the summer of 1990, the European Community members had concluded an agreement on asylum proceedings. Under this agreement, asylum seekers entering the European Union have the right to only one such proceeding. The responsibility lies with the country that has allowed the foreign national to enter, or that was the first one he entered. The agreement shall prevent foreign nationals from applying for asylum in more than one EU member countries, either concurrently or consecutively. Lintner said the agreement is an important step toward harmonizing the community's asylum laws. The Dublin Agreement is to be seen in connection with the abolition of border controls agreed on by the community. He said the reason given for the change of the asylum law that was passed by the Bundestag last year was the European agreements. Lintner said that beside the Dublin Agreement, the government is aiming at a standardization of asylum policies and procedures throughout the European Union. A short debate showed that the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union agrees with the Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party on this matter. The Party of Democratic Socialism and Alliance 90/Greens opposed the idea. Deputy Weiss of Alliance 90/Greens warned against "isolation measures," which would create the preconditions for criminal organizations trafficking in asylum seekers.
