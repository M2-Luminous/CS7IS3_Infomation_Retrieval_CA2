Avakhyan was delivered to Yerevan on the same day and is charged with an attempt of exporting secret information from Armenia. This is, in fact, the first case when ANSD has caught a spy in Armenia. Vahan Avakhyan has left Armenia at the beginning of this year. At the end of February his wife, Zaruhi Yavrumyan, was arrested in the "Zvartnots" Airport of Yerevan, attempting to take away computer diskettes, containing secret information. After capturing the diskettes, ANSD has been tracing every step of Vahan Avakhyan, who left for Bulgaria by that time. Yerevan was aware of his decision to visit Moscow and knew the precise time of his arrival to the Russian capital, where he was caught immediately after leaving the airplane. "SNARK" reports, Former Counselor of the President, former member of the "Karabakh" Committee Ashot Manucharyan will be a witness in the action against Avakhyan. Meanwhile the acting ANSD Chairman David Shakhnazaryan reported, Manucharyan refuses to evidence in this regard. It is not clear yet, for Secret Services of what country V. Avakhyan worked. But evidently, as long as Russian secret services are actively participating in investigations, Lubyanka seems not being indifferent to this country too.
