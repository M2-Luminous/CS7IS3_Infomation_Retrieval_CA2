He said that the world had legalized the public crime committed against us, the Bosniak Muslims, and only because we are preserving our Islamic Bosniak identity and because we are defending our homeland. What we must do now can be found only in ourselves and around us, and we must finally understand that. Let us repeat: No United States, no England, no France is going to help us unless we help ourselves. The brave Gorazde people must know that help is not forthcoming. The world does not give a damn about our suffering and our cries. Everything that we have achieved so far has been achieved with our own strength and the courage of our fighters. That is the only way in which Gorazde can and must be defended. Now Gorazde needs iron discipline and decisiveness. Everything must be subjugated to the defense of the town, without which there is no life. Let us remember: We do not face an ordinary enemy. We are facing a criminal movement that has been launched to destroy us, to annihilate us. The world is watching that. Our country will have to be more decisive and more determined in mobilizing all those who can and must help. We must particularly be decisive toward the part of the younger people who have managed to avoid [words indistinct]. Every working place has to be examined through the effects of the work, and where the effects are not good, we have to place people where they can and must contribute the most. We are in a brutal defensive war in which our defeat means our death. We have to remove decisively all those incompetent from places of authority. That is why any broadcasting of the thoughts and statements by prominent world leaders has also to be subjugated to that aim only, and avoid everything that sows illusions and feeds idle hope. One of these is the recent statement by the foreign minister of Russia, the country that is in essence anti-Bosniak, the country that has been aiding Milosevic's fascist conquering policy. Can these people wish us well? Whether this indifference of the world is the result of the accord reached by the world powers, there is no point in guessing. We have no use for empty talk. There is no point in blaming the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], since we know that the UNPROFOR headquarters are somewhere far away, in Washington, New York, or London. The only correct solution is to mobilize everything we have, all our forces in the struggle for liberation. All those who play games with the fate of their people and their state, and behave [word indistinct] or in a self-centered way, they have to be removed from their posts. Betrayal and the call on betrayal must be punished severely. What do you think England did in World War II? Will we finally come to our senses? As for Gorazde, let us repeat, it will endure for as long as it finds the strength to adjust to the imposed brutal situation. The situation in Gorazde is literally in the hands of the citizens of Gorazde. The republic will continue to work -- and work even harder -- on waking at least a bit the conscientiousness of the world. One however should not have any illusions here. Everything is in our hands and the hands of the Lord.
