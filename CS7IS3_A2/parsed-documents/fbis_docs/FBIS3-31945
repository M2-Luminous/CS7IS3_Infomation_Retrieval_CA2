Polling stations opened at 0700. We visited the National Police and the Treasury Police. We will first listen to Coatepeque Police Chief Patrocinio Benjamin de Leon: [Begin recording] [De Leon, in progress] ...to work out without problems and to allow the security of all citizens and Coatepeque voters. [Espinoza] Have there been any disorders or terrorist attacks in your municipal jurisdiction? [De Leon] Everything is going normally, thank God, and thanks to the security afforded by the National Police and the Army, with whom we have worked closely in addition to the municipal police. [Espinoza] Is there any sort of special recommendation you would like to make to the people? [De Leon] Only that they remain calm and behave the best they can to ensure that these elections benefit our Guatemala. That is what we wish. [Espinoza] We are now in the office of Luis Everardo Soto, Coatepeque Treasury Police chief, who will give us important information on the sale of liquor. From what time were liquor sales suspended? [Soto] Everyone who sells liquor and beer was told sales have been suspended from 1200 [as heard] onward until 0600 on Monday. The idea is to afford greater control during this referendum. Regarding security, this has been coordinated with the National Police. All the necessary security has been rendered since the day the election papers and ballots arrived in the municipality. Today we also have, in addition to the Treasury Police, the National Police. [Espinoza] Have there been any disorders, or is everything normal up to now? [Soto] Everything is normal up to now. I do not know if we are going to have any type of problems later. [Espinoza] What recommendations would you like to make to our listeners? [Soto] That they continue to behave the same way they have done up to now, so as to avoid any problems. [end recording]
