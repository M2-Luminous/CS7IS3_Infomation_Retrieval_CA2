Between check points, 2,562 persons were caught--for visa violations or illegal border crossings. At the same time, illegal merchandise valued at more than 3 million kroons (calculated at state prices) was seized. More than 1,300 persons were sent out, who had been here illegally. Border guards discovered 640 falsified passports. "Last summer at the port of Tallinn, for example, three Kurdish refugees presented such expertly crafted Polish passports that they were being used for the third time `around.' Or let's recall the story of how some Kurdish refugees showed up at the check point at Ikla, equipped with genuine Latvian passports showing Azerbaijani as their nationality," said Tarmo K�outs, executive director of the Border Guards Service. There are 38 check points (12 a year ago) along Estonia's borders, employing 2,446 persons. "Last year, their average monthly salary was 871 kroons. Despite the old Estonian saw: Let the wages match the work, we are still trying to maintain: The work first, and wages later principle, but..." Tarmo K�outs mused, recalling a current truism: "A cheap state official is the most expensive kind." Last year, however, the government did approve the concept of border guard, the decree for the Border Guard Service and, since February 1 of this year, the new structure of border guard has taken effect. But the biggest problems, supposedly, are still stemming from gaps in legislation. Thus, Estonia does not have a border law ("We hope it will be passed this spring," Tarmo K�outs said optimistically), and a border guard law. The legislative vacuum can lead to absurdities, where people involved in the illegal transport of Kurdish refugees cannot be punished. Thus, on October 25, 1994, a party of Kurdish refugees was taken aboard the Vessel Vironia from Pirita to the port of Lindigo in Sweden. A criminal suit was filed against the sailors, but the Tallinn City Court cleared them of charges, because Estonia did not have legally fixed state borders... During the night before October 27, 1992, 129 Kurdish refugees were taken to the Bornholm island of Denmark aboard vessels Lyly and Meotida. Two weeks later a criminal suit was filed, and dropped on June 27 last year, again for lack of a "legally fixed state border"... On February 2, 1993, the Vessel Revalia took 108 Kurdish refugees to Helsinki's Suomenlinna. The criminal suit was dropped on June 30... The border guards are very optimistic aboutbout the the court case coming up for March 7. In it, two men are accused of trying to take 24 Kurdish refugees from Tallinn to Finland on a vessel called Orbiit. Tarmo K�outs believes that: "Border guards will already start to benefit from the law on surveillance activity passed this week, which will enable us to gather information about events happenings in the border region, instead of relying on police all the time." About the incident of 66 Kurdish refugees discovered in a refrigeration van on board the passenger ferry Estonia last Saturday night, we now know that, according to preliminary data, 16 of these people had left the camp at Harku secretly. The rest of them presumably came to Estonia at the beginning or middle of last week, and had been hiding somewhere near Tallinn. How they crossed the border (both entering and leaving Estonia), will be explained by the heads of different government agencies. At any rate, yesterday morning there was a meeting dealing with this at the Ministry of the Interior that will be continued next Monday.
