The allegation about the influence of hot money [dinero caliente] in the political campaigns was made by Juan Jose Chaux Mosquera, currently a member of the House of Representatives. The Liberal politician spoke with Fernando Garcia, this paper's correspondent in Popayan, and told him that in Cauca dirty money is already circulating in politics. He lamented that several candidates for public office are accepting money from "friends of drug trafficking, which could impede peaceful debate, since it will lead to political corruption." Although Chaux Mosquera did not reveal the list of persons aspiring to congressional office who are allegedly receiving financial backing from drug traffickers, he said it is easy to identify them since they are handing out large sums of money in northern Cauca. In the halls of Congress there were insistent rumors during the last weeks of legislative activity that relatives of persons who have been linked to drug trafficking would be running for congressional office, especially in the Atlantic Coast region.
