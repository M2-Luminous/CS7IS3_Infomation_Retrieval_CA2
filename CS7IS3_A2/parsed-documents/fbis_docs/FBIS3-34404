The regime's guards and agents have arrested a large number of the city's residents, especially youths, in fear of more riots erupting, and this has further heightened the Zahedan people's anger at Khomeyni's regime. The valiant people of Zahedan and the families of the martyrs of the latest demonstrations in that city have forced the Khomeyni regime to hand over the bodies of three of the martyrs of those demonstrations. The regime's officials -- terrified at the Zahedan people's reaction at the last rites of the martyrs of the heroic demonstrations, which would fan their fury and hatred -- had refrained from handing over the bodies. In the course of the heroic uprising by the people of Zahedan, in addition to some being martyred, thirty people were also wounded. Some of the regime's guards and agents were also killed by the people. Following the large-scale demonstrations by the people of Zahedan and the attack on Hashemi-Rafsanjani, which has plunged the entire regime in fear, Khamene'i issued a decree appointing Besharati, a (?member) of the shah's SAVAK and the current interior minister, as his replacement in the law enforcement forces for the next three years.
