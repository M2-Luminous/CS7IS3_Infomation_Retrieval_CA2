FR940524-1-00055 FR940524-1-00010 (e) Hand-operated bypass systems designed and constructed to permit the wearer to breathe and to conserve his gas supply in the event of a regulator or demand valve failure, shall be provided where necessary. (f) Valves installed on apparatus shall be clearly distinguishable from one another by sight and touch. (g) The bypass system valve control shall be colored red. (h) A main-line or bypass valve or system will not be required on apparatus for escape only. (i) Safety relief valves or systems, designed and constructed to release excess pressure in the breathing circuit, shall be provided on closed-circuit apparatus, and shall meet the following requirements: (1) The relief valve or system shall operate automatically when the pressure in the breathing circuit on the inhalation side of the breathing bag reaches 13 mm. (one-half inch) water-column height of pressure above the minimum pressure required to fill the breathing bag, within the breathing resistance requirements for the apparatus. (2) The relief valve or system shall be designed to prevent external atmospheres from entering the breathing circuit. (3) The relief valve or system shall be designed to permit manual overriding for test purposes and in the event of a failure in the valve or system. §84.85 Breathing bags; minimum requirements. (a) Breathing bags shall have sufficient volume to prevent gas waste during exhalation and to provide an adequate reserve for inhalation. (b) Breathing bags shall be constructed of materials which are flexible and resistant to gasoline vapors. (c) Breathing bags shall be installed in a location which will protect them from damage or collapse by external forces, except on apparatus classified for escape only. §84.86 Component parts exposed to oxygen pressures; minimum requirements. Each applicant shall certify that the materials employed in the construction of component parts exposed to oxygen pressures above atmospheric pressure are safe and compatible for their intended use. §84.87 Compressed gas filters; minimum requirements. All self-contained breathing apparatus using compressed gas shall have a filter downstream of the gas source to effectively remove particles from the gas stream. §84.88 Breathing bag test. (a) Breathing bags will be tested in an air atmosphere saturated with gasoline vapor at room temperature (24&hyph;30 ○C./75&hyph;85 ○F.) for a continuous period of twice the rated time of the apparatus (except for apparatus for escape only where the test period shall be the rated time of the apparatus). (b) The bag will be operated during this test by a breathing machine with 24 respirations per minute and a minute-volume of 40 liters. (c) A breathing machine cam with a work rate of 622 kg.-m./min. will be used. 1 1 Silverman, L., G. Lee, T. Plotkin, L. Amory, and A. R. Yancey, Fundamental Factors in Design of Protective Equipment, O.S.R.D. Report No. 5732, issued Apr. 1, 1945. The dimensions of the breathing machine cam are available from the Institute upon request. (d) The air within the bag(s) shall not contain more than 100 parts per million of gasoline vapor at the end of the test. §84.89 Weight requirement. (a) The completely assembled and fully charged apparatus shall not weigh more than 16 kg. (35 pounds); however, where the weight decreases by more than 25 percent of its initial charge weight during its rated service life, the maximum allowable weight of a completely assembled and fully charged apparatus shall be 18 kg. (40 pounds). (b) Where an apparatus employs equipment which contributes materially to the wearer's comfort, e.g., a cooling system, the completely assembled and fully charged apparatus shall not weigh more than 18 kg. (40 pounds) regardless of the decrease in weight during use. §84.90 Breathing resistance test; inhalation. (a) Resistance to inhalation airflow will be measured in the facepiece or mouthpiece while the apparatus is operated by a breathing machine as described in §84.88. (b) The inhalation resistance of open-circuit apparatus shall not exceed 32 mm. (1.25 inch) water-column height (at a flow rate of 120 liters per minute). (c) The inhalation resistance of closed-circuit apparatus shall not exceed the difference between exhalation resistance (§84.91(e)) and 10 cm. (4 inches) water-column height. §84.91 Breathing resistance test; exhalation. (a) Resistance to exhalation airflow will be measured in the facepiece or mouthpiece of open-circuit apparatus with air flowing at a continuous rate of 85 liters per minute. (b) The exhalation resistance of demand apparatus shall not exceed 25 mm. (1 inch) water-column height. (c) The exhalation resistance of pressure-demand apparatus shall not exceed the static pressure in the facepiece by more than 51 mm. (2 inches) water-column height. (d) The static pressure (at zero flow) in the facepiece shall not exceed 38 mm. (1.5 inches) water-column height. (e) Resistance to exhalation airflow will be measured in the facepiece or mouthpiece of closed-circuit apparatus with a breathing machine as described in §84.88, and the exhalation resistance shall not exceed 51 mm. (2 inches) water-column height. §84.92 Exhalation valve leakage test. (a) Dry exhalation valves and valve seats will be subjected to a suction of 25 mm. (1 inch) water-column height while in a normal operating position. (b) Leakage between the valve and the valve seat shall not exceed 30 milliliters per minute.
