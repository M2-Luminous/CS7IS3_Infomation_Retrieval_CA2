Galanos described the visit as positive, and added that Cyprus' relations with Israel have strengthened. He noted, however, that Israel considers Turkey to be a good friend and ally with which it also maintains good relations. Galanos said: The delegation established that the Israeli side is not well informed about the Cyprus issue, and that there is almost a complete lack of awareness on many levels. He added: This is because there was no Cyprus Embassy in Israel for many years.
