FBIS4-13644 "drnes078cc_94001" FBIS-NES-94-078 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Islamic Affairs Islamic Council Reiterates Duties, Rights Islamic Council Reiterates Duties, Rights NC2104160494 Cairo 'AQIDATI in Arabic 12 Apr 94 p 2 NC2104160494 Cairo 'AQIDATI Arabic BFN [Text] The Islamic Research Council, headed by his eminence the grand imam of al-Azhar, has issued the following statement in response to remarks on al-Azhar by some writers: Praise be to God and prayers and salutations be on God's messenger Muhammad and all prophets and messengers. "Our Lord! Decide thou between us and our people in truth, for thou art the best to decide." [Koranic verse] The Islamic Research Council of al-Azhar has examined remarks by some writers about al-Azhar, particularly about al-Azhar's examination of [literary and artistic] material. The council issues this statement to the Egyptian people as a reminder and in eagerness to explain and stress the task it is entrusted with. The essence of this task is to promote God's religion through wisdom and good advice; as Almighty God said, "Let there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, enjoying what is right, and forbidding what is wrong: They are the ones to attain felicity." [Koranic verse] What is to the credit of our glorious nation is that religiousness has been instilled in the Egyptian people's souls since history began. The Egyptian people, including all their trends and inclinations, are clearly religious and adhere to God's teachings. Al-Azhar has always been the place sought by students of Islamic knowledge from all parts of the world and from the Islamic world east and west in realization of God's command in his holy book "If a contingent from every expedition remain behind, admonish the people when they return to them that thus they may learn to guard themselves against evil." [Koranic verses] Al-Azhar's task also is to study Islamic sciences, explain the facts of religion to people at home and abroad, and present them to the people pure, sound, and void of odious bigotry and extremism. This is so because al-Azhar seeks a middle course and moderation--a characteristic by which al-Azhar and its institutions have been known throughout history--out of the conviction that this religion is easy and one should not go to extremes. This lays on al-Azhar the duty to convey the message of Islam to all nations, defend it, and explain its effect on the progress of mankind and civilization. It is the destiny of al-Azhar to be the trusted guardian of Islamic values and the cultural heritage of this nation. This has become deeply entrenched in the minds of the Egyptian people, who flock in alarm to the al-Azhar mosque for advice on every issue that concerns their Islamic creed, shari'ah, and ethics. These are precisely the Islamic principles legislated by the Egyptian Constitutions, laws, and by-laws in Egypt, culminating in the declaration that Islam is the state's religion, Arabic its official language, and the principles of the Islamic shari'ah the main source of legislation. If this were the established rule, and indeed it is, then there should not be room for any discordant voices or writers with twisted ideology to question al-Azhar's right to caution against whatever may contradict the teachings of Islam or exceed the limits set by God Almighty in His Koran or in the teachings of His prophet, peace be upon him, or that it is the ultimate authority in this regard. These voices and writers are not new to the scene. For decades they have tried to advocate alien and imported ideologies and materialistic philosophies, to antagonize the heavenly revelation, and to conspire against Islam, only to be defeated and fail on every occasion, thank God. Today, once again they have come out into the open, taking advantage of the extremists' plots, to undermine Islam in its entirety, or rather to strike at religion in general. The noble al-Azhar has always been and continues to be against any form of extremism and eager to show the bright image of Islam, in a bid to uphold what is right, refute and uproot what is wrong, and to promote virtue and prohibit vice, as God has ordered, with wisdom and good advice. If some are riding the wave of extremism and excess, it is the duty of those who are well versed to straighten out their deviation and restore them to reason. As for those who cannot tolerate Islam and who declare themselves and their writings to be at war against its rules and rites, there is no place for them in this arena, for they are the ones who make things worse by combating extremism with an even more misleading and harmful extremism. Judging by their conduct, it is clear that they hold no reverence for Allah. Their boldness against Islam's heritage and its sources in the Koran and the prophet's tradition is evident to all, beyond any doubt. They fail to realize that in drifting away from God's religion there is no distinction between deviation to the right or to the left, between adding and omitting, and between those who question God's religion and those who are ungrateful to it. Being the higher body involved in Islamic research, it is the Islamic Research Council's duty "to give its views on any sectarian, social, or economic problem that comes up," and "to follow up on all the studies and researches published on Islam and the Islamic heritage inside the country and abroad to benefit from whatever authentic views they contain, or to counter, correct, or react to them." To attain its goals under the powers invested in it, the Council may issue recommendations to individuals and groups involved in the field of Islamic culture in public and private organizations. It would have been better for the voices and pens that contest the Honorable al-Azhar's missions to have followed the call to pursue an orthodox line of conduct, in word and deed as well as in performance, and avoided sparking off disagreements on religious issues. They are well aware that those who follow the call are careful to obey God's word and cherish Islam, their creed and canon. Accordingly, and since the al-Azhar shaykh is by law "the grand imam and the highest opinion on all religion-related matters," the Council--supported by its chairman, the grand imam of al-Azhar--will continue, along with him, to protect the Koran and its tradition, guard the bounds established by Allah, and necessarily draw attention to the need to rectify deviations or twisted conduct regardless of its kind or source. "For the scum disappears like froth cast out, while that which is for the good of mankind remains on Earth." [Koranic verse] May Allah guide our steps. God as our witness, we have conveyed the message. [Signed] Honorable al-Azhar Shaykh and Chairman of the Islamic Research Center Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq
