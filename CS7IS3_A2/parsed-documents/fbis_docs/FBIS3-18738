Drafted by Ferdinando Adornato and signed by 14 personalities from the culture and business worlds (including Bobbio, Eco, Furio Colombo, Ettore Gallo, Benetton, Marzotto, and Sylos Labini), this appeal has become the banner of the National Cultural and Professional Assembly, promoted by Democratic Alliance [AD] and scheduled to take place in Rome on 12 March. The title "Reflect, Italy" sounds like an antislogan designed to counter "Forza Italia." Is this so? Let us listen to Adornato himself. [LA REPUBBLICA] Is this, then, a last appeal to avoid the "slumber of reason?" [Adornato] The Italy of competence and work must make its voice heard. The meeting which will be held in Umberto Hall will feature the three C's symbolizing the reconstruction of the country: competence, creativeness, and civilization. The best part of Italy must enter the field in order to restore the image of a nation which is on its knees but which nevertheless can still rely on enormous resources to rise up to its feet again. [LA REPUBBLICA] Does appealing to those who are "competent" mean proposing a technical government, just at a time when an attempt is being made to revive politics? [Adornato] We must change the system, the decisionmaking mechanisms, otherwise nothing will change. Decisionmaking must be closely linked to expertise, following years of calculated incompetence on the part of a worn-out and impoverished political caste. For example, unless we get managers to run our hospitals, we will always have a disastrous health system. [LA REPUBBLICA] Is there any sense in an appeal to "creativeness?" Is this not an appeal to Italic vitalism in the manner of Pasqualino Settebellezze [movie character]? [Adornato] Not at all. This is an extraordinarily creative country. The problem is that people have only used this asset to bend the law and serve their own private interests -- to adapt, conform, evade taxation, swindle the state. However, we must now draw up a list of our resources. There is enormous potential for the construction industry, which does not mean more concrete, but rather, making towns more habitable. The same applies to reviving tourism, which has been destroyed, or putting culture to good use and making it profitable. The private and the public sectors must work together to create new jobs, to launch a Roosevelt-like development and reconstruction program, starting from a number of pilot projects. [LA REPUBBLICA] Is the appeal to civilization intended as a bulwark against electoral barbarism? [Adornato] Of course, our country cannot revert to the late 1940's ideologies. The Cold War is over for everyone. [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is saying that, if he loses, he will leave Italy for good -- an excellent example of political incivility. We will not leave -- there is no antinational posturing on our part. If we lose, we will stay here as part of the opposition. As the British say: Right or wrong, this is my country -- this Italy where 96 percent of homes have a TV set, where it takes six months to get x-rays on the National Health Service, this Italy which has no respect for elderly people and children, which is corrupt and cynical, with its head in Beverly Hills and its feet in the Third World. [LA REPUBBLICA] Will an appeal against this egoism epidemic be enough? [Adornato] To begin with, in March Italians will be voting directly for the government, for the first time ever. For [Prime Minister] Ciampi or Berlusconi. This does not seem like much, but actually it means a lot.
