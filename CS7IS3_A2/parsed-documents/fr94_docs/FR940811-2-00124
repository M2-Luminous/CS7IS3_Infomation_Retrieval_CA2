FR940811-2-00124 FR940811-2-00076 5. Applicant believes that the exposure to certain custodial risks is reduced when securities are held through Euroclear or CEDEL, rather than directly by a United States bank branch, since securities held in Euroclear or CEDEL do not have to be transported for deposit outside these systems to effect sale. Furthermore, holding foreign securities outside of Euroclear and CEDEL would give rise to substantially higher costs and probably would involve other significant problems. Applicant's Legal Analysis 1. Section 26(a)(1) provides that a unit investment trust must be governed by a trust indenture that designates one or more trustees or custodians, each of which is a bank, and section 26(a)(2)(D) requires that the trust indenture provide that the trustee or custodian have possession of all securities and other property in which the funds of the trust are invested. 2. Euroclear and CEDEL do not qualify under the Act as custodians for unit investment trust assets. The term ``bank'' is defined in section 2(a)(5) as a banking institution organized under the laws of the United States, a member bank of the Federal Reserve System, and any other banking institution or trust company doing business under the laws of any state or the United States that receives deposits or exercises fiduciary powers. The SEC has stated that an overseas branch of a domestic bank is the only facility located outside the United States that qualifies as a custodian under section 26. See Exemption for Custody of Investment Company Assets Outside the United States, Investment Company Act Release No. 13724 (Jan. 17, 1984). The SEC also has indicated that a foreign-incorporated subsidiary does not meet this definition. See International Resources Funds, Inc., Investment Company Act Release No. 2874 (May 4, 1959). Accordingly, neither Euroclear nor CEDEL meets the definition of a bank under the Act, and, as a result, neither qualifies as a custodian. 3. Section 6(c) provides in relevant part that the SEC, by order upon application, may exempt any transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicant believes that the requested relief satisfies the section 6(c) standard. 4. Rule 17f&hyph;5 permits a registered management investment company to hold foreign securities in foreign security depositories or clearing agencies such as Euroclear or CEDEL, subject to certain provisions. Rule 17f&hyph;5 permits investment companies to place and maintain foreign securities, as defined in the rule, with certain foreign custodians, provided that a majority of the board of directors, (a) determines that maintaining the company's assets in a particular country is consistent with the best interests of the company and its shareholders, (b) determines that maintaining the company's assets with a particular foreign custodian is consistent with the best interests of the company and its shareholders, and (c) approves, as consistent with the best interests of the company and its shareholders, a written contract that will govern the manner in which such custodian will maintain the company's assets. The directors also must establish a system to monitor these arrangements and annually review and approve the continuance of these arrangements. Both Euroclear and CEDEL qualify as foreign custodians under rule 17f&hyph;5. There, however, is no rule analogous to rule 17f&hyph;5 applicable to the safekeeping of the assets of a unit investment trust when those assets are held outside of the United States. 5. Applicant proposes to provide to a trust custody services that would permit the foreign securities of the trust to be held abroad in the custody of Euroclear or CEDEL. These arrangements will be in total agreement with those applicable to registered management investment companies as contemplated by rule 17f&hyph;5, except that (a) certain duties and responsibilities of the directors of such companies will be performed by applicant as trustee, (b) applicant will provide indemnification to the unit holders, and (c) only Euroclear and CEDEL will qualify as foreign custodians for the trusts. 6. Applicant views the deposit of trust assets with Euroclear and CEDEL to be consistent with the purposes of section 26. Euroclear and CEDEL are the largest clearance and custody systems of internationally traded securities. Their insurance coverage, governing terms and conditions, and the high calibre of their depositories provide trust and unit holders with a great degree of security. Applicant's Conditions Applicant agrees that the exemptive order requested herein will be subject to the following conditions: 1. Applicant will comply with the provisions of Rule 17f&hyph;5 under the Act as if each trust was a registered investment company and applicant was its board of directors; except that Euroclear and CEDEL shall be the only qualified ``eligible foreign custodians'' for the trusts. 2. Applicant will indemnify and hold each of the trusts harmless from and against any loss that shall occur as the result of the failure of a Transnational Agency holding the foreign securities of a trust to exercise reasonable care with respect to the safekeeping of such foreign securities to the same extent that applicant would be required to indemnify and hold a trust harmless if applicant were holding such foreign securities in the jurisdiction of the United States whose laws govern the relevant trust indenture; provided, however, that applicant shall not be liable for loss except by reason of the gross negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct of applicant or a Transnational Agency. 3. Applicant will assure that the sponsors of each of the trusts agree that the potential exposure of loss to unit holders resulting from the use of a Transnational Agency will be disclosed, if material, in the prospectus relating to the relevant trust. 4. Applicant will maintain and keep current written records regarding the basis for choice or continued use of a particular Transnational Agency, and such records will be available for inspection at applicant's offices at all reasonable times during its usual business hours by unit holders and the SEC. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
