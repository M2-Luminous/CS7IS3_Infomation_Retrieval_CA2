"The timing of the operation, known as Silver Back, depends however on local security conditions," he added on BRTN [Dutch-language Belgian Radio and Television] radio. The minister also confirmed that the first plane bringing Belgians home from Kigali is expected in Melsbroek during the night of Monday to Tuesday. This plane is due to leave the Rwandan capital at around 1000 GMT on Monday, traveling first to Nairobi (Kenya) and arriving in Belgium during the night (at around 2300 GMT, according to a Sabena spokesman -- editor's note). Priority is now being given to the evacuation of Belgians living in the interior of the country. Belgian paratroopers aim to assemble the Belgian nationals at Kigali airport throughout Monday, and possibly Tuesday. Belgians living in the capital have already assembled. The minister also pointed out that the Belgian blue helmets have been charged with taking part in the evacuation operation. Finally, he confirmed that both civil and military cooperation with Rwanda would probably be reviewed after the evacuation. He added that this question will be on the agenda of the government and Parliament in the coming weeks.
