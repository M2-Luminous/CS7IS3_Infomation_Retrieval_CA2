In a statement to MENA today on the sidelines of the committee meeting, he said that the paper still contains numerous political items that are the jurisdiction of the bilateral negotiations, which are considered to be the basis of the political process. He noted that the paper that will be adopted at the conclusion of the meetings in Cairo will not be "a recommendation" but a "draft" that will be submitted to the Arab countries to give their official view. It will then be put forward to the general arms control committee meeting scheduled for April. Meanwhile, an official source in the United Arab Emirates delegation participating in the meetings of the arms control and regional security committee said that the United States and Russia, in their capacity as cosponsors of the peace conference should endorse on any joint principles adopted by the current meetings in Cairo and not just take a neutral stand. In a statement to MENA, he said that his country insists on the two cosponsors' approval and endorsement of any formula on principles reached by the Middle East countries so that both countries will be committed to that formula in the future. He said that this point is still under discussion because both cosponsors favor a neutral stance on the position the conferees intend to adopt.
