The ministers confirmed that the action plan should be designed to boost transparency, objectivity and free competition in Japan's construction market and secure greater foreign access, Ishihara said. They were Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. The 20-minute meeting was in line with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's instruction on October 22 to hammer out an action program in early 1994 to open Japan's construction market to foreign firms. The government issued an outline of the scheme to improve its public works bidding systems on October 26 to avert U.S. punitive actions against Japan. Ishihara told a news conference the government hopes to thrash out details of the action program by around mid-January. He denied, however, that the timetable has anything to do with the January 20 deadline for U.S. sanctions against Japan over construction procurement practices. "It is not that we are working out an action plan in the face of threatened sanctions but at our own volition," Ishihara said. The United States has threatened to impose sanctions if Japan fails to take steps to increase the openness of its construction market and secure greater foreign access by January 20, an extended deadline from the original October 31. Ishihara also said that all cabinet ministers, except Sadao Yamahana who is in charge of political reform, will meet prior to a regular cabinet session on Tuesday morning to exchange views on the planned action program. At the meeting, Ishihara said, Hosokawa will explain the outcome of Monday's talks and seek cooperation from the ministers. He revealed that ministers did not discuss the value of projects undertaken by national and local governments, or by public corporations, for which foreign contractors will be allowed to participate in tenders. The four ministers also did not talk about a possible halt to preferential treatment for U.S. construction firms in bidding for Japan's major public works projects, the deputy chief cabinet secretary said. Igarashi, the construction minister, has said Tokyo may stop such preferential treatment for U.S. firms in return for the introduction of an open bidding system. U.S. construction firms have received work on 34 Japanese projects worth a total of nearly 100 billion yen, including New Kansai International Airport near Osaka, western Japan, since the two governments agreed on the idea in 1988.
