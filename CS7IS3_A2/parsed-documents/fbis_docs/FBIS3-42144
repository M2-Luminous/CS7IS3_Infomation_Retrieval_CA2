Speaking to reporters during the second day of his official visit to Israel, he was today lecturing at the Hebrew University. More from reporter Dick Winter: [Begin recording] Winter: Dr. Vaclav Klaus, in his first visit to Israel, met this morning with his former economic adviser: the governor of the Bank of Israel, Ya'aqov Frenkel. Frenkel, in 1986 a senior official in the International Monetary Fund, helped Dr. Klaus to plan the new Czech Republic's emerging free market economy. But reporters' first question to the visiting prime minister was about the charges that the Czech firm Skoda, one of the Czech Republic's largest companies, is selling nuclear technology, along with other weapons, to Iran. Klaus: Well, I must say those are just rumors and speculations usually created by the competition in the Western European countries, in the United States companies which want to catch the markets themselves and try in advance to send rumors to undermine the Czech position. Simply that's not true. [passage omitted] [end recording]
