Good evening, Mr. Schutte. Thanks for coming on. It's been quite a business this evening, in this program. [Schutte] Good evening, Mr. Bishop. [Bishop] First of all, what can you tell us -- what can you add, indeed, to what our political correspondent has said and what's been carried in the news? [Schutte] Well, I think the first thing that I would like to say is that I am cautious. There are a number of conditions that have been set. Of course if something happens, if it really is true, then it is very good news because the fact will be that then we will be able to say that the leaders representing 90 percent of our population will in fact have indicated participation in this election and then one can say that this is an inclusive election -- that what we've aspired to in the last few years, that would be very good news but I think -- of course, I think the other thing that one must say is that it is a good indication that the IFP is at least considering participation. [Bishop] Would you say though that two leading figures like Mr. Mandela and Dr. Buthelezi would come together, look so much at ease and yet it not really being on -- that there's still a chance everything might be off? [Schutte] Well the news is very fresh to me, and I can only look at the spoken word. And if one looks at the spoken word, there is still a lot of conditions put to it, but what I can say is that there has been a lot of work put into trying and finding an accommodation in the last few days and hours and there is an indication that that will not be in vain. [Bishop] What price the Freedom Alliance? How are you reading that? [Schutte] Well that is not indicated. Also, the other aspect of the international mediation. The fact is that the election must go forward. The election must go forward on 27 April and to make that possible there are a number of restrictive dates, the one is 4 March. Parties who want to participate will have to register by 4 March and to enable them to finally be part of the election process they will have to submit their candidates' list by 9 March. That is the final date. [Bishop] Mediation -- what's the relevance there? Mention of an overseas mediator, indeed. [Schutte] Well, that is not clear to me at this stage because if that is to be...if that is to happen before any of the parties -- well before the IFP decides to really get involved, that will have to occur very, very soon. [Bishop] Mr. Schutte how close were the Nationalist Party to the ANC [African National Congress] on this approach to Dr. Buthelezi? [Schutte] We took it on ourselves to make a number of approaches, to make a number of proposals to him with a view to getting his participation. The moment that we could get that I am sure that we could have also persuaded the ANC to accept many of the proposals. That was our game plan. [Bishop] Can you tell us if certain offers were made to persuade Dr. Buthelezi and the IFP to agree to provisionally come on board? [Schutte] Well, of course we indicated also that a great many of their preconditions have been met, and are now being met in parliament, so I believe that that was also...that also played a major role. [Bishop] Nothing further and more tempting perhaps? [Schutte] I don't want to take the matter any further at this stage. I think it's far too late. The fact is that tomorrow is the last day of parliament and we would have to have some more...some clear indication at this stage to take the matter any further. I just cannot see at this stage, at this very late stage, that amendments can be made. [Bishop] Well, thank you so much for coming on and helping us with this, the big breaking news story of the evening. [Schutte] Thank you.
