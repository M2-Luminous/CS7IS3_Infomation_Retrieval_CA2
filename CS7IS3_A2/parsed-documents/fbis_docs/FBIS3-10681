This has been achieved as the result of the competent, dedicated work of the expert satellite and optical-link researchers at the Jose Antonio Echeverria Superior Polytechnical School in Havana City. A relevant fact was that at the first interactive conference in February, outstanding experts of the Medical Sciences Institute received a live satellite signal, enabling them to observe three top scientific-level surgeries. During the Hispasat satellite transmissions, a doctor observing one of the complex surgeries was able to answer questions on the patient's health condition.
