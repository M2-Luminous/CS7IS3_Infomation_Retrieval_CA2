However the meat is safe to eat, the Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday. Farmer David Blything, of Green Lane Farm, Kelso, where traces of bovine immuno deficienco virus (BIV) have been found in at least two animals, said yesterday that the meat was likely to be made into mince or beefburgers. Mr. Jim Jack, solicitor for Mr. Blything, said last night one of the cattle was sold for slaughter before tests showed it contained BIV antibodies. A second animal, which tested positive, had also been sent for slaughter as had a third from the herd which had not shown signs of antibodies. BIV is a distant relative of HIV virus in humans, but the ministry said there was no risk to public health. It originated in the United States and was first discovered in Britain in 1990. -- Pig farmers were facing a serious economic crisis, Mr. David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said at its annual meeting in London yesterday. An urgent message had been sent by him to Mr. Renee Steichen, EC farm commissioner, urging him to speed up an inquiry into state aid given to French pig producers. The NFU says that the state aid puts the British producers at a competitive disadvantage.
