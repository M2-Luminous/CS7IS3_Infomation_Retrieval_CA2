Statements concerning the report should be sent to: David Speights, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office, Mail Code: 5101, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Swack, Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office, at (202) 260&hyph;3850. BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Section 112(r)(10) of the Clean Air Act directs the President to conduct a review of release prevention, mitigation, and response authorities across the Federal government. The Environmental Protection Agency, in conjunction with the other member agencies of the Federal National Response Team (NRT), conducted the review and submitted its report to the Congress in February 1994. The report concludes that while the current hazardous materials safety system achieves its statutory goals to protect public health and safety and the environment, it is overly complex and confusing and, as a result, imposes unnecessary costs on government, industry, and the public. To address these issues and to consider appropriate remedies, the report proposes a second phase involving stakeholder participation that will focus on: •Streamlining the multiple and overlapping statutory terms for regulated substances and reportable events, •Harmonizing multiple and/or redundant hazard classification systems, •Analyzing the efficacy of multiple requirements for facility contingency plans and the desirability of a Federal baseline standard with added components for special concerns, •Streamlining accident data collection and management systems to improve efficiency, and •Improving Federal/state/local coordination of emergency planning. The goal of the second phase of the project is to identify specific administrative and statutory changes that will yield a more coordinated, rational, and efficient approach to hazardous materials safety. The period provided under this notice for statements is designed to provide an opportunity for interested parties to have input into this process and help shape any potential recommendations. Dated: June 25, 1994. James L. Makris, Director, Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16726 Filed 7&hyph;8&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
