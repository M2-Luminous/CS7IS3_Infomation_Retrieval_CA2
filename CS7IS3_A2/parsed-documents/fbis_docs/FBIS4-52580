FBIS4-52580 "dreas091_j_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 16 Mar 1994 Indonesia * Official Concerned About Loan Transactions * Official Concerned About Loan Transactions 94SE0109A Jakarta BISNIS INDONESIA in Indonesian 16 Mar 94 p 1 94SE0109A Jakarta BISNIS INDONESIA Indonesian CSO [Text] The head of the APBN [State Budget] Commission of the DPR [Parliament] believes that problem loans and nonperforming loans made after the KLBI [Bank of Indonesian Liquidity Credit] was halted in January 1990 were caused by debtors manipulating their equity by marking up the projects funded with that credit and by using part of the KLBI funds for other projects. Aberson M. Sihaloho, Deputy Chairman of the DPR's APBN Commission, said that as soon as the KLBI was halted at the beginning of 1990 through the issuance of the 29 January 1990 policy package known as the January Package, the number of problem loans rose sharply. He then mentioned that the percentage of problem loans in government banks, about 6 percent in 1990, rose to 11.8 percent in 1991, rose again to about 15.8 percent in 1992, and in 1993 it rose to 21.2 percent of the total credit of 91.8 trillion rupiahs granted by BUMN [State-Owned Enterprise] banks. "The Minister of Finance himself presented these figures at a working meeting with the APBN Commission," said the Representative in the DPR building yesterday. Aberson said that the problem loans occurred because debtors who obtained low-interest KLBI loans at around 14 percent interest increased their equity by marking up the value of their projects or their capital goods. "So that equity reached 25 percent, as was required at that time, but in reality it wasn't that high," he said. At the same time, Aberson added, debtors who obtained KLBI loans used part of the credit for other projects which had no connection with the projects funded by the KLBI, for example for investment in hotels or other enterprises; some was even deposited in banks. So that, Aberson continued, when the due date arrived and the debtor had to pay the instalment payment and the interest, the project funded by the KLBI was unable to pay the obligation because the real value of the project was less than what was submitted in the credit proposal. "Debtors who obtained a KLBI manipulated the equity from the proceeds of their project mark-up, said Aberson, a member of the FPDI [Indonesian Democracy Party Faction] of the DPR. As Aberson said, Sumarlin's statement made when he was still Minister of Finance in 1990 when he explained the 1990 January Package alluded to the fact that the debtors had diverted the KLBI funds. Sumarlin said that the KLBI had weaknesses and problems. "Many KLBI loans which carry low interest rates and which frequently cause distortions in allocation and evaluation are still used in our present system of national credit," Sumarlin said at that time. Sumarlin said that what happened was that low-interest cash loans were then deposited in banks. "As a result of actions such as that, loans obtained by debtors before the beginning of 1990, including KLBI loans obtained by Eddy Tansil of the Golden Key Group, became problem loans, which are not very different from nonperforming loans," said Aberson. Nonperforming loans not yet turned over to the State Auction and Loan Affairs Board [BUPLN], Aberson said, are still considered problem loans by the bank concerned. "It is not until it is turned over to the BUPLN that it becomes a nonperforming loan," said Aberson.
