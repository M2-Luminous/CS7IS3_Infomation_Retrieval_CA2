Morken, who is the newly elected leader of the Europe Movement in Telemark, has fired off a powerful warning to his party. He points to an interview with Erik Solheim in DAGENS NAERINGSLIV in which the SV leader says that he is "in favor of pan-European cooperation in the CSCE, NATO, and also in the relationship between the EU and East Europe." "This argument is diffuse, to put it mildly. It sounds completely contradictory to be in favor of cooperation between the EU and East Europe and at the same time to be against the EU," Morken said. In the past the headmaster from Bo has been the leader of the Telemark SV. He is still a member of the party, but has resigned from all party posts because of the way the party leadership is tackling the EU issue. [Borud] Erik Solheim has told the public that at present he is thinking and reading books. Should the party leader now come out of the isolation booth? "Yes, he should come out of the isolation booth, and he should be making statements to which people can react; whole alternatives that place Norway in a European and international context and that react to the real world and the fact that the EU exists," said Morken, who hopes that the SV will follow the Danish Socialist People's Party and change its stance on the EU issue. [Borud] There has been silence from the SV leadership since the election. "Yes, it seems as if the fiasco in the election -- which was to a large extent due to the EU issue -- has made the leadership uncertain about what arguments should be used now." [Borud] Has the SV engaged in the debate on the Center Party's terms to too great an extent? "Yes, for a period to begin with, but then people realized that no one can beat the Center Party when it comes to dogmatic opposition to the EU. We as socialists must have completely different arguments." Morken has long been calling for alternatives to the EU, but does not think that he has been given any satisfactory answers: "I have reached the conclusion that the EU is the only body that could be the start of something that could become pan-European cooperation." Morken has little sympathy with those who argue for NATO membership, but against the EU: "This weakens West European influence, and we will find ourselves with a NATO that will be totally dominated by the United States. The EU is the only supranational body that has the economic and political weight to support the countries of East Europe. Security policy is something much greater than military capacity. The economy is of crucial importance when it comes to stabilizing the situation in East Europe, and this is something that only the EU can do," Morken said, adding a reminder about his socialist point of departure.
