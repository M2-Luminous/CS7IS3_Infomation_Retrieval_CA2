The TEC management committee was mandated to take whatever steps it felt were necessary to ensure free and fair elections in the territory. The TEC passed the resolution after being presented with a report alleging kwaZulu government and kwaZulu Police [KZP] complicity in hit squad activity. The report, compiled by attorneys Fink Haysom and Howard Varney and the SAP's [South African Police] Col Ivor Human, recommended the KZP be brought under South African Police jurisdiction ahead of the April 27 election. Although the TEC decided on no specific or immediate steps, the report's conclusions will help inform management committee members of the steps believed to be necessary to ensure a free and fair election in Natal. It calls on the kwaZulu administration to co-operate with all electoral organs, the South African Government and with civil service rationalisation. It also recommends indemnity be considered for police officers who have information on hit squad activities. The investigations team began its work in December after a Goldstone Commission report said hit squads were probably operating in Natal/kwaZulu. Investigators heard evidence ranging from KZP involvement in hit squad activity to the involvement of the department of the chief minister of kwaZulu, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the report said. "The pattern which emerges from the evidence is obvious and repetitive. It repeatedly refers to certain individuals and similarly reveals a clear pattern with regard to the response by the kwaZulu Police to hit squad activity." It notes that "hit squad activity in Natal and particularly in the area of jurisdiction of the KZP is rife. The number of deaths caused by these hit squads is unquantifiable but would represent a significant proportion of those who have died in political violence in kwazulu and natal." The report said some of the hit squad activities could be associated with people who underwent training in the Caprivi Strip in 1986 and who now operated within the KZP. These trainees had later been trained by the SAP and deployed in the Pietermaritzburg area. It said some officials of the Inkatha Freedom Party and employees of a kwaZulu government department were implicated in hit squad activity. Victims included members of the African National Congress and KZP policemen perceived to be disloyal to the IFP. There was evidence that investigations were being hampered by the "highest echelons of the KZP". "The task group is satisfied that there are linkages and connections between different elements engaged in gun running and hit squad activity inside and outside the security forces, both in the Transvaal and Natal." It recommends a single unified investigative team assisted by international figures and that the Caprivi trainees be transferred from active policing. "We recommend further the immediate cessation of the issue and distribution of all firearms, including semi-automatic weapons from or through the department of the chief minister of kwaZulu." Finally, it recommends that the KZP give exact details of steps it intends implementing to prevent hit squad activities in the run-up to the elections and the possible revocation of the authority of the kwaZulu government to establish its own police force.
