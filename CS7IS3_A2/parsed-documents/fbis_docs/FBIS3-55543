The participants in the meeting discussed ways to reach the goals set by their joint declaration adopted on January 5. In the declaration they expressed their determination to build their activities in the State Duma on the basis of "parliamentary freedom and responsibility, common sense, political realism, pragmatism, and respect for opinions and positions of other factions and groups."

The deputies called on their colleagues elected in individual constituencies to join their efforts for the benefit of all peoples of Russia. The commission for the procedural regulations of the State Duma and the deputy status discussed key questions the solution of which should ensure the effective work of the parliament.
