FBIS4-21629 "jptnd009___94016" JPRS-TND-94-009 JPRS PROLIFERATION ISSUES 31 March 1994 EAST ASIA SOUTH KOREA SKNDF White Paper Denounces Country's Nuclear Development SKNDF White Paper Denounces Country's Nuclear Development SK0204061294 (Clandestine) Voice of National Salvation in Korean to South Korea 0300 GMT 31 Mar 94 SK0204061294 (Clandestine) Voice of National Salvation Korean BFN [Text] The Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] on 30 March published a white paper revealing that the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the multipurpose research reactor in Taedok are for nuclear development. Saying that the Kim Yong-sam clique misled the public opinion by insisting that the experimental reactors of North Korea are for the development of nuclear weapons, so as to kick up anti-North smear campaign, the white paper pointed out that this is like an act of a thief turning on the victim with a club. The white paper maintained that the reactors used for the development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula are not the experimental reactor of North Korea, which has generating capacity of 5,000 kilowatts, but the heavy water reactor in Wolsong with 678,700 kilowatt and the multipurpose research reactor in Taedok with 30,000 kilowatt. Based on accurate materials, the white paper expressed that the Wolsong heavy water reactor is a reactor for the development of nuclear weapons disguised as one for commercial use. It added that it is a plutonium-producing reactor, introduced for the development of nuclear weapons and not for commercial use, in view of its purpose and structure. The white paper disclosed that the Wolsong heavy water reactor disgorges a large amount of spent fuel containing high-level plutonium and is used directly for the development of nuclear weapons. In addition, the white paper pointed out that the multipurpose research reactor complex is a reactor exclusively for nuclear arms development under the veil of research. The white paper exposed that the multipurpose research reactor is a reactor for the development of nuclear weapons set up in the eighties as an alternate project as the attempt to introduce it for the key role in the nuclear development in the seventies had failed. The white paper revealed on the basis of the accurate materials that the multipurpose research reactor is not an experimental reactor with a peaceful purpose but for military use which is used as a diazole in the production of nuclear weapons, and said the problem lies on the fact it is closely linked with reprocessing facilities. The white paper insists that all these facts prove that the Wolsong heavy water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor in Taedok are for the military use, and it is South Korea, not North Korea, which confronts the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The white paper said that the South Korean authorities are openly claiming the reexamination of the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and eager to develop the nuclear weapons by openly calling for nuclear option. If this is not true, the white paper maintains, the South Korean authorities must give up the policy of nuclear arms development pushed ahead in accordance with the anti-North nuclear smear campaign, and declare the removal of the heavy water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor which are used for the production of nuclear weapons.
