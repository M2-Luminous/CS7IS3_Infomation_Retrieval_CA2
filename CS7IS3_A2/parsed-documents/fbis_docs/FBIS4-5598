FBIS4-5598 "dreas070_a_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Ambassador Assures Washington Reform To Continue Ambassador Assures Washington Reform To Continue OW1104234394 Tokyo KYODO in English 2325 GMT 11 Apr 94 OW1104234394 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Washington, April 11 KYODO -- Japan's Ambassador to the United States Takakazu Kuriyama assured Washington Monday that the new government in Tokyo will press on with political and economic reform initiated by outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Japanese diplomatic sources said Kuriyama gave his assurance in a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. Kuriyama originally asked for the meeting to set the groundwork for crucial trade talks that had been scheduled for Friday in Morocco between Kantor and Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. The surprise announcement last Friday that Hosokawa was stepping down from office is likely to scuttle Hata's planned trip to Morocco, however, as well as prospects for a quick resumption of stalled trade talks between Tokyo and Washington. Japanese diplomatic sources said Kantor and Kuriyama agreed that the two countries should act prudently on the "framework" trade talks. "Both sides realized that the framework should not be allowed to fail once again," a Japanese source said. Tokyo has urged Washington to resume the talks, which broke down at a summit meeting between President Bill Clinton and Hosokawa on Feb. 11. The Clinton administration made it clear after Hosokawa's resignation announcement last Friday that Washington wants to settle trade disputes with Japan under the terms of the basic framework trade accord reached with Tokyo last summer.
