FBIS4-6734 "dreas078_d_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 South Korea Special Organization for DPRK Escapees Planned Special Organization for DPRK Escapees Planned SK2204100894 Seoul YONHAP in English 0846 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204100894 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The government and the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) have decided to form a special organization to deal with North Korean escapees, DLP policy coordinator Paek Nam-chi said Friday. The organization is to be comprised of officials from the Economic Planning Board, the Agency for National Security Planning, the National Unification Board, and the Health and Social Affairs, Foreign and Labor Ministries. The government and the ruling party held a joint meeting on foreign affairs Friday attended by Chong Che-mun, chairman of the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs and National Unification Committee, and Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu to discuss handling escapees from logging camps in Siberia and other North Koreans fleeing their country. The soon-to-be-formed organization will study revision of related legislation including the law to protect North Korean defectors here as well as enact a law to protect refugees, the official said. The body is also expected to work out concrete measures to help North Korean refugees in South Korea -- providing them with opportunities for vocational education and social adaptation training, among others. Hundreds of North Koreans have escaped from Siberian logging yards, testifying later to rampant human rights violations inside the camps. The government and DLP officials agreed to devise mid- and long-term measures as the number of escapees from logging camps in Siberia and from North Korea is expected to keep increasing. The officials decided to concentrate on strengthening the North Koreans' ability to stand on their own here rather than giving them financial support. They also established the principle that North Koreans staying in China after escaping from logging camps in Russia or North Korea can resettle in South Korea if they wish. The government plans to hold diplomatic negotiations with the Chinese Government on the matter, according to party coordinator Park. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Han reported recent developments in the North Korean nuclear problem to the meeting. "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) sent North Korea a positive answer to Pyongyang's proposal that IAEA inspectors visit Yongbyon and witness the changing of nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor," Han said. The IAEA, Han said, responded that nuclear safeguards activities are necessary to complete its inspections and proposed that Pyongyang permit further checks of nuclear facilities it was denied access to last March and to ensure the continuity of safeguards. "IAEA inspection of the 5-megawatt reactor is important in securing the nuclear transparency of North Korea," Han said.
