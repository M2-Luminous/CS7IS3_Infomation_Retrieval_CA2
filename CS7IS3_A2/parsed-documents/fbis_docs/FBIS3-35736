He spoke of similar mentality on the ground and disarray within the democratic camp. Cebanu does not rule out that the Agrarian-Democratic Party may win at least 30 percent of the vote. However, the Alliance of Socialists and Unity Movement has the chance of doing the same, he believes. The Women's Association may perform well if the vote follows a Russian scenario, Cebanu said adding that the Peasants and Intelligentsia bloc and the Alliance of Christian Democratic People's Front which may win 10 percent of the vote each are likely to forge a single parliamentary group. Cebanu is sceptical about the chances by the Socialist Democratic, Democratic and Reform Parties to overcome the 4 percent barrier needed to form a faction. It is most important that people caring for internal peace and stability came to power, Cebanu stressed. But we will be in for the worst time if ant-independence forces win the election, he said.
