Barkashov's Life. Many Theories, Truth Hidden"] [Text] SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA has already reported (4 January 1994) that an attempt was made on the life of Aleksandr Barkashov, leader of Russian National Unity [RNU], 22 December. He is currently in an MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] hospital with a severe gunshot wound. In a statement issued through ITAR-TASS the Russian MVD promised to publish the official version of the circumstances surrounding this act of terrorism by 4 January. But the facts that have reached the editorial office so far are not only contradictory but sometimes mutually exclusive. According to one theory, friends took the wounded RNU leader to an ordinary Zelenograd hospital under an assumed name. The Russian special services tracked him down and moved him to the MVD hospital, where Barkashov is allegedly being held under arrest in connection with the events of 3-4 October. But the General Prosecutor's Office investigations group reported that Kazannik had long ago rescinded Barkashov's arrest warrant for lack of evidence. According to another theory, supporters of the RNU leader had themselves asked the MVD to move him to a militia hospital and organize security, since they feared another terrorist attack on Barkashov, who allegedly knows certain details of the Supreme Soviet shooting that could be "deadly" for some people. In this connection the following frank admission in MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS (5 January 1994) strikes me as interesting: "A statement by the `fuehrer' (Barkashov -- S.T.) received by us but not yet published clearly states that this brigade (the NATO 6th Brigade -- S.T.) under the command of Colonel Dzheyk Kenti [name as transliterated] methodically shot people on both sides at the White House in October so as to `make the conflict more bloody.' Israel's `Jericho' 4th Special Forces Brigade and the `Veytar' [name as transliterated] paramilitary organization were particularly brutal in dealing with unarmed women and old veterans. Moreover, in Barkashov's opinion, Yeltsin officially ordered that two high-ranking CIA station chiefs be attached to the Security Ministry and that all the security agents to coordinate their operations with them." I will not make any judgment as to the accuracy of this report, but if it contains even a grain of truth, Barkashov's life could indeed be in serious danger.
