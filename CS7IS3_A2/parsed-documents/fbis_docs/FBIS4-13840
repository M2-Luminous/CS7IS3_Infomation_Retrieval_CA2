Some windows of the U.N. office have been broken and riot police are now trying to prevent the demonstrators from entering the building. In the course of their rally on Tehran streets, thousands of students chanted slogans, condemning the silence of the United Nations and other international bodies on the massacre of Bosnian Muslims. The marchers strongly condemned the double standard policy of the United Nations and certain Western countries towards international issues, calling for a halt to the crimes being committed by the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The angry demonstrators also burned the U.S. flag in front of the U.N. office. The marchers, mostly wearing shroud, announced their readiness for a rapid dispatch to Bosnia and helping the brave defenders of Gorazde. In a press release the marchers said the only way to end the clashes is practical coordination of the Islamic countries for the quick dispatch of forces to Bosnia. "What is going on in Bosnia is also in line with the tragic policies of the global imperialism and international Zionism towards Palestine, Lebanon, Kashmir, Tajikistan and other Islamic countries," the marchers said. Meanwhile, Bosnian Ambassador to Tehran Omar Bahman appreciated the people for their massive presence in the rally, and said resistance of the Bosnian Muslims is indebted to the cooperation of the Islamic Republic of Iran. "The enemy is strong, but we will continue to resist," he said, adding that the Bosnian people were victims of a horrible crime which was unprecedented in the history. In another development, the Islamic Association of the Iranian Students in Moscow condemned the massacre of the oppressed people of Gorazde by the racist Serbs, and castigated the silence of the international circles and the United Nations towards the issue. "If the world continues its silence, and the Muslims world does not rise up, the Serbs will totally occupy Bosnia-Herzegovina and kill all Muslims in that country with the help of the arms of the former Yugoslavia," said the association in a statement.
