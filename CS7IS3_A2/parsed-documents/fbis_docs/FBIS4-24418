The eight-part defense education series will soon be distributed to people's armed forces departments across the nation. "The Great Wall Is in My Heart" is China's first comprehensive and systematic educational TV film on national defense. Guided by the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his ideas on army building in the new period, the series employs a large amount of stirring historical data and illustrative facts in presenting a vivid picture of how the three generations of CPC leadership collectives care about and value defense buildup. The series, which gives publicity to the series of principles and policies for China's national defense buildup; the achievements scored in this regard; and national defense laws and regulations including the "Military Service Law"; and disseminates modern defense knowledge, is visual teaching material on defense education for the broad mass of militiamen, reservists, and youngsters.
