A shocking report on the quality of its water is to be discussed in Denmark next month by European Ministers, but the outline of the report has already been accepted. The Quality Status Report, drawn up by scientists from eight nations -- Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Sweden -- says chemicals such as hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and tributyl tin (TBT) have reached alarming levels. Discharges of pesticides, oil and poisonous metals -- such as cadmium -- have risen unchecked and pose disturbing problems. "More stringent goals and measures are urgently needed," says the report: only radical action will halt a decline that is turning the sea into the waste dump of northern Europe. The measures to be discussed by Ministers will include drastically reducing the use of the fertilisers now leaching into rivers; halting industrial pollution; and stopping the overfishing of cod, haddock, sand eels and sprats. Such moves would, however, also have a dramatic impact on farming, fishing and manufacturing throughout the northern countries of the European Union. Fertilisers are used to sustain high agricultural yields and anti-pollution controls would make factories more expensive to run, while fishing often provides the only income for many communities around the North Sea. Discussion of the report could be protracted. Nevertheless, the eight nations are committed to reducing by 1995 emissions that are killing the sea. This gives Ministers little time to act. The report admits: "It is expected that the goal of a 50 per cent reduction in inputs of nitrogen (from fertilisers) to potential problem areas will not be realised by 1995." Additional measures and better controls are therefore urgent, it concludes. Other problems it raises are: -- High concentrations of cadmium now being found in liver tissue of fish from the central North Sea; -- discharges of fertilisers producing algal blooms, which starve fish of oxygen and are making many beaches and swimming areas dangerous; -- uncontrolled emissions of chemicals by the oil industry, from leaks and flaring operations; -- and the urgent need to ban tributyl tin (TBT), used in anti-fouling paints and known to cause deformities in oysters, whelks and other shellfish. The report concludes that, although scientists have uncovered a depressing list of ailments that are killing the North Sea, more research is required to pinpoint other threats.
