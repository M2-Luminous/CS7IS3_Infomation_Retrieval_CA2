Speaking at the XV ALIFAR Latin American association of pharmaceutical companies meeting being held here, Villalobos added that "and if we wanted to use the dyeing techniques we should have to pay royalties to these US companies." Another odd story recounted by Villalobos is that the Nazca drawings, purported to be messages to the gods, have had a patent taken out on them in France and now no products containing those drawings can be sold in France. These are just some of the sore points that have cropped up at the meeting of Latin American pharmaceutical companies discussing the patents issue here. Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador have succumbed to US pressure and have recently implemented a patents system, Argentina and Brazil however continue to show strong resistance to any system being imposed on them from abroad. Although CILFA [Argentine Industrial Center of Pharmaceutical Laboratories], Argentina's local association of companies have resisted tooth-and-nail any efforts to impose a patents law, on this occasion they will be adopting a more moderate approach and unlike some of the extreme views being expressed by other delegations, will be seeking to get the other countries to accept the GATT's Uruguay Round proposals on the patents issue. The GATT treaty, signed recently by 117 countries proposes a transition period of ten years for developing countries and the possibility of awarding obligatory licences so as to ward off monopoly situations. In Argentina government officials have teamed up with senators to try and bring the patents bill currently before the Senate, into line with the GATT provisions. Despite the fact that the US signed the GATT Treaty it has been attempting to gain further advantages as was the case with Brazil where Brazilian President Itamar Franco has promised the US that Brazil will eliminate or substantially reduce the transition period. However the Brazilian patents bill has still not been approved by its Congress. US pressure has also grown considerably on Andean Pact countries. Peru has a patents law since January 1, as does Ecuador. Venezuela adopted a law last October while Chile adopted a patents law in 1991. However according to the head of the Chilean pharmaceutical association Jose Plubins, "the pressure being exerted by the US on Chile to change its patents law is becoming unbearable." In Chile's case the US is attempting to extend the life of the patent from 15 to 20 years and that patenting should be retroactive by five years. Nor does a patents law guarantee foreign investments, as the multinationals proclaim. In Chile Pfizer, Bayer, Squibb, Schering and Parke Davies have left Chile since the patents law was implemented.
