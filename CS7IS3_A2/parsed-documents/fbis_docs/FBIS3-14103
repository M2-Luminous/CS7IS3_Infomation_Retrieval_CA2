Ross met earlier tonight with Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, which was followed by bilateral talks between the Jordanian and U.S. delegations. Before leaving Amman, Ross said his talks were good and businesslike, and that he expects the peace talks to resume soon. Speaking to reporters at Amman airport, Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said tonight's talks also covered the resumption of Jordanian-Israeli bilateral talks in Washington, as well as economic ties. [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] We had very good, serious, and businesslike discussions today. We covered a range of topics. Mr. Ross was kind enough to give us an update on the developments in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. We also dealt with the issue of bilateral issues, like sanctions in al-'Aqabah, and also our economic bilateral relations. Well, we think that some progress is going to take place very soon, and we are going to see tangible results. We also had a discussion of how to proceed next on the negotiations, and how to invigorate the Jordanian-Israeli track when we meet in Washington, hopefully in April. [Unidentified reporter] I would like to ask about the Israelis and Palestinians. They said that they agreed on international armed presence in Hebron, Gaza, and Jericho. They said that the United States and Norway agreed to participate in this. Could you elaborate? [Ross] Well, the discussions that they had covered a number of areas, including trying to reach understandings on security-related issues, and also looking at how one can move rapidly to conclude the negotiations and move towards an implementation. I am not going to go into the specifics of what they are working on right now, because I think their discussions are ongoing. [Reporter] I would like to ask you about the siege of al-'Aqabah. It is affecting Jordan tremendously. Are you going, and do you have any plans to lift the embargo, when? [Ross] Well, we had a discussion. As the minister said, we had a discussion on that. We have been exchanging views on that. And we are going to be working on that as best we can. [end recording]
