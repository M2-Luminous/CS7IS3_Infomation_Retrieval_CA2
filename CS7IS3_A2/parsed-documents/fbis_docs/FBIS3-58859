The Movement Against Racism and for Friendship Between People said Azad Dere had been questioned by police in Paris on Thursday and then ordered to remain at home in the south of France. Interior Minister Charles Pasqua signed an expulsion order for Azad Dere on December 30 as part of a Europe-wide crackdown on Kurdish activists. Dere told AFP by telephone he had been detained while acting as an interpreter for a visiting Kurdish delegation. "My activities in France are perfectly legal," he said. "I have a resident's permit that is valid until 2003." Police have placed him under house arrest "until they can find a country that will accept me after my expulsion from France," he said, adding that the expulsion order was a result of pressure from the Turkish Government. On November 18, police carried out an operation against Kurds suspected of involvement with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is fighting the Turkish Government for an independent state. Sixteen of the Kurds detained in the raids are still being held and three others are under house arrest. Azad Dere slipped through the net while he was attending a meeting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. In a statement, the Movement Against Racism demanded Azad Dere's immediate release, charging that "this new act of complicity (with the government in Ankara) dishonored France."
