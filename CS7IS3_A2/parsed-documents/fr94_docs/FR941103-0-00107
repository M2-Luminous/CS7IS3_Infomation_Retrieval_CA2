FR941103-0-00107 FR941103-0-00016 Section 178.346&hyph;2 Minor editorial changes are made to paragraph (a). Section 178.346&hyph;10 Valve manufacturers stated that, during prototype testing, they have encountered substantial problems in obtaining adequate flow under emergency conditions with pressure relief valves designed for the comparatively low MAWP levels typical of DOT 406 cargo tank motor vehicles. These problems have been resolved for current valves; however, the valve manufacturers continue to believe the emergency flow capacities, which are permitted to release up to one gallon of lading under the dynamic pressure surges characteristic of rollover accidents, are still marginal in some cases. Because of the problems encountered by valve manufacturers, RSPA will allow an additional year for product development and manufacturing start-up. This extension is added in a new paragraph (b)(3). RSPA proposed to revise paragraph (c)(1) to permit DOT 406 cargo tanks to have the same set pressure and test pressure as allowed in ยง178.345&hyph;10(d)(1), and as prescribed for DOT 407 and 412 cargo tanks except that the reclosing pressure would remain at no less than MAWP. Commenters stated that while the proposed language would be helpful in increasing the venting capacity to a limited extent and providing a similar difference between opening and closing pressures over a range of MAWP values, it would not eliminate the need for supplementary venting capacity. Commenters requested that the flow rate be determined at a higher pressure, specifically at 125 percent of the tank test pressure. This would provide more pressure differential across the valve seat and provide higher venting capacities. As discussed in the preamble for 178.346&hyph;10(b) above, pressure relief valve manufacturers reported that they have found it difficult to obtain adequate emergency flow capacities in valves designed for DOT 406 cargo tank motor vehicles. Based on comments received, RSPA believes the problem can be relieved by implementing two measures. The first measure is to increase the tolerance on the valve set pressure to allow the valve to begin opening at a lower set pressure and to be fully open at a higher pressure. The second measure is to increase the venting capacity rating pressure to 125 percent of the tank test pressure, and not greater than 3 psi above the tank's MAWP. Because the pressure relief valves are required to be removed from the cargo tank during periodic pressure testing, the tank itself will not be exposed to pressures above its normal test pressure [see ยง180.407(g)(1)(i)]. This increase in the venting capacity rating pressure will still provide a satisfactory margin of safety with respect to tank bursting pressure, even in the event of exposure to fire. The combined effect of these changes can be expected to significantly raise the pressure differential across the valve seat, thus increasing flow. Accordingly, both paragraphs (c)(1) and paragraph (d)(1) have been revised to include these two measures. Section 178.346&hyph;13 In the NPRM, RSPA proposed to increase the emergency flow capacity of DOT 406 pressure relief valves by raising the test pressure of the cargo tank. This was intended to alleviate problems reported by valve manufacturers by increasing the differential pressure across the valve seat, thus increasing flow. However, commenters requested that RSPA not make this change because of the increased danger of deformation of heads at pressure levels above 5.0 psig, especially for internal heads in which the pressure is applied to the convex side. One commenter stated that pressures above 5.0 psig would require increased head thickness or bracing, thus increasing the weight of the tank resulting in lower payload and higher manufacturing cost. As an alternative means of increasing emergency flow, commenters suggested that the set pressure and the flow rating pressure of the pressure relief valve itself be changed while retaining the existing tank test pressure. RSPA agrees with this alternative. Therefore, RSPA has revised paragraphs 178.346&hyph;10(c)(1) and (d)(1) instead of revising the tank test pressure requirements. Shortly before publication of the NPRM, TTMA petitioned RSPA to use the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) test for vapor-tightness for all DOT 406 cargo tanks. TTMA requested that Method 27 be authorized for all DOT 406 cargo tanks, regardless of whether they are: (a) used in gasoline delivery, (b) fitted with vapor collection equipment, or (c) subject to this test under EPA rules. Method 27, is found in appendix A. to 40 CFR Part 60. Section 1.1 of Method 27 is applicable for the determination of vapor tightness of a gasoline delivery tank which is equipped with vapor collection equipment. Requirements for applying the initial pressure-vacuum and test criteria are contained in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart XX_Standards of Performance for Bulk Gasoline Terminals. In ยง60.501, the definition of vapor tight gasoline tank truck reads: Vapor-tight gasoline tank truck means a gasoline tank truck which has demonstrated within the 12 preceding months that its product delivery tank will sustain a pressure change of not more than 750 pascals (75 mm of water) within 5 minutes after it is pressurized to 4,500 pascals (450 mm of water). This capability is to be demonstrated using the pressure test procedure specified in Reference Method 27. It should be noted that 750 pascals = 0.109 psi = 3.0 inches of water and 4,500 pascals = 0.653 psi = 18.1 inches of water. Similar provisions for benzene are prescribed in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart BB_National Emission Standard for Benzene Emissions from Benzene Transfer Operations, at ยง60.601.
