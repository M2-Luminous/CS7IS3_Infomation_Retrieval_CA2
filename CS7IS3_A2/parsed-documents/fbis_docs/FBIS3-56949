Ariyoshi Sibata, president of the Japanese company "Toen Shiozi", which mediated the deal told TASS on Friday by telephone from Beijing, where he is currently staying, that his company engages in trade in scrapped metal and therefore is interested in cooperation with Russia which has huge amounts of decommissioned machinery, including military equipment. He rejected claims of U.S. mass media that Russia and North Korea had signed a deal envisaging shipments of a whole fleet consisting of 40 submarines which Pyongyang may use for training and as spare parts for its military equipment. In October 1993 Sibata's company brokered a deal upon a North Korean request to ship three decommissioned and dismantled diesel submarines from the Russian Pacific Fleet to Pyongyang. Sibata said the submarines had no armaments, were heavily covered with rust and were semi-submerged. The submarines had already been delivered to North Korea where they were cut into pieces 1x1.5 metres in size to be used as scrap metal, he added.
