After 10,000 shells of all calibers, after superhuman fighting and unprecedented heroism of the defenders, the defense line has been breached in the southern part of the battlefield on the right bank of the Drina. The situation is exceptionally dramatic, while fresh columns of refugees are moving into the town center from villages on the right bank. The villages of Ahmovici, Uhotici, Kodzaga Polje, and some other villages from this area have been emptied of their inhabitants. Many civilians have been killed. Those who have succeeded in getting out in the face of strong aggressor forces, are trying to cross to the left bank and have somehow get into the town. In the town, however, the situation is extremely dramatic. At about 1900, artillery shelling intensified. Howitzer shells are being used to systematically target houses one by one in Vitkovici, (Vaci), and (Vinarici). Many people have been killed. It is not possible to get information from the military hospital because everyone is involved there in giving help to the injured. Infantry attacks also intensified at 2000 on the southern approaches to the town. No one knows what things will look like and what will happen in the night ahead. If anyone wants to help Gorazde they should do so immediately. For many people here tomorrow will be too late.
