Recently Cuba also had strong ties with countries of the socialist bloc, ties which were abruptly broken. That, together with the U.S. blockade, brought our country to the situation of the special period. Nevertheless, today, in the midst of these difficulties, Cuba is making great efforts to diversify its commercial ties with the world. In this connection, just yesterday, British Ambassador Leycester Coltman announced the possibility that another British firm may come to Cuba to work in oil exploration. At this moment, important firms from France, Great Britain, Canada, and Sweden are working in the oil exploration sphere in Cuba. It is a process whereby we are redirecting and diversifying our trade with the whole world. In Great Britain's case, Ambassador Coltman pointed out that, years ago, Cuba's exports were up to $50 million. In 1992, that figure dwindled to $43 million and in 1993 to $21 million. However, Ambassador Coltman noted that the first quarter of 1994 marked a certain recovery. In other words, it is not only in the [word indistinct], but other activities as well. Another thing I wanted to point out was about trade with Latin America. Economist Osvaldo Martinez, president of the Commission on Economic Affairs of the National Assembly of the People's Government, recently said that in 1990, 83 percent of our exports and 87 percent of our imports were concentrated in Europe. Back then, Latin America represented only 7 percent of exports and 7 percent of imports. In 1993, our exports to Latin America grew from 7 to 14 percent, and our imports from 7 to 47 percent. This is additional proof, along with Ambassador Coltman's statements and other elements mentioned by the press and our leaders, that Cuba is making efforts, in midst of its economic difficulties, to diversify its ties with the entire world.
