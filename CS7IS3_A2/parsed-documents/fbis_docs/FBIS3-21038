Application programs for industrial practice are being developed. One program is intended to plan airline routes worldwide. The core of the new Center for Parallel Computing at the University of Cologne is a massively parallel computer with 1,024 processors. In cooperation with companies, the Cologne scientists want to develop practical applications for industry on the high-performance computer. The Cologne supercomputer is only the second of its kind in Germany. Its twin stands in the University of Paderborn. With their output data amounting to a maximum of 4.4 GFlops, 4 GByte main memory, and 5 GByte/sec communications bandwidth, the computers are "top-of-the-line, worldwide," as Michael Wottowa proudly assures his Cologne system managers. Together with physicist Thomas Pfenning, the mathematician looks after programs for the high-performance computer. The financing for the Parsytec GCel3-type computer, which has a price tag of DM4.5 million on it, came to the extent of one-quarter, each, from the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, DLR (German Aerospace Research Institute), a price cut by maker Parsytec in Aachen, and funds from the European Community. In an effort to make sure that the lead held by the United States and Japan in this field would not grow any further, the EC is supporting four supercomputing centers in Cologne, Paderborn, Amsterdam, and Athens as part of the ZEUS ("Centers for European Supercomputing") initiative. With the help of their own application programs, the European high-performance computer centers are to try to find ways of transferring the output of massively parallel computing to industrial practice. The supercomputer with the noble, black-blue frog design today already displayed its special strength during multiple runs of the same program with different parameters. In this case, each processor gets an identical version of the program and only the parameters are newly determined. Michael Wottowa is convinced that the "parallel computer is also particularly suitable for field decomposition processes." That applies, for example, to the expensive programs used by the Cologne meteorologists who can calculate medium-term weather forecasts and the propagation of noxious substances using the Parsytec computer. To do that, they subdivide the air envelope of the earth as a two-dimensional surface with a certain size, and from that, they model a grid for the computer. Each computer then gets a part of the grid-oriented problem to process. But, first of all, the weather forecasters "must transfer several tens of thousands of lines of weather code to the computer," reports the system manager in discussing the status of the weather forecasting project. "Just transferring such tremendous volumes of data can take weeks," Wottowa figures out in an effort to illustrate the dimensions of the programs. The Power Systems Institute of the DLR is working on a computer-intensive project called Aerodynamics Simulation of Aircraft Power Plants. The aviation specialists replicate various shapes and arrangements of rotor blades in a jet engine as well as the combustion processes on the screen. Aircraft makers and engine makers hope--with the help of computer results--"to be able to optimize propulsion and to reduce noise emissions and fuel consumption," explained physicist Thomas Pfenning in emphasizing the industrial benefits to be derived from the program. One of the hardest nuts to crack for the supercomputer is the flight optimization program. Building on a demand model, the German Lufthansa wants to get out of the red. But something that looks simple at first sight turns out to be a complex task. The program must consider the booking data, the utilization of the individual seat classes of all major airlines, all types of passenger aircraft, and the data from the international airports. New, worldwide route planning and improved seat utilization are to be the result. Processes used hitherto cannot do that. "Just a short time ago, flight plans were fed in manually on little cards and the computer programs are very restricted," smiled Thomas Pfenning. But the very next flight plan, he hopes, "will be made on a mathematical basis, even if the complete program is not yet ready." Another traffic program, the simulation of traffic jams, revealed some rather baffling results on the new computer. Here it was not computer architecture but rather only the high computer output that was decisive. The Cologne physicists wanted to find out "why traffic buildups are formed when there is no visible traffic obstacle and how these traffic jams can be prevented." Here are the astonishing answers the computer came up with: Buildups that keep the driving speed down are necessary to move as many cars as possible over the roads in a high traffic volume situation. Less cars can be driven overall on a three-lane superhighway than on a two-lane road with strict driving tempo requirements, the program figured out. "Differing speeds, individual driving styles, and numerous passing maneuvers covering several lanes demand space and inevitably lead to jams," said Pfenning in explaining the results. The men in Cologne want to feed current data from much-traveled sections of highway into the computer soon so as to be able to spot the traffic buildup even before it develops. Many drivers will then perhaps get to their destinations faster if they follow the speeds recommended by the computer. With the help of other, practice-oriented programs, Michael Wottowa wants "to prove to industry that big problems can be solved with parallel computers." For instance, the mathematicians in Cologne, in cooperation with a specialized software producer, are trying to put together shipping run plans for moving companies. Language researchers are using neuronal networks to design a machine translation program for spoken language. The economic data processing specialists are focusing on problems dealing with production control and credit ratings when it comes to borrowing money. Thomas Pfenning is convinced that "one can achieve a big speedup in computer output only if one lets several processors work on the same problem." But because there is very little in the way of adequate past experience or standards, the most important thing first of all is to solve the problems of massively parallel computing to begin with. Supercomputers are still an expensive development project--a case for the expert, in other words. Here is the next task that is planned for this series of "Technologies of the 21st Century"--research for the communications company.
