FR940816-2-00032 FR940816-2-00027 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket No. CP94&hyph;691&hyph;000] Request Under Blanket Authorization; Colorado Interstate Gas Company August 10, 1994. Take notice that on July 29, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), P.O. Box 1087, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80944, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;691&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211) for authorization to construct a new delivery facility under CIG's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;21&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. CIG proposes to construct facilities to provide fuel gas to Amoco Energy Trading Corporation (Amoco) for the start-up of a compressor station. The delivery facility will consist of a 2-inch meter run and appurtenant facilities at an estimated cost of $2,500 to be financed from funds on hand. The new facility will be located in Section 35, Township 33 South, Range 66 West, Las Animas County, Colorado. Amoco will need approximately 200 Mcf per day of start-up fuel gas which is within certificated entitlements. The proposed facility will not have an impact on CIG's peak day and annual deliveries as the service will be provided on an interruptible basis and only when start up fuel is required. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefore, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.
