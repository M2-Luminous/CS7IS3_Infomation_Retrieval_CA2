Asked about rescuing Japanese staying in South Korea if the situation on the Korean peninsula should become tense, he said: "Our operation should not deviate from the law. Japanese staying there will feel relieved when a bill on revising the SDF Law submitted to the Diet passes through the Diet. I hope the bill will be adopted as early as possible." In this way, he expressed hopes that the bill on revising the SDF Law which allows the SDF to use government-owned planes for rescue operations will be enacted at an early date.
