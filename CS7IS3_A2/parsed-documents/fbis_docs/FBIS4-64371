Honestly, I see no way out if we continue along this route." Thus did Nicolas Redondo sum up his view of the current Spanish situation at a breakfast yesterday with reporters that, though no one referred to it as such, served as an unofficial farewell by the incumbent general secretary of the UGT [General Union of Workers]. Redondo asserted that our economy can no longer stand the thousands of layoffs week after week and the continual job losses in the small-business sector, "which the media do not even bother to report, while the government displays inertia and even appears surprised at what is occurring." Another remark by the union leader struck a note of despair: "We know that we cannot be staging general strikes at every turn, but this situation has to be addressed without delay." To judge, however, by still another assertion made by Nicolas Redondo in response to a question concerning the PSV [Basque Socialist Party], the unions have very little margin left for maneuver. "Yes, I venture to say that is true. We are paying a price for having staged a general strike." PSOE's Rightist Tilt As usual, the government's current policy rated harsh comments by the UGT leader, but this time, citing the outcome of the party's recently concluded 33d congress, he criticized the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] directly. "The party is now tilting toward the right," he said. Without voicing judgment of this situation, Redondo nevertheless pointed out that the party congress served to confirm what was already known: that the PSOE in its majority supports the government's policy, and that neolaissez-faire has now asserted itself as a doctrine among the rank and file of Spanish socialism. His summation of the PSOE congress was: "Pedro Solbes walked away with it." In any case, said Redondo, "I am not going to resign from the PSOE. I am still unbelievably credulous, and willing to believe that something will change." He also expressed his confidence in the role of the left in general: "There is an official institutionalized left, and a real left. But with time, I believe that a coherent left can emerge. Why not?" Yesterday's meeting with the press also ranged to discussion of other burning issues, such as the PSV crisis and the forthcoming UGT congress, at which Nicolas Redondo will be leaving the position he has occupied as general secretary for the past 17 years. In his farewell remarks yesterday, the UGT leader acknowledged that those "morally" responsible for the PSV's setback are the union leaders and, of course, the management of the IGS [expansion unknown]-PSV. "The government is not in any way responsible," he said, adding, however, that neither had the government been very helpful. Nevertheless, Redondo concluded, the cooperativists need not be overly concerned if the following steps are followed: presentation of the cooperative's viability plan that is being worked out by the IGS, to the administrators appointed by the government; if agreement is reached, granting of a credit line of 8 billion pesetas guaranteed by the IGS's assets; and lastly, building of the housing units over a period of four years. The Succession His successor clearly will be Candido Mendez. The general secretary added nothing new to what has already been disclosed as regards the makeup of the new leadership. Mendez is the candidate who best meets the requisite conditions for creating a consensus at the April congress. Redondo asserts that it is for this reason that he personally selected Mendez. Mendez's plan, which features the strengthening of the federations within the organization, "is our plan," and Redondo thinks that it is also the plan of the other candidate in the running, Manuel Fernandez "Lito." Yesterday, Candido Mendez took a giant step toward ensuring that he will have the backing of the majority at the UGT congress. Its certainty now appears irreversible. The FSP [Public Services Federation], the largest of the UGT federations, announced its preference for Mendez's candidacy yesterday. The FSP's special congress also decided to support the continued incumbency of the UGT's present Executive Committee.
