This is seen concretely in the exchange of visits by delegations at various levels, the mutual visits by our peoples, and the solution of various problems between our countries with a sense of sincerity and mutual understanding, for instance the speedy demarcation of the common border between Laos and Myanmar that recently concluded with great success within a short period of time. We are very pleased to see that thanks to the persistent pursuance of its policy and the effective administration of the country by SLORC chaired by Your Excellency, the Union of Myanmar has become more stable every passing day.

With rapid steps in socioeconomic development, the material and moral life of the people of Myanmar has now clearly improved. Myanmar's status and role in the international arena has also been consolidated and its cooperation with other countries broadened. I would to take this auspicious opportunity to wish the fraternal people of Myanmar new and greater achievements in defending your national independence, unity, and stability so that you will be able to build their country into a wealthy, strong, and prosperous entity. Respected Your Excellency the chairman, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, we the Lao people, have actively carried out national development and construction in accordance with our policy of comprehensive restructuring. We have made certain initial important achievements in this endeavor. Our country has now attained peace and stability. Our socioeconomic development has made continuous progress. Our country's potential in various fields have been comprehensively exploited. With the consolidated use of our inner strength and in coordination with the [words indistinct] foreign investment and international assistance and cooperation, the material and cultural life of our multiethnic people has been gradually upgraded. Nonetheless, we have not yet been freed from under development. Therefore, the Lao Government and people regard national construction and development as our important tasks aimed at improving the well-being of our people and making our country prosperous. To achieve the aforementioned esteemed goals, in addition to mobilizing every consolidated potential of our nation, we also regard the creation of favorable external conditions as an important issue. That is why the LPDR has pursued the foreign policy of peace, independence, (?friendship), and cooperation with all countries regardless of the differences in our political systems and on the basis of the five-point principle of peaceful coexistence. We continue to consistently pursue the policy of building good relations and promoting cooperation for mutual benefit with neighboring countries, thereby contributing to enhancing peace, stability, friendship, and cooperation for development in this region. As for the Union of Myanmar, we can see our two countries possess many similar potential and special characteristics. The two sides should consult and exchange views to look for better and more effective forms and methods of cooperation at various levels. We hope that the visit by Your Excellency the chairman and your wife and delegation will open a new era for strengthening, deepening, and broadening the relations and cooperation between our two countries, thus making the friendship and brotherly affection between the peoples of Laos and Myanmar (?grow even stronger).
