Speaking at a news conference in Budapest at the end of his visit to Hungary yesterday, Stoiber said the eastward expansion of the EU is of fundamental importance. On this issue he is in "relatively close agreement" with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who also spoke of a special relationship with the Visegrad countries. As a result in particular of the wave of migration from East Europe, the increase in organized crime, and a common asylum policy, these states should already have a place at the table of the Twelve, or eventually the Sixteen. Stoiber arrived in Budapest with a delegation of leading Bavarian economic representatives yesterday morning. He conferred with Prime Minister Peter Boross, Defense Minister Lajos Fur, and Finance Minister Ivan Szabo. He also met with President Arpad Goncz and with Gabor Kuncze, the Alliance of Free Democrats candidate for the post of prime minister.
