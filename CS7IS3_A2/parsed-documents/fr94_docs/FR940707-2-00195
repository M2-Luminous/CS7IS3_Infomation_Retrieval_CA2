FR940707-2-00195 FR940707-2-00100 [Release No. 34&hyph;34276; File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;8] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to Amendments to Its Listing Fee Schedule for Listed Companies June 29, 1994. On March 8, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19 8b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend its original listing fee, processing and fee and annual maintenance fee. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;2 (1994). The proposed rule change was notified in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33928 (April 19, 1994), 59 FR 21793 (April 26, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. The PSE is amending its fees for listed companies. Specifically, the Exchange is increasing its original listing fee for the common stock of exclusively listed companies from $10,000 to $20,000. In addition, the Exchange is increasing its initial processing fee, applicable to all original listing applications, from $250 to $500. Finally, the Exchange is increasing its annual maintenance fee for exclusively listed companies from $1,000 to $2,000. Dually listed equity securities would continue to be charged $10,000 for original listings, and $1,000 for the annual maintenance fee (for one issue). 3 3 The Exchange stated that for the purposes of this amendment, an equity security is dually listed if it is listed on both the PSE and either the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') or the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). An equity security is exclusively listed for purposes of this amendment if it is listed on the PSE and not on either the NYSE or the Amex. The Exchange states that the fee increases are designed to offset rising costs associated with maintaining listing services and related overhead expenses. 4 4 The Complete schedule of fee changes is contained in Exhibit A to File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;8. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, with the requirements of Section 6 of the Act. 5 More specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act which requires that the rules of an exchange assure the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among members, issuers, and other persons using its facilities. The Commission notes that an increase in the PSE's listing fees was last approved in 1991. 6 Moreover, the current increases do not place an excessive allocation of Exchange fees on its issuers as opposed to members and other persons using its facilities. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to approve the proposed rule change. 5 15 U.S.C. 78f (1988). 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29882 (October 29, 1991), 56 FR 57028 (October 29, 1991) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;91&hyph;29). The Commission believes that it is appropriate for the Exchange to charge greater original listing fees for exclusive listings as opposed to dual listings due to the additional costs incident to maintaining exclusive listings. For example, with respect to exclusively listed companies, the Exchange may incur additional costs for, among other things, monitoring the company for corporate developments. The Commission further finds that the fees are reasonable because the Exchange has proposed the increases to offset rising costs associated with maintaining listing services and related overhead expenses. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to approve the proposed rule change. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 7 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;8) is approved. 7 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 8 8 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1994). Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary.
