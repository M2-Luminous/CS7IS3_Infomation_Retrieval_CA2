He said that the idea of taking urgent additional measures to combat organized crime had been initiated by the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS), and that the Interior Ministry had insisted that it be documented in a decree, not in a law. He also said that in the middle of June, FCS Director-General Sergey Stepashin sent a letter to President Yeltsin urging him to draft a law on amending and enlarging the Criminal Code and submitting it to the State Duma. Concurrently, the idea was proposed of passing a decree on measures to step up the campaign against organized crime. The source maintains that the decree provided for measures which did not go beyond the president's constitutional powers. Other measures were to be implemented after the parliament adopted the draft law submitted by the president. In actual fact, another version, proposed by Interior Minister Viktor Yerin and by his first deputy Mikhail Yegorov, was adopted. In a slightly softened form, this version was used as the foundation for the presidential decree. The source said that the draft decree had been signed by the FCS's First Deputy Director-General Anatoliy Safonov, not by Stepashin who left for the Far East on June 13.
