A military budget to be discussed in its second reading at the State Duma hearings on Wednesday may become the last one for the army and navy, he stated. Osadchiy said deputies in State Duma factions and committees are being intensively coached and calculations by Sergey Glazyev, who found additional sources of revenue to finance defence spending, are being severely criticised. General Osadchiy believes that Tuesday's press conference of Petr Shirshov, chairman of the Federation Council committee on security and defence, is to demonstrate the Federation Council's stand once again. The Council declared for an increase in military expenditure, taking into account both inflation and an utter necessity to buy hardware and arms, pay money allowance to servicemen, and cater for soldiers and seamen. If the State Duma on Wednesday fails to heed the Federation Council's recommendations, this military budget may become the last one for the armed forces, for they would not be able to exist as one of major elements of Russian statehood without a minimally sufficient and steady financing, General Osadchiy said.
