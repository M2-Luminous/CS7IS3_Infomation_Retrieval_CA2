The party was founded by Stjepan Mesic and Josip Manolic. [passage omitted] Before the founding assembly, Mesic and Manolic sent an open letter to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman which was, surprisingly, published in Croatian newspapers. In the letter, Mesic and Manolic present their opinion about President Tudjman and his policy, and that opinion is the worst possible. Mesic and Manolic write: Mr. President, you rule as a dictator, leading the country to a catastrophe. After our warnings you call us putschists. Let me remind you that the Hungarian Democratic Community [HDZ] accused Mesic and Manolic of preparing a coup while President Tudjman was in Washington. In their letter, Mesic and Manolic respond: We do not want to bring down the state but, Mr. President, we are against your disastrous policy both in Bosnia and in Croatia. According to Mesic and Manolic, all decisions in Croatia are made by one man and consequently the state president has to answer the following questions: Who is responsible for the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly the war with the Muslims? Who sent the Croatian army to Bosnia only to deny its presence there? Its involvement in Bosnia has been confirmed by numerous coffins returning to Croatia, Mesic and Manolic say. [passage omitted]
