He linked the decision to continue to grant China most-favored-nation [MFN] status to an unambiguous message: Henceforth, the most powerful man in the world will no longer make favorable trade conditions dependent on human rights. This change of position is based on opportunism to a large degree; nevertheless it is reasonable. After all, the President has to put up accusations that he has broken his word. The Chinese rulers do not take human rights more seriously now than they did a year ago, although this is exactly what Clinton had demanded as a condition for continued free trade. Now, the White House has clarified the issue once and for all. It was the only possibility for Clinton to avoid having to deal with the tiresome Chinese problem year after year. The decision is the result of practical interests. To gain the support of the U.S. public, which is sensitive as far as human rights questions are concerned, Clinton was unusually explicit about the advantages. U.S. exporters now cannot only expand their position at the largest regional future market, but even consumers at home will continue to benefit form inexpensive Chinese goods. Moreover, the Americans need China to keep North Korea in check. After all, from the other industrialized nations no support for sanctions was to be expected -- officials in Bonn, Paris, and Tokyo would have secretly even been happy about the weakening of the U.S. competitors. One example: At the moment, Daimler-Benz and Chrysler are vying for a license to construct minivans in China; Clinton's tough position would have threatened the chances of the car manufacturers from Detroit. Uncle Sam is no longer strong enough to be able to simply ignore -- as sometimes during the Cold War -- that his partners were shamelessly taking advantage of such opportunities instead of backing the U.S. course. Finally, Clinton also had to consider the suspicion of other Asian countries that have accused Washington of cultural imperialism. Recently Britain experienced how sensitive dealings with the new economic powers in the Far East have meanwhile become: As a result of corruption accusations in the English press, Malaysia excluded British enterprises from public orders -- a short time ago Britain's trade minister left for Kuala Lumpur with an offer for reconciliation. So much for plain pragmatism, but Clinton's step was correct even under more principled criteria. Trade not only increases prosperity, it also exerts a pressure for liberalization -- particularly in view of the rising internationalization of the economy. Although this thesis is regarded as vague by many, and as hope based on an ideology that is geared toward the economy, in most cases it is, after all, true: Once the material basic needs are fulfilled, and it is possible to achieve modest prosperity, the people will press for political freedom. In the long run, economic progress will undermine the foundations of dictatorial rule. This is why, without being cynical, one can follow the motto: "If in doubt, opt for free trade." Yet, those who support this position must also think of the consequences. Although China is not the only country in Asia that infringes systematically on human rights, the faults of the regime in Beijing are certainly grave; and nothing is likely to change in the short term, either. Therefore, it has nothing to do with cultural imperialism when the West criticizes oppression in Tibet and the arrest of dissidents. Clinton saw himself even forced to admit that one could not even prevent the import of goods produced by forced labor. Yet, the United States' decision and the attitude of the other industrialized nations also illustrate the yardstick for future sanctions. In similar cases, moral arguments for trade barriers will no longer be acceptable, even if political interests and election dates would suggest that it is advisable to isolate certain states from trade by pointing to human rights. Those who opt for free trade with China can hardly maintain sanctions against Cuba. The outrage of Western politicians about working conditions in threshold countries that are unworthy of man also become implausible. The United States, for example, has strongly criticized the lack of social standards in Malaysia and Indonesia. To pretend that one is worried about the labor rights in such cases, while importing products of forced labor from China, is hypocritical. The important point here is protectionism -- closing the market for one's own advantage. Of course, there will always be exceptions. When it is necessary to stop ethnically motivated crimes as in the former Yugoslavia or to isolate the former apartheid regime in South Africa, then sanctions will undoubtedly be legitimate. With the exception of South Africa, the FRG almost always rejected trade sanctions. Although this was done out of German economic interests, the position of the government in Bonn has also been politically worthwhile, as can be seen by the example of the former East Bloc. Therefore, the Germans, in particular, must be careful when political opportunism -- different to the case of China -- will call for trade sanctions. Bill Clinton's change of policy would have a liberating effect if it were to make such double moral standards more difficult in the future.
