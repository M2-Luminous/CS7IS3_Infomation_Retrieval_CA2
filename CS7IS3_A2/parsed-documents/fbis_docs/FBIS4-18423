"I would characterize the losses as insignificant," Professor Trond Bjorndal of the School of Advanced Economic Studies in Bergen said. Bjorndal was presenting a brand-new study commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Some parts of the industrial and commercial sector in Norway feared the worst when Norway decided to resume commercial minke whaling last year. The report concludes, however, that only ripple effects have been registered from the boycott actions in Great Britain, Germany, and the United States. The report researchers were not able to measure any losses for Norwegian businesses in other markets. Worst in Germany The figures of lost sales presented yesterday in Oslo are in stark contrast to the claims of the environmental organization Greenpeace that said that Norwegian business last year lost NKr450 million in canceled contracts because of whaling. The environmental activists were the most successful in harming Norwegian exporters in Germany. Presumed losses have been registered by seven Norwegian exporting companies, two of which were fish exporters. A number of other businesses reported canceled contracts, but according to Bjorndal this was compensated for by the businesses finding other buyers for their products. All in all Norwegian businesses had a sales loss of NKr10.7 million on the German market. With an adjustment for nonincurred production expenses the businesses wound up with a reduced profit of between NKr2.7 and NKr4.4 million. "We think this is the correct way to gauge the losses to Norwegian industry. It is pointless to attach numbers to canceled contracts," Prof. Bjorndal stressed. Increased Export In Great Britain the losses to Norwegian firms are estimated at between 2.7 and NKr4.4 million. In the United States there do not appear to have been any losses as a result of antiwhaling actions, but three firms did have extra expenses for warehousing, legal aid, and information campaigns to the tune of NKr700,000. Bjorndal pointed out that during the same period Norwegian business and industry generally made much progress in the very markets where Greenpeace and other environmental groups had urged a boycott of Norway. Fish exports to Great Britain and Germany increased by 11 and 4.6 percent respectively, compared with the preceding year. At the same time there was a strong increase in German tourist traffic in Norway, while British tourism in Norway stagnated. But the reduced size of British tourist traffic to Norway in 1993 was much lower than the overall reduction in British travel abroad. While the number of British guest days in Norway declined by 3.9 percent, the overall reduction in British travel abroad was about 12 percent. "The preliminary figures for influx of tourists last year show that the strong skepticism voiced by the exporting sector regarding Norwegian whaling were not well founded in reality," Prof. Bjorndal said. [Box, p 4] Whaling 1993 - Norwegian whalers shot 226 whales last year for an initial value of NKr13.2 million. - Twenty-eight vessels participated in the traditional whaling; four vessels did research whaling. - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spent NKr11.5 million on special information campaigns abroad. - Training of inspectors for the whaling vessels cost NKr2.5 million. - If the harvest of minke whales increases to 1,700-1,800 animals, the activity will have a market potential of NKr250 million.
