The UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) "can from Wednesday morning deploy 100 soldiers in the part of the town situated on the left bank of the Drina" river, Karadzic announced. The authorisation came as part of a third ceasefire the Serb leader has negotiated with UN representatives in as many days. The details of the agreement remain to be discussed with the United Nations special envoy to the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi, the radio quoted him as saying. Akashi has come under criticism from Bosnian Moslems after holding fruitless talks with Karadzic Sunday as Serb tanks poured into Gorazde, giving the Serbs virtual control of the town. Karadzic said Wednesday that UN soldiers would be allowed to "protect the civilian population but not the Bosnian Army," Serb radio reported. "The aim of the Serb counter-offensive is not to take the town but only the right bank of the Drina which belongs to the Serbs," the Serb leader added. But relations between the Serbs and the military wing of the UN mission in Bosnia would remain suspended "because of the active role it is playing in the civil war." Reponsibility for the fighting around Gorazde rests with the United Nations, as "it has not disarmed the Moslem (Bosnian) army in a region that was supposed to be demilitarised," Karadzic argued. The radio made no mention of the release by Bosnian Serb forces Tuesday of six out of eight teams of UN military observers that they had detained last week in retaliation for NATO airstrikes around Gorazde. The teams, comprising three to five people, were reported by the UN Tuesday to have been been freed.
