According to the calculation, the producer rice price averaged 17,700 yen per 60 kilograms from 1986 to 1988, more than 10 times higher than the price of Thai rice, the cheapest on the international rice markets. Under the agreement signed in mid-April by a ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Marrakech, Morocco, Japan will open 4 percent of its long-closed rice market to imports under a "minimum access" formula with the rate increasing each year until it reaches 8 percent. After a six-year grace period, Japan will have to convert all rice import restrictions into tariffs. Under such conditions, the government should slash its purchase price of domestic rice by 18 percent and that of wheat by 16 percent from current levels by the year 2000 to make domestic production competitive on the international markets, according to the government calculation. Base on the calculation, the government plans to gradually reduce producer prices of rice and wheat from this year. Under the staple food system, the government buys much of the rice crop at a set price and resells it at lower prices to consumers by subsidizing the price gap.
