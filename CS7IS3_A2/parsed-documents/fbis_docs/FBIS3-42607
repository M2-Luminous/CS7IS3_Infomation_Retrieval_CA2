Gaydar, first deputy chairman of the Government of Russia, by Tatyana Korostikova; place and date not given: "What Will They Berate the Authorities For in the New Year: Ye. Gaydar's Departure Facilitated an Abrupt Fall of the Exchange Rate of the Ruble"] [Text] This was the last interview which Ye. Gaydar gave to ARGUMENTY I FAKTY before resigning from the position of first deputy prime minister. However, he has not given up his reformist plans, which he intends to implement in the position of chairman of the Russia's Choice faction in the State Duma. [Korostikova] What will Russians have to go through in 1994? [Gaydar] The perception of an ordinary person is always much more critically disposed toward what is happening than a detached, remote historical assessment. This is why events should not be measured by whether they will praise or berate the authorities (of course, it will be the latter), but rather what they will berate the authorities for. If they berate the authorities for: --prices still growing, although the rate of inflation has dropped; --there being goods in the stores, but us being nowhere close to Warsaw yet, to say nothing of Brussels; --the problem of employment becoming more acute; --having to restructure production and master new products with some difficulty; --the peasants having difficulty selling their products because of growing competition, this will mean that the authorities are moving in the right direction. If they berate the authorities for: --there being no goods at any price; --money being worthless again; --the ruble once again depreciating quickly against the dollar; --not being able to save money in rubles and having to convert the money into dollars; --the above being impossible to do because strict procedures for currency operations have been introduced; --no one filling state requisitions, despite their reintroduction, this will mean that the authorities are advancing along a dangerous path. In December we had a 12-percent inflation rate (the target was 5-7 percent by the end of the year). This is why the inflation control measures we have planned for 1994 do not appear explosive to me. To be sure, we will have to pay for such a monetary policy by a harsher reduction in the output of uncompetitive products, but no unthinkable growth of unemployment is expected, at least not in 1994. Unemployment will increase gradually. Here is the experience of Estonia and Latvia: at present, prices are growing there at the rate of less than 1 percent per month, whereas unemployment does not go into dozens of percentage points; it is the same as here. [Korostikova] Yegor Timurovich, you are talking about everything as if the Duma will not restrict the reformers in anything. Compared to the Duma, the old parliament might seem a cherished dream. [Gaydar] No, the old parliament was no cherished dream. I will remind you that in September we had a harsh conflict between the parliament and the president; everything was moving toward a political crisis. All edicts of the president were immediately canceled. There was no budget for the fourth quarter. A power vacuum emerged in the regions because all the decisions of the center were torpedoed by the other branch of power. In general, the power structure in Russia was paralyzed. [Korostikova] Indeed, but at the time you had the use-of-force scenario to fall back on, and now you do not. [Gaydar] There is the constitution instead, which establishes the natural framework for the separation of powers, which previously was not the case. Of course, we (Russia's Choice) are a minority in the parliament; however, with the help of the president's veto we will be able to block the adoption of the most irresponsible decisions that pose a danger to the country. [Korostikova] What is the threat to Russian consumers from new customs tariffs on imports? There was panic in Moscow before New Year's day; they swept away even the most expensive merchandise sold for foreign exchange. [Gaydar] The adoption of new import tariffs has been postponed until March. The tariffs need additional work. New import duties should restrict imports we do not need, but they should not be prohibitive in nature. [Korostikova] Will they restrict imports of foodstuffs, too? [Gaydar] Why should we, unlike all other countries of the world, fail to protect our own agriculture? The issue is different: To what extent should these duties be introduced, and at what levels? The position of the agrarians, headed by Zaveryukha, is: make the tariffs prohibitive, so that they will teach everyone a lesson about importing anything at all to our country. A majority of other ministries and departments advocate a different point of view: tariffs should be made normal, that is, presupposing a certain revenue for the budget and elementary protections for domestic agricultural production, but by no means prohibitive. No matter what import duties are adopted, they will not apply to goods from CIS countries. We have signed free trade treaties with them. This means an enormous amount of foodstuffs. [Korostikova] Will there be any assistance for the producers of goods that are needed? [Gaydar] Several substantial preferences for them are found in the Edict on Taxation which was recently signed by the president. For example, if a small enterprise engages in a priority type of activity, its profit tax will be reduced. Tax relief will be provided for the profits of banks from long-term credit extended for investment purposes. Restructuring of the system of state support for the investment activities of enterprises is planned. Money will not be given for nothing to those who have managed to get through to the necessary office, but rather to support promising projects through either credit guarantees, stock purchases, or supplemental state financing, in addition to internal and private investment, and so on. The Ministry of the Economy has already developed such a concept.
