This is the gist of a document drafted by the Foreign Ministry's Policy Planning Division on relations between the two countries. The threat of U.S. pressure has always hovered over Israel's head; however, according to the document, which is classified as secret, this threat has been withdrawn because of the breakthrough in the peace talks. Washington considers Israel an ally. The most important piece of news regards the annual U.S. aid, to the tune of $3 billion. Until about a year ago, there was talk of a certain gradual reduction in U.S. foreign aid. The Policy Planning Division believes that the United States has no intention of cutting foreign aid to Israel. The division even goes as far as stating that "there is a promise that if Israel becomes more vulnerable, the United States will agree to give (Israel) more aid and more access to technology." It may be assumed, therefore, that the scope of the foreign aid Israel receives will only be changed in one of two instances: If the Israeli Government halts the political process, the aid will be cut. If, on the other hand, it should decide to "take additional risks" -- a euphemism for a withdrawal from the Golan Heights -- the United States may increase the aid. And yet, one aspect of the Foreign Ministry document casts a shadow on Israeli-U.S. relations. It has to do with the U.S. secretary of state's determination to promote the peace talks with Syria. These remarks, worded very vaguely, caused a slight shock in Jerusalem and in the Israeli Embassy in Washington. The embassy decided to react, because Itamar Rabinovich is not only the ambassador but he also heads the Israeli team on the talks with Syria. A week ago, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres received a classified telegram from Rabinovich, written after a consultation was held at the embassy. Some of the senior embassy political staff claimed that the Planning Division document was politically inspired by Foreign Ministry officials. The embassy agrees that the U.S. Administration does not attribute the same degree of importance to foreign policy as did previous administrations. The debate is about whether Christopher is doing enough. The document makes one feel that Planning Division personnel are not convinced that the Americans can be trusted to use the momentum in order to bring about a breakthrough in the negotiations with Syria. The Washington embassy discussion ended with different conclusions. It is true that the negotiations with Syria are stuck and that things will move slower than expected, but the embassy does not believe that this delay poses a threat to the entire process. The ambassador's report to his political staff indicates that there never was a situation in which the American peace team was not attentive or ready to take action to promote peace. Embassy staffers claim that the ball is indeed in the Syrian court. This is the stage at which al-Asad is called upon to come up with better answers for Israel. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with the secretary of state delaying his visit as long as al-Asad is not delivering the goods. Washington has discerned signals of distress in Syria -- for example, in the Syrian media attacks on Israel last week. Syria is concerned about the progress in the process with the Palestinians and the developments between Israel and Jordan. Christopher's delayed Middle East visit made al-Asad feel pressured. If Israel also pushes Christopher, the embassy said, it will be asking for pressure in return. [passage omitted]
