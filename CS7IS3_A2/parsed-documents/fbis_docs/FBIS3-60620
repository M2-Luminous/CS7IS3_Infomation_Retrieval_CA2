It is known to be a growing possibility that the U.S. Government will make the "negative conclusion" because the dominating opinion is that although the North's proposal delivered through the nonofficial contact in New York shows partial progress, the North's condition of accepting limited inspection [chehanjok sachal] on its nuclear facilities is not acceptable. It is anticipated that the U.S. Government will eventually notify North Korea of the refusal and repeat its demand for the inspection of two undeclared facilities, which North Korea is obstinately refusing. According to a U.S. Government source on 6 December, it is known that the message will be conveyed to North Korea during the contact in New York on 6 or 7 December, after approval by President Bill Clinton. The source says the U.S. new proposal suggests that if North Korea accepts inspection of two undeclared facilities, the date for the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks may be confirmed.
