"We told the Russian authorities before the use of this air support," Butrus-Ghali told a press conference held jointly with Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. He explained why he had not revealed this earlier by saying: "I only received this information recently." Moscow protested vehemently following Sunday and Monday's air strikes near the besieged eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave that they had not been informed before they were launched. Western leaders subsequently said no government had been told before the strikes were launched, because they needed to be carried out urgently, and insisted that the order to launch them had been taken under a previously-agreed system. Butrus-Ghali, who arrived here Wednesday for an official three-day visit, again defended the UN decision to call for North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air strikes, saying he would do so again if necessary. "We will not hesitate to call on NATO to protect UN forces if they are in danger," he said, speaking in French. "It is a very clear warning to all those in former Yugoslavia who try to oppose the actions of UN forces." He reiterated that UN Security Council Resolution 836 allowed him to call for air action, and said that the Russian Federation had accepted the resolution.
