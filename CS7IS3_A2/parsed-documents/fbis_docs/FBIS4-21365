The creation of this party was justified by the fact that the Hungarian Green Party kept drifting to the right and, therefore, the environmental and nature protection movements in Hungary distanced themselves from this party. The fact that the Federation of European Green Parties accepted the ZA among its members represents an appreciation for the party's activity so far. We interviewed Erzsebet Schmuck, cochairman of the ZA. Bodnar: What is the goal of your party? Schmuck: Our main goal is to send an adequate number of deputies into Parliament and, later, also to the self-government bodies. It is extremely important to create a so-called green control at all legislative levels. Unfortunately, the cause of environmental protection has been forced into the background as against various interests in the past four years, in spite of the fact that, earlier, the current parliamentary parties promised something else. It is perhaps sufficient to mention the fact that a new and modern environmental protection law has not been submitted to Parliament to this very day; the obsolete law legislated in 1976 is still valid in Hungary. Bodnar: Would you give some details about your program? Schmuck: We have a comprehensive and complex program, one that does not only aim at solving environmental problems in the narrow sense of the word, but it also covers all areas of economic and social life. For example, the fact that we are also dealing with social issues is automatically connected with the fact that the roots of environmental problems are to be found in the economy itself and in the people's lifestyle and customs. Our party is striving to discover and treat the causes, rather than carry out symptomatic treatment. The basic principle of our program is to recreate a harmony between man and nature. The present and future key issue is how we can coordinate the economic and ecological interests. An increasing number of people and politicians find this need, because the exploitation of natural resources is so widespread today that is could actually become a factor hindering economic development. The serious recession all over the world and the serious economic problems today can also be traced to this circle of problems. Bodnar: Many people regard your ideas as a utopia.... Schmuck: People should read our program published in the Election Bulletin. Many people called us up recently and told us that the public indeed formed the opinion about the ZA that we were following a utopia but, after reading our program, they support us because, in their opinion, our ideas are realistic and offer a solution that would make survival possible, namely to slowly find the way out of the crisis, to build an environment-friendly economy and society. We think that the seriousness of this problem will force everyone to move in this direction. I am convinced that our program is realistic and even viable. Bodnar: How do you explain the fact that, contrary to Western Europe, the greens failed to make themselves properly known in Hungary? Schmuck: This is not quite true, because a lot of deputies got into Parliament via the Danube-movement. It is a fact, however, that, since the change in the regime, the various environmental protection movements have not been able to strengthen to the extent desired by this serious problem. This is also connected to the fact that, contrary to the promises, the civil organizations did not get the support and infrastructural background needed for their operation. No matter how many volunteers there are in the environmental protection movements, they still need minimal conditions necessary for their activity, and they lack these conditions. For example, only a few Hungarian environmental protection movements have an office to work from. This is a serious problem. Bodnar: Which parliamentary party is close to you? Schmuck: Our relations with the parliamentary parties is proportional with their treatment of the environmental issues. The ZA is a party free of ideology. We have values close to the left, the liberals, and the conservatives. At the same time, there are trends in all these three directions that we reject. We are moving in a fourth axis, and we do not belong to any main stream. Bodnar: What election results do you count on? Schmuck: I would like to mention the fact that most non-parliamentary parties have very little chance of reaching the 5-percent threshold because they lack financial resources. However, we will definitely be able to come up with a national list. I would also like to mention the fact that Karoly Javor, a parliamentary deputy of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], will run in the elections as an independent representing the ZA. We know that our chances are minimal, but we hope we will obtain more than 1 percent of the votes. Our making it into parliament depends on the extent to which the citizens vote for a so-called green future.
