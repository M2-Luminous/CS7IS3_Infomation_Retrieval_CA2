[passage omitted] The American and British representatives said the Serbs should give back part of the occupied territories. As for France, the efforts of the alliance might be salutary and make us forget last week's errors of judgement: [Begin Juppe recording] A mistake was made in Gorazde. The operation launched by the Serbs was underrated -- it was an operation of aggression -- while all the conditions were met for us to strike quickly and hard. The reaction came late and in small doses. So it is necessary to draw lessons from this for the future. By Wednesday [27 April], the Serbs must withdraw by 20 km in Gorazde. We shall be extremely vigilant. This also means that should there be the smallest attack on the other safe areas, what tragically took place in Gorazde must not be repeated; that is, we must not procrastinate, we must react quickly and resolutely.
