Huge pictures are hung everywhere in the streets of the capital city. The time has arrived again for Hungarians to choose. The Hungarian general elections, which occur every four years, begin on May 8. Of the more than 90 parties across the country, 15 are eligible to take part in the campaign. The exhausted party leaders are shuttling from city to city, from metropolis to countryside, shaking hands, smiling, making speeches and criticizing their opponents. Everyone in this country is waiting for the time to vote, and for the election results. In these elections, voters will choose 386 new representatives to form the new National Assembly. Those parties with five percent of the vote will have representatives in the Assembly. The two or three parties with the most representatives will form the government; the others will be opposition members. In the 1990 elections, the Democratic Forum party received the most votes. It allied with the Small Holder's Party and the popular Christian Democratic [People's] Party and formed a cabinet. The Alliance of Free Democrats, the Socialist Party and the Federation of Young Democrats become opposition parties. However, in the past four years great changes have taken place. Opinion polls from the end of last year until now show that the Socialist Party is the favorite, followed by the Alliance of Free Democrats, the Federation of Young Democrats, the Democratic Forum, the Small Holder's Party and the popular Christian Democratic [People's] Party. The ruling parties are losing their dominance, while the opposition parties are gaining. The opposition Socialist Party, according to the polls, could win as much as 25 percent of the vote. Why have such changes occurred? it is widely believed that the change is happening because the ruling parties have not devoted their energies to economic development. The country's economy declines every year, budget deficits rise, the jobless rate increases, and inflation remains high while fraud occurs in the process of privatization. This has all been pointed out by the opposition parties, who conclude that "the present economic situation is worse than 1990". The most recent opinion poll found that only one percent of the people surveyed believe the government has done "very well", 27 percent say "good", 34 percent say "poor", 21 percent say "very poor" and 17 percent say they don't know. But the ruling parties insist that they have done quite well, and that the country has been the most stable in Eastern Europe over the past four years. The government has achieved progress in economic reform, and the country has gained more foreign investment than any other in Eastern Europe. Yes, they say, the government has made some mistakes, but they have been corrected in time. Peter Boross, Hungarian prime minister, believes he should be prime minister for another four years. He strongly opposes the Socialist Party assuming power, and rules out an alliance with the Alliance of Free Democrats. Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, responding to both domestic and foreign fears and speculations, affirmed repeatedly that Hungary will not change its policies after the election. However, it is believed that changes will be made in diplomatic policy and the administrative program after the election, though no party will change the multi-party parliamentary system, privatization or the market economy. Such changes, if they were to occur, would send shock waves through the country, and no doubt in all of Eastern Europe. So the Hungarian people face a choice with great significance.
