A source in the president's entourage says that the president keeps his plans to himself because he thinks that the probability of an electoral success for those parties is merely theoretical. The source told INTERFAX that parties that had recently advocated integration into Romania tried to win electoral support in the runup to the election by saying they wanted Moldova to stay independent. The source also said that the president intended to hold a poll on 6 March so as to determine what the country's residents were thinking of its independence. The president is sure that the 27 February elections and the poll will confirm that his independence course is supported by the population. Even though the poll results would not be legally binding, Snegur did not doubt that they would endorse "a policy of true independence" to be pursued by the president and the new parliament. The president hopes that the elections will return a solid majority of centrist-minded deputies who will work with him in a coordinated and constructive way. Indeed, sociological polls taken in Moldova recently forecast that over 30 percent of seats in parliament will be won by the Agrarian Democratic Party (ADP) which will be followed by socialists and social-democrats. The ADP leaders Petru Lucinskiy, Andrey Sangheli and Dumitru Motpan will offer the two other parties an alliance in parliament. According to the source, Snegur is in a good position to discuss the status of Transdniestria with the leaders of that area. Snegur has recently received a letter from Russian President Boris Yeltsin, saying that Russia is prepared to continue to act as a mediator in negotiating a settlement. The Moldovan authorities are prepared to discuss with Transdniestria a number of compromise options leading to solution of problems on which the two sides differ. "Transdniestria could enjoy maximal self-government, going as far as legislative autonomy, while staying in the Republic of Moldova as its integral part," Snegur believes. Meanwhile, scores of people from the left bank of the Dniester (the self-proclaimed Transdniestrian Moldovan Republic -- IF) have arrived in electoral stations set up for them. (The Central Election Commission had decided that residents of Transdniestria could vote from 21 February to 27 February -- IF). Victor Puscasu, Deputy Chairman of the Moldovan parliament told INTERFAX that an exception was made for the residents of Transdniestria so that they "express their views independently of the Tiraspol leaders." He said that they would be allowed to vote even if they did not have a mark in their passport saying that they were Moldovan citizens. Officials of the Central Election Commission say that hundreds of Transdniestrians have voted on 21 February. The elections are reported to run into difficulties, however. Voting ballots were still unavailable in some voting stations and Transdniestrian guardsmen who patrol bridges over the Dniester harass the voters. Activists of some parties are said to tell the voters approaching the voting stations who to vote for. They abuse their right to continue campaigning. Snegur's headquarters are engulfed by telegrams from the south of Moldova. A source in the president's entourage told Interfax they protest the ban on opening electoral stations in areas where Gagauzi reside, effectively barring over 100,000 people from voting. Snegur has reportedly decreed that voting stations be opened there.
