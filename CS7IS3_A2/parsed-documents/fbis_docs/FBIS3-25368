I think the first aim that we in the government are following is to stop the massacres so that all Burundians can feel safe. Afterward, we will see. [Mas] Nevertheless the result of opening up is that Uprona [Unity for National Progress], the former sole party, has got what would elsewhere be called the Ministry of the Interior--in other words, questions of internal security--and, furthermore, we are seeing the entry of people who were behind the recent bloody events in Bujumbura. Some people are talking of capitulation by the Frodebu [Burundi Democratic Front], the party in power. [Ngendahayo] Uprona hasn't got the interior portfolio. There is a minister of the interior in the government team. What it is is territorial administration. That is a nuance that should be added. Then there has not been any capitulation. Rather we have opened up as was necessary, in a strategic move, to enable there to be an all round relaxation of tension. If for the safety of our citizens we have to deal even with parties who have no representation at all in the National Assembly, but with whom, for everyone's safety, we have to discuss and cooperate, why not? We are quite open to discussion and to power sharing, if it is for the good of the country and its citizens. [Mas] What weight did the Army have in this choice? In this opening up? [Ngendahayo] Officially, the Army did not play any role. Now, at the level of realpolitik there are certainly negotiations going on in this same direction, because you have to face up to reality: if there have been problems in Burundi, it started on the night of 20 to 21 October, and everything started off at certain military camps. So we are bearing all these parameters in mind. [Mas] The night of 20 to 21 was the night of the attempted coup, which led to the death of the elected president, Melchior Ndadaye. In the end this coup seems to have benefited certain members of Burundi political circles? [Ngendahayo] After the death of the head of state, and after the death of some very highly placed state officials, we had to reconstruct the government, which had completely collapsed. To emerge from our places of hiding, we had to have discussions with our political partners, who had not suffered reprisals, and to try now to find a new way of governing the country, bearing in mind all the problems we have just experienced. This is why you are seeing a repetition of what President Ndadaye, in his great magnanimity, did, and what we are doing in our great sense of realism. [Mas] In specific terms, what might the program of this new government be? [Ngendahayo] I think there is basically to be a continuation of the program that arose from the June elections. This cannot be refused, and, more importantly, it is inevitable. But at first, before reaching the point where this program can be followed, there has to be a period where we will work first of all to restore peace, to restore trust between citizens, and for national reconstruction. These are extremely important things. And in this context we have to bring back the refugees, numbering nearly 1,000,000, who have swarmed into Rwanda, and who are in Zaire and in Tanzania. [Mas] In this do you still need foreign support, of a military nature, in particular the kind the OAU envisaged? [Ngendahayo] Yes indeed, in as far as when you talk to the refugees, they say: We want a successor to Ndadaye -- and they have got that -- but they add: We want his successor to be protected and have his physical person guaranteed. We don't want the same causes to produce the same effects, they say. And so there is a very important effect from a psychological point of view, that the OAU mission should be there in military form, to contribute to the security of the head of state, and of certain dignitaries, so that the country's own forces of law and order can gradually take over. [Mas] How do you envisage the political future of Burundi? [Ngendahayo] I think the political future of our country depends on the goodwill of politicians in Burundi. Therefore I think there is an appeal that has to be made, namely to make politicians realize that they have to keep in their minds the fact that the most important thing is not so much obtaining ministries as preserving peace. Second, we must not conceal the true values of democracy, or forget that we, in Frodebu, are in power thanks to elections that came out of a quite proper and decent political process, which was the pride of the whole of Africa. Seen like this, the achievements of June 1993 are something very important, which we have to bear in mind for the future.
