The staff of the Press Department at the Czech Ministry of Defense reported that the U.S. side is finishing the text of an agreement on the basis of which the transfer of the equipment is to be executed. The Czech side is ready for the transaction. The Pentagon, which acknowledged the results of the readings by the Czechoslovak chemical warfare unit from the war against Iraq two years ago, wanted to test the measuring instruments in chemical laboratories in the United States to assess the reliability of the data. The Pentagon was particularly interested in the prototype for a simple, yet effective instrument for rapid detection of the most dangerous toxic substances of the orgonophosphate type known as Detehit. It also wanted to examine the PCHL-90 portable chemical laboratory and the DP-86 modern digital dosimetric instruments used for detecting radioactive contamination. If the instruments tested well, the Americans would allegedly buy them.
