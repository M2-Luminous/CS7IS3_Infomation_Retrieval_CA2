According to the speaker, equality in trade and economic relations should mean, above all, "an increase or complete abrogation by the West of export quotas", since only this can evoke interest from both sides. The idea of the need for establishing equal partnership between East and West European countries key-noted the first two days of the international forum in Crans-Montana devoted to East-West relations. Forum participants spoke about this at plenary meetings, seminars and at intervals between sessions. In turn, Ivan Korotchenya, executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that the West's aid was inefficient to a great extent. For instance, the refusal by Byelorussia to take humanitarial aid has not virtually affected the situation in the republic in any way. Therefore, he noted, relations between CIS republics and Western partners should be built on quite another basis: to develop contacts at all levels --from small enterprises to state-owned companies. "It is humiliating for our states to receive just aid," the executive secretary said. The forum is discussing specific projects of cooperation. Korotchenya said that some delegations from CIS countries are already discussing proposals from potential Western partners. Speaking at a plenary meeting, Swiss Economics Minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz noted that success of international cooperation would be determined, above all, by stability in East European countries and consistency with which they would pursue reforms. Interdependence of the countries in the old world has graphically demonstrated itself: The economic slump in the West negatively told on export opportunities from Eastern Europe. Commercial relations is an important factor for economic growth. "Therefore, our aim should be the development of trade with the East and not aid," he summed up his speech. In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Moldavian [Moldova] President Mircea Snegur called attention to the fact that the present forum considerably differs from other similar meetings: It examines not only economic but also political problems. "Economic reforms and the development of relations are linked here directly with measures to ensure political stability on the continent," he stressed. This is of great interest for Moldavia, since "it is forced to overcome the consequences of a short armed conflict in 1992 up to this time".
