The cadres of the movement have almost unanimously agreed to establish a formula for public political, social, and cultural action through which the Islamic Jihad can perform its Islamic duty to further the Palestinian cause, he said. Shaykh al-Shami, who served as the official spokesman for the Islamic Jihad deportees in Marj al-Zuhur in Lebanon, said the public front will not be a substitute for, but a backer of, the Islamic Jihad. Asked if this political front will also be active in the West Bank areas that are not under the authority of the Palestinian self- rule council, Shaykh al-Shami explained that the establishment of the front is linked to the circumstantial change: the launching of the Palestinian self-rule authority. The front will operate only in the Palestinian autonomous region, he said. Shaykh al-Shami believes the front will be open to all Palestinians who embrace Islam, are committed to it, and who work for the Palestinian cause. On the possibility of the leaders of this front participating in the upcoming elections for the self-rule council, Shaykh al-Shami said it is not necessary for every political party or political front to participate in all elections or in the executive power. Our clear political position, he said, is not to participate in the institutions of the self-rule, which the Islamic Jihad has opposed from the very beginning. Asked about the issue of Hani 'Abid, a journalist close to the Islamic Jihad who has been detained by the Palestinian authorities for more than 10 days, al-Shami said that after several meetings between Palestinian security leaders and figures close to the Islamic Jihad, the Palestinian security leadership promised to release 'Abid within a few days. However, this did not happen and the Islamic Jihad is waiting for them to keep their promises, he said.
