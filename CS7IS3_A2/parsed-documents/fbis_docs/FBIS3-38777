If state finances are not in order, there will be no halving of unemployment or stability in the social security system, the government's two primary goals. It is true that the minister of finance is making quite a fuss over the fact that the budget deficit and the state's total borrowing requirement will decline in 1994-95 compared to the current fiscal year (see the table), but not until around the end of the century will it be possible to have the state's finances in reasonably good order. In the meantime, the national debt is going to rise at an alarming rate. Last year our public debt passed the inconceivable figure of 1 trillion kronor. By the end of this fiscal year -- that is, in June of this year -- the debt is expected to total just over 1.2 trillion kronor, and in June 1995 it will be up to 1.435 trillion kronor. That is 94.5 percent of the gross national product (GNP), meaning all the goods and services we produce in Sweden in one year! Prodigious Amount Calculations show that the national debt may reach 2 trillion kronor by the end of the 1997-98 fiscal year, that being the final year of the government's five-year reorganization plan for state finances. The debt would then total 109 percent of GNP, a level achieved in the Western World only by Belgium, Greece, and Italy. With a debt and interest burden that high, a country can scarcely afford to pursue a stabilization policy, and Sweden might wind up in that situation in a future recession if the national debt is not stabilized -- in other words, unless the debt ceases to grow faster than GNP. Debt service on the national debt is going to cost a full 85 billion kronor over the next fiscal year, and that is about as much as the state pays out to the sick, the handicapped, and pensioners. Anne Wibble's five-year reorganization program strengthens the budget by 81 billion kronor, and she claims that the goal for the first year has been more than achieved. But the improved budget figures are due mainly to the beginnings of an economic upswing, one effect of which is an increase in tax revenues for the state and a gradual decline in the cost of unemployment as well. Not Content The minister of finance expects to stay within the projected 81 billion kronor in budget improvements until 1997-98, something that the Riksdag has already approved. But the measures involved may be adopted earlier. On that subject, Wibble sets forth a line of reasoning in the budget statement. If things go so well that economic conditions and public savings improve faster than expected, we should be not be content with that, she warns. If anything, such a development would be an argument in favor of speeding up the reorganization of state finances, because then we would have a chance of lengthening the period of good growth and reducing the risk of overheating and bottlenecks in the future. If, on the other hand, the economic recovery turns out to be weaker and shorter than predicted when the reorganization program was launched in 1993, the program must still be carried out, Wibble emphasizes. Otherwise, the public deficit might go down more slowly or, in the worst of cases, continue to rise -- because of high interest rates, for example. Even under those circumstances, considering the large deficit we began with, the 81 billion kronor called for in the reorganization program should be regarded as a minimum program, the minister of finance says. In the spirit of the Lindbeck Commission, she also emphasizes the importance of the institutions in this connection. A longer term of office beginning with this fall's elections -- from three to four years -- combined with new rules for the Riksdag's budget process, can increase the credibility of long-term measures. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Planned Deficit Reduction by 1998(in billions of kronor) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Billions of kronor |Description | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |41 |Lower subsidies to households: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1.
