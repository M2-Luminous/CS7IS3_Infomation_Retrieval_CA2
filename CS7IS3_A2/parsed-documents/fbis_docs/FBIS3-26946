Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, pointed out in his speech: The principles for guiding this year's work are to emancipate the mind, firmly grasp favorable opportunities, make breakthroughs in key areas, and make bigger strides for reform and construction so as to realize the target of becoming fairly well-off ahead of schedule. Li Qiyan, mayor of the municipal government, chaired the report meeting. Making reports at the meeting were responsible persons of the municipal planning commission, the municipal scientific and technological commission, the municipal commercial commission, the municipal commission for foreign economic relations and trade, the municipal economic restructuring commission, the organizational department and the propaganda department under the municipal party committee, and the municipal agricultural office. Last year, the municipality created a new situation in reform and opening up, comprehensively increased economic targets, and comprehensively fulfilled or surpassed the 38 planned targets of nine major categories that were approved at the first session of the 10th municipal people's congress. In 1993, the GNP reached 85.2 billion yuan, an increase of 12 percent when calculated in terms of comparable prices. The grain output reached 2.84 billion yuan and the per unit yield of grain reached 690 kilograms, setting a record. The total industrial output value reached 125.6 billion yuan, an increase of 18.5 percent. The profits and taxes realized by the enterprises at or above the township level reached 15.42 billion yuan, an increase of 15 percent. The total volume of retail sales of commodities reached 54.92 billion yuan, an increase of 27.8 percent. Local investment in fixed assets reached 27.1 billion yuan, an increase of 49.4 percent. A total of 11 million square meters of houses were built, including 5.5 million square meters of residential houses. A total of 3,752 new foreign-funded enterprises of three types were approved and $6.28 billion worth of foreign capital were used according to agreements, respectively increasing by 70 percent and 3.3 times. The volume of export through foreign trade totaled $1.698 billion, an increase of 10.6 percent. A total of 2.03 million overseas tourists were received, an increase of 16.1 percent. Foreign exchange earnings reached $1.24 billion, an increase of 15.9 percent. The local revenues reached 8.41 billion yuan, an increase of 4.8 percent. Viewing the general situation, we know that last year, the national economy of the municipality developed in a sound and orderly way, the biggest improvement was made in the appearance of urban areas, new breakthroughs were made in deepening reform, key strides were made in building markets, the biggest breakthroughs were made in using foreign capital, and people's livelihood was noticeably improved. Li Qiyan said in his summing-up speech: This report meeting has been successful. All departments, commissions, and offices have made full preparations, conscientiously studied the summing up of the 1993 work and the arrangements for the 1994 work, and worked out new ideas for 1994's work. The report meeting implements the guidelines of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee and generally upgrades the understanding about the policy on linking theory with practice. Many reports dialectically ponder over problems. All this shows that the people have new ideas and good skills and are full of the awareness of emancipating the mind, conducting reform, and opening to the outside world. Many reform projects of breakthrough significance, as set forth in the reports, have new ideas and embody the new measures conforming to the current international big markets. The way of thinking is clear. We have great determination and forceful and solid measures to speed up the capital's modernization. The report meeting makes a good start in carrying out the municipality's work in 1994 and helps lay a good foundation for realizing the 1994 fighting goals. We should strive to make greater achievements. Chen Xitong started out in his speech by expounding on the guiding principle for the work of the whole municipality during this year. He said: The year 1994 is the first year for comprehensively implementing the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee on the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, an important year for realizing the goal of becoming well-off three years ahead of schedule, and a year of increased domestic and international opportunities for us. In line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we have proposed the guiding principles for the work of the whole municipality during 1994 through conducting investigation and studies, extensively listening to opinions, and holding consultation and discussions in all sectors on emancipating the mind, seizing opportunity, making major breakthroughs, meeting the goal of becoming well-off ahead of schedule, and making greater strides in reform and construction. Chen Xitong said: Emancipating the mind is an endless long-term task. Emancipating the mind is aimed at seeking truth from facts, unceasingly freeing ourselves from the shackle of idealism and mataphysics, and understanding and transforming the objective world in line with dialectics. Just as Comrade Jiang Zemin said: "Emancipating the mind is aimed at making ideology match reality, and subjectivity match objectivity, in other words, it means seeking truth from facts." We conducted general discussions on emancipation of minds for four successive years, and each discussion brought progress in ideology and played an active role in promoting all fields of work. What is the priority of the municipality's emancipation of mind during this year? Generally speaking, the priority is to further emancipate the minds in line with the work of accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, expanding the extent of reform, establishing a modern enterprise system, and firmly seizing the opportunity to accelerate development in difficult and hot spots that disrupt the progress of all departments and units. Specifically speaking, priorities in emancipating minds this year are: First, we should continue to emancipate the minds according to the rate of development. The development rate of Beijing last year was quite rapid at 12 percent. Our problem is that we cannot seem to make it faster. The development rate of Beijing is lower than the national average and lower than Shanghai and Tianjin. A gap exists when compared with the favorable conditions of the capital. If we give further play to advantages and tap into potential, it is possible for us to achieve faster development. This development rate should be realistic and sound. Second, we should further emancipate the mind in building the socialist market economic structure. In building the socialist market economic structure, we should pay attention to the law of value, give play to the basic regulatory role of market mechanisms, and at the same time, build a sound marcoeconomic regulation and control system, and never take blind action. Macroeconomic regulation and control is not a synonym of the planned economy, therefore, we must not regard it as going back on the old track. We should comprehensively understand this, and never be one-sided. Third, we should further emancipate the mind in running state-owned, large and medium-sized enterprises. State-owned, large and medium-sized enterprises are the leading forces of the socialist market economy. We must invigorate them because if we fail to do it this way, it will be impossible for us to establish the socialist market economic structure. One-third of the number of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises are good, average, and running in the red. We should try our best to invigorate enterprises that have heavy internal burdens but are needed by the market by pushing them forward with help and support to operate in order to serve the market economy, and strive to invigorate them. Fourth, we broke the old structure and stressed the importance of daring to go ahead, to blaze new trials, and to take risks in reform and construction, and now central authorities have formulated a basic pattern for the socialist market economy and will establish a new structure, so is it still necessary for us to go ahead, to blaze new trials, and to take risks? We believe that in building a new structure, we still need to advocate the practice of daring to go ahead, blaze new trials and take risks. Because the old structure has not been completely eliminated, shackles and obstacles remain, and many old things have yet to completely disappear from the stage. The newly established systems also need to be replenished, revised, implemented, developed, and improved in practice. We should make bold explorations and experiments for the new system by proceeding from realities. We should also continue to emancipate the mind and dare to give everything a try and go ahead. Fifth, we should further overcome blind complacency and a passive pessimistic view. It is a lopsided view to feel complacent over a little bit achievements and then refuse to make progress. It is also a lopsided view to blame others and shift responsibilities onto external reasons whenever there is a difficulty and then refuse to exploit one's subjective activity. Both of these views should be tackled conscientiously. Sixth, we should overcome the situation in which some units have been weak in doing one thing but tough in doing another, or have been tough in words on both but stressed on neither in deeds. Failing to overcome such a metaphysical situation will affect the central link of economic construction. We must persist in the principle of taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands. This is the only way to ensure the smooth progress of economic construction. Seventh, we should overcome the idea of choosing and promoting cadres according to seniority. In using cadres, we should persist in the requirements of making cadres more revolutionary, younger, better educated, and professionally more competent and making cadres have ability and political integrity. We should solve the problem concerning the provision of leading bodies at various levels. We should boldly choose and promote young cadres. This is a long-term policy, and we must emancipate our mind in this regard. Chen Xitong stressed: Only by emancipating the mind can we blaze new ideas and act boldly. If we are plagued by all sorts of fears and dare not to do this or that, we will be unable to make big progress. New ideas, bold actions, and emancipation of the mind are closely integrated. All units and all departments should emancipate whatever binds their ideas and actions. By doing so, they can go all out to do their work without restrictions, make progress rapidly, and accelerate the pace of reform and opening up. When talking about the seizure of opportunity, Chen Xitong pointed out: Opportunity is a special manifestation at the present stage, and it does not exist at any stage. Failing to seize the opportunity, it will be missed. The present situation at home and abroad is extremely advantageous to our development, and thus it is a race opportunity. Seizing the opportunity loosely means failing to seize it. We must firmly seize the opportunity, cherish it, and make good use of it so that we can beef up the economy. Just like some comrades said, seizing the opportunity means having new resources, new financial sources, and high growth speed. Some comrades have failed to seize the opportunity because they have caught sight of things belatedly, understood things slowly, and lacked the sense of responsibility, the sense of urgency, and the sense of crisis. Some other comrades have lacked practical experiences and indulged in empty talks. Still others have aimed too high and buried themselves in studies all day long, thus missing opportunities. We should keep firmly in mind what Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, that is, "the opportunity should be seized and policy decisions should be made in time," otherwise, "the time will pass in a flash." Therefore, seizing the opportunity should be regarded as a principle for our work this year. Chen Xitong said: By making breakthroughs in key areas, we mean to make breakthroughs in major contradictions, in central links, or in key points. Without emphasis, there will be no policies, and our work cannot be promoted. This year, the central and key point of the work of the entire municipality still lies in economic work. We should achieve success in the work in all fields around the central link of economic construction. Each field has its own major contradictions. Only by making breakthroughs in major contradictions first and solving non-essential contradictions second can we achieve results in our work. To find out correct points in making breakthroughs, we are required to conduct investigation and study and think it over conscientiously. All fronts should sort out their contradictions, put them in right order, and strive to solve them in the order of importance. This means making breakthroughs in key areas. We should solve a central problem in a period, and solve some major problems throughout a year. Successfully solving problems, we will make a breakthrough and make big progress. As all fronts have their own special contradictions and key areas, we should not use a fixed pattern to address their problems. When issues of a specific character are resolved, it will be easy to resolve the issues of a general character. Achieving a fairly comfortable living standard three years ahead of time is an issue regarding general character, in which making mountainous areas prosper, people's housing problem, and the problems of low-income workers require great efforts to resolve. We should also pay attention to the work of social stability and the spiritual civilization. As long as the key areas are clearly defined and breakthroughs are made in them, greater progress will be achieved in the work of the municipality. Speaking on strengthening party building and improving party leadership, Chen Xitong said: Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out that we should "strengthen and improve party building, strive to raise the party's ruling and leadership levels, and enable our long-tested Marxist party to play a better role as the leadership core in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics." To make a greater step in reform and construction this year, we need to carry out plenty of work, and we must not slacken efforts in party building. We should step up efforts to achieve two improvements. First, we should make unremitting efforts to achieve ideological and theoretical improvement. The major tasks are to deeply study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. After reading through Volume 3, we should conduct intensive reading of special topics in an effort to understand it more thoroughly. In studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the focus is to study and master dialectical materialism and historical materialism and to study their stand, viewpoints, and methods. We should use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a tool to attain Beijing's targets of reform, opening up, and construction and promote all work. Meanwhile, we should transform our world outlook and outlook on life and oppose money worship and ultra- individualism. In particular, leading cadres should embrace the communist world outlook and outlook on life and work hard all their life towards their ambitious goal. We should also coordinate the study of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping with the study of the basic theories of Marxist works, including philosophy, political economics, and scientific socialism. Only when we thoroughly understand the basic theories, can we acquire a better understanding of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theories. Ideological and theoretical improvement should be the criterion in assessing cadres, especially young cadres. Chen Xitong pointed out that focusing on establishing the socialist market economy system, we should study the knowledge on the market economy, the modern enterprise system, and modern science, technology, and management. He urged: The study should become a system, should be examined, supervised, and appraised, and should become a criterion for selecting and promoting cadres. Propaganda through the media and through cultural and art works should all be linked to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the major melody should be given prominence so that efforts can be pooled to achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living together. Speaking on organizational improvement, Chen Xitong pointed out: The focus should be on improving leading bodies. Breakthroughs should be made in organizational work, especially in the orderly succession of cadres to make leading bodies younger. We should promote a number of young cadres who uphold the four cardinal principles, are loyal to the party's cause, and pay attention to the overall situation. We should also promote women cadres and cadres of minority nationalities and make a breakthrough in selecting cadres without party affiliation or with democratic parties to participate in the administration of state affairs. We should improve grass-roots organizations and build party branches well. In particular, we should be determined to rectify backward party branches and, at the same time, summarize the experiences of advanced party branches so as to promote the work of the middle branches of the party. We should build party organizations of enterprises and also pay attention to improving the party organizations of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises, collective enterprises, and private enterprises. Only when grass-roots organizations are improved, can the party fully develop its role. We should achieve success in improving party style and building a clean government. This is a major task concerning the life and death of our party. Administrative honesty should be linked with administrative diligence. Two major experiences were gained in the improvement of administrative honesty in the previous stage. First, meet with the masses to directly hear their opinions and accept their supervision. Second, administrative honesty is closely linked with administrative diligence, so be sure to be honest and diligent. We should always use the enthusiasm gained through improvement of administrative honesty to do good and real deeds for the people and start an upsurge before the Spring Festival. Chen Xitong urged to vigorously promote the setup of socialist democracy and politics and pointed out the necessity to reform the political system accordingly while restructuring the economy. At present, we should achieve work in the following few aspects: First, we should further improve the people's congress system; strengthen and perfect the functions of the municipal, district, and county people's congresses and their standing committees; upgrade the prestige of the local organs of state power; bring into better play the functions of the people's deputies; and work out systems to enable the deputies to bring their functions into better play after the congresses. Second, we should further perfect the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the communist party and consolidate and develop the united front in the new situation. We should continue to persist in the principle of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, showing utter devotion, and sharing woe and weal"; strengthen and improve the leadership of the party; and bring into full play various democratic parties and non party personages' roles in participating in and discussing political affairs and conducting democratic supervision. We should strengthen the consultation and discussions with democratic parties; improve the work of handling the motions put forward by the democratic parties, including the federations of industry and commerce; and positively create conditions for democratic parties to participate in and discuss political affairs and conduct democratic supervision. The party-member cadres at various levels should pay attention to the united front work and strengthen the work toward nationalities, the religious work, and the work toward Taiwan. Third, the most important foundation of the united front is the masses of workers and peasants. The key to ensuring that the masses of the people play the role as a master is to carry forward democracy, to make the people have the right to handling their own affairs, to link responsibility with right and benefits, and actually mobilize the people's enthusiasm for being the master of the people. Fourth, we should achieve the setup of the socialist legal system. Without the legal system, there will be no guarantee for the sustained, fast, and smooth progress of the national economy. We should speed up the legislation to promote the setup of the socialist market economic system, strengthen the construction of the law enforcement worker contingents, attend to the education on general knowledge of laws, and really ensure that there are laws to abide by. Fifth, we should safeguard the political and social stability of the capital just as we cherish our eyes. This is of primary importance. Development creates conditions for stability, and stability provides an environment for development. One's existence depends on the another. Chen Xitong stressed the necessity to vigorously advocate the tendencies of conducting investigations and study. Last year, we did this for the whole year and made good achievements. This year, we should continuously persist in it. This is a fundamental duty for leading organs. The leading organs of the municipal party committee and the municipal government, departments, commissions, offices, districts, counties, bureaus, and all units should work out plans for investigations and study. It will be possible to form a regular work method if we persist in it for several years. Through investigations and study, all units should report back as to what aspects they have emancipated their minds in, what obstacles they have in grasping favorable opportunities, what contradictions they should solve, and what methods they should adopt to solve contradictions. All these should be regarded as the main contents of the investigation and study activities as well as the basis for year-end examinations. Li Qiyan urged that all departments should relay and implement the guidelines of the meeting, readjust their own work plans, divide their planned tasks to lower levels, and ensure the implementation of the tasks. Before the Spring Festival, we should further do solid and concrete deeds for the people; achieve the things that have direct bearings on the personal interests of the people, such as market supply and the supply of gas, heat, and electricity; and also resolutely ban the setting off of firecrackers. Present at the meeting were some municipal leaders, including Zhang Jianmin, Wang Daming, Li Zhijian, Zhang Baifa, and Wang Baosen.
