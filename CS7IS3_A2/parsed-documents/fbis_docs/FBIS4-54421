Among these forces, Boross mentioned the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) in the first place, and said the Socialists themselves had firmly ruled out the MDF a few days ago. The MDF also does not want to enter into a coalition with an Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) that is directed by the SZDSZ's strong core in Budapest, and which is moving closer to its one-time enemy, the former communists (the MSZP), Boross said. The prime minister discussed in detail farming and industry. He also said that debt servicing, and external circumstances such as the collapse of the Soviet Union and its insolvency, the global recession, and the Balkan war have held Hungary back, falling short of results hoped for in the MDF's 1990 program.
