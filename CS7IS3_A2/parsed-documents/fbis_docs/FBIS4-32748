Lansky, journalist and political analyst who served as Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry spokesman and ambassador to the Council of Europe: "Understanding Our Own Past, Forming Our Own Future"] [Text] In the Czech press in mid-May I challenged the stance of President Havel, who before a gathering of politicians and intellectuals from home and abroad claimed that the Czech state, and indeed all post-Communist states, were not post-Communist anymore but full-fledged democracies like any others. My arguments were based mostly on our shortcomings regarding rule of law, respect for the constitution, and suspected economic crime, often in the upper echelons of political power. The events surrounding May's annual congress of Sudeten Germans (an ethnic group forcibly transferred from parts of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia shortly after World War II), along with a few other international events, serve to remind us that the problem has a foreign policy dimension as well. A democracy, I believe, should be able to come to terms even with the nastier parts of its own past. The Sudeten German question is loaded with emotion on both sides of the border. Sudeten Germans in the latter half of the 1930s massively supported Hitler, and demanded to join his Reich, which they achieved through the Munich Agreement of September 1938. That date marked the beginning of the end of pre-war Czechoslovakia and, ultimately, of preparations for the war. The suffering this brought to millions of Czechs, Slovaks and Jews in this country has been neither forgotten nor compensated. Czech victims of Nazism say they never received any reparations for their suffering and loss of property. Sudeten Germans, too, are demanding compensation and their right to a homeland, in other words, the right to return to what is today the Czech Republic. Although the government of federal Czechoslovakia tried to reject material claims from the German side (while raising some claims on behalf of Czech victims of Nazi persecution), it did admit moral wrongdoing in punishing the Sudeten Germans collectively. Current Czech officials, on the other hand, have been making various noises about dialogue on an unspecified level (as Premier Klaus suggested last year). And recently, in a rare display of unity across the entire political spectrum, they flat out rejected invitations to engage in dialogue made by the Sudeten German spokesman, Mr. Neubauer. Mr. Klaus even called an invitation to attend the Sudeten German congress a provocation. Further underscoring the delicacy of the situation is the fact that the guest of honor at that congress--to be presented with the highest Sudeten German honor, the Charles Prize--was Alois Mock, the foreign minister of neighboring Austria, whose official speech was published in advance in the SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, a rather unimportant and militant German weekly. Mr. Mock chose to speak of the suffering Sudeten Germans experienced as a result of the forcible transfer, while ignoring the suffering of Czechoslovak citizens under Hitler's Germany--which indeed is not a very wise or tactful policy from the foreign minister of a neighboring state. On top of it all, he had the bad taste to quote Mr. Havel, who once equated the transfer of Sudeten Germans after the war with "ethnic cleansing" and was subjected to heavy criticism for it. Poor Mr. Mock was criticized not only in Prague, but also at home. Some Social Democrats in Austria even suggested that he had confused the SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG with the SUDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG and the Sudeten German Charles Prize with the European prize of the same name, and they asked him to reconsider his decision to accept the award. So much for Mr. Mock. As for the Czechs, their irrational attitude toward a less pleasant part of their own past clearly shows that their thinking is far from free of totalitarian influence. They simply cannot escape dialogue with an ethnic group in the country of their mightiest neighbor, which, even though it may not be very influential politically, is still big enough to be able to bring the problem back every time it is most uncomfortable for the Czechs. It will always be a matter of Czech foreign policy as long as the Czechs themselves are not able to form a rational attitude of their own to present to their German neighbors. The legacy of Czech-German relations is inescapable. If the Czechs believe the demands of their counterparts (and the Sudeten Germans are counterparts, like it or not) are arrogant and/or wrong, it should be easy to refute them. But this issue has a moral dimension that must be addressed too, a dimension that is very much concerned with democracy and tolerance. As a victim of the Holocaust myself, and knowing well the entire complicated nature of own own German history, I cannot see any justice being done by causing summary injustice to others. By accepting the European code of human rights, we have signed away the notion of collective guilt. We can still be members of international democratic institutions without practicing what we have signed, but in that case we won't be true democrats. Ultimately, this is not even a Czech-German problem, but a purely Czech problem to be disposed of, and the sooner the better. This is a Czech-Czech problem in the sense that it is the duty of Czech politicians to introduce it and explain it to citizens. But as long as the premier takes invitations to be provocations, the efforts of people to turn their totalitarian minds to democracy will be futile.
