While former U.S. President James Carter enticed the DPRK foreign minister at a state dinner in Seoul with prospects of extensive trade, respectful relations, and mutually advantageous trading exchange between the despotic Pyongyang and Washington, leader of the free world, M. Albright, U.S. permanent representative at the United Nations, clearly showed that her government was tired of waiting. The sanctions against North Korea -- which has left the international organizations that inspect and coordinate all work with nuclear materials -- have put the United Nations face to face with the need for action. The United States has taken the lead, as usual in recent years. The first set of measures proposed by Washington on Wednesday does not look very impressive. It is believed that the United Nations will only approve two points: discontinuing weapons trading with the DPRK and discontinuing all air flights except for passenger flights. Observers maintain that this is just the first step. If Pyongyang does not listen and continues its policy, tougher sanctions will follow. In particular, the next step will be to freeze all the DPRK's assets in international banks and exclude this country from transnational financial activity. North Korea has repeatedly stated that it will consider any economic sanctions to be an act tantamount to a declaration of war. However, a group of journalists who arrived in Pyongyang together with Jimmy Carter did not discover any outward signs of preparation for combat operations. The magnificent reception given to Ex-President Carter by no means signifies Pyongyang's readiness to respond to his initiative. Carter's idea briefly boils down to North Korea being promised serious political and business contacts, and talks about this would start straight away as soon as the DPRK restores access to its nuclear reactors for international inspection. However, these promises have met with no response in Pyongyang. Many people believe that the DPRK will continue with its tough brinkmanship [protivostoyaniye na grani voiyny] until it receives real diplomatic recognition in the West and until the blockade, which has become particularly painful following the disintegration of the USSR and China's greater involvement in the world economic process, is broken. However, all the indications are that North Korea's intentions do not end there. As one expert on the region said, "through its activity in developong [sozdaniye] an atomic bomb, Pyongyang wants to achieve two aims. The first is to achieve international recognition. The second is to obtain an atomic bomb." Analysts believe that the aged North Korean dictator Kim Il-song can foresee a time when the unification of Korea into a single state will become inevitable. Possessing nuclear weapons may be a the deciding trump card both at the unification negotiating table, and, equally importantly, under the table.
