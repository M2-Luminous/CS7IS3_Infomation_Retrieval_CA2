When the GATT was established in 1947, China was one of the founders. After the founding of New China, China was excluded from the GATT. In July 1986 China formally submitted an application for the restoration of its signatory status. Whether or not China can restore its GATT status at an early date will affect China's political and economic structural reform and economic development. Apart from this, it also will have an important bearing on the final establishment of a new international trade order. Reviewing the Process According to GATT provisions, China should go through seven stages in resuming its GATT status: 1) Submitting a letter of intent to resume its GATT status; 2) Examination and ratification by the GATT Council; 3) Submission of a memorandum on trade structure; 4) Examination by a work group comprising the representatives of the GATT Council member-nations; 5) Submission of a draft agreement on resuming its GATT status and the conduct of separate consultations with two-thirds of member-nations; 6) Signing an agreement on resuming its GATT status; and 7) Formally resuming its signatory status. The first and second stages have proceeded very smoothly. China formally submitted an application to GATT in July 1986 and the GATT Council readily and unanimously ratified it. China submitted a memorandum on its trade structure in February 1987. As the GATT Council varied in its views on whether or not China fell into the category of "resuming GATT status," it did not form a working party until May 1987 -- a date that indicated the beginning of the formal talks on China's resumption of GATT status. At the 10th GATT working party meeting in February 1992, the talks on China's resumption of GATT status completed the work for the fourth stage. At the 11th GATT working party meeting in October 1992, "essential" talks were held on the agreement, and the talks are still under way so far. The Cause of Obstacles Oksenberg, famous U.S. expert on the China problem, pointed out in 1990 that the talks on the agreement would be the most difficult job in the course of China's resumption of GATT status. Facts have proved that the talks in this stage have been more difficult and complicated than Oksenberg expected. There are many reasons. First, GATT has never been a "pure" trade organization. Big powers usually decide their "tricks" in GATT according to the international situation and their diplomatic strategies. Facing the tremendous changes in the international situation in recent years, the United States, Japan, and the EC -- all occupying a dominant position in GATT -- have adjusted their China policies and thus reconsidered China's resumption of GATT status. Second, in recent years some developed nations have constantly created trouble for China, such as disputes between China and the United States over China's most-favored nation status, the Yinhe incident, and arms proliferation; stalemate in Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue; French arms sales to Taiwan; U.S.-European joint action to impose pressure on China concerning the human rights issue; and so on and so forth. These large and small frictions have indirectly affected the talks on China's resumption of GATT status. Third, the draft agreement on China's resumption of GATT status is based on the final document of the Uruguay Round of talks. Because the Uruguay Round of talks was postponed time and again, this directly caused a delay in the process of China's resumption of GATT status. Speeding Up the Pace At the beginning of this year, China stepped up its efforts at the talks on resuming its GATT status. On 21 January, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen visited China,and the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee formally resumed its work after a seven-year suspension. On 20 February, deputy U.S. trade representative Dawkins led a delegation to China to hold the eighth round of consultations between the two countries on China's resumption of GATT status. On 28 February, Brittan, EC chief representative to GATT talks, visited China. The GATT working party on China will hold its 16th meeting [as published] in Geneva in April, and China will send a delegation to Morocco in mid-April to sign the final document of the Uruguay Round of talks. Viewing the initial results of the consultations between the Chinese, U.S., and EC representatives and the arrangements for future talks, we have reason to believe that the talks on China's resumption of GATT status have entered a new stage, and that it is absolutely possible for China to resume its status as a GATT "founder nation" before the Multilateral Trade Organization [MTO] established by the Uruguay Round of talks comes into effect. Favorable Conditions On China's part, it is equipped with the conditions to resume its GATT status. 1) In 1993 China continued to deepen its reform and made major progress in this respect. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decided the overall structure of the Chinese market economy and ratified a series of reform measures for the financial, monetary, taxation, foreign trade, and enterprise structures. In 1993 alone, the National People's Congress ratified 13 economic laws and regulations, including the Company Law and the Law Against Improper Competition, clarifying the main composition of the market, standardizing market behavior, and laying the foundation for entry into the market economy. 2) To cope with the difficulties created by the U.S. Government, China -- bearing in mind the country's interests and economic development -- took a correct attitude and worked hard to improve its relations with the United States. In January 1992, China and the United States, abiding by the GATT blueprint, signed a memorandum of understanding on protecting intellectual property rights; in August and October, the two countries signed a memorandum on prison-made products and market admission; and in January 1994, the two countries reached an agreement on textile products. 3) In 1992 and 1993, China maintained rapid economic growth and registered rapid foreign trade development. Thanks to the marked improvement in its overall national economic strength, China has the ability to perform GATT duties and also has strengthened its confidence in conducting consultations with other GATT signatory nations on some "sensitive issues." On the part of the Western countries, China's resumption of GATT status will help boost their interests. In such cases, the obstacles to China's resumption of GATT status will diminish. 1) China displayed its huge market potential in 1993. In the first nine months of 1993, China's trade with Germany, Italy, and Denmark increased by 90 percent, 83 percent, and 154 percent, respectively, over the same period of 1992. In 1993, Japan's exports to China increased by 44.6 percent over 1992. In 1993, China absorbed one- tenth of the direct investment from around the world, thus becoming the second largest direct foreign investment recipient after the the United States. At a U.S. Congress hearing on 24 February this year, deputy U.S. trade representative Balshevsky said that the Chinese market had provided a "historic opportunity" for U.S. enterprises. She added that China will import $40 to $100 billion worth of power equipment in the coming 25 years, $40 billion worth of planes in the coming 20 years, $30 billion worth of telecommunications equipment in the coming five years, and $29 billion worth of automobile parts in the coming three years. As a "huge market" is appearing in China, many GATT member-nations indicated the urgency of allowing China into the GATT. 2) China has regarded the date for the MTO to come into force (July 1995) as the "final time limit" for its re- entry into GATT. If China cannot reenter GATT by that time, China will adopt a "bilateral" trade talk strategy in international trade. In this case, many countries are worried that there will be much trouble in entering the huge Chinese market. Final Stage The talks on China's resumption of GATT status have entered a crucial stage of "bargaining." In February, China and the United States conducted initial consultations on a "special protective clause." This means that the United States is worried that after China re-enters GATT, its exports to the United States will increase by a wide margin and create market confusion. It therefore demanded the establishment of a protective mechanism. The Chinese side expressed its readiness to accept this clause conditionally (meaning there must be a time limit). At the 16th [as published] GATT working party meeting on China from 15 to 18 March, the majority of representatives explicitly expressed their hope for an early conclusion of the talks on China's resumption of GATT status, so that when it resumes its GATT status, China will become a founder-nation of the MTO, which will be established early next year.
