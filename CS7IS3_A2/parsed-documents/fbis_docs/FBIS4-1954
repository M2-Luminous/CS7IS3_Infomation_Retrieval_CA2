Last year saw the officials go to Beijing to ask for help once more. But this time they did not request for grain supply, but for helping sell its two million tons of surplus grain. "This was a historical change," a provincial official said, "Liaoning Province, used to depend on other provinces for living, is self-sufficient in grain and pork." According to the figures provided by the Provincial Statistical Bureau, the province turned out 17 million tons of grain last year, averaging 400 kilograms per capita and exceeding the national average. Its output of livestock products amounted to 2.32 million tons, averaging 34 kilograms of meat, 18 kilograms of eggs and four kilograms of milk per capita, also higher than the national average. By the end of last year, the province sold 2.5 million tons of rice and maize and 300,000 live pigs to other parts of the country. In addition, it exported 300,000 tons of rice to Japan last year. Local officials attributed their achievements to the government's sustained efforts in promoting agricultural development. Liaoning is China's only province, of which the urban population accounts for more than 70 percent of the province's total. To feed its residents, the provincial government had to buy at least three million tons of grain and 70,000 tons of pork from development. A senior Chinese official has called on other provinces and regions with grain shortage to follow the example of Liaoning in northeast China.
