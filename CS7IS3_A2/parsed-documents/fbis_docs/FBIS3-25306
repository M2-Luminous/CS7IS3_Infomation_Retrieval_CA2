Pressure from militant circles for the process of creating a volkstaat starting without delay was intensifying at the time of going to press, especially after the Afrikaner National Front [AVF] had announced on Thursday [10 February] that it would not take part in the April elections. But the decision to declare a volkstaat had already been made in Pretoria on 18 January. The moderate faction in the AVF under the leadership of General Constand Viljoen has, however, apparently been given time to exhaust the negotiation option first. Victory The militant faction in the AVF this week achieved victory after victory at consecutive meetings of the CP's [Conservative Party] Executive Committee and the "transitional parliament." The faction is capitalizing on the 29 January events, when General Viljoen was booed in Pretoria while he -- under certain conditions -- was calling for participation in the election. Well known moderates in the AVF were not even present on Thursday when the "transitional parliament" authorized a decision to boycott the election. Among them were General Constand Viljoen and two CP MP's -- Drs. Corne and Pieter Mulder. The approximately seven to 10 CP MP's who are in favor of participation in the election showed no signs of resistance in the midst of emotional intimidation from far right wingers. Elated Spokesmen in the militant faction of the AVF were elated yesterday over the victories achieved this week. To further rub salt into the wounds, AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche yesterday unequivocally rejected proposals to get international mediation on the volkstaat issue. "It is just a trick to sow division within the National Front," Mr. Terreblanche said. But it is General Viljoen who on several occasions has been toying with the idea of calling in international mediators. Fight Back Despite these drawbacks, sources in the moderate group said they were going to fight back. They give the assurance that differences will be brought to a head within "10 days." Preparations for a rebels' state have nevertheless been underway for a long time, with two MP's, Messrs. Schalk Pienaar and Kobus Beyers, playing a significant role. It revolves around a so-called "resistance map" in which a large portion of the country has been designated as a future volkstaat in contrast to the "peace map" for which negotiations between the government, the ANC and the AVF over the past few weeks yielded nothing. Meanwhile, it has come to light that neither the CP nor the AWB support this map and that even the AVF's Executive Committee rejected it. The "peace map" makes provision for 15 percent of the country's area as a volkstaat. It has been rejected by both the government and the ANC. The more than 60 CP-controlled city councils in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State will play an important role in the establishment of a rebels' state. After the CP-orientated Transvaal Municipal Association indicated that it would not take part in a new constitutional dispensation, it is a foregone conclusion that right wingers will find refuge around these city councils and even defend them with weapons. Radio Pretoria The success achieved through Radio Pretoria will serve as a model for resistance surrounding the city councils. On Friday General Viljoen, in an interview with RAPPORT, broadly referred to an "emergency solution" to attain a volkstaat peacefully. He was reluctant to elaborate further, except to say the transitional constitution has to be amended to legalize the implementation of a volkstaat during the interim period of five years. Yesterday Gen. Viljoen castigated ANC leader Nelson Mandela in an open letter over his umpteenth utterance that a volkstaat will not materialize. "Your current statements do not match what has been going on during the negotiation process and it has left my team confused and embarrassed," the letter stated.
