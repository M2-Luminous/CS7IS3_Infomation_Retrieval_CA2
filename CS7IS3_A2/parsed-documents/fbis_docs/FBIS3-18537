This is not enough for the Nordic countries alone to be able to block EU proposals which run counter to Nordic interests -- for that 70 percent of votes would be needed -- but it does mean that the Nordic countries could represent a power factor together with other EU countries in areas such as environmental policy, consumer policy, and on the question of free trade. Denmark has had difficulty in promoting the stated Danish interest in high standards in the environmental and consumer fields -- as demonstrated most recently in connection with issues such as the EU's directive on the recycling of packaging materials and the directive on food additives. Hitherto Denmark, together with the Netherlands and Germany, has formed a block vote in the Council of Ministers and has fought for higher environmental standards. But the three countries have not had enough votes to stand firm on this policy. With votes from Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Norway -- which are expected to pursue a similar environmental policy line in the EU -- a solid block has now been created that could at least block proposed directives that are designed to water down environmental policy. But apart from in the environmental field it is at present difficult to see how the admission of the new members could alter the balance in the Council of Ministers. Yesterday Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical Liberal) himself mentioned environmental policy as an important area for Nordic cooperation. "There is a core of issues on which the Nordic countries have a common stance," he said. He also mentioned the question of greater openness in EU cooperation and the prospect of increased cooperation with the countries of East Europe. "In the case of East Europe I see a real possibility of close Nordic cooperation involving new initiatives that could benefit the East Europeans." Niels Helveg Petersen takes the view that the Nordic countries have a shared desire and a common interest in getting the East Europeans linked to the EU as swiftly as possible. "But there is the prospect of other openings in the field of security and foreign policy, and along with all this comes the prospect that the Nordic area will have a common foreign policy through the EU," Niels Helveg Petersen pointed out. Since World War II the Nordic countries have gone their separate ways in the field of security policy. Denmark and Norway have been members of NATO, for the last 22 years Denmark has also been a member of the EU, Sweden has been neutral, while up to the collapse of the Soviet Union, Finland had forced on it a neutrality that mostly satisfied Soviet interests. In the economic field, however, there are doubts about the creation of a Nordic block vote. In the agricultural field Denmark's interests run directly counter to those of the other Nordic countries, and it is also doubtful whether the potential new members will back the liberal trade line that Denmark has traditionally pursued in the EU.
