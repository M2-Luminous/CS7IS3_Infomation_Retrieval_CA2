FR940705-0-00048 FR940705-0-00002 Appendix B to 7 CFR 1755.900_Thermal Reel Wrap Qualification (I) The test procedures described in this appendix are only for qualification of initial and subsequent changes in thermal reel wraps. (II) Sample selection. All testing must be performed on two 450 millimeter lengths of cable removed sequentially from the same fiber jacketed cable. This cable must not have been exposed to temperatures in excess of 38 笳気 since its initial cool down after sheathing. (III) Test procedure. (1) Place the two samples on an insulating material such as wood. (2) Tape thermocouples to the jackets of each sample to measure the jacket temperature. (3) Cover one sample with the thermal reel wrap. (4) Expose the samples to a radiant heat source capable of heating the uncovered jacket sample to a minimum of 71 笳気. A GE 600 watt photoflood lamp or an equivalent lamp having the light spectrum approximately that of the sun shall be used. (5) The height of the lamp above the jacket shall be 380 millimeters or an equivalent height that produces the 71 笳気 jacket temperature on the unwrapped sample shall be used. (6) After the samples have stabilized at the temperature, the jacket temperatures of the samples shall be recorded after one hour of exposure to the heat source. (7) Compute the temperature difference between jackets. (8) For the thermal reel wrap to be acceptable to REA, the temperature difference between the jacket with the thermal reel wrap and the jacket without the reel wrap shall be greater than or equal to 17 笳気.
