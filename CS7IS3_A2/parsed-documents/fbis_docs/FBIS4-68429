A conspicuous reduction in the domestic expenditures of the state is the first point that should be noted. The official deficit of the federal budget--62.4 trillion rubles [R]--equals approximately one-third of its expenditures and comes to 8.6 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). This is less than last year (10.5 percent of GDP). However, the reduction in state expenditures in real terms and the hardening of monetary policy are not restricted to two percentage points; they are much greater. The expenditure side of the budget includes quite a number of new items which were not included in last year's budget. For the relative size of domestic expenditures of the budget to be comparable with last year, the following should be subtracted from the amount of expenditures in 1994: --state guarantees for foreign loans--R12.8 trillion (previously they were not taken into account within the budget, and from 1994 on they are registered in the budget twice, as financing for the deficit and as budget expenditures). In general terms, these are mythical, nonexistent expenditures; they will not occur actually, i.e. as payment of funds from the budget, this year, and in the years to come--only in the event that the enterprises that have received these loans are unable to pay them back); --financial support fund for northern territories--R6.6 trillion, and expenditures for conversion--R0.8 trillion (the monies in these items were previously provided as loans from the Bank of Russia); --the debt of the budget for 1993--about R4 trillion (has already been paid in the first quarter); --the increment of expenditures for serving the foreign debt--R6 trillion (more than $2 billion). Therefore, the real domestic expenditures of the state under comparable methodology will decline by about R30 trillion rubles, and the size of the deficit will decline by almost a factor of two and come to merely one-fifth of the expenditures and less than 5 percent of GDP. It should also be taken into account that the interest rate on credit from the Bank of Russia has become positive in recent months, i.e. it exceeded the growth of prices, that the extension of easy credit and subsidization of imports were canceled, and that a number of other restrictions in monetary policy were introduced. Therefore, the government is planning a perceptible hardening of the budgetary and monetary policy for 1994. The tax burden is growing noticeably: --profit tax has been increased by 6 percent (of which 3 percent is for the federal budget), --a special tax has been introduced--actually, value-added tax has been raised by 3 percent; --the tax on assets has been raised to 2 percent; this amounts to a very sharp increase given a reappraisal of the cost of enterprise assets by a factor of 27 effective 1 January 1994 (in 1994 proceeds by virtue of this tax are projected to be 20 times greater than in 1993); --transportation tax has been introduced (1 percent of the labor compensation fund); --customs duties on imports were increased effective 15 March. At the same time a number of preferences in profit tax have been granted; however, in grand total the government plans to collect 16.6 percent of GDP for the federal budget, instead of the 10.6 percent last year. Even after the nontax proceeds are subtracted, the tax load on the economy for funding federal expenditures will increase by a factor of almost 1.5. Nonetheless, despite the tax increase the revenues of the budget appear to be overstated. Budget revenue calculations clearly fail to take into account the industrial slump, the mounting volume of nonpayments, the flight of capital, and an increase in the "average" resourcefulness of merchants in terms of tax evasion. In the first two months of 1994 only 8 percent of GDP in taxes was successfully collected by the federal budget, whereas a statistic from the beginning of last year is built into the calculations which is clearly unrealistic. Given that the revenue calculations are overstated, it will become necessary to cut back expenditures as revenues are really taken in, that is, the domestic expenditures of the state will be reduced even below the level planned in the budget, which is low to begin with. While the overall tax burden increases, the government turns out to be unable to take specific and realistic measures to increase budget revenues. Thus, in keeping with the Law on the Customs Tariff which was passed last year, an overwhelming majority of customs preferences were to be canceled effective 1 January 1994 because the rates of customs duty were to be uniform and not subject to change. The government has been unable to cancel these preferences and apparently is not planning to do so. A shortfall in budget revenues on account of the granted preferences exceeds $4 billion (R12 trillion) in terms of duties alone, and considerably more taking into account value-added tax and the excise tax on imports. Besides, the government exempts from the levying of duties and taxes almost $20 billion in foreign trade turnover consisting of centrally exported and imported items (loss in duties alone--up to $3 billion). The budget does not sufficiently account for the possibility of increasing proceeds from privatization, as well as the growth of revenues in conjunction with the consolidation of off-budget and "ministerial" funds in the budget. Despite the decisions made to merge these funds, this has not been actually done. Budgetary Expenditures On the whole the budget expenditures are planned to increase by a factor of 4.5 compared to 1993 (under the comparable calculation method described above), with revenues planned to increase by a factor of 7.1. State investment from the federal budget comes to about 2 percent of GDP (even according to initial calculations for the budget it came to 3 percent). Priority investment programs have virtually not been distinguished in the draft. The assistance fund for small businesses and entrepreneurship comes to less than one-hundredth of 1 percent of budget expenditures. Out of almost R8 trillion in subsidies for the coal industry, only R0.3 trillion is earmarked for a program of reorganization and closure of unpromising enterprises; the rest of the amount constitutes a grant to the industry to carry out the pay scale agreement (wages), to maintain social services facilities, and so on. The reorganization fund is not envisioned at all in other sectors. Funds allocated for conversion (R0.8 trillion) are not an investment in the reorganization of production for manufacturing civilian products at defense enterprises, as one might think; instead, grants for wages or to maintain social infrastructure facilities account for four-fifths of these funds. In real terms, proceeds from privatization will decline compared to 1993, although last year privatization for checks proceeded whereas in the second half of this year a transition must be made to privatization at a fee. The structure of budget expenditures is inertial in nature and appears to be called upon to merely "patch holes" in the economy. Of the entire complex of economic policy measures, only the policy of restricting state expenditures and the growth of money supply is implemented very consistently. Is the Budget Policy in Line With the Existing Situation? Some economists might be getting the impression that a "victory" over inflation is near: The rate of inflation has been falling consistently since August 1993. It appears that the objectives set for economic policy will be reached any minute. Of course, a normal economic situation presupposes stable prices or prices growing slowly (up to 10 percent a year). However, is the direct path toward the goal always the best? As a result of consistent policy, in the fall of 1993 enterprises have for the second time since 2 January 1992 ended up in a situation of rigid financial restrictions. Two years ago enterprises responded with an increase in nonpayments, with the volume of production falling slightly. They reacted differently at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994. Industrial enterprises no longer have the funds to purchase raw materials and subcontracted parts, and are forced to reduce production. In the fall of 1993 industry experienced the most feeble seasonal pickup in all the years of crisis. In January 1994 (during the period of traditional seasonal stability), there was an unprecedented decline, by 12 to 17 percent compared to the December 1993 level according to various estimates. The decline in one month was virtually equal to that for all of 1993! In February the volume of industrial production stabilized at the extremely low January level, thus confirming that the decline in January was not random in nature. In the process the volume of production in machine building dropped by more than one-half compared to January 1993 (according to preliminary data it fell by one-quarter in industry as a whole in the first quarter of this year). The worsening financial standing and stoppages of enterprises are bringing about a rapid growth of arrears in the payment of wages and forced furloughs for workers. In the last five months (October 1993 through February 1994), arrears in the issuance of funds for labor compensation in industry, construction, and agriculture increased by a factor of 5.2, of which in the last two months--by a factor of 2.6. As of 1 March more than 8,000 industrial enterprises had arrears; in February the latter exceeded the monthly labor compensation fund at these enterprises by a factor of 1.25. A reduction in effective demand by workers who have failed to receive wages restricts final demand even more. Mounting financial difficulties hit the budget like a boomerang: Proceeds from the profit tax are dropping sharply (in conjunction with reduced profits), as are those from value-added tax (in conjunction with mounting nonpayments), income tax, and some other taxes. The economy ends up in a vicious circle: Failing to receive revenues, the budget reduces expenditures, which diminishes the value of final demand; this brings about a worsening of the financial standing of enterprises, lower profits, and growing nonpayments. The knot becomes ever tighter. As the results of January and February indicate, even a direct tax increase does not bring about an increase in budget proceeds; losses due to the deterioration of the economic situation are considerably greater. The increase in import duties effective 15 March will most likely bring about smaller budget revenues due to a reduction in imports. Shortfalls in financing for agriculture are one of the reasons for a reduction in the planted area. In the fall of 1993, an area 20 percent smaller was planted in winter crops, which will bring about a loss of the crop of approximately the same magnitude. Planted areas are likely to shrink in the spring of 1994, too. This means that there will be fewer foodstuffs this year, and they will be more expensive. In 1992 and 1993 the slump in agriculture was minimal, and this mitigated the deterioration of the economic situation in the country. In 1994 the situation might change, and a reduction in agricultural production will accelerate the industrial slump rather than mitigate it. The policy of increasing taxes and cutting back on budget expenditures will not actually bring about a reduction in the deficit. It will bring about a cataclysmic fall in production, deterioration of the financial situation in the economy, and a surge in the budget deficit; paradoxical as it may be, as a result of this policy revenues will grow (inflation!) conspicuously slower than expenditures. The general economic situation in Russia obviously deteriorated sharply at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994. In this situation, the government prefers to pretend that nothing special is happening. However, if the deterioration continues at the same rate, the most elementary projecting methods result in an estimated slump in industry of more than 30 percent, i.e. almost by a factor of 1.5, rather than 8 percent (as in the original projection of the government), 12 percent (as in the revised projection), and not even 20 percent (as in the pessimistic projection)! Let us recall that the president's Budget Message for 1993 submitted to the Supreme Soviet contained the following macroeconomic projection: inflation--a factor of 3.4 during the year, slump in industry--7 percent, budget deficit--7.2 percent of GDP and about 25 percent of expenditures. The actual numbers for 1993 were: inflation--a factor of 10, slump--16.2 percent, budget deficit--10.5 percent of GDP and about one-half of expenditures (and then only at the price of rigid restrictions and debts of the budget carried over into 1994). If we look at the 1992-1993 situation as a whole and try to distinguish the principal causes of this profound fall in the volume of industrial production (just under a factor of 2), we can distinguish two causes--a reduction in investment and a loss of sales markets. The government projects a further decline in investment for 1994. Indeed, there is no hope that investment will grow under the stated policy. Undoubtedly, investment from the budget will be extremely limited (in conjunction with attempts to achieve inflation-control goals). Following the events of 21 September-4 October 1993, the investment climate for domestic, to say nothing of foreign, private capital investment is extremely unfavorable in view of sharply higher political risk. This is why new decisions will be needed in order to stabilize the volume of investment--yet another revision of the cost of fixed assets of enterprises, the expansion of centralized credit provision through government channels, or an increase in the budget deficit. Between 1989 and 1993 Russia successively lost traditional markets for the sale of its products. The markets of the former socialist countries were lost from 1989 through 1991 in conjunction with the disintegration of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. The markets of the former Union republics were lost in 1992 and 1993 in view of the deliberate liquidation of the united ruble zone by Russia. Finally, in 1993 Russia began to lose its own domestic market in conjunction with the policy of stabilizing the exchange rate of the ruble in the environment of high inflation: Imported products are crowding out the domestic producer. The Budget as an Instrument of Economic Policy It is impossible to bring inflation in the Russian economy down in the short term; its roots are profoundly institutional and structural in nature. Regardless of the will and wishes of reformers, the Russian economy has entered a phase of fluctuations which is known in economic science under the name of "stop and go" [rendered in English in the original]: Periods of stricter monetary policy give way to periods of relaxation. This sets a certain cycle in the economic and political life of the country. However, in this instance it is necessary to feel quite clearly the change in policy from "stop" to "go." In late 1993 and early 1994 this change is obviously due. Persisting in the "stop" policy is bringing about an ever greater slump in production in industry and agriculture, deterioration in the structure of the economy, stoppages at enterprises, and rapid growth of first hidden and then overt unemployment, with all the ensuing social and political conflicts. We consider institutional and structural transformations in the economy against the background of relatively stable and predictable budgetary and monetary policies of the state to be the main tasks of economic policy at present, rather than fighting inflation. Our main priorities in economic policy should be as follows: --growth of state investment (budget and off-budget) and incentives for private investment; formation of the capital market; --incentives for shifts in the structure of production in favor of products of final demand and those with a high degree of upgrading; --support from the state for reforms in all sectors of the economy. To properly devise the budget for 1994 it is first of all necessary to build into it a realistic, realizable macroeconomic projection designed with the likely influence of the economic policy of the state taken into account. In view of the worsening macroeconomic situation in Russia at the beginning of 1994, a minimum task should be set before the budget for 1994: to strive to refrain from worsening the main macroeconomic characteristics compared to last year. The impatient aspiration to improve these characteristics quickly has already resulted in a cataclysmic slump in industry. This is why, in view of the results of the first quarter of 1994, the deterioration of the indicator of the industrial slump can no longer be avoided. It is realistic to proceed from the statistic of decline in industrial production of 20-25 percent this year (that is, the maintenance at the end of the year of the level of production of the first quarter of this year). For the most part, the state is left with the device of funding out of the deficit in order to slow down the fall this year. This device should be used. Of course, in the process it is necessary to contain inflation within certain limits, for example, 15-20 percent per month this year, with this plank subsequently being reduced yearly. It would be necessary to use the secured "respite" in fighting inflation in order to develop reforms in the principal sectors of the economy. This is how a budget for 1994 which would reflect such an economic policy could look in terms of the principal economic parameters. The revenue base should be real. This means that, on one hand, the standard of collected taxes should not be overstated, and on the other, it will be necessary to take full advantage of the potential to augment revenues. Unfortunately, the possibilities for increasing revenues are few. Most of them are associated with foreign economic operations--revision of the volume of product transactions to meet state needs (it is necessary to sharply reduce it), as well as compliance with the requirements of the Law "On the Customs Tariff" with regard to the cancellation of preferences in export and import operations. However, the cancellation of preferences will likely necessitate a partial increase in directed grants and state investment, which will be included on the expenditure side of the federal budget. It is necessary to think over the possibility of increasing proceeds from post-voucher privatization. It is necessary to consolidate most off-budget funds within the federal budget, with their expenditure side analyzed. Of course, it is necessary to step up monitoring of the collection of taxes, as well as export and foreign exchange controls. The proportion of state expenditures in the budget for this year should be approximately at the same level as in 1993, and a little higher--in proportion to the growth of budget revenues. This puts the size of the budget deficit at 40-50 percent of its expenditures. However, with a view to ensuring a turnaround in the future, it is necessary to change the structure of the expenditure side of the budget: Expenditures should be increased for items that will produce real returns in the long term. This is primarily investment. It is necessary to make investment in keeping with the special-purpose federal programs developed by the Ministry of the Economy. In this instance it is better to follow the path of increasing financing for already approved investment programs without starting new ones, and of concentrating investment on construction sites that are close to completion. Of course, it is necessary to improve the quality of the development of such programs, taking into account world experience of project financing and perhaps with technical assistance from international financial organizations. In addition, investment along the lines of joint financing of special-purpose programs of local budgets is promising, as well as joint financing with the private sector (primarily but not only in housing construction); the latter is particularly significant for enlivening investment activity. Federal investment should not come as a grant in the course of joint financing; it is necessary to record it as a share of the property of the enterprise being built (retrofitted), with the possible privatization of this share in the future. The mechanism for financing the difference in interest rates on long-term loans out of the budget may be used more actively. Measures of state support for the development of a capital market are necessary--a reduction in taxes on operations with securities, incentives for an active investment policy on the part of state and nonstate institutional investors, and the creation of an infrastructure for the development of investment projects (investment banks and companies, a change in the direction of work of the Committee for the Management of State Property, and so on) etc. Second, there are expenditures for real reforms. This is support for small businesses (for example, the budget fund could be increased by a factor of 50 to 100), an increase in the fund for enterprise reorganization in the coal industry and the creation of a similar fund for enterprises from other industries; a state program for voluntary enterprise bankruptcies; realistic conversion programs associated with the reorganization of production; active shaping of the labor market; reorientation of the privatization process away from distribution of property by checks toward holding auctions and investment competitions (won by those who want to invest the most); incentives for exports and import substitution, and many other things. Third, these are appropriations for science, culture, education, and health care--not an increase in expenditures for all items in these sectors but rather financing for reforms in them: a transition to funding mostly scientific projects rather than institutes; incentives for a transition to insurance-based health care; tax exemptions for noncommercial activities, and so on. Finally, appropriations for defense should be used to mitigate the consequences of already planned reductions in the strength of the army and its transition to a greater degree to the professional principle of organization; changes in the structure of the state defense requisition; and meeting disarmament obligations. Much of what has been described here can and should be done as early as in the 1994 budget. We propose to reject in the first reading the draft 1994 federal budget submitted by the government and to return it to the government for revisions. One month could suffice for the government to do this. It would then be possible to manage to approve the budget before the beginning of the third quarter in view of the fact that the budget for the second quarter has already been approved, and that the specially developed accelerated procedure for approval of a budget by the Duma takes 40 days. In view of the sharply higher instability of the economic situation in Russia, the real lead time in budgetary planning comes to one or two quarters. This is why it can be recommended that the government submit to the Duma a budget for the third quarter or for the second half of the year. Correspondingly, quarterly reports on implementation of the budget should be submitted (as of today even the 1992 report has not been submitted to the Duma, to say nothing of the first quarter of 1994). It is necessary to consider the federal budget together with other fundamental decisions on economic policy--confirmation of the Main Directions for Monetary Policy and the reports and budgets of the off-budget funds. Besides, a macroeconomic projection and calculations for the consolidated budget (that is, those with the drafts of regional budgets) in primary form are needed within the Budget Message in order for a decision to be made. Unfortunately, not one of these documents has been submitted for consideration by the Duma so far. * * * The 1994 federal budget is unacceptable in the form in which it was submitted. It is too harsh for our economy, which is still ailing. If the budget were rejected in the first reading, with precise recommendations given for revising it, a forward-looking economic policy could be started as early as the second half of 1994. The 1995 budget could then be developed proceeding from the accomplishments of 1994. Of course, we could hardly expect a quick improvement in the socioeconomic situation. However, it is important to embark on a path that leads out of the abyss as soon as possible.
