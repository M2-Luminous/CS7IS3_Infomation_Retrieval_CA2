As a result of the member survey, it will soon become clear how many people have left the party. We spoke about this and about possible cooperation among the opposition in the course of the coming local government elections with Gabriella Farkas, the outgoing deputy executive chairman of the MDF. The Executive Committee has put Gabriella Farkas in charge of guiding the party machine until the national conference scheduled for the autumn. [Csik] The MDF Executive Committee asked its members in writing to indicate whether they continue to feel themselves as party members. What is the reason for this survey of members? [Farkas] The results of the recent elections and the subsequent slightly bitter mood of the members justifies the question of whether we can and want to continue working. This way, we can see who are the members that we can count on both in the course of the experts activity helping the party's parliamentary group and in the local government elections. There will, obviously, be people who say that they no longer want to continue with us, but I do not think that there are many of them. If we did not take the risk in facing up to this, we would be having to build on sand. [Csik] The party will have to say goodbye to 320 paid employees out of a total of 400. Does this mean that the structure developed in the past four years will also change? [Farkas] According to our election results, our budget support will decrease considerably. This is why we have to reduce the apparatus both in the central office and the provinces. Although we are streamlining our party, the system and principles will remain the same; we will be able to rebuild all of this without special restructuring when we have the means to do so. [Csik] The opposition, including the MDF, will now represent a much smaller weight in parliament than in the past four years. Will there be any possibility of opposition politics at all? [Farkas] If the government coalition wants it, they can pass almost everything through voting. However, I think that, through the committees, we will have the chance to assert our opposition position. The composition of our parliamentary group is fortunate too, because we can send expert and well-trained deputies to every parliamentary committee. I simply do not believe that it can happen in a democratic parliament that a better proposal than that of the government party is rejected merely because it comes from the opposition. [Csik] Local government elections will be held in this autumn. Can you envisage cooperation between the opposition parties to defeat the government parties? [Farkas] I am convinced that there is a need for local cooperation. Not only because this is a possibility that brings results, but also because only this can be a successful policy in local political activity. Local political activity should be "above" the parties participating in the election struggle. One of the most important principles is who can do most for the given town or village. I can envisage a situation in which the opposition parties will run with a common candidate in many places or they will support each other's candidates. [Csik] The MDF will hold a national conference in autumn. To what extent will the leadership change? [Farkas] The MDF national conference will have to complete the "documentation" of the election defeat. We will not be able to start building if we drag out this analysis for too long. Our election failure was not only due to human error or mistakes. The kamikaze role that the party accepted in 1990 is among the major causes of our defeat. I hope the causes will be examined honestly and the election of a new leadership will be made accordingly. If we do not do this, we will be going the wrong way. It is absolutely certain that part of the leadership will change. Obviously, the members are dissatisfied with some leaders, but some members of the leadership will be needed for continuity. This will not be another party. This will remain the Hungarian Democratic Forum.
