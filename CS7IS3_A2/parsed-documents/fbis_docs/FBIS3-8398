Addressing the first rally of the Young Democrats' election campaign, Orban said, "Over the past few years the Fidesz proved that it could represent the ideas of political and national unity in an authentic way." "The Fidesz was perhaps the first party in the 20th-century history of Hungarian liberalism which could reconcile liberalism with national commitment," he said. The Fidesz chairman said the country needs a government which helps stabilize democarcy and is committed to Hungary's soonest possible membership in the European Union and NATO. "A liberal government has the best chance to cope with the tasks the country will face in the coming years," Orban said. Concerning the strengthening of the Socialist Party, Orban said most people wish calm, security and a better life rather than a return to the past.
