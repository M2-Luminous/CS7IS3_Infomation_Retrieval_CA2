He estimated that the debt will be close to 500 billion [Finnish] markkas [FMk] in 1997. Viinanen said the European Union (EU) solution will increase the need to take out around FMk10 billion in new loans next year, while at the same time the ministries have exceeded their budget limits for next year by FMk11 billion. Such a situation is serious and precarious, the finance minister stressed. "The debts are becoming an enormous burden on the national economy, but many choose not to see this," said Viinanen. "However the fact is that the billions that go to service the national debt must be taken from somewhere." Viinanen pointed out that it is still true that state spending is rising at a faster pace than revenues. Tax revenues will not increase much during the late 1990's, he said, at least not to the extent that they will offset national budget deficits.
