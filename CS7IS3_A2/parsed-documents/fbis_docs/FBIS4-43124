"The persons in question are not in any way related to the Mujahedeen and its activities," it said in a statement sent to AFP in Nicosia. "The Government of Turkey is responsible for the protection and safety of all Iranian asylum-seekers," the group said, a day after the Turkish news agency ANATOLIA said they were being expelled to Iraq. "If for whatever reason it does not wish to accept them, it must relocate them in European countries with the help of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees," said the Mujahedeen. It said the group had helped the 16 Iranians seek refuge in Turkey for humanitarian reasons only. They had been living in Ramadi, west of Baghdad, and some had been POWs during the 1980-1988 war between Iran and Iraq. But ANATOLIA said the 16 had confessed to having entered Turkey with false passports and received military training at a Mujahedin camp in Iraq. The Turkish Interior Ministry rejected their request for political asylum and drove them to Silopi on the Iraqi border, it reported, quoting a senior police official as saying the expulsion was a goodwill gesture to Iran.
