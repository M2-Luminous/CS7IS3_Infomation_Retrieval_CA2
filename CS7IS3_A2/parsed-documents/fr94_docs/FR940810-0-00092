FR940810-0-00092 FR940810-0-00021 NIOSH has found that airborne fibers are released in the work place when glove bags are used to remove asbestos pipe. Although the reasons for these releases were not determined, the study indicated that glove bags did not control asbestos exposures as anticipated. Thus, NIOSH strongly supports OSHA in requiring that negative-pressure enclosures be used in conjunction with glove bags. Furthermore, NIOSH recommends that OSHA require the use of respiratory protection when glove bags are used. At a minimum, NIOSH recommends that workers should be required to wear the most protective air-purifying respirators␣*␣*␣* (Tr. 229) The study evaluated the removal of asbestos containing pipe lagging using glove bags from four public school buildings. The data were obtained during week-long surveys in each of the buildings. According to the abstract in the evaluation: ``the same work crew removed asbestos-containing pipe lagging in all four schools. Personal exposures to airborne fibers were determined using the NIOSH method'' (Ex. 125). NIOSH summarized the results: ``*␣*␣*␣In three of the four facilities studied, workers were exposed to airborne asbestos concentrations above the OSHA PEL. Only in the last building where the removal took place, were exposure levels reduced to below the new OSHA PELs.'' Interpretation of the results of this study varied. BCTD viewed the study as supporting its view that glove bags should not be permitted for other than small scale, short duration jobs because they do not provide reliable protection for bystanders. (Ex. 143, p. 98). HEI concluded, based on the NIOSH study, that ``*␣*␣*␣glove bags should never be used as a stand alone abatement isolation procedure for long pipe runs'' (HEI, Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 5&hyph;48). Clearly these results call into question any expansion of permitted glove bag use. However, after paying close attention to the conditions, personnel and equipment utilized in the NIOSH study, and to the rest of the record, OSHA believes that glove bag systems, when properly deployed and supplemented by barriers, are capable of protecting both the abatement worker and bystander employee. Details of the improper usage in the NIOSH study were pointed out by Grayling and CI and by the NIOSH investigators themselves; ``the methods employed by workers␣*␣*␣*␣violated current state-of the art glove bag procedures␣*␣*␣*␣(t)he glove bags contained over four times the recommended material, they were opened up and slid down the pipe, *␣*␣*␣(t)hey were used as a receptacle rather than as a glove bag, *␣*␣*␣the envelope was slit to speed the removal process, *␣*␣*␣bags were being sealed while removal was taking place␣*␣*␣*'' and other improper procedures (Ex. 130, Ex. 125). In addition, although NIOSH noted ``[w]orker training and experience are important components in a reliable system of control measure, *␣*␣*␣(in this study) the work crew was not trained in the proper use of glove bags'' (Ex. 125, p. 20). Representatives of the glove bag industry also noted that since the study was undertaken in 1985&hyph;86, the equipment used by the workers, has been replaced by better designed and more protective equipment and materials. For example, one of the glove bags used in the study employed a zippered connection system, which ``promote(s) the free flow of contaminated air from the glove bag during removal␣*␣*␣*,'' and the ``one-size fits all'' glove bag has been replaced by a ``greater number of designs and configurations of glove bags␣*␣*␣*␣(for) T's, elbows, valves, verticals and extended runs'' (Ex. 130, p. 3). The study showed that by the time the removal activity reached the fourth (final) building, the work crew, having been ``trained'' by a variety of on-the-job methods, such as ``trial and error,'' advice from the survey team, and watching a videotape, exposure levels were dramatically reduced. The pre-removal levels were not lower at the final facility, approximately the same amount of asbestos was removed as in the other operations and the authors stated that the lagging was in generally good condition throughout the study_lending further credence to the hypothesis that the use of improved work practices led to generation of lower fiber levels. The report concluded with a list of recommendations for work practices for glove bag use. OSHA believes that the NIOSH study should be viewed as a demonstration of poor work practices by untrained employees. The Agency notes that although the NIOSH study contains carefully presented and analyzed exposure data, the study design was compromised by the intervention of the investigators in instructing the workers. Further, since the workers were untrained, and for the most part did not use the glove bags correctly to attempt to isolate the disturbances, the study is of limited utility in identifying problems of glove bag systems when they are used correctly. NIOSH speculated that ignorance of proper glove bag procedures was common for plant maintenance personnel, asbestos operations and maintenance personnel, and many asbestos removal contractors who use glove bags only occasionally'' (Ex. 125, p. 53). If indeed this is so, it suggests that short of prohibiting glove-bag removals entirely, restricting permitted usage to, for example, maintenance work (small-scale, short-duration work) may result in limiting permitted glove bag work to where it is likely to be performed incorrectly. It also suggests that, the frequency of glove bag work, rather than the size of the removal project is more relevant to its effectiveness. Other participants echoed this caution, for example, David Kirby of Oak Ridge National Laboratory testified that glove bag usage should be conditioned on showing quarterly frequency of glove bag usage (Tr. 116&hyph;17).
