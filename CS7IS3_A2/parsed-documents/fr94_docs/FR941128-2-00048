FR941128-2-00048 FR941128-2-00038 [OPP&hyph;50799; FRL&hyph;4903&hyph;9] Receipt of a Notification to Conduct Small-Scale Field Testing of a Genetically-Engineered Microbial Pesticide AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has received from American Cyanamid Company of New Jersey a notification (241&hyph;NMP&hyph;E) of intent to conduct small-scale field testing involving a baculovirus Autographa californica Multiple Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (ACMNPV) which has been genetically engineered to contain an insect-specific protein toxin from the venom of the scorpion Androctonus australis . American Cyanamid intends to test this microbial pesticide on lettuce, cabbage and leafy vegetables in the states of Florida and Texas. Target pests for these field trials include the cabbage looper and the tobacco budworm. The Agency has determined that the application may be of regional and national significance. Therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting public comments on this application. Dates: Written comments must be received on or before December 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments in triplicate, must bear the docket control number OPP&hyph;50799 and be submitted to: Public Docket and Freedom of Information Section, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person bring comments to: Rm. 246, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. Information submitted in any comment(s) concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI). Information so marked, will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment(s) that does not contain CBI must be submitted for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice to the submitter. Information on the proposed test and all written comments will be available for public inspection in Rm. 246 at the Virginia address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Phil Hutton, Product Manager (PM) 18, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 213, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA (703&hyph;305&hyph;7690). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A notification of intent to conduct small-scale field testing pursuant to EPA's Statement of Policy entitled, ``Microbial Products Subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act,'' published in the Federal Register of June 26, 1986 (51 FR 23313), was received on September 29, 1994, from American Cyanamid Company of New Jersey (NMP No. 241&hyph;NMP&hyph;E). The proposed small-scale field trial involves the introduction of a genetically-engineered isolate of the baculovirus Autographa californica Multiple Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (AcMNPV). The strain to be tested (VEGTDEL-AaIT) has been genetically modified with approximately 1 kilobase internal deletion in the ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase gene and an inserted gene which encodes an insect specific toxin protein from the venom of the scorpion Androctonus australis . The purpose of the proposed testing will be to evaluate the efficacy of this genetically-altered AcMNPV (relative to the gene-deleted construct and a commercial Bacillus thuringiensis insecticide) against certain lepidopteran species ( Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper and Heliothis virescens (tobacco budworm)) on lettuce, cabbage, and leafy vegetables. The proposed program consists of two field trials to be conducted late 1994 or early 1995 (depending upon pest infestation levels) in Florida and Texas. Both sites will be located on secured research farmland. The test will consist of a maximum of four treatments with four plots per treatment and a maximum of six applications per treatment. The maximum size of a given treatment plot in each test will be 0.018 acres (4 rows wide x 60 ft. long). The total acreage treated with the genetically modified construct will consist of 0.44 acres. Treatments will be applied to plots in the test area using ground equipment: small tractor sprayers or CO 2 driven back pack sprayers. Soil monitoring will take place both during the test and approximately 1 month after the crops are destroyed. Baculovirus present in the soil (if any) will be detected via bioassay and identified genetically using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique. Upon completion of the trial, crops will undergo crop destruction at the test site and adjacent buffer zones. Wild-type ACMNPV will be oversprayed if the genetic construct is detected in the area 100 feet from the site of application. Following the review of American Cyanamid Company's application and any comments received in response to this notice, EPA will decide whether or not an experimental use permit is required. Dated: November 14, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs.
