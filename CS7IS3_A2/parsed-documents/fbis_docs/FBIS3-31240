After he had held talks with Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency, Churkin met and held talks with Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. Summing up today's talks, Churkin told journalists the following. [Begin Churkin recording, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] First of all, I am very glad to have had the opportunity to meet Prime Minister Silajdzic and President Izetbegovic. This time I came here mainly because I wanted to see that the military disengagement that has started around Sarajevo is being carried out without a problem. You may recall that shortly after the tragedy in this town on 5 February, Russia demanded that the siege around Sarajevo be lifted, (?immediately). We are following this process very carefully and are trying to do what we can to make sure that this process continues. If this process turns out to be successful, we will have a new opportunity to find a political solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole. I am very encouraged by what I heard today from President Izetbegovic and Prime Minister Silajdzic. Naturally, I stressed that we hope that the forces of the Bosnian Government will show restraint in the days and weeks ahead. This will be demanded from all sides. I was also encouraged by the fact that the hosts spoke not only about the current crisis in and around Sarajevo, but also about the prospects for a political solution, and even more than that, about what can be accomplished between us in the time of peace that will hopefully come soon. [end recording] Briefly addressing journalists, Prime Minister Silajdzic stressed two aspects of today's talks. [Begin Silajdzic recording, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] The first is that we asked Mr. Churkin to influence as much as possible the situation in Sandzak, which is not in line with rapprochement and the peace talks. People are being arrested in Sandzak. The situation in Sandzak is very grave. We fear that the conflict could escalate, that stronger, more repressive measures could be taken. We know that 200 people have been arrested. We asked Mr. Churkin to work in this direction with the people in Belgrade as much as he can. This was one issue. The other issue concerned the possibilities for developing Bosnian-Russian relations in the future. We think that these relations do not have to be at the present level, and that they could be developed in the direction of global rapprochement. We are all slowly beginning to live in this global village. [sentence as heard] These are the two issues. Mr. Churkin spoke about other aspects of the talks. [end recording] Vitaliy Churkin then commented on his statement for Belgrade Radio that Russia will put a stop to the prospect of air strikes on Serbian positions. [Begin Churkin recording, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] I do not recall saying anything like that. The media also reported that a joint statement was issued after my meeting with Milosevic. This is not correct. There was no joint statement, neither a formal nor an informal statement. What I stressed, and I can repeat it, is that we believe that everything must be done to achieve this encouraging process of peaceful military disengagement in and around Sarajevo. I think that continuing the fighting and confrontations is in noone's interest. In this sense, yes, we are trying everything to prevent the escalation of the conflict here. However, I am also saying personally and publicly that if the process of demilitarization in and around Sarajevo fails, worst things will happen. I have made this point again and again. [end recording] The journalists were than again addressed by Prime Minister Silajdzic. [Begin Silajdzic recording, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] This must be the first step toward peace. NATO's ultimatum should be the first step toward peace, because, as I have stressed in the past, there used to be a military imbalance. This ultimatum is now restoring this balance to a certain degree. I believe that the balance of power maintained peace in Europe for 50 years. This principle was abandoned with everything else in Bosnia, but is now coming back. This will not be easy. However, goodwill must exist on all sides. Regarding our side, this will exists. We will meet all our obligations and we are striving for peace. [end recording]
