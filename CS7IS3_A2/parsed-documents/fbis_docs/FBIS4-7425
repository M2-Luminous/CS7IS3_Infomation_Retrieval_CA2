FBIS4-7425 "dreas083_l_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 Philippines PRC Legislators Deny Arms Buildup in Spratlys PRC Legislators Deny Arms Buildup in Spratlys BK2804142794 Quezon City MALAYA in English 26 Apr 94 p 2 BK2804142794 Quezon City MALAYA English BFN [By Shalom Mapagu and Ellen Tordesillas] [Text] Legislators from the People's Republic of China yesterday told their Filipino counterparts that there is no reason to be alarmed over reports that the People's Republic of China has increased its military budget by 20 percent. This, they said, did not mean there was an arms buildup in the disputed Spratly Islands or anywhere else in the region. Rather, the increase was dictated by inflation. "The cost of goods are rising in China," said Zhu Liang, chairman of the foreign affairs and defense committees of the PRC's National People's Congress. The Spratlys are being claimed in part or wholly by the Philippines, PRC, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei, and Vietnam. The Philippines and Vietnam have repeatedly expressed concern over reports that China has been increasing its military presence in this disputed territory. "Reports that we are expanding our military capabilities have been reaching the West. We think this is nothing but rumor," said Zhu Liang. The Chinese legislator said disputes between PRC and other countries "should be settled through peaceful negotiations." Zhu Liang emphasized that the Mainland China opposes military aggression. "Not now, not even in the future," he said. Liang was accompanied during the meeting with Filipino legislators by six of his colleagues in the National People's Congress. He met with the House Committee on Foreign Affairs chaired by Rep. Jaime Lopez (Laban [Lakas ng Bayan -- People's Power], Manila). Lopez hoped the Philippines' partnership and cooperation with China "will succeed very soon." He expressed confidence that China's participation in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would greatly enhance trade potentials in the Asia-Pacific Region. In the Senate, Sen. Blas Ople yesterday said the "wound" inflic??e recent visit here of .se President Li Teng-hui on Philippine-China relations has apparently been healed as manifested by the current visit of the Chinese parliamentarians. Ople, who accompanied the visiting parliamentarians to Malacanang yesterday, said, the visit "means they have given time for these irritations to heal." The parliamentarians were scheduled to come February but canceled it when President Ramos received Li who passed by Subic Bay last 9 February. "This means that Philippine-China relations can withstand a few challenges from time to time," Ople said.
