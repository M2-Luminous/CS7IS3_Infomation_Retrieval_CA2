This has turned out to be consensus reached by the deputies to the ongoing session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC). Necessary macro-control measures reflect the actual needs of the current Chinese economy with initial features of the market economy, some deputies held. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to bring the economy completely onto the track of the market economy at one stroke on the basis of decades-long practice of the planning economy. To some extent, market economy is in essence an economy under a developed legal system and characterized of fair competition, no matter in a socialist or a capitalist country, said Tao Dayong, a noted economist from the Beijing delegation. Therefore, the development of a socialist market economy without strengthening macro-economic control will give rise to economic disorder. Wu Shuqing, president of Beijing University and also a renowned political economist, said China started its modernization drive from a comparatively backward economic base. If China develops its economy by relying on the economic evolution out of its course, the market economy process will be longer and harder and the economy will be in no way competitive in the world. Facing the imminent task of curbing inflation and the disorderly capital investment, forceful macro-control measures, including some administrative means, will be entirely necessary and proper, some deputies said. In this aspect, the central bank should effectively control money supply and stabilize money value. The deputies voiced unanimous support to the various reform measures with regard to strengthening macro-control including the introduction of the tax-revenue sharing system, which they said is one of the most important elements in the whole macro-control system. However, the system should proceed steadily as it might exert more financial pressure on enterprises, those in coastal areas in particular, deputies from the coastal areas said. To effect a less uneven economic development between the east and west parts of the country, appropriate macro-control measures will help bring about a comparatively balanced economic development towards common prosperity, a provincial governor from northwest China has said. While agreeing the macro-control measures will be of benefit to the national economy as a whole in long-term prospective, some of the measures will possibly cause temporary financial problem in the immediate future, deputies from the underdeveloped regions said. For example, more investment will flow to coastal areas once commercial banks to be established start operation because the investment returns there is much better than in the west parts of the country. As a remedy, some deputies from the west suggested that preferential monetary policies be introduced and that development banks with more competitive rates and exclusively for western parts of the country be established.
