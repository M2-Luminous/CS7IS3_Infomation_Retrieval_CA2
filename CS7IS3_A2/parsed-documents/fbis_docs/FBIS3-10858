Lacalle termed his meeting with Clinton -- his first ever -- as "brief, but all in all, most satisfactory." During a news conference later, the Uruguayan head of state commented that the "scope" of Clinton's letter convening the Miami summit next December is unprecedented because "nongovernmental interest groups are invited to participate and hold meetings." He said: "If integration between intermediate sectors of our society is achieved between now and December, the summit will be a meeting of nations, to which governments will contribute by applying the political and legal wrappings to something prepared from the grassroots." Lacalle praised Clinton's idea of relating the struggle to "achieve prosperity with the strengthening of the democratic system in the entire western hemisphere." He said he was convinced that "even though the GATT trade talks unfortunately failed to meet all our expectations, I have no doubt whatsoever that trade links between countries of the hemisphere will be strengthened." "The integration of the Americas will be achieved in due time -- perhaps not in the near future, but certainly in the foreseeable future," he said. To attain this, it is important to "further the parallel development of integration processes like the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and NAFTA." Lacalle praised Clinton's endeavors, as he "campaigned for NAFTA with intelligence, boldness, and zeal -- which met with Latin American approval." The head of state declined to discuss who his country will vote for at the forthcoming elections for the OAS General Secretariat. "Uruguay will not voice its opinion. We have already decided, but we would rather not make it public until we are further enlightened through future negotiations," he noted. The president stated that Uruguay is in favor of settling the issue by consensus rather than having an all-out struggle at the polls. He believes the new secretary general will thus have greater support. Regarding the possibility of Cuba joining the OAS, Lacalle said: "Unless the Cuban Government changes its position," this is most unlikely. Lastly, commenting on the elections that will soon be held in his country, the head of state said: "There is special interest in hearing the proposals of the opposition because the proposals we submitted to Congress concerning state-owned enterprises and health care were voted down." Concerning the government's economic policy, Lacalle asserted that the important "adjustments" implemented were always accompanied by "a far-reaching social policy." Lacalle is on a private visit to Washington, where he will be presented with an award by the AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs Committee] (a pro-Israel lobby that gives annual awards to people who champion the cause of Israel and the Jewish people).
