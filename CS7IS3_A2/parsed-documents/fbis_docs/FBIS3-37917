None of the past election campaigns has had such a tenuous legal basis as the present one. There is no federation-wide law on the elections -- the State Duma is only just setting about producing one. On the other hand the president's Edict No. 1765 gave administration heads themselves the right to ratify local election statutes. You do not have to be a clairvoyant to predict that they will give free rein to their whims. This is just what they are doing. The administration in Voronezh has reserved the right to hold meetings of voters -- or not, as they please -- to nominate candidates for deputies, and to admit observers or not. The Tula administration head may himself appoint a section of the deputies to the representative body. The mayor of St. Petersburg has refused students and servicemen the right to vote while at the same time forbidding Federation Council members to stand as deputies. The Leningrad Oblast administration head will himself appoint municipal leaders (who should, of course, be elected by the people). So the executive branch offensive against representative branch prerogatives is continuing. But there is nothing to be surprised about here -- this is what step-by-step constitutional reform amounts to. It is more to the point to ask the question: What will become of the country if this impromptu approach extends to the whole of great Russia? As far as the range of views represented on the eve of the elections is concerned, it does differ, though not sharply, from that of December. All seven communist parties are vigorously nominating their own candidates this time (only Zyuganov's Communist Party participated in the federal elections), as are the parties with a popular-patriotic orientation. The regional organizations of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] are hedging their bets. Zhirinovskiy has stated that these elections have not the slightest significance for him -- all his thoughts are on the presidential election. But in the provinces the LDPR branches are not inactive and are counting on winning a majority of the votes cast -- which, to tell the truth, is hardly likely if you take into consideration the stiff competition put up by the left-wing and patriotic movements. The democratic forces, on the other hand, finally seem reconciled to the prospect of losing. Presidential Territorial Administration Chief Nikolay Medvedev even stated that a Red anti-presidential cordon could form around Moscow, taking in Lipetsk, Kursk, Orel, Voronezh, Ryazan, Mordovia, and Penza. Almost as in 1918: Then, if you remember, the government, ringed by the Whites, was forced to transfer from St. Petersburg to the Kremlin in Moscow. You can only say one thing definitely: Whatever the results of the elections they will hardly provide a solid basis on which to extricate ourselves from the crisis. The converse is more likely: Yet one more leg of the presidential chair will fold under him. But a poor result is nevertheless a result. The time is coming when to dramatize the outcome of the voting, to ring all the bells and cry "Russia, you've gone crazy" would be tantamount to summoning the spirits of revolution. Enough of that! It would be nice to enter the 21st century in a well-cut rule of law suit. Let presidential power be the pants and parliamentary power the jacket. Or the other way around, so long as there are no pistol muzzles jutting from the pockets. The pockets should contain only handkerchiefs, and these should be sweetly scented.
