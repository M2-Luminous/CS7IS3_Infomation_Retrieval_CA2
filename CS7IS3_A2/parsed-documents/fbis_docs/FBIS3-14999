Saburov, vice premier of the Republic of Crimea, by T. Ryabchikova; place and date not given: "'We Must Make Crimea Open to All'"] [Text] Ye.F. Saburov, who has accepted President Yu.A. Meshkov's offer of the vice premiership of the Republic of Crimea, arrived in Crimea the day before yesterday. Ye.F. Saburov is a candidate of economic sciences and full member of the Academy of Computerization and the Academy of Social Sciences of Russia. Following graduation from the Mechanico-Mathematical Faculty of Moscow State University, he worked in a number of research institutes. From August 1990 through April 1991 he was deputy minister of education of Russia, from April through August 1991 he headed the group of economic advisers of the chairman of the Council of Ministers, after this he was deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers and minister of economics of Russia, and since January 1992 he has been director of the Government of the Russian Federation's Center for Information and Social Technology. The day before yesterday, Ye.F. Saburov gave KRYMSKAYA PRAVDA his first interview. [Ryabchikova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, first of all, permit me to congratulate you on your arrival on native soil. You are truly a Crimean? [Saburov] Yes, I am. I was born in Yalta in 1946, Crimea is my home. Following school graduation, I left Yalta for studies in Moscow. I graduated from Moscow State University, married, and stayed on in Moscow. But, naturally, I never lost my connection with Yalta, with the Crimea. My parents live here, my friends are here. And every year, whatever the weather, as they say, I have tried to get to Yalta. [Ryabchikova] How will your citizenship problem, which greatly excites Ukraine for some reason or other, be decided now? [Saburov] You can get excited over anything. I do not believe that there is such a person as Ukraine. This is, you know, something out of Ilf and Petrov--when the roadside philosophers sit on the embankment and argue: France wants such and such, Britain wants such and such. There are no such people as France, Britain, Ukraine. There are certain politicians in both Ukraine and Russia to whom confrontation for some personal ends of theirs is profitable. I do not believe that this question is so insurmountable that it cannot be settled by way of compromise in negotiations. I am altogether a supporter of compromise and believe that compromise is very good, it is better than confrontation. After all, as Makarenko once said, if a Russian intellectual is a stickler for principle and sticks firmly to his positions, in half an hour the whole apartment is forced to take valerian. This is not necessary if a compromise is possible, if accord is possible. I believe that for Ukrainians and Russians the question of dual citizenship is simply a question of a normal life. Five million Ukrainians currently working in the Russian North are Ukraine also. [Ryabchikova] And, then, you have come home. [Saburov] Yes, this is truly the case. And it is altogether very strange to say that there is some Russian or Ukrainian economic science. I would like to give you some facts. What is Russian economic science? It is Yevgeniy Grigoryevich Yasin from Odessa. It is Belkin from Kharkov. It is Grigoriy Alekseyevich Yavlinskiy from Lvov. It is ultimately myself--from Yalta. The policy of such countries as China, which are calling on their compatriots to help their homeland and asking them to return and work, would seem to me absolutely correct, therefore. It is strange to me that the Ukrainian state is not calling to such a brilliant economist as Yuriy Vasilyevich Yaremenko, a Ukrainian, he emphasizes this, but talking about a shortage of personnel here. When Yu.A. Meshkov made me the offer and this become known, the telephone was ringing off the hook with calls from former Crimeans who live in Moscow and in Russia and who are doctors of economic sciences and very important specialists in particular sectors. They would very much like to come to Crimea and work for the good of their motherland. Does Crimea believe that these are not its sons? [Ryabchikova] How will you embark on the fulfillment of your duties? Where will you begin? [Saburov] I would like first of all to clearly determine what I can do and to remove all the exiting disagreements. I repeat: I am a supporter of compromise. This is not weakness but quite a strong position. And it means that I want to have freedom of action at the level I deem necessary. But for this I have to turn to the people of Crimea to learn my fellow countrymen's opinion. First, people must understand that there will be no miracle. Any person who promises to make Crimea replete and prosperous in two days is a liar. The people must not be fooled. I can promise only one thing--that I myself and the people whom I bring in will work as hard as they can for the good of Crimea. That we will try to do everything possible in this difficult situation with two inflating currencies and severed connections. With the strange games of politicians, who do not know what they are doing. I promise to make every effort to overcome the obstacles, which there will be, of course. I will take as the basis healthy business, primarily Crimean business, but with the attraction of businessmen of Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, France, whoever. I have already received certain offers. Very great interest has been expressed by Spain, for example. The Mediterranean countries are in principle longing to enter the Black Sea, and we must help them do so. We must make Crimea open to all. Crimea never was and must not be an island fenced off from all countries. It must become a focal point of interests. It is all this that will help create in Crimea prosperity and well-being and jobs and decent earnings, in a word, a normal life for society. [Ryabchikova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, could you name the members of the team you intend to bring from Moscow? And, further: How will you build your relations with the present Council of Ministers? [Saburov] I believe that the enlistment of quite serious, efficient personnel would be not at all a bad thing for the structure of government of the Republic of Crimea. I have won the consent of certain people to live and work here, in Crimea. But I will decide later. I need first of all to familiarize myself with the present makeup of the government and to take a look at and scrutinize these people. And, generally, I am not the sort of person who is inclined to go in for radical reshuffles for the sake of reshuffling. Each person who is currently part of the structure of government of the Republic of Crimea or its cities may count on my assistance, help, and the heartiest cooperation if he is really disposed to work for the good of Crimea. I will change people only if they are unwilling or unable to work or if they reject the proposals pertaining to a reform of the economy of Crimea which I intend to make. [Ryabchikova] What will your first steps in reform of the economy of Crimea be? [Saburov] There is a very varied structure of production in Crimea: industrial and agricultural and recreation zones and port installations. The speed of the solution of questions in these sectors will vary also, therefore. I understand what an onerous and difficult task this is, I understand that the economy of Crimea has been reduced to a condition which no longer fits within any economic notions even. This had to have been specially contrived. But it is easy to fall into the abyss, climbing out of it is not that simple. I anticipate a program of Crimea's emergence from the economic crisis being drawn up in the coming months. It will be quite complex, evidently, and will require complex technical approaches. This program will be presented for Crimeans' approval. To what end? First, compiling an intelligent program is only half the battle, because it then needs to be fulfilled. And, second, approval of a program in this way or the other imposes a responsibility on those who execute it. There is something for which people can be held to account. And in principle a person engaged in state administration (the executive) should be under supervision. For the executive, supervision means not trifling tutelage or immersion in paperwork but verification: whether the charted strategic program is being fulfilled or not. [Ryabchikova] In consenting to become vice premier of Crimea you familiarized yourself, in all probability, with Yu.A. Meshkov's program and the promises he made to the people. Do you consider these feasible? [Saburov] I would answer this question this way. For me personally it is perfectly clear that people voted for Meshkov inasmuch as he was, indeed, serious in formulating the question of an alliance with Russia, primarily of an end to the economic stupidities that have been perpetrated here. I believe that we need to tackle all economic matters on a purely professional basis, proceeding only from one consideration: whether things are better for people or worse. An alliance with Russia is extraordinarily important for Crimea. The question of the ruble zone. Poly-currency conditions, where several currencies are in circulation simultaneously, would seem more attractive to me. Not necessarily the karbovanets and the ruble, what is more, there is the dollar and the mark and everything else. Any economic decision is ambivalent, everything needs to be computed: Is this advantageous or disadvantageous. I fully understand Yuriy Aleksandrovich, who, of course, proceeded from the fact that being in the ruble zone is better than in the karbovanets zone. But for Crimea the question is now somewhat different: It needs to be understood what it is beneficial for us in Crimea to have as the special conditions. Everything needs to be looked at and computed here. I would like to make separate mention of relations with Russia. Russia will sign an economic treaty with Crimea if it is duly substantiated, if it does not cause any international obstacles, and if it is beneficial to Russia itself. We must proceed from the fact that no one will help us. Nor should they! We ourselves need to pull ourselves out of this difficult situation in which we have landed. It is natural that Russia was and remains the most important and most profitable partner of Crimea, as of all of Ukraine also. That treaties with Russia are possible. And that it is perfectly possible to fulfill the necessary conditions about which I have spoken. It is perfectly possible to have direct relations with Russia. But why only with Russia? We will endeavor to ensure that each enterprise of Crimea might have direct relations with Russian enterprises and with Greek, French, or Swiss enterprises. It is all the same to us--just as long as life becomes somewhat better. [Ryabchikova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, what was your family's attitude toward the decision to move to Crimea? [Saburov] What is my family? My mother lives in Crimea, although she is now in Moscow, it is true, since she has been indisposed. I brought her here because she could not live on her doctor's pension. Having worked, God knows, for so many years, she ultimately found herself destitute. But my mother is longing to return to Crimea, of course, as soon as it gets just a little warmer. My daughters are married, and they will, therefore, be going nowhere, most likely. And my wife was one of the main ones urging me to make this decision. Truly, I very much want to do what I can here. I very much want to live and work for the good of Crimea and its inhabitants--my fellow countrymen.
