FR941102-2-00033 FR941102-2-00023 The electric energy Enron proposes to transmit to Mexico would be purchased from electric utilities and Federal power marketing agencies. Enron asserts that such energy would be surplus to the requirements of the entities from which it would be purchased. Enron would arrange for the exported energy to be wheeled from the selling entities, over existing domestic transmission facilities, and delivered to the foreign purchaser over one or more of the following international transmission lines: San Diego Gas and Electric Company's (SDG&E) 230-kilovolt (kV), Miguel-Tijuana transmission line (PP&hyph;68); the SDG&E 69&hyph;kV line at San Ysidro (PP&hyph;49); the SDG&E 230&hyph;kV, Imperial Valley-La Rosita line (PP&hyph;79); El Paso Electric Company's 115&hyph;kV lines at Diablo, New Mexico (PP&hyph;92) and Ascarate, Texas (PP&hyph;48-A); Central Power and Light Company's 138&hyph;kV and 69&hyph;kV transmission lines at Brownsville, Texas (PP&hyph;94); and the 138&hyph;kV transmission lines permitted to Mexico's Comision Federal de Electricidad at Eagle Pass (PP&hyph;50), Loredo (PP&hyph;57), and Falcon Dam (PP&hyph;57) in Texas. Enron has suggested that the initial FE authorization be sufficient for all short-term exports of 90 days duration or less, at unspecified rates of transmission, over any of the international transmission facilities identified above. For exports over 90 days duration, Enron has suggested that it notify FE prior to commencing exports and that it provide the following information: (1) The name of the purchaser(s); (2) the term of the agreement; (3) the contract transmission route(s) and the name of the companies providing transmission wheeling services; (4) the related FERC Rate Schedule, if applicable; and (5) the point(s) of exportation. Enron further suggests that FE publish a notice of the proposed transaction in the Federal Register , stating that the transaction would be deemed approved and allowed to commence unless, within 10 days of publication of such notice, (1) a protest is filed, or (2) FE notifies Enron that the transaction is not approved. Subject to the foregoing, Enron could commence exportation at the end of a 10-day comment period. In the case of either a protest or notification of disapproval by FE, exports could not commence without specific authorization by FE. Before FE takes any final action on applications to export, it first must determine that the proposed action will not impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or will not impede or tend to impede the coordination in the public interest of facilities in accordance with section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. For applications from ``traditional'' electric power systems, the standard procedure is for the applicant to submit various technical studies which demonstrate the operation of the regional electric power supply system with the applicant exporting specified levels of power over identified international transmission lines. The applicant also is required to demonstrate that it would have sufficient generating capacity to sustain the proposed export under the terms and conditions of its export agreement, while still complying with any established reserve criteria. Since marketers generally could not be seen as having any ``native load'' requirements, the latter criterion of maintaining sufficient reserve margins appears inappropriate and unnecessary in this instance. Conversely, FE feels that the issue of coordinated use of regional transmission (i.e., parallel path flow) becomes more critical in the case of marketers because of the unspecified nature of the transactions, in terms of the magnitude and sources of the export, and the export points. FE recognizes the right of the marketer to compete in the electric power arena, as well as the legitimate reliability/operating concerns of the ``traditional'' electric power systems. Therefore, FE is proposing an alternative means for determining the reliability impacts in the case of exports by marketers. In lieu of the technical studies (power flow, transient stability, etc.) usually submitted in support of an export application, FE will consider accepting executed transmission wheeling/access agreements between the marketer/applicant and the owners of the transmission systems reasonably expected to be involved in providing transmission service to the export point. FE is considering requiring the submission of these transmission access agreements prior to any exports (short- or long-term) occurring over any particular export point. If an export order is granted, the applicant could ``activate'' any or all export points by submitting appropriate transmission agreements. After submission of the agreement(s), the applicant would be permitted to engage in short-term exports immediately, and long-term exports subject to the procedures discussed above. FE is soliciting comments particularly on the procedures it is considering for addressing electric reliability concerns and the authorizing of exports of longer than 90 day duration.
