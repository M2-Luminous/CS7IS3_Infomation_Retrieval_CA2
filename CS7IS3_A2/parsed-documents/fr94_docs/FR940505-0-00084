FR940505-0-00084 FR940505-0-00025 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 042594A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is closing the directed fishery for Greenland turbot in the Bering Sea subarea (BS) of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the Greenland turbot total allowable catch (TAC) in that subarea. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), May 8, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Senior Inseason Manager, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with ยง675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Greenland turbot TAC for the BS was established by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and subsequent apportionment of reserve (59 FR 21673, April 26, 1994) as 4,667 metric tons (mt). In accordance with ยง675.20(a)(8), the Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has established a directed fishing allowance of 3,967 mt, with consideration that 700 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the BS. This fishery begins at 12 noon, A.l.t., May 1, 1994. Because of the low directed fishing allowance and high interest in the fishery, there will be insufficient time to collect and analyze catch data and take appropriate action to ensure the directed fishing allowance is not exceeded. Therefore, based on the best available data, the Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the Greenland turbot directed fishing allowance in the BS will be reached by 12 noon A.l.t., May 8, 1994. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Greenland turbot in the BS, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., May 8, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at ยง675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under ยง675.20 and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866.
