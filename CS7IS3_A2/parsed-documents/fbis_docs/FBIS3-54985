Former President Abulfaz Elchibey, who was removed from power by a coup in 1993, issued a message stating that "an independent and democratic Azerbaijan is a major threat to imperialist forces." Indicating that Azerbaijan is living under extremely grave conditions, Elchibey called on the Azerbaijani diaspora to help the refugees. Elchibey repeated his call for unity and togetherness and said no power will manage to divide the people. In the meantime, opposition is growing against Geydar Aliyev, whose position has weakened because of growing economic disarray and further loss of territory after the fall of Elchibey. The detentions of the leaders of People's Front and Musavat Party, which forged a national unity on the instructions of Elchibey, is continuing. The reporters are under pressure following the introduction of censorship against the opposition papers. It is being reported that Mahir Memedov, one of the directors of the paper DZHUMHURIYET, has been detained and is being asked to resign his job. Geydar Aliyev, who disbanded the 37 volunteer battalions formed during the Elchibey era, has now ordered the detention of Adil Hashimoglu, who has been commanding the volunteer detachments since the start of the war with Armenians. Adil Hashimoglu, who commanded the units in Kubatlinskiy and Zangelanskiy Rayons at the request of Elchibey and who was instrumental in the latest military successes, was detained on the pretext that in complicity with the People's Front he was plotting a coup in Ganja against Aliyev. The detention of Hashimoglu, coming soon after the imprisonment of the people's hero Arif Pashaogly and Chief of the Security Directorate in Kazakhskiy Rayon, caused a reaction among the refugees in Ganja and Baku. Demirel Invited Aliyev It was agreed to set up a group to draw up a border agreement between Azerbaijan and Turkey. It was confirmed that the borders of Azerbaijan's Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic cannot be altered forcibly and that the 1921 Kars treaty recognizes guarantorship rights to Turkey. In a statement issued by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, it was stated: "Turkey will not remain a mere spectator if an attempt is made to forcibly alter the borders of Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic." In seeing off Gasan Gasanov at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Hikmet Cetin handed him a personal letter from President Suleyman Demirel. Cetin said that the letter is an invitation to Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev to visit Turkey. Gasanov stated that Aliyev will visit Turkey most probably in January and added that the Turkic republics' heads of state summit, which was held in Ankara on 29 October last year, will be held in Baku between 20-22 January.
