FBIS3-12754 "drnes043_n_94002" FBIS-NES-94-043 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Mar 1994 LEBANON Continued Commentaries, Reports on Church Bombing Syrian Position is `Main Question' PM0203120994 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 28 Feb 94 p15 PM0203120994 London AL-HAYAH Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Khayrallah Khayrallah article: "Between Two Massacres"] [Text] At first glance, one cannot but link the Zuq Mikha'il church massacre in Lebanon to the al-Ibrahimi mosque massacre in Hebron committed by a Jewish "fundamentalist" with the clear participation of others who believe that there is no possibility of coexistence between the peoples of the region and that there is only room for extremism, extremists, and continuation of violence. Of course, the timing of the church explosion appeared to be the best service to Israel because the crime committed in Lebanon provided the best evidence that there are "extremists" everywhere and that the ugly act committed against the worshippers in Hebron was part of the wider framework of imbalance in the region, a condition which made the peace process possible just as it made those opposed to the process resort to exceptional ways of fighting it. And so in the end it would appear that violence and terrorism are features of a general condition prevailing in the region, that what happened at the al-Ibrahimi mosque was an integral part of that condition, and that Israel itself will have to face the problem of its "fundamentalism" just as in the case of a good number of states in the region such as Algeria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. Such an argument appears to be solid and logical, but what is required is an understanding of the Lebanese situation, which must be viewed from a special angle because that small country is in the process of rebuilding itself after its government moved it out of the intensive care unit to pave the way for laying the foundations of a state and institutions that would take it healthily to the year 2000 and beyond. Lebanon is currently in labor. The Zuq Mikha'il church explosion cannot be isolated from the attempt to assassinate Christian clergy on their way to the al-Balamand monastery, the explosion at the Phalangist headquarters in al-Sayfi in the heart of Beirut on new year's eve last year, or the sectarian leaflets distributed at the time and the explosions which accompanied that in stores in various areas. All that was in the context of undermining the process of redrafting an integral national plan for Lebanon taking into consideration the fact that there is a need to rectify matters, particularly the injustice inflicted on the Christians in general after they were dragged into a "suicidal" plan and then into boycotting the latest parliamentary elections. That does not mean that other parties, such as Syria, do not bear any responsibility in the context of settling scores with certain leaderships to the point of deliberately humiliating them even if that means making a large number of Lebanese people feel that they are the "oppressed" group indeed. It is easy to accuse Israel of being the party behind the church explosion to divert attention from the al-Ibrahimi mosque massacre, but it is difficult to admit that certain groups in Lebanon, while pretending to be fighting Israel, actually in practice serve the policy of the Jewish state. They do so by seeking to sabotage the national basic program being implemented by the Lebanese Government at all levels beginning with the reconstruction of Beirut and reviving it as a civilized city in which people enjoy living together, not just a place of coexistence between the Lebanese themselves and Arab brothers and foreigners, and by pursuing a policy of terrorizing the Christians to block any attempt to restore political balance in the country. The main question remains: What is the position of the Syrian leadership on everything happening in Lebanon? Can Damascus continue to play the game of maintaining certain balances in the country through its ability to use "the extremists" and their practices in the framework of its regional policy? Finally, the church explosion must be seen as a blow to Syrian security in Lebanon. What will Damascus do? Will it continue to play the waiting game knowing that any weakening of Lebanon is ultimately a weakening of Syria and its ability to face Israel with a minimum degree of Arab coordination.
