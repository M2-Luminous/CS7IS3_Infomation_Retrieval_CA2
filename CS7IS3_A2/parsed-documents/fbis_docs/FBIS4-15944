In this context the Yekaterinburg-based association Russia's Taxes has been tasked within a month to work out and present to the State Duma a basically new tax system because without reforming the tax legislation "it is impossible even to start discussing the 1995 budget." Experts, however, doubt the feasibility of tax reform "Glazyev style." The Russia's Taxes association favors the idea of reforming the tax legislation in effect since 1992. The proposed concept was approved by sessions of the Sverdlovsk Oblast Council and the Russian Government. Nonetheless up to now it has not been viewed as a serious alternative to the existing taxation system. According to information in possession of KOMMERSANT-DAILY, the Yekaterinburg concept envisions a reduction (value-added tax from 20 percent to 13 percent) or full abolition (profit and income taxes) of those taxes which at present constitute the bulk of budget revenues, and also increasing the rate of resource and property taxes. It is proposed also to abolish the tax for exceeding the wages fund and basically to revise procedures for taxing enterprise property (exclude the enterprises' monetary assets from the tax base). The plan is to tax funds used for consumption; to impose a tax on the export of capital, the franchise to produce minerals, and "on ecology." According to estimates by the concept's authors, if their system is adopted, the taxation level for enterprises in the processing industry will constitute not more than 25 percent (instead of 44 percent at present). Moreover, increasing the tax on property will lead to its more effective and rational use. According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's experts, in spite of the fact that it is supported by a wide circle, the adoption of the new tax program promoted by Sergey Glazyev is unlikely -- because the idea of such a reform in the tax legislation is opposed not only by influential factions in the State Duma led by Gaydar (Russia's choice), Nikolay Medvedev (New Regional Policy), and Boris Fedorov (12 December), and representatives of the Finance Ministry and the State Tax Service but also representatives of the presidential administration. Thus, Yevgeniy Yasin, chief of the administration's analytical center, stated at a recent Interaction club meeting that "if the government does something `Glazyev style,' it would be a catastrophe."
