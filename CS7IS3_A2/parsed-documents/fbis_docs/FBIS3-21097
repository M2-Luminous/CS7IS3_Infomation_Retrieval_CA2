Discussing the merger of missile activities by Matra Defense and British Aerospace [BAe] Dynamics, Noel Forgeard, Matra-Hachette's general manager in charge of defense and space and chief executive officer of Matra Defense, writes in the group's in-house newspaper that "detailed talks between the teams are making progress, with both sides showing a desire to conclude the discussions as soon as possible in 1994." According to Forgeard, "it is very desirable that the resulting Matra-BAe (missile) company be joined by Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace [DASA], and it is very likely that that will happen in the medium term." For the time being, the French-German team is continuing its separate efforts to merge the missile activities of those two firms in a new company that may be called Euromissile, thus retaining the name of the current consortium. But this is not certain, since the two companies have asked for in-house suggestions regarding a less "Euro" name! What is certain, on the other hand, is that the merger of missile activities by Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace is in the final stretch. Officials met in Munich before Christmas to finalize their communication strategy with a view to an upcoming announcement regarding the new French-German missile company formed by Aerospatiale and DASA. It is therefore likely that we will see the simultaneous regrouping of Matra-BAe and Aerospatiale and DASA in 1994.
