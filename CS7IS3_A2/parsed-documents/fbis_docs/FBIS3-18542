That was the assessment made by Prime Minister Carl Bildt when commenting on the agreement between Sweden and the EU at a news conference yesterday afternoon. "Many of the myths that the no side has lived on can now be consigned to the trash can. The whole of the negotiating process shows that the EU takes account of our views," said Bildt, who claimed that in the negotiations the EU has accepted the majority of Sweden's demands. The prime minister stressed that this will be an important argument when it comes to persuading hesitant voters prior to the referendum. "I believe that there will be a yes in the referendum because the negotiations show that in European cooperation account is taken of national demands. ``We know one thing for certain and that is that outside the EU we will have no influence at all. ``We would become a peripheral state,'' Carl Bildt said. Not surprisingly, the prime minister was very pleased with the day's agreement in Brussels. "It is a very, very satisfactory result from the negotiations. This is the most important international agreement for Sweden this century," Bildt said. He praised the Swedish negotiators in Brussels who were led by European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel and called them diplomacy's answer to Sweden's national ice hockey team. Carl Bildt was unwilling, however, to discuss when a Swedish referendum should be held. This will now be decided in consultations among the parties represented in the Riksdag, he said. "But we should not drag our feet unnecessarily." Carl Bildt said that he was not unhappy that in a phasing-in period the reduction in Sweden's membership contribution to the EU will be less than what Sweden's negotiators had initially been demanding. "This is something that can of course always be discussed, but we did after all get half of what we demanded." Today at 0900 Carl Bildt will brief the Riksdag on the agreement in Brussels and answer the questions of Riksdag deputies.
