He told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that at the first planning meeting he told the Mayoralty officials: "Whoever does not agree to work with us can be dismissed." Tolstoshein noted that "so far few have expressed such a wish." Today he and his assistants have been at their desks since early morning. As already reported, criminal proceedings have been instituted against the Vladivostok Mayor Viktor Cherepkov. He has been accused of accepting bribes amounting to 3 million rubles. At the decision of the kray administration he has been removed from his post. The proceedings have been temporarily suspended until the arrival in Vladivostok of the investigator for especially important cases of the Procuracy-General, Konstantin Mavrin. "For ten months the former head of administration Viktor Cherepkov and his team thoroughly neglected the town's economy, including the building from which they administered the town," Konstantin Tolstoshein noted. "Apart from the documentation which the Procuracy has to sort out, everything there is tangled. No debit and credit books were kept, accounts were not kept properly. As a result financial funds were spent without thought." The newspaper BOLSHOY VLADIVOSTOK Tolstoshein affirms, "reflected the interests of Cherepkov and received at his personal order several hundred million rubles. And that at a time when there is a catastrophic lack of funds for social needs and the town's municipal economy is neglected. Seeing their extravagant masters, the officials of lesser rank were none too thrifty with the taxpayers' money either." Konstantin Tolstoshein said: "When I was asked to become head of the town administration, I thought for a long time. I realized it would be difficult: the townsfolk had been fooled by Cherepkov's populist slogans and promises. I myself am a native of Maritime Kray. I started as building site foreman, I became district administration head, then headed the committee for military industry of the kray's admidnistration. I am no stranger to difficulties."
