Mexico was seen as a stable country where social stability prevailed, he said. Tello Macrias also said Mexico has not taken into consideration the possibility of requesting aid from the United States or any other government. Tello Macias said Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis is the only voice to explain what is being done, how it is being achieved, and what is expected of the reconciliation process. Let us listen to him: [Begin Tello Macias recording] It would be advisable to avoid the proliferation of people playing the leading role in this situation. I believe it would be much better for the national and international public if there is only one voice. [end recording] Manuel Tello described as serious the possibility that other governments are supporting the armed movement in Chiapas because they would be hurting the country's sovereignty. He said that even though there is no evidence, the Mexican Government does not rule out the possibility that non-Mexicans are participating in actions with the armed group. The Mexican foreign minister, who until a few days ago was Mexico's representative at the United Nations, said the Chiapas conflict adversely affects various sectors of the population but said it is no reason to paralyze the country.
