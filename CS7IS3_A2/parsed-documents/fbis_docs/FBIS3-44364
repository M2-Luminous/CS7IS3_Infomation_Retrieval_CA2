Many people at home and abroad have used this remark to explain the relationship between China and the world. As the New Year approaches, various localities, departments, and enterprises throughout the country are speeding up their work, making plans to further increase their economic and trade contacts with foreign countries through in-depth reform and wider openness to the outside world. In the meantime, economic specialists and manufacturers in various regions of the world are enthusiastically discussing the "China factor." They have noted that since the publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important remarks made during his south China tour in the spring of 1992, along with the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] economic growth and the increase in comprehensive national strength, China has exerted an impact on the international community which is not to be ignored: In the various factors by which economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region is maintaining vigorous momentum, China is exercising the role of a "booster," and in the various endeavors to push forward the global economic development, China is a positive and active factor. A developing and flourishing China is making its greater contributions to the world peace and development. On this occasion of bidding farewell to the old year and ushering in the new, the colleagues of this newspaper's Economic Department held a forum especially on the subject of the relationship between China's economic development and the world economy. We now publish the following excerpts from it: More and More Serious Attention Has Been Paid to the "China Factor" Lu Zhenhua (7120 2182 5478): The vigorous momentum of economic development in China increasingly has attracted worldwide attention. Recently, the following four figures were most widely discussed by people: China's rapid economic growth has lasted for 24 months, China's economy has shown a growth rate of 12 percent, the economy in the Asia-Pacific region grew by 8 percent, and the world economy grew by an average of 2 percent. During these "24 months," China's places in world GNP and import-export trade volume have moved forward several times. Some people said that China's 12 percent growth rate has given impetus to the 8 percent growth rate in the Asia-Pacific region, and also has generated the world's 2 percent growth rate. At present, when many countries are considering ways to promote economic development, accelerate economic recovery, and lower unemployment rates, they all place the "China factor" at a high level -- something that has never been seen before. This is obviously practical. China is a developing country with its economy just taking off, so it is wrong to exaggerate the role of the "China factor." However, China possesses a vast market, as well as a great potential for opening up this market along with economic development. It is indeed an unwise move to overlook or abandon this market. According to statistics, over the past five years, foreign capital directly utilized by China amounted to approximately $30 billion. Meanwhile, it spent $400 billion in purchasing foreign goods. It is anticipated that during the Ninth Five-Year Plan, there will be an increase of more than 10 percent in these two areas. Such a large amount of capital and huge commodity market will bring many opportunities to various foreign countries and regions. Dai Lan (2071 1526): According to the latest World Bank statistics, foreign funds flowing into China in 1993 exceeded $27 billion, and China has become the world's largest country into which foreign capital has flowed. In the 15 open cities, more than 240 representative offices have been set up by over 130 financial institutions from 29 countries and regions. The quick access to China by foreign banks and their extensive involvement have attracted people's attention. Since last year, China's stocks have crossed the Pacific Ocean and begun trading in the renowned stock market in Wall Street. Wall Street financiers likened the Chinese stocks to "mountaineering tigers." Over the next five to 10 years, China, being a major region for the future development of "energy" in the world, will see substantial growth in the securities markets. Japan's Nomura Securities is the first foreign organization to set up a representative office in China. Nomura took an optimistic attitude toward the relatively high growth rate that China will be maintaining and the funds that China will raise on the largest scale ever seen in history for the development of its agriculture, energy, transportation, and telecommunications in a period of time to come. Through Nomura's introduction, more than 300 Japanese enterprises have come to China one after another to set up foreign-invested enterprises there. In addition, it has specially set up the Nomura (China) Investment Company, Limited, to engage in various investment projects of considerable size in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, and other cities. Thus it is obvious that China's vigorously developing economy really has provided good opportunities for foreign funds. Overseas Manufacturers Are Optimistic About the Markets in China Xu Zhengzhong (6079 2973 0022): China's consumer market is an enormous one, and is significantly characterized by the growth of its market capacity outpacing its economic growth. This year, China's total volume of social commodity retail sales will increase by 23.5 percent. Also, judging from the consumption structure, both daily consumer goods and durables have universally begun to change to a diversified pattern at multiple levels. The strong demands of China's consumer market not only accelerated the readjustment of the world's industrial structure of consumer goods, but also brought about the prosperity of these trades. This is demonstrated by the fact that at present, many countries are contending with each other in studying China's consumption structure in order to be suited to the consumer market in China. In addition, the brisk consumer market in China also provides outlets for the substantial amount of idle funds from all over the world. At present, owing to the sluggish markets in quite a few countries and regions, the return rate there has been seriously affected, but the stable and prosperous consumer market in China has provided investors with exactly the environment and confidence for their success. Lu Zhenhua: The striking characteristic of China's market is its hugeness, with great potentials and multiple levels. Domestic manufacturers have placed high hopes on it, and it has an appeal for overseas manufacturers. Analysis of the prospects of China's market just according to the increase of 22.5 percent of the total social commodity retail sales across the country in the first 11 months of this year over the corresponding period last year is not comprehensive enough. We should note that at present, there exist privately owned foreign exchange amounting to nearly $10 billion and personal savings exceeding 1,600 billion yuan, which are potential forces for consumption. If we analyze China's market potential from a deeper level, people will come to some kind of understanding that is more encouraging. First, the total population of the Western developed countries is about one-half China's current population, which, though under control, is still growing at a rate of 1 percent. The demands of such a huge population at multiple levels certainly will give impetus to world commodity production. Second, the markets of the Western countries have tended to mature, while the development of China's market has just begun, and is full of opportunities. Third, the economic development achievements attained by China over the past dozen years have been shared by the great majority of the people, and with their income growing, they are rapidly turning into actual market demand. Today, many overseas manufacturers' opinion that the "China market should not be lost" stems precisely from their considerations of immediate and long-term interests. China's Economy Is Being Linked to the World Economy Liu Luyan (0491 7627 3601): China's foreign economic relations and trade made a stride forward in 1993 on the basis of sustained development. It is anticipated that the total value of exports will be over $91 billion and imports will be approximately $100 billion. Regarding direct foreign investment, a grand total of some 130,000 foreign-invested enterprises have been approved; industrial output value accounted for six percent, and import and export volume accounted for over 20 percent of China's total. [as received] This indicates that the dependence of China's economy on foreign countries has increased repeatedly, and its relationship with the world economy has become closer and closer. In this era when science and technology are advancing by leaps and bounds, it is an irreversible tendency to merge the domestic economy with the world economy. Since reform and opening up, China has made unremitting efforts to link its economy to that of the world. The foreign trade structural reform has been deepened deliberately, with its intensity being further increased this year, the management of export quotas and licenses has been relaxed, the imposition of import regulatory taxes and requirement for all lists of imported substitute goods have been canceled, and import tariffs have been reduced twice. All this has enabled China to move closer to GATT requirements. As a participant in the Uruguay round of talks, China has made major adjustments in its foreign trade policies according to the requirements of the talks, and has drawn up a list of tax reductions or remissions for agricultural and nonagricultural products, the service trade, and so on. In short, China is moving positively toward standardized international trade. Qin Jingwu (4440 0079 0582): In China's primary energy (yi ci neng yuan 0001 2945 5174 3293), the development of petroleum particularly requires international cooperation. In 1992, when China designated the East China Sea and Tarim Basin for foreign companies' prospecting and development at their own risk, scores of foreign companies submitted tenders. In the meantime, China discovered a number of oil and natural gas deposits in the Tarim, Dzungaria, Turfan, and Hami Basins. Moreover, China's oil industry has emerged from the national boundaries and has engaged in overseas oil prospecting at its own risk. It has signed agreements on oil prospecting with Canada, Peru, Thailand, and Papua New Guinea, which indicates that China has set up a global concept of oil exploration in order to seek cooperation for energy development in the sphere of the world. Xu Zhengzhong: During the decade before reform and opening up, China mainly exported some labor-intensive preliminary materials and rough products, and the ratio between them and the technique- intensive products for exports was 7:3. Alongside the technological advance and industrial structural readjustment, the proportion of finished products in the country's export commodities grew so rapidly that the former ratio has been reversed to become 4:6. More and more China's hi-tech products have crossed national boundaries to take part in international competition. This certainly will exert an impact on the industrial structural readjustment of international trade.
