FR941219-0-00058 FR941219-0-00016 Questions Involving State Law Preemption One commenter asked about the effect of Section 6 on State laws. While Section 18 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2616) sets forth general provisions regarding preemption, Section 6 contains its own preemption provision. The Secretary believes that one of the significant achievements of Section 6 was the elimination of perceived difficulties in the marketing of servicing rights for mortgage loans originated in various States. In part, Section 6 constituted a recognition of the de facto national market for mortgages and mortgage servicing and represented an attempt to facilitate such a market by establishing uniform standards. Therefore, Section 6 is determinative of the information required for the Servicing Disclosure Statement and the Notice(s) of Transfer; any other similar State requirements are preempted. Other provisions of State laws, such as those requiring additional notices to insurance companies or taxing authorities are not preempted by Section 6 or this rule. If permitted under State law, such additional information may be added to a notice prepared under this section. Requests for Exemption (1) Nine commenters requested that their institutions be exempted from providing Servicing Disclosure Statements, either because they were not institutions that transferred servicing or because they were chartered to make certain public purpose loans. Another commenter wanted an exemption for lenders that always transfer loans at closing; three commenters requested an exemption for lenders that do not sell the servicing rights. HUD response. While the Secretary has the authority to create classes of exemptions under Section 19 of RESPA, no commenter advanced a reason that would justify an exempted class. The Servicing Disclosure Statement is particularly appropriate when a lender always transfers loans at closing. When a servicer never sells servicing rights, it can simply state that fact. In any event, the information relating to complaint resolution must be provided, although lenders that do not transfer servicing may incorporate this information into the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A. HUD amended the Servicing Disclosure Statement to include a sentence in the heading suggesting that a borrower save the statement if a loan is approved and to include alternate language regarding the history of mortgage servicing transfers that is allowed under the 1994 amendments of Section 6. (2) In the event a lender changes its policy and begins to sell the servicing, a commenter suggested that these lenders have to follow the rule within six months after beginning sale of servicing. HUD response. When a lender determines that it will sell servicing, the lender will be subject to the requirement that it furnish to the borrower a 15-day Notice of Transfer. The lender may also be required to revise its Servicing Disclosure Statement at the next calendar year revision. There is no obligation to send an amended Servicing Disclosure Statement for previously closed loans at the time of the sale of servicing; the 15-day Notice of Transfer provides the required information. (3) Three commenters suggested that mortgage brokers should be exempt from furnishing the Servicing Disclosure Statement, because furnishing the Statement is the obligation of the funding lender. However, another commenter suggested that a face-to-face meeting with the mortgage broker should satisfy the face-to-face meeting requirement for a lender. Two other commenters stated that the time (3 business days) should begin to run after the lender receives the written application from another party. HUD response. The general rule is that the Servicing Disclosure Statement shall be provided within 3 days of receipt of the borrower's written loan application, unless the application for credit is turned down within that time. If an application is received by a mortgage broker that will close the loan in its own name using table funding, the table funding mortgage broker is to provide the Servicing Disclosure Statement, using the ``we do not service mortgage loans'' optional language in ยง3500.21(b)(4). Similarly, for first-lien dealer loans, the dealer should provide the Servicing Disclosure Statement, using the ``we do not service mortgage loans'' optional language. (4) A commenter questioned whether a Servicing Disclosure Statement is required when the mortgage servicing function is transferred to an affiliated entity. A question was also posited as to how to treat a circumstance when a lender had a program that always sold servicing and another where no servicing was required. HUD response. A Notice of Transfer generally is required when there is a transfer of servicing between or to affiliates, unless there are no substantial changes in the way the borrower makes payments (see discussion below). However, the information regarding affiliate or subsidiary transfers is not required to be included in the statistical computations found in the Servicing Disclosure Statement. In the interest of full disclosure, this information may be provided voluntarily; the model format allows for this disclosure. If the lender is providing the historical data, the lender should indicate whether the Servicing Disclosure Statement includes assignments, sales or transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries. When the lender has a variety of programs, some of which sell servicing and some of which do not, information may be added to the model format to allow the servicer to describe this situation, or some variation of this situation. Further, while the use of the acknowledgment is mandatory, the use of the model format is not, and the incorporation in a footnote or otherwise of reasonable additional information, to describe situations that do not fit conveniently into the format is anticipated and expected. Sample language describing other alternative situations has been included with the model format.
