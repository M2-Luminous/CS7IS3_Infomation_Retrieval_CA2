The complaint is an element of the careful Swedish monitoring of the political development in the former Soviet Union and East and West Europe. On the Swedish side it is stressed that the Western democracies should constantly insist that the relations between Russia and the weak states that were created after the Soviet collapse be governed by international law. "Anything else would be dangerous in view of the often fragile national formations," says Lars-Ake Nilsson, under secretary of state for foreign affairs at the Foreign Ministry. "The major Western powers have accepted the Russian interest-sphere thinking a little too easily, something we regard as unacceptable." Believe in Russia Nilsson, who was minister to Moscow for four years and ambassador in Prague for three years before being appointed the Foreign Ministry's highest spokesman, is commenting after the publication of SVENSKA DAGBLADET's series of articles "Uncertain East Europe." It has pointed up the fear of East Europeans that they might not make it into the West European warmth before a new icy Russian chill begins. The under secretary confirms that the principal orientation of the Swedish Eastern policy is to build up European security not against but with Russia. The essential part is to preserve and intensify the democracy that is stumbling ahead in Russia and help the Russians push through a policy of economic reform. "It is much too soon to write off the Russian democracy and give up all hope that the Russians will somehow succeed in getting through all the difficulties," in Lars-Ake Nilsson's opinion. "That is the scenario we are pursuing." In a country such as Poland, sharp criticism is being voiced against NATO for not already allowing the East and Central Europeans in, and a corresponding fear of Russian expansionism. Poles and others are talking about appeasement policies toward Russia, draw parallels with the 1930's, and find similarities between extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Adolf Hitler. The Foreign Ministry's evaluation is that Zhirinovskiy as an actor and political phenomenon is both disturbing and unpleasant, but that he is already quite busy unmasking himself. Various Groups "We hope that this will also have a full impact on Russian opinion, well ahead of the 1996 presidential election," Nilsson says. "Zhirinovskiy's political platform is not monolithic either, but consists of various groupings with conflicting interests. ``If things should go badly in Russia, which cannot be excluded, of course, there is still an opportunity to let the Visegrad nations (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary) into NATO. The alliance has not closed any doors for the East Europeans; on the contrary, it has opened up a way in.'' From a Swedish perspective the new proposal for entry into the Western alliance, Partnership for Peace (PFP), is a wise decision. If NATO right now had already welcomed membership for just the Visegrad nations, the Swedish thinking goes, it could have been misinterpreted in Moscow and led to risks for the Baltic states. It would have drawn a new line in Europe and not favored the Swedish security interests. Not Underestimate "We must not underestimate the importance of PFP," Lars-Ake Nilsson maintains. "This is one step in order to take care of the need for greater security that the Visegrad states have. It will also develop a network of contacts with the Russian military and with the officer hierarchy from the Warsaw Pact, which has only been reformed to a limited extent." An initial Swedish PFP agreement will be ready within one or a few months, according to the under secretary. He says that it is a strong Swedish wish that Russia will join the PFP, which President Yeltsin has been said to favor. Great Confusion The Baltic states occupy a special position in the government's Eastern policy, even if Ukraine's exposed position is an increasingly disturbing factor. Prime Minister Carl Bildt's statement that Sweden cannot be a spectator in the event of an attack on any of the Baltic states must be regarded as official policy. Pierre Schori, the Social Democrats' foreign policy spokesman, also a potential foreign minister if the government changes this fall, calls the prime minister's position "a peculiar solo trip, which has caused a great deal of confusion about the Baltic policy." Never Indifferent In a so-called policy speech about the Swedish foreign policy, Bildt has said, referring to, among other things, the Swedish attitude during Finland's Winter War, that "I find it difficult to see neutrality as a likely choice for Sweden in the conflict cases in our immediate vicinity that we can imagine today" and that "we can never stand indifferent before the forces that would try to overturn Russia's democracy or seek to undermine or crush the independence of the Baltic states." "I have had a major argument with Bildt about the Baltic policy in the Foreign Relations Committee," Schori reveals. He also says that he believes the entire Swedish Eastern policy to be in disarray. He refers primarily to the use of, or failure to use, the foreign aid that could help the East Europeans restructure their countries. Other than that, his wordings are very close to those of the government side. Pierre Schori regards the PFP (which he prefers to abbreviate PFF) as the embryo for all security order in the entire Europe. And he, just as Lars-Ake Nilsson, says that it is actually more important for the East Europeans to join the EU [European Union] than NATO. Softens the Impression When the PFP was created, Schori seemed to think that Sweden could not join unless Russia did. He now softens that impression by saying that Sweden should not enter a new security organization that excludes the United States and/or Russia. He also does not believe that the PFP will "survive" if Russia does not join. Pierre Schori does not criticize just the Western powers but also the Swedish Government for not having spoken up sufficiently clearly about the Russian interest-sphere thinking. He talks about "a Russian Monroe policy," which he equates with U.S. interventions in Panama and Grenada. "My point," Schori says, "is that superpower politics still prevail, even in the era of postcommunism." This is why there is all the more reason for Sweden to stand up for the international law.
