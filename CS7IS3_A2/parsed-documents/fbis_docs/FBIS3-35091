FBIS3-35091 "drnes034_v_94002" FBIS-NES-94-034 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Feb 1994 Pakistan Bhutto Speaks at Parliament on Kashmir, NW Frontier BK1602154794 Islamabad PTV Television Network in English 1400 GMT 16 Feb 94 BK1602154794 Islamabad PTV Television Network Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has expressed the confidence that the people of Kashmir will get their inalienable right of self-determination under the leadership of the Pakistan People's Party [PPP]. She was responding to the speech made by the leader of the opposition, Mr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, in the National Assembly this afternoon during the debate on the current political situation in the country with a particular reference to the situation prevailing in NWFP [North-West Frontier Province]. The leader of the opposition in his speech had criticized the prime minister on her interview with the BBC. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said she stood by her interview as Pakistan did not interfere in the internal affairs of India nor do we intend to interfere in future. Kashmir she emphasized is not an integral part of India. It is a disputed territory recognized by the UN and even by the former Indian prime minister, late Jawaharlal Nehru. The prime minister declared that Pakistan under the leadership of PPP has put India on the defensive and on the run. The Indian leadership is so desperate that it has indulged in attacking the person of the prime minister of Pakistan. It is a tragedy that when the Indian president and their leadership have launched a slanderous campaign against her setting aside all diplomatic norms, the opposition joined hands with the Indian Government against the prime minister of Pakistan. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said she is not deterred by such attacks and tactics as she has never committed any laxity in discharging duties while serving the motherland. The PPP government, she said, is steering the country out of the international isolation and enhanced Pakistan's prestige in the comity of nations. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said India is now embarrassed and worried due to Pakistan's effective strategy on Kashmir while the situation was quite different during Mr. Nawaz Sharif's tenure. Referring to the allegations leveled by the leader of the opposition that the PPP has abducted the MPA's [members of provincial assembly] of NWFP assembly, she said the leader of the opposition is painting a wrong picture in this regard. She challenged the opposition to present a solid proof in favor of their claim about the abduction of MPA's like we had provided evidence of the kidnapping of the PPP MPA's [by Sharif's party] at the time of Senate election during the previous regime. She said nobody in the immediate families of the MPA's of NWFP assembly has claimed that their relatives have been abducted by the government. This is an ample proof that the claim of the opposition is false and baseless. Participating in the debate, the leader of the opposition, Mr. Nawaz Sharif, said the government should have provided a leadership for strengthening political culture in the country. But he alleged the government is creating political crisis. He said the government should have taken initiative both in and out of the house in curbing the horse trading. Mr. Nawaz Sharif said the opposition has the right to move a no-confidence motion against the government, but horse trading and keeping MPA's hostage is contrary to the Constitution. Earlier, the law and justice minister, Syed Iqbal Haider, moved a motion for debate on the current political situation in the country, with particular reference to situation in NWFP. Initiating the debate, Syed Iqbal Haider said the government has voluntarily agreed to hold discussion on the NWFP situation because it wants to discuss everything in the house. However, the minister criciticized the requisitioning of the session by the opposition. He said it has been done to sabotage the government endeavor to mobilize the world opinion on Kashmir.
