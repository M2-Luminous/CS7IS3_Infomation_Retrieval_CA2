Giving details of the bill, the minister of justice and attorney general, Honorable Lovemore Munlo, explained that the new Constitution shall come into force in two stages. It will first come into force provisionally for a period of one year from 18th of this month, in order to comply with the wishes expressed at the constitutional conference which was held at Kwacha Conference Center earlier this year. Honorable Munlo said the draft Constitution therefore provides for the appointment of a constitution committee of Parliament to create the requisite machinery to oversee the process of national consultation for the further refinement of the Constitution. Among the features in the new Constitution is the establishment of the office of the ombudsman, whose function shall be to check and keep watch on public offices and public bodies in the performance of their duties. It also provides for the human rights commission, whose function will be to look at human rights abuses. Honorable Munlo said the new Constitution also abolishes the present three regional traditional courts and the national traditional court. Several members, while supporting the bill, however expressed reservations on certain aspects of the Constitution, but noted satisfaction that there is provision for the (?refinement) of the new Constitution for a period of one year.
