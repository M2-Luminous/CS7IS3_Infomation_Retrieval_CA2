It has subsidiary and joint enterprises in many countries of the world. Not many people know that YUBEKS became the first foreign firm that started to cut diamonds in Russia jointly with the Smolensk production association Kristall. The discussion in our interview mainly centered on the peculiarities of the diamond business and how it is developing in the world, particularly in our country. [Shevtsov] Mr. Bannai, why and how did you decide to work in the diamond business? [Bannai] Most of all, because diamonds are not simply a business, but a way of life. Work on them can even be equated to art. I see this business as a hobby that, in addition, can bring in an income. Although, based on economic interests, on my part it would be more advisable to concentrate my principal attention on other more profitable forms of activity of our companies. The cut-uncut diamond business is a closed business in which in order to win one's own "place under the sun" it is necessary to pass a very difficult survival exam. He who engages in this business finds himself under unusual conditions, in which an especially important role is played by confidential relations with partners, and the word you give has primary value. I joined the diamond business immediately after completing studies at a university in Paris. I started to learn it in Israel, where I studied and worked in shops and became familiar with gemology. Further, our company was among the first to master the "princess" type of cut, which was new at that time. Given the availability of a certain type of raw material, this cut makes it possible to obtain a very beautiful diamond with a quadrilateral form. The losses from the initial weight are extremely insignificant. Thereby, the coefficient of effectiveness of its use is greatly increased. Thus, it can be said that this is what started our penetration into the uncut-cut diamond business. [Shevtsov] Are any changes occurring now in world trade in the uncut and cut diamond business? [Bannai] It is well known that the uncut-cut diamond business is to a large degree conservative. But in recent years it has undoubtedly been experiencing important changes, especially in the sphere of the new technology for processing uncut diamonds. At the same time, the concept of sales is changing and being improved. Broad prospects for the development of new markets in the east are emerging--first and foremost in China and Russia, where one-quarter of the population of the planet lives. It is precisely there that new diamond buyers should appear. [Shevtsov] But after all, they are very expensive, and the incomes of the people in these countries is rather low... [Bannai] First, there is reason to hope that the incomes of the population in these countries will increase. And, second, it should not be thought that all diamonds are very expensive. Of course, there are diamonds that cost hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars. But on the other hand there are the kind that in principle are accessible to everyone. They can be acquired for several dozen dollars. Thus, the dream of diamonds is realizable not only for the rich. [Shevtsov] How is the activity of your company conducted on the Russian market? [Bannai] I visited Russia as a businessman for the first time in 1989. During a visit to the Smolensk production association Kristall we began to hold negotiations on the creation of a joint enterprise for cutting diamonds. And although they were quickly concluded with success, a considerable amount of time passed before it was possible to establish a joint enterprise between our company and the Smolensk plant that really began for the first time to engage in diamond cutting. It was given the name Kristalldiam, and after three years became one of the major producers of diamonds, among similar joint enterprises existing in Russia. In addition, its product is distinguished by the high quality of faceting for which Russian diamonds, particularly Smolensk diamonds, have long been famous. We were the first to produce the Princess diamond cut in Russia. Right after our enterprise, other Russian plants began to do this also. All told, with the participation of YUBEKS five joint enterprises engaged in diamond cutting have been established in Russia. [Shevtsov] What do you think of the condition of the uncut-cut diamond industry in Russia? [Bannai] I want to say that, despite the economic crisis that has struck practically all branches of the economy of Russia, this industry is one of very few that has succeeded in maintaining its position. Although, of course, its development is being negatively affected by the instability of the political situation, the developing crime-conducive situation, and also the fact that some enterprises have ended up outside Russia. Unfortunately, there is no clear concept of the development of the uncut diamond processing industry on a countrywide scale. Moreover, this branch attracts a large number of people who do not understand it very well. Nevertheless, they try to influence the course of events. Some of them think that Russia should sell its raw materials only to De Beers, and others that it should not sell diamonds at all, inasmuch as this leads to a "squandering" of the national wealth, etc. A lot of inaccurate and incorrect articles have appeared in the press. Unjustified attacks are frequently made on such state structures as Komdragmet of Russia, Almazyuvelireksport, and Diamonds of Yakutia-Sakha. But after all, high-class professionals work in these structures who like and understand their business. It is clear that it is necessary to sell the main mass of uncut diamonds and the products received from them. If Russia does not trade in uncut and cut diamonds, others will start to do so for it, squeezing it out of the international market. Of course, reserves of uncut diamonds must exist, but in reasonable limits. It is no accident that the United States regularly resorts to the sale of uncut diamonds from the strategic reserves. In the last two years this tendency has intensified even more. Now, for example, the value of technical uncut diamonds has dropped sharply. Prices for them were reduced by 20-30 percent in the last year. A situation has developed in which even De Beers cannot and indeed does not want to control the situation in the technical uncut diamond market. I, for example, consider absolutely groundless the De Beers assertion that Russia, allegedly in circumvention of an agreement reached with this monopoly, has flooded the international uncut diamond market, which will lead to a drop in prices for them. How then in such a case, while announcing the arrival on the world market of an excess of uncut diamonds from Russia, did De Beers itself increase deliveries by 30 percent, thereby attaining a record level of sales for its entire 120-year history of existence. Of course, if Russia takes the path of development of its own diamond-cutting production, this will to some degree weaken the monopoly position of De Beers. In turn, Russia will feel more confident on the international cut diamond market. I think that your country, from the position of an equal, could come to an agreement with De Beers about your real place in this market. Of course this is not easy, but it is possible. For this the state must first decide how many and what kind of uncut diamonds it wants to cut, and also guarantee the necessary raw material to diamond-cutting plants for a long period. In addition, the government has to consider that in offering raw material to plants according to a price list coordinated with De Beers, a high profit will be assured from the production of cut diamonds. This is explained by the fact that additional well-paid jobs are established, and the treasury receives stable deductions from the payment of high taxes. The diamond-cutting plants gain their own capital, and they are not listed among the state debtors. I am a supporter of the centralized distribution of diamonds in Russia among enterprises engaged in their cutting. However, of course, they should be received only by serious firms that simultaneously with trade ensure the employment of the population. In addition, it is necessary to establish a secondary raw materials market in Russia and also to encourage Russian firms to establish subsidiary enterprises in other countries. They should join in partner relations with foreign companies that have colossal experience in activity on the international market. It is also necessary to support and strengthen those Russian structures headed by Komdragmet, which, speaking for a continuation of cooperation with De Beers, at the same time do not plan to do the bidding of this monopoly, first and foremost protecting the interests of Russia and its uncut diamond industry.
