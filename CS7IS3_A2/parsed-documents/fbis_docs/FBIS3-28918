The ASAHI SHIMBUN said, "If the world's two economic superpowers...retaliate against each other by taking protective trade steps, damage to the global economy would be great," and urged the two countries to handle the situation with a long-term perspective. Commenting on Friday's summit talks between Japanese prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington over bilateral framework trade talks, the leading daily said, "the summit sessions made people feel Japan-U.S. relations entered into a new stage." Hosokawa and Clinton could not reach an accord on the framework talks to slash Japan's trade surplus and open its markets. "In many of the previous Japan-U.S. summit talks, the Japanese side gave in considerably to (U.S. demands) to keep the alliance, thus causing anti-U.S. feelings to spread in Japan, and coating the surface with vague agreements, leaving seeds of dispute." "Hosokawa and Clinton frankly said `no' to each other on the economic issues and (such a way) is better than the practice in previous summit talks, in which success was an imperative goal," the ASAHI said in its editorial. In order to make use of the establishment of "a mature adult relationship," the daily, however, urged the two countries not to let economic confrontation spill over into overall bilateral ties, and it asked Japan to act on opening its markets and reducing the trade surplus. The MAINICHI SHIMBUN also urged the two countries to set up a cooling off period and probe a strategy for mutual prosperity and existence, saying, "the development of the U.S. economy hinges on the extent it takes hold in Asia and (for that reason) cooperation between Japan and the U.S. is indispensable." The daily said, "the bickering between Japanese and U.S. Administrations did not reflect the competence of or cooperation among private sectors." Noting views that the U.S. electronics and auto industries have regained competitive strength with the improved U.S. economy, that Japan is no longer a threat to the U.S. economy, and that Japan's current account surplus is shrinking sharply, the daily said "(we) should not react excessively to the disagreement (on the trade negotiations)." There are many factors that time would solve even if (the two countries) do not do anything," it said. The largest circulation daily the YOMIURI SHIMBUN said, "we believe the summit meeting reflected a post-Cold War relationship between Japan and the United States that is reaching a new, mature stage." The daily expressed hope that both Japan and the U.S. would resume talks by making good use of a cooling off period, saying, "the maintenance of positive bilateral relations between Japan and the United States is important for the security of Asia as well as the rest of the world." "As Japan-U.S. relations mature, both nations must fulfill their responsibilities as mature nations. In this respect, Japan must implement what it can do as quickly as it can," the YOMIURI said. "Above all, Japan must deregulate its economy and improve government procurement, which the government can do on its own," the daily added. The daily also urged Japan to pursue the further realization of opening its markets by getting the stagnating economy on track through stimulating domestic demand with flexible fiscal and financial measures, as well as more strictly applying the antimonopoly law. It asked the U.S. to reconsider ways to promote foreign access to Japanese markets, saying "we can never agree with the idea of setting unilateral numerical targets and threatening to impose trade sanctions against Japan." The leading economic daily NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said, "Japan and the U.S. are in a state of economic war in the wake of the breakdown of the framework trade talks." Expressing concern that emotional confrontation could spread between the two countries, the daily said, "it is important that Japan and the U.S. try to strengthen bilateral relations by all means." "Numerical targets demanded by the U.S. would surely lead to managed trade...but the Japanese side also made a mistake by saying only `no' to the matter and did not act on opening markets, delaying pump-priming measures," it said. "The biggest mistake was that both Japan and the U.S. faced off without taking into account the chaotic post-Cold War world," the NIHON KEIZAI said.
