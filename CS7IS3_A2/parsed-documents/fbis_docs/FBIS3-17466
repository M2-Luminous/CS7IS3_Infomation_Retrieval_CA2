Brazauskas, along with V. Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas [parliament] National Security Committee, National Defense Minister L. Linkevicius, and other officials, visited the former Russian Army bases and inspected the condition of the transferred facilities. First of all, the delegation visited the Rukla base in the Jonava region. "There are lots of buildings, but they are used ineffectively," said the president. Previously, the base used to house 12,000 servicemen, while now there are only several hundred soldiers -- the first field army motorized battalion "Gelezinis Vilkas" [Iron Wolf]. An opinion was voiced that Rukla could become the key Army training base and a center for motorized training. The base has comfortable vacant apartments which could accommodate servicemen coming for training. In the Panevezys region, A. Brazauskas and his accompanying delegation showed interest in the Pajuoste base. They discussed ways of better utilizing its facilities. The president said that it would be our key air base. In the Siauliai region, the president visited the military airport in Zokniai.
