FR940804-0-00117 FR940804-0-00024 One individual expressed concern that Department attorneys would exploit this exception by making gratuitous allusions to other offenses in the course of an otherwise illicit contact with a represented party. As noted above, prevailing case law interpreting the Sixth Amendment and the Model Rules permit an attorney to question a defendant as to uncharged offenses, and there is no evidence of systemic prosecutorial abuse of this type of interrogation. Accordingly, there is no reason to suspect that prosecutorial practice under these rules will be different. Paragraph (f): Threat to safety or life. The Supreme Court has recognized that, in certain limited situations, the need to guard against threats to public safety can justify noncompliance with otherwise applicable constitutional safeguards. See Warden v. Hayden , 387 U.S. 294, 298&hyph;99 (1967) (warrantless search permissible when delay would endanger lives of officers and citizens); New York v. Quarles , 467 U.S. 649, 657 (1984) (``the need for answers to questions in a situation posing a threat to the public safety outweighs the need for the [ Miranda ] prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination''). This paragraph recognizes an analogous exception to the general prohibition against communications with represented parties in the absence of their counsel. It is the Department's intention that this exception be invoked only in rare circumstances and only for the purpose of protecting human life or safety. The exception has three requirements: (1) the attorney for the government must have a good faith belief that the safety or life of any person is threatened; (2) the purpose of the communication must be to obtain information to protect against the risk of injury or death; and (3) the attorney for the government must, in good faith, believe that the communication is reasonably necessary to protect against such risk. These requirements are imposed to ensure that the exception is invoked only to protect human life or safety, and not as a routine matter in violent crime prosecutions. For example, the fact that potentially dangerous firearms have not been recovered would not in and of itself be sufficient under ordinary circumstances to constitute a threat to safety under this exception. Furthermore, the communication must be for the purpose of protecting human life or safety, and may not be designed to elicit testimonial evidence. However, information thus obtained may be used for any purpose consistent with constitutional limitations. No specific comments were received regarding this paragraph, and it has not been changed. Section 77.7: Represented Persons; Investigations As noted in the discussion of section 77.3, individuals and organizations who are neither defendants nor arrestees are not ``parties'' within the meaning of this rule, and the general prohibition on ex parte contacts therefore does not apply. This section makes clear that attorneys for the government are authorized to communicate, directly or indirectly, with a represented person unless the contact is prohibited by some other provision of federal law. These communications are subject, however, to the restrictions set forth in sections 77.8 and 77.9 regarding certain categories of negotiations and respect for attorney-client relationships. Two individuals commented that this section, even as limited by sections 77.8 and 77.9, allows a broader range of contact with persons under investigation than is necessary to meet the Department's legitimate investigative needs. These individuals agreed that the government must be free to conduct undercover operations and investigations, even when field investigators coming into contact with potential criminal or civil respondents are directed by government attorneys. They argued, however, that overt communications with persons during the investigative stage are not similarly justified. The Department agrees that overt communications between a government attorney and a represented person during the investigative stage raise different considerations from covert communications and should be subject to greater restrictions. For this reason, the Department plans to make revisions to the United States Attorneys' Manual providing that government attorneys should engage in overt communications only after carefully considering whether the communication is more appropriately handled by others, and should generally not communicate overtly, or cause another to communicate overtly, with a target of a federal criminal or civil investigation, who is known by the Department attorney to be represented by counsel, concerning the subject matter of the representation. Nevertheless, the Department believes that overt contacts by federal attorneys and agents with witnesses and subjects of investigations are often necessary for effective law enforcement and hence should be permitted. Section 77.8: Represented Persons and Represented Parties; Plea Negotiations and Other Legal Agreements This section prohibits government attorneys from initiating or engaging in negotiations of certain specified legal agreements with any individual whom the government attorney knows is represented by counsel, without the counsel's consent. Even when the regulation otherwise permits substantive discussions with a represented party or represented person, it ordinarily would be improper for a government attorney to initiate or negotiate a plea agreement, settlement, immunity agreement or any other disposition of a claim or charge without the consent of the individual's counsel. The one exception to this prohibition occurs when the communication is initiated by the represented person or represented party and the procedural safeguards provided for in paragraph 77.6(c) are satisfied. The Department believes that this section is important for the preservation of the attorney-client relationship. One of the primary purposes of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 is to protect an individual represented by counsel from overreaching by an attorney for an adversary. The Department believes the risk and the consequences of such overreaching are at their greatest during negotiations over plea agreements, settlements, and other key legal agreements. The training, experience, and knowledge of the law possessed by an attorney is particularly valuable in such situations. The prohibition contained in this section includes all negotiations of the terms of a particular plea agreement, settlement agreement, or other agreement covered by the section. However, this section does not prohibit an attorney for the government from responding to questions regarding the nature of such agreements, potential charges, potential penalties, or other subjects related to such agreements during an otherwise permissible discussion. Nevertheless, an attorney for the government should take care in such situations not to go beyond providing information on these and similar subjects and should generally refer the represented person to his or her counsel for further discussion of these issues. The government attorney should also make it clear that he or she will not negotiate any agreement with respect to the disposition of criminal charges, civil claims or potential charges, or immunity agreements without the consent of counsel. No specific comments were received regarding this section, and it has not been changed. Section 77.9: Represented Persons and Represented Parties; Respect for Attorney-Client Relationships
