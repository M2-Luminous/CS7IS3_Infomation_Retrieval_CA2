At the end of the eighties, the Defense Ministry's expenses totaled hundreds of millions of pesos. A review of these expenses paved the way for a reduction in costs after basic steps were taken to update the military's financial system. Measures were applied at all levels, thereby reorganizing the budget system on the basis of charging for goods and services provided or required by each unit. Profitability, costs, control of resources, the struggle for efficiency, and the policy of basing investments on profits are part of the vocabulary that dominates the process now under way within the FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces]. During a conversation with Colonel Harry Villegas of the Western Army's political sector, I was able to understand more profoundly how the armed institution's self-financing is being achieved. [Begin recording] [Villegas] Based on the principle that we must be self-financed, [words indistinct] budget, there are two basic roads to self-financing. One is a reduction in expenses, and the second is money-making efforts. Money-making efforts have been taking place in agricultural production; in commercial activities, such as taking care of officers' homes, tourism, and the sale of certain food supplies; and in various other activities. All of these steps help reduce expenses. Under this system, each one of these primary, agricultural and commercial activities has its own account. These activities are generating profits gradually. Once profits are realized, 60 percent go toward taxes which, in turn, remain in the Armed Forces Ministry, but at a ministry level. Meanwhile, 12 percent of these profits go to Social Security, and 5 percent -- as in the case of commercial activities -- are distributed among those taking part in earning the profits. The remaining profits go into the unit chief's account, and these funds can be used for new investments. They can be used to motivate individuals or to resolve problems in the unit itself. This represents very efficient financial control. Gradually, both factors, when you see the overall picture, will reduce the budget and will limit or reduce expenses. [Samper] Therefore, you are saying that nowadays unit chiefs must become multitalented men. They must be very knowledgeable in several fields and in a number of specialties because they can no longer simply rely on their military training, as they have done up until now. Therefore, the unit chief must also fulfill political duties and other specific duties. [Villegas] They must be fully prepared. [Samper] That is right, they must be fully prepared. Currently, what new responsibilities and skills are required of unit chiefs? [Villegas] Currently, as you have been able to see, we devote ourselves to combat training. We are practically maintaining the same level of combat training we previously had. In addition to this, however, we must also guarantee our soldiers' nourishment. [Word indistinct] is being guaranteed, and it is being guaranteed in a qualitative fashion. We must control conservation and maintenance of [word indistinct], which, as you can see, this activity requires. We must take charge of deployment. You have been able to observe that a high percentage -- and, each time it will be higher -- of our combat forces order arms [words indistinct]. Another skill required is that of an economist. We are not talking about economists with degrees or economists [word indistinct]; instead, they must have command of the economy. They must know what a product costs, and not be content with a product that represents a loss. At all times, they must know what resources require investments, how to make investments, and to truly control costs. They must truly oversee investments. Of course, one must devote time to this. When all of these qualities are taken into account, you will realize that our unit chiefs must be well prepared. [end recording] Cuba's FAR is on the road to self-financing, which, from an economic viewpoint, translates into reduced dependency on the state's overall budget. Moreover, it also translates into greater defensive capabilities, maneuverability, and flexibility.
