But even on the island, where 51 candidates were running for the 16 seats in the oblast duma, the results were very different from what the organizers had expected. In two multiseat districts -- Korsakovskiy and Kholmskiy, which unite the central and southern parts of the oblast as well as the Kuril Islands -- only slightly more than 25 percent of registered voters turned out. The turnout in Tymovskiy District in northern Sakhalin was slightly higher at around 32 percent. But the most discouraging poll result was the fact that the elections were almost wholly ignored by the population of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk -- only 18 percent of voters turned out. It is possible that the weather played a mean trick on the election organizers -- as a result of heavy snow falls many residents of the south of the island had no water for several days, power supplies were intermittent, and no bread was delivered to the stores. Nonetheless, the main cause of the Sakhalin people's political apathy, it seems to me, lies elsewhere. As one of Russia's most "expensive" regions, the island is drifting from one economic disaster to another. The lack of diversification in the old economy, geared mainly to fishing and timber procurement and enriching a narrow group of merchants and former members of the party nomenklatura, has left most of the population on its uppers, and there are only a few projects (of dubious worth from the islanders' viewpoint) as evidence of the widely trumpeted promises to "Taiwanize" Sakhalin and turn it into a kind of oil and gas El Dorado.
