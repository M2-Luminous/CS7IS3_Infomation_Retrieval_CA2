CPRF Secretariat Communique No. 645 reads: Lately, fascist oppressive maneuvers by the puppet clique with the mask of a civilian government are being conducted more openly in South Korea. According to reports, on 1 March, when some 2,000 Seoul citizens and college students marched on the street, shouting slogans "Yankee go home", "Cancel the plan to deploy patriot missiles in South Korea" after holding a meeting marking the 75th anniversary of the 1 March popular uprising, the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique repressed the protesters with arms and forcibly dispersed them by mobilizing the riot police, thus committing fascist violence. Prior to this, on 23 February, when some 400 students of universities in Kwangju, including Chonnam and Choson Universities, launched a demonstration, shouting slogans against the rice market opening, the fascist clique savagely repressed them by letting the armed police move out and release tear gas. On 25 February, the puppet police showered tear gas indiscriminately at college students in Kwangju, who were staging a demonstration opposing the National Assembly ratification of the nation-selling opening of the agricultural market. The rascals released so much tear gas that patients at the nearby Chonnam University Hospital had to seek help to take shelter. After the indiscriminate oppression at the demonstration site, the puppets tyrannized by letting the riot police move to Chonnam and Choson Universities, where they conducted a surprise search and confiscation and incarcerated many students. In mid-February, the puppets arrested students participating in an anti-U.S. demonstration in the front of the American Center in Kwangju and hauled in 23 students engaged in anti-U.S. agitation activities in front of the Kwangju Post Office. Moreover, the puppets did not hesitate in committing an atrocity by arresting four students, including Yi Chang-yol of Kyongbuk University in Taegu, for posting a notice supporting the North's insistence on a billboard, by invoking the National Security Law. The South Korean students, the target of the puppets' oppression, are patriotic students who oppose outside forces, acts of selling the nation, and the confrontation between fellow countrymen while insisting on independence and desiring the reunification through alliance with communism and the North. Their struggle and desire cannot be a crime. Nevertheless, these fascist oppressive maneuvers following the oppressive order to control with arms the South Korean people's just struggle, which puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam issued while berating it as an illegal and violent deed on many recent occasions, clearly prove that the South Korea puppets are now openly adhering to the fascist rule with arms after casting off its perfunctory civilian mask. The oppression with arms cannot save the Kim Yong-sam ring from the power crisis [chonggwon wigi]. The South Korean people cannot achieve independence or democracy, nor can they even maintain their lives, leaving traitor Kim Yong-sam, who is as crafty as a fox, at the post of power. The South Korean people in various classes and strata should struggle more stalwartly [kwagamhi] to overthrow [tado] the Kim Yong-sam ring, which sells the interest of the country and the people while depending upon outside forces and makes fascist oppression and treachery to the country and the nation commonplace.
