Ozren chetniks, together with their recently arrived reinforcements, intensified their attacks on the free Maglaj territory. Fierce artillery fire directed at the positions of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade on the northern parts of the front, near Bijela Ploca, (Kojundzevaca), and Haluge started just after 0700 and went on until midday. Tanks, Bofors, and mortars from the infamous strongholds on Mt. Ozren fired at the town center. Two people were lightly wounded. The UN Protection Forces in Maglaj again came under attack this morning, and the blue helmets were again -- for the second day running -- forced to respond to the chetnik fire. This time, however, NATO planes appeared very quickly. The Serbian aggressor is continuing to concentrate his forces toward Maglaj, so new attacks on this part of the free Bosnia-Herzegovina territory appear imminent.
