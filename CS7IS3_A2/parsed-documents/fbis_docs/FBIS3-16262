This decision has been perceived by the opposition as "support for Russia's imperial ambitions in the post-Soviet area." Deputies from the National Independence Party, the National Democratic Party, the People's Front, and a number of other parties (16 in all) are holding joint consultations and meetings to elaborate a policy of opposition to Georgia's inclusion in the CIS. It has reached the stage where the opposition intends to appeal to the republic's Supreme Court because, in its opinion, parliament's decision on Georgia's membership of the CIS is unlawful. Its appeal is based on the fact that this decision was made by a simple majority of deputies and not two-thirds of them, even though the republic's legislation contains no clear ruling on that question.
