This was the first time NATO had carried out air strikes against this region since the Bosnia-Herzegovina civil war broke out two years ago. According to the U.S Pentagon, the air strikes were conducted at the request of 12 UN military observers stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Not long before this, these military observers submitted a request to Yasushi Akashi, UN special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, expressing the hope that protection would be provided for Gorazde so that it would not suffer from the Serbs' armed attacks. Yasushi Akashi immediately approved their request and gave the order to provide "strict air assistance." In addition, General Ross, commander of UN troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, disclosed that he had warned Serb military officers on three occasions not to continue their advance toward or shelling of Gorazde, but subsequently, a Serb tank opened fire on Gorazde, so Ross requested air strikes in the region. Gorazde is an important city in Bosnia-Herzegovina and is also a place full of bloody clashes and dangers. It was an enclave of Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslims. In 1993, the UN Security Council declared Gorazde, Sarajevo, Bihac, Tuzla, Srebrenica, and Zepa to be six "safe zones," but these "safe zones" are not safe. In the last two weeks, Gorazde has become even "hotter" because of Serb attacks against the city. Reports say that the Serb armed forces are advancing toward the city from the south and the north, while carrying out armed attacks. During this period, almost 100 people in the city have died in these attacks, and more than 400 have been wounded; many UN personnel in the city also are threatened, including relief personnel, military observers, and ground navigators for the air strikes. The air strikes in the "safe zones" have temporarily stopped the shelling of Gorazde. At that time, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, U.S. President Clinton, and the German Government commented on the air strikes. Butrus-Ghali's spokesman in Geneva said that Butrus-Ghali "did not hesitate at all" on the question of using air strength to protect Gorazde, nor did he hesitate on carrying out air strikes again to protect those UN "safe zones." Analysts pointed out that this indicated the secretary general's determination to protect these unsafe "safe zones." Outside the White House, Clinton said: "What we want to do is promote talks." The German Government hoped that in the course of promoting talks, air strikes would force the Serbs to withdraw their troops. Since the promulgation of the "ultimatum" in early February and the downing of Serb planes, the current air strikes were another major military move by NATO. After the promulgation of the "ultimatum," the Bosnia-Herzegovina capital city of Sarajevo -- one of the "safe zones" -- remained comparatively calm. In its current air strikes, NATO possibly intended to expand the "Sarajevo formula," but the Bosnia-Herzegovina civil war is long drawn-out, all sorts of conflicts are cropping up, and some regions are full of mountains and forests. The three bombs may have calmed the situation in Gorazde, but the path to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina still remains long and tortuous.
