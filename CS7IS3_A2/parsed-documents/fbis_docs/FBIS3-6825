The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted a resolution Monday to refer Pyongyang's refusal of full inspections of its nuclear facilities to the United Nations Security Council. Hosokawa said he was gravely concerned over the situation and was keeping it under close observation, the officials said. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said in a separate press meeting that government ministries and agencies have started considering possible punitive measures against North Korea in preparation for the possibility of the United Nations Security Council adopting sanctions. Takemura also said it is important to exchange information with the United States and South Korea over the issue. As for the large-scale transfer of goods and funds to North Korea by pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in Japan, government sources said it would be difficult to suspend such remittances even if sanctions were imposed. The sources said, however, that the government would consider the remittance issue. The sources also said that Japan will have to take a harder stand toward North Korea since it is likely Pyongyang would target Japan if it develops nuclear bombs.
