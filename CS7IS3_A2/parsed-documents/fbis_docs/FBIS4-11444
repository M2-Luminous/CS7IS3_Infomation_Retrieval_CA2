[Begin recording] [Alvaro Perez Trevino, presidential candidate for the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution] Honestly, no debate has been agreed upon because, in reality, no candidate has grabbed the bull by the horns. Now Dr. Zedillo has dared to launch this initiative. It is alright because if this initiative would not have been presented, no debate would occur. [Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, presidential candidate for the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party] I will always maintain that a debate must be pluralistic and democratic, without exclusions. If there are no guarantees that all candidates are treated with respect and equality, I would not participate in debates of this nature. [Marcela Lombardo Otero, presidential candidate for the Popular Socialist Party] If we want to strengthen and expand the political-democratic system in the country, it must be done by expanding and strengthening the multiparty system, which enriches proposals and projects anywhere in the world. [Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the Mexican Green Ecologist Party] We are happy to be part of the group of political parties that have been set aside. These parties have not been considered for the possibility of debating at this level, and the possibility of gaining access to the presidency. Well, at least that is what they believe, but the reaction of neglected parties will be very powerful. [Pablo Emilio Madero, presidential candidate for the Mexican Democratic Party] We are all presidential candidates, there are not only three candidates. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to hold the debate only amongst three people. [Unidentified reporter] How would you propose that the debate be held? [Madero] All candidates should be allowed to participate at the same time, with the same lighting, the same cameras, the same journalists, the same audience, and on conditions of equality. This will permit citizens to appreciate what each candidate is proposing. [end recording]
