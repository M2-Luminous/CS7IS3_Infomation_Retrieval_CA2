FR940707-1-00035 FR940707-1-00011 (3) There are units occupied by employees of the housing (and family members residing in the same unit) who are under 55 years of age provided they perform substantial duties directly related to the management or maintenance of the housing. (c) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples: Example 1: A. John and Mary apply for housing at the Valley Heights apartment complex which is a 100 unit housing complex that is operated for persons 55 years of age or older in accordance with all the requirements of this section. John is 56 years of age. Mary is 50 years of age. Eighty (80) units are occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older. Eighteen (18) units are occupied exclusively by persons who are under 55. Among the units occupied by new occupants after September 13, 1988 were 18 units occupied exclusively by persons who are under 55. Two (2) units are vacant. At the time John and Mary apply for housing, Valley Heights qualifies for the ``55 or over'' exemption because 82% of the occupied units (80/98) at Valley Heights are occupied by at least one person 55 years old or older. If John and Mary are accepted for occupancy, then 81 out of the 99 occupied units (82%) will be occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older and Valley Heights will continue to qualify for the ``55 or over'' exemption. B. If only 78 out of the 98 occupied units had been occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older, Valley Heights would still qualify for the exemption, but could not rent to John or Mary if they were both under 55 without losing the exemption. Example 2: Green Meadow is a 1,000 unit retirement community that provides significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons. On September 13, 1988, Green Meadow published and thereafter adhered to policies and procedures demonstrating an intent to provide housing for persons 55 years of age or older. On September 13, 1988, 100 units were vacant and 300 units were occupied only by people who were under 55 years old. Consequently, on September 13, 1988 67% of the Green Meadow's occupied units (600 out of 900) were occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, Green Meadow qualifies for the ``55 or over'' exemption even though, on September 13, 1988, under 80% of the occupied units in the housing facility were occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that at least 80% of the units that were occupied after September 13, 1988 are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older. Under paragraph (b) of this section, Green Meadow qualifies for the ``55 or over'' exemption, even though it has unoccupied units, provided that at least 80% of its unoccupied units are reserved for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or over. Example 3: Waterfront Gardens is a 200 unit housing facility to be constructed after March 12, 1989. The owner and manager of Waterfront Gardens intends to operate the new facility in accordance with the requirements of this section. Waterfront Gardens need not comply with the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section that at least 80% of the occupied units be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit until 50 units (25%) are occupied. When the 50th unit is occupied, then 80% of the 50 occupied units (i.e., 40 units) must be occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older for Waterfront Gardens to qualify for the ``55 or over'' exemption. §100.316 Intent to provide housing for older persons. (a) The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that the person or entity affirmatively demonstrates through credible and objective evidence that the housing satisfies the requirements of §§100.305, 100.306, 100.315 and 100.316 or 100.310, 100.315 and 100.316. Housing satisfies the requirements of §100.316 if the owner or manager of a housing facility publishes and adheres to policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent by the owner or manager to provide housing for persons 55 years of age or older. (b) The following factors, among others, are relevant in determining whether the owner or manager of a housing facility has complied with the requirements of §100.316: (1) The manner in which the housing facility is described to prospective residents. (2) The nature of any advertising designed to attract prospective residents. (3) Age verification procedures. (4) Lease provisions. (5) Written rules and regulations. (6) Actual practices of the owner or manager in enforcing relevant lease provisions and relevant rules or regulations.
