(From the draft of the Law on Fighting Corruption) The draft Law on Corruption was one of the last documents which the Supreme Soviet considered and approved in its time. However, President Yeltsin did not sign it, referring it for revision. According to Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the Committee on Security of the lower chamber of the Russian parliament, the committee has resuscitated the draft and made a number of substantial revisions in it. Possible amendments to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, which does not define precisely what should be considered corruption in Russia, are being considered in parallel with the law. In Ilyukhin's opinion, this evil has afflicted the state structures of Russia from top to bottom. The draft, hearings on which have already been held at a joint meeting of two commissions of the State Duma--for security, and for legislation and judicial reform--envisions punishments of several kinds for unconscientious officials. Being disciplined administratively is the lightest punishment that a bribe-taker holding a state position can get away with. This is followed by dismissal from his position with a subsequent ban on working for state institutions for a certain period of time. Criminal liability is envisioned for crimes in office which have considerably damaged the interest of the state. The chairman of the Committee on Security has no illusions about the new law working to the fullest extent immediately after its adoption by the parliament and confirmation by the president of the Russian Federation. Like many others, the document is threatened with falling victim to the atmosphere of "legal nihilism" that reigns in the country. Some deputies from the Russia's Choice faction oppose the adoption of the Law on Fighting Corruption as such. In their opinion, the law torpedoes the economic reform that is underway in Russia. Viktor Ilyukhin believes that the attitude of the president of the Russian Federation toward the new draft law is being formed under the influence of two legal schools, "theoreticians"--who are represented by the Institute of State and Law of the Russian Federation, and "practitioners"--the Institute of the Russian Federation Procuracy, the Academy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and others. Whether Yeltsin will sign the document after it is approved and passed in the Federation Council largely depends on who succeeds in substantiating their position better--the "theoreticians" or the "practitioners." In the opinion of the chairman of the Committee on Security, there are quite a few people on the staff of the president of Russia and in the government who are resisting the appearance of the new law. An alternative draft of the law is being developed in the recesses of the president's staff. However, Ilyukhin believes that the Duma is outpacing the team of the president. The presidential law is still at the development stage, whereas that of the Duma is almost ready.
