"Developments have so far shown that the intentions of the Croats and Muslims are such as to form a block against the Serbian side," he said. "We are going to exchange views on this today with the speaker of the Upper House of the Russian Federation in Moscow." Krajisnik said it is the U.S. Administration's mistake to assume that the Serbs will bow to pressure and do something against the Serbian people's interests. He noted over the phone that the Serbs have offered maximum concessions to the Muslims -- 33.3 percent of territory -- in order to secure peace among all three national communities in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. "However, the Serbs will not accept a solution that would be considerably detrimental to the Serbian people's strategic interests. This is why we regard this agreement in Washington as some sort of action against the Serbian people. It is incomprehensible that such an agreement is being drawn up which isolates the Serbs, and which intends to create an artificial and unfeasible entity." Krajisnik warned that the division of the Serbian part of the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina could be dangerous: "Our messages are: Don't count your chickens before they are hatched, and that there can be no peace if one tries to exclude Serbs from the agreement." The president of the Srpska republic assembly said that, had the organizers of the Washington meeting been in favor of an agreement with the Serbs, they would have invited them to attend the conference and tackled the problem together. "It is inconceivable that anyone should conclude an agreement between Croats and Muslims and then impose this stand on the Serbs," he said. Krajisnik said that the Serbs cannot be forced to have one-third of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina territory because they own 64 percent of the territory. "A just solution and peace cannot be achieved by means of pressure, blackmail, and ultimatums. Such a practice can only prolong the war," said Krajisnik in conclusion.
