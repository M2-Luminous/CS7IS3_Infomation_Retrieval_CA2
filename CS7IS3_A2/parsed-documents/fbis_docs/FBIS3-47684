According to the report, the students were invited to a meeting by Karen leaders at a place 45 minutes by boat on the river from their camp. When they arrived in Manerplaw, Karen soldiers took the students to a guerrilla training camp near their headquarters. KNU leader, General Mya, in the presence of top-level KNU officials, told the students group that the KNU would hold cease- fire talks as planned with the Burmese Government. Furthermore, Gen. Mya informed the student group not to obstruct or protest against the talks in any way and told them to watch from the sidelines. The students on their part had consistently opposed peace talks with the Burmese Government. According to an opposition source at the border, the 12 students are still being detained. The KNU spokesman in Bangkok has denied the report on the above incident. He said the incident was merely a repercussion of the split within the ABSDF [All Burma Students Democratic Front] since 1991. There has been tension between the DAB [Democratic Alliance of Burma] and the students group in recent months. The DAB, which was formed with 15 opposition organizations, includes the goverment-in-exile headed by Dr. Sein Win. According to reports received in the past week, the students group had been openly voicing their criticism following the agreement by four major armed ethnic organizations and the Burmese Government to hold peace talks. The group was reported to have severely criticized the Karen organization for its talks at the DAB emergency meeting held in Manerplaw this week. At the same time, some members of the armed students organization, the All Burma Students Democratic Front [ABSDF], were reported to have left Karen territory with their weapons without informing the Karens. KNU officers have told the students to return the weapons they have armed them with. According to an additional report, the Karenni Progressive Party is reported to have disarmed the ABSDF faction which had been staying with the Karenni organization.
