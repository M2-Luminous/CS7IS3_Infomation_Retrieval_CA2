FR940523-1-00010 FR940523-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Part 301 [GL&hyph;520&hyph;87] RIN 1545&hyph;AL20 Payment of Excess Expenses Incurred by Purchaser in Connection With the Redemption of Real Property Under I.R.C. ยง7425 AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. SUMMARY: This document contains a proposed regulatory amendment relating to the payment of excess expenses incurred by a purchaser at a nonjudicial sale in connection with redemptions of real property by the United States under Internal Revenue Code section 7425. The existing regulations provide guidelines for submitting claims for excess expenses incurred by a purchaser, or his or her successor in interest, after a foreclosure sale and before redemption, but do not provide a cutoff date for submission of claims for excess expenses. The intent of the proposed regulations is to provide such a cutoff date. These proposed regulations provide that when requested by the district director, a purchaser at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale must submit a written claim for excess expenses within 30 days of the request for such claim to be considered. If, however, the purchaser does not submit a claim at that time, but does incur excess expenses, the purchaser may submit a claim within 30 days after the redemption. Failure to submit a claim within that time period forecloses the right to do so. DATES: Written comments and requests for a public hearing must be received by July 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send submissions to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (GL&hyph;520&hyph;87), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. In the alternative, submissions may be hand delivered between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (GL&hyph;520&hyph;87), Courier's Desk, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert A. Walker, (202) 622- 3640 (not a toll-free call). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document contains proposed regulations that would amend the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 301) under section 7425 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The regulations would impose a time limit within which a purchaser of real property at a nonjudicial sale may submit a claim for excess expenses to the United States when it is redeeming such real property. The United States will not consider any claim made after expiration of the time limits.
