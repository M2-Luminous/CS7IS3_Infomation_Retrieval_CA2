FR940222-1-00058 FR940222-1-00009 Implementing this proposed rule would not create any additional expenses but should enable the Medicare program to realize savings in administrative costs. At present, we are unable to estimate the potential dollar amount of these savings. We evaluated the potential impact of these regulations changes on intermediaries and carriers for purposes of determining whether a regulatory flexibility analysis is required. We believe that the effects or the changes will be minimal. Almost all of the present contractors have been performing the functions for a number of years and have developed efficiencies that would argue against our needlessly altering their functions. Therefore, it is not our intention to use the flexibility of this regulation to make wholesale changes. Consequently, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Similarly, the Secretary certifies that it would not have a significant effect on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Therefore, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act. In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866 this regulation was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
