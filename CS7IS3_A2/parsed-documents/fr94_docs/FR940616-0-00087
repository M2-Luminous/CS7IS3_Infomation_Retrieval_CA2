FR940616-0-00087 FR940616-0-00011 Paragraph (c) of ยง9.131 establishes the test to be used in determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. The agency is required to make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical evidence, or on the best available objective evidence to determine: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices or procedures will mitigate the risk. This is the test established by the Supreme Court in Arline. This type of inquiry is essential if section 504 is to achieve its goal of protecting individuals with disabilities from discrimination based on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to legitimate concerns, such as the need to avoid exposing others to significant health and safety risks. Making this assessment will not usually require the services of a physician. Sources for medical knowledge include guidance from public health authorities, such as the U.S. Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control, and the National Institutes of Health, including the National Institute of Mental Health. Additional Changes In addition to the above changes, and as discussed in further detail in Section III of this preamble, the final rule also revises ยง9.170, which concerns the part 9 compliance procedure. A hearing procedure is not mandated by statute, and the Department has concluded that the compliance procedure set forth in ยง9.170 provides an adequate remedy. Certain editorial changes were made to ยง9.152 to clarify the extent of the agency's responsibility to modify existing housing. II. Discussion of Public Comments The revisions to the part 9 proposed rule discussed in section II above are further addressed in this section III, which addresses the issues raised by the public commenters. Relationship of Section 504 to the Fair Housing Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act Comment. Six of the commenters stated that the part 9 proposed rule did not incorporate the standards and requirements that appear in the Fair Housing Act 1 or in title II of the ADA. Two commenters expressed concern that the part 9 rule proposes to implement less stringent standards than the Fair Housing Act, and requested that the part 9 final rule conform to the Fair Housing Act requirements; thus, eliminating any conflict in program regulations. Another commenter stated that the ADA requires HUD's regulations to ``refer to the ADA so that when HUD assumes responsibility for housing enforcement under the public services section (title II of the ADA), HUD will be better able to ensure consistency among all of its enforcement responsibilities.'' 1 Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 is referred to as the ``Fair Housing Act.'' Response. As noted in the preamble discussion under Section II, which discusses changes made to the part 9 proposed rule, HUD does, in several places in the final rule, incorporate the standards and requirements of the ADA. However, it is important to note that in enacting the Fair Housing Act and the ADA, the Congress did not override the specific provisions of section 504. While all three statutes (the Fair Housing Act, the ADA, and section 504) provide certain civil rights protection to individuals with disabilities, the scope and mandate of each statute is different. Section 504 is concerned with discrimination against individuals with disabilities in federally assisted and federally conducted programs and activities. Federal programs or activities subject to section 504 include those in the areas of employment, education, health, social services, housing and agency facilities. Under section 504, the mandate that a federally assisted or conducted program or activity be ``accessible'' to individuals with disabilities does not, in every case, require structural changes. Moreover, when compliance with the ``program accessibility'' of section 504 does require structural changes, structural changes are not required to the same extent as required under the Fair Housing Act. Under section 504, accessibility is defined in broader terms, as discussed in the preamble to HUD's part 8 interim rule implementing section 504 for HUD assisted programs and activities: For example, even though a facility in which a federally assisted program is conducted is free of architectural barriers and thus meets requirements for facility accessibility, the program is not accessible if management policies and procedures effectively bar [individuals with disabilities] from participating in or otherwise benefiting from the program or activity. On the other hand, a program which is conducted in an inaccessible existing facility can be made accessible without altering the facility, where the program or activity can be delivered or otherwise be made available to a [disabled] beneficiary without loss of essential program benefits. ( See preamble to part 8 interim rule published on May 6, 1983, 48 FR 20638 at 20640) The Fair Housing Act is concerned with discriminatory housing practices, and its provisions apply to all housing, not just federally-assisted or federally-owned housing. The Fair Housing Act is also concerned with structural accessibility. The Fair Housing Act establishes accessible design and construction requirements for certain new multifamily dwellings for first occupancy on or after March 13, 1991. These requirements, however, do not extend to existing facilities (i.e., alterations to existing facilities are not required). The ADA is concerned with discrimination on the basis of disability in the areas of employment, public accommodations, State and local government services, and telecommunications. With respect to structural accessibility, title II of the ADA requires that newly constructed or newly altered State or local government facilities be designed and constructed or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. ( See 56 FR 35574.) The different mandates and scopes of section 504, the Fair Housing Act and the ADA limit the extent to which the regulations promulgated under these statutes can be uniform. Additionally, HUD's section 504 regulations are subject to the coordinating authority of the DOJ under Executive Order 12250 (45 FR 72995, 3 CFR, 1980 Comp., p. 298.) The purpose of DOJ's coordinating authority is to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, there is uniformity in the implementation of section 504 by all Federal agencies. Accordingly, HUD's section 504 regulations are obliged to adhere, as closely as possible, to DOJ's prototype section 504 regulations for these types of programs, and to such other guidance as DOJ may provide in the issuance of section 504 regulations (for example, see the discussion concerning applicable accessibility standards in Section II of the preamble).
