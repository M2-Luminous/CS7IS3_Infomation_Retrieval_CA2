The statement added that one citizen was injured in this operation and a soldier from the Central Security Forces was killed. The statement affirmed that this confrontation was part of the Interior Ministry's security policy to expand the efforts to confront various terrorist elements. The following is the text of the Interior Ministry's statement about this operation: As part of the security policy formulated by the Interior Ministry to expand the scope of the confrontation against all terrorist elements, which was initiated by the ministry to strike at the hotbeds and centers of public activities for these elements in the Governorates of Aswan, Qina, al-Fayyum, and Asyut--the most recent of which was to strike against the terrorist groups that were using the mosques of al-Rahmah and Miftah al-Rahman in Asyut as dens to hide their weapons and tracts, the State Security Investigations prepared themselves for a large-scale campaign on al-Badari Island. The island is controlled by the al-Hamami family, which has a strong grip on this region. The commander of the military wing of the terrorist organization in Upper Egypt is terrorist Salah Muhammad 'Atiyah al-Hamami. In view of the large area of the island--about 4,500 feddans--and its rough topography, in addition to it being surrounded by the Nile, a full and comprehensive plan was prepared after two months of monitoring and scouting the island to determine all roads leading to and from it. Forces of the highest level of combat training prepared for the raid. They were joined by international antiterrorism forces and armored and amphibious central security forces. These groups planned to stormed the island and arrest all the individuals hiding there and using it as a headquarters to mastermind their operations. The forces were aided by units from the Asyut Security Department, the Criminal Investigations Department, and various investigations groups because of the amount of information they have about this island. At 0330 Wednesday, the forces stormed the island in extreme secrecy and conducted a thorough search. The forces entered the island according to plan and tightened their control over all the island's inlets and outlets. The operation resulted in the death of the terrorist group's leader and commander of its military wing, Salah Muhammad 'Atiyah al-Hamami, who was wanted in many terrorist cases, including Case 542/1993 of Markaz Sidfa. This case involves the assassination of Lieutenant Colonel Mahran 'Abd-al-Rahim, head of the State Security branch in (?Dayrut), and his son Muhammad. This terrorist was regarded as the leader of the organization's military wing. He supervised the training, planning, and financing of the group's recent terrorist operations in Asyut, Qina, and Aswan Governorates. An automatic rifle and a large quantity of ammunition were found in his possession. Afterward, 57 active members of the terrorist organization surrendered to the raiding force. It turned out that some of them had carried out these operations, some had been in charge of training, and others were responsible for provisions, financial support, and conveying orders. All of them (?were) arrested. The forces also seized papers, (?letters), and documents referring to operations that were being planned, including operations against some public figures and installations. The forces also seized other documents containing addresses of some of the organization's fugitive members in various governorates and providing important clues that will help the authorities arrest other fugitive terrorists. Citizen Mustafa Kamil Ahmad 'Uthman was wounded in the clashes. He was hospitalized, and his current condition is positive. A Central Security Forces conscript, Rikabi Nur 'Ali, was killed. The Prosecution Office was asked to initiate an investigation and take legal measures (?against) the arrested suspects. The forces are still combing the island. Their search is expected to take some time because of the rough topography of this island. Plans are also being made for similar campaigns in all regions of the Republic's governorates that terrorists are reportedly using as hideouts. The Interior Ministry affirms that, in the next stage, it will direct its blows forcefully and decisively against these sites to eliminate this renegade faction.
