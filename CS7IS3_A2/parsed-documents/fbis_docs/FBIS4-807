Sources close to the negotiations say the government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] have agreed to the document submitted by the mediator, which is based on proposals presented yesterday by UNITA and today by the government, regarding the conclusion of elections. The document on national reconciliation will be discussed. This is the final document, and it provides for UNITA's participation in the various government echelons. Political analysts say the document is very brief in that UNITA does not discuss what the government has to offer. UNITA says it has asked for nothing from the government, including the sharing of power, because it was the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola that won the elections. UNITA will take part in the government in view of the latter's offer in line with the spirit of national reconciliation.
