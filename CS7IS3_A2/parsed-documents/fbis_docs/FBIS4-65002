Finland must not align itself with either the British or the French ideology, but act as defender of the interests of Europe's northeast corner. A loose EU is not necessarily advantageous to Finland. These were the points that SDP [Social Democratic Party] Chairman Paavo Lipponen stressed in his speech at a seminar organized by the Trade and Industry Delegation on Wednesday [4 May]. Lipponen pointed out that Finland has eight months to prepare its membership policy and get ready to take full advantage of membership. He added that Finland cannot function for a single day in the EU without a clearly defined platform of policy. "Will it be the French or the British philosophy? The French focus on finality, a clearly defined goal for a closely integrated, federalist EU. The British prefer to advance pragmatically and favor a loose community until this is proven wrong. "Finland has the same right as the present member countries to hold on to its national interests. Good relations with Russia are too important an asset to Finland to be given up. The EU cannot expect Finland to take on greater risks than any other member country. Our position has become easier due to the fact that the integration of Russia into European cooperation is also vital to the EU." The Foreign Minister Is Giving the Wrong Signals The SPD chairman was critical about the attitude taken by Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto: "The foreign minister has already gone against Finland's interests on two occasions, once by hastening to declare himself a supporter of the British EU philosophy and a second time by siding with the British view on the minority vote issue." Lipponen did not think it was self-evident at all that a loose community would be to Finland's advantage. This standpoint is based on misconceptions from the Cold War, not on a proper analysis of what is best for Finland: "Finland would weaken its own influence by adopting a platform of opposition to federalism. A Community without a common will and capacity to act is likely sooner or later to leave its smallest members in the weakest position. "In a loose EU, the great powers would skim the cream off the milk and focus on their own interests. If the new countries adopt an antifederal platform, it will strengthen the position of those who want to create an inner circle of `original' member states and do business by means of coalitions." A loose EU, according to Lipponen, may even incite Germany to go in its own direction. The EU Must Expand to the East "Germany is very much in favor of expanding the EU to the north and the east. This commits Finland, as a member of the EU, to take an early stance on the issue of the EU's expansion. The newest members are generally opposed to the next candidates. But here, Finland's interests are the same as those of the EU in general. The countries of East Europe must be taken on board as members by the turn of the century. East Europe, which is heading for chaos as a result of insecurity and political and commercial discrimination, could become an overpowering threat to the EU and cause the disintegration of the whole union." Lipponen thinks that as a member of the EU, Finland must also act as a staunch advocate of the interests of business and industry. The most typical requirement in this respect concerns heavy industry, i.e., the paper, shipbuilding, and metal sectors. In discussing Finland's role as defender of the interests of Europe's northeastern region, Lipponen referred to the EU's preparatory work to develop a basic structural plan for Europe: "It does not include a single project addressing the attachment of the Baltic area to the Europe of the EU. The Finland-St.Petersburg-Moscow rail and road links, the development of the ports in the Gulf of Finland, and the Baltic road network must be included in the Commission's project program." "We Do Not Want a Eurohell" Lipponen stressed that Europe must be developed as a social project, not only as a design engineered by a politico-industrial elite: "We do not want a Eurohell with a dogmatic economic and monetary policy, set to destroy the unity of the Community and where a political elite hands out mafia-style subsidies to mitigate opposition," he said. Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto believes that EU membership will enable Finland to focus even more efficiently on the central goal of greater stability and security in Northern Europe. Haavisto, who also addressed the EVA [Business and Industry Delegation] seminar, stressed the importance of Finland's role in influencing the way the EU develops its relations with Russia and the Baltic states and in the design of EU's new northern dimension. Haavisto agreed with SPD Chairman Paavo Lipponen that Finland must base its actions in the EU on the needs and interests of the Finnish community: "Only the Finns themselves will take care of Finnish issues in Brussels," Haavisto added. Haavisto was definitely more cautious than Lipponen in outlining Finland's role in the EU. While Lipponen believes that expansion to include East Europe would be in Finland's interest, Haavisto confined himself to say that expansion will have to be examined with care as it would affect our position in the EU's northeast corner. Haavisto also dodged the issue of whether a loose or a close EU would be in Finland's interest. The question must be studied, he said, alluding to the smaller EU states, of which many have favored federative forms of decisionmaking on the basis that this has committed the bigger countries to a closer cooperation.
