The source confirmed that Khun Sa's soldiers are still in full control of all strongholds, noting that the report on the recapture of towns from Khun Sa's army was merely propaganda from the Burmese Government. He admitted that goverment troops are present in the region, but they have not yet launched any offensive against Khun Sa's positions. Both the government's side and Khun Sa's army suffered heavy casualties in the fighting, which broke out opposite Lak Taeng village of Wiang Haeng District, Chiang Mai Province, since 7 May. It was reported that the Burmese Government has recaptured eight strongholds earlier taken over by Khun Sa's men. On 20 May, some 7,000 government soldiers, together with 1,200 porters, were reportedly rallying in the vicinities of Mong Chot and Mong Tuan in preparation for crossing the Salween River to the western bank to launch attacks on Khun Sa's positions. The source said he was unaware of the report on the U.S. financial assistance given to the Burmese Government for the suppression operations against ethnic rebel groups, adding that the Burmese Government probably cited narcotics problem as a pretext to request the U.S. help. Our correspondent reported that although the fighting was 18 kilometers away, the sound of artillery shelling could be clearly heard in Wiang Haeng district town. No wounded soldiers from Khun Sa's army crossed the border to seek treatment from Wiang Haeng district's hospital as in the past because Khun Sa has set up field hospitals at the strongholds captured earlier from the government side. District Clerk Phongsakon Thirabadi said he had instructed officials to closely monitor the situation along the border with Burma. However, he anticipated gruesome battles if the government troops are able to cross the Salween River to the western side, and this can trigger refugee influx into Thailand.
