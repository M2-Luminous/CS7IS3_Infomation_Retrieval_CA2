However, Japan is being asked to construct a prosperous and vigorous economic society toward the 21st century to deal with the aging society. It is also being asked to play a suitable role in the international community. The government has to overcome the current economic difficulties as early as possible. At the same time, through the reform and opening of the economic society, it needs to construct a vigorous and open economic society in which the people can prosper, as well as to contribute to the international community for the sake of stable growth of the world economy. [Passage omitted on explanation of current domestic and foreign economic situation] While carefully watching the current domestic and foreign economic situations and seeking the direction Japan should take toward the 21st century, the government intends to make an all-out effort to tackle the following tasks. The first task is to implement measures for economic recovery. As I said earlier, the Japanese economy is faced with continuous stagnation in such fields as consumer spending and capital investment. Nevertheless, public investments and housing construction have been pushing up the economy, and inventory adjustment and capital stock adjustment have progressed. Also, the consumption of durable goods is expected to increase. Signs of recovery like this are steadily emerging. To strongly reinforce such signs of the beginning of an economic recovery to move our economy onto the track of a full-fledged recovery as early as possible in fiscal 1994, and to secure stable growth from fiscal 1995, we recently formulated an unprecedented comprehensive economic package exceeding 15 trillion yen. The package includes plans to increase domestic demand, such as income tax cuts worth Y5.85 [yen] trillion and increased public investments, as well as measures to tackle pressing economic problems. The package is rich in both quality and quantity, thus literally a comprehensive pump- priming program. The government intends to implement these comprehensive stimulus measures as one package, and to stimulate the economy as soon as it possibly can with the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the fiscal 1994 budget. I am confident that these measures will eliminate the pessimistic outlook and lead to an increase in domestic demand and consumer spending, thus contributing greatly to efforts to achieve a full-fledged economic recovery. [passage omitted on effects of lowered official discount rate on the economy and on need to stabilize foreign exchange rates] The second task is to actively promote financial reform. The government has formulated several economic stimulus packages to shore up the faltering economy, and has reluctantly decided to issue more construction bonds to make up for an increase in expenditures for public works projects included in the packages. [Passage omitted on the financial structure's dependence on government bonds] The third task is to realize tax reform before the end of the year. To make the aging society a vigorous and prosperous one, it is very important to establish a taxation system in which income, consumption, and assets taxes are well balanced, as well as to realize tax reform with public consent. Based on this view, the Tax Commission energetically discussed tax reform and compiled a report last November in which it showed the basic idea of realizing a fair and vigorous aging society. After receiving the report, the government and the ruling parties began discussions and agreed to enact legislation for tax reform before the end of the year. In line with this agreement, the government will continue to study tax reform while hearing opinions of people from various circles to realize tax reform before the end of the year. The fourth task is to establish harmonious economic relations with foreign countries and contribute to the growth of the world economy. As world trade and direct foreign investment are expanding, the world economy more and more requires the system of mutual dependence. I believe that in such a situation, Japan needs to make efforts to establish harmonious economic relations with other countries, and to actively contribute to the growth of the world economy. To realize steady growth of the world economy with no inflation, Japan will cooperate with other countries in the process of formulating economic policy coordination at G-7 meetings of finance ministers and central bankers. At the same time, it will exchange views with other countries at the APEC meetings of finance ministers. The Uruguay Round trade negotiations, which lasted for almost seven years, were successfully concluded on 15 October, 1993. The success of the talks have placed confidence in the international economic order. Based on the results of the Uruguay Round talks, Japan will make efforts to maintain and strengthen the multilateral trade system to contribute to the growth of both the domestic and world economies. Concerning tariffs, in view of the need to open Japanese markets wider to foreign competition, the government plans to lower tariffs on raw sugar and abolish tariffs on auto parts. [Passage omitted on Japan's economic assistance to developing countries and former planned-economy nations] The fifth task is to put life into the financial and securities markets. In order for the nation's economy to continue to grow, it is essential that the smooth supply of funds necessary for economic activities is assured. The recently announced overall economic stimulus package is aimed at enabling implementation of measures on the financial and securities markets along with other measures. It presents policies on the financial market that should make possible the smooth supply of funds, facilitate disposal of bad assets, reduce interest, and improve liquidity of credits. It also presents the government's basic thinking on ways of dealing with the bad assets of banking institutions. This thinking will remain the administrative guideline relating to solving the problems of banking institutions' bad assets. With regard to the measures for invigorating the securities market, the government is getting ready to present to the current session of the Diet a bill aimed at introducing a system on securities transactions which will ease controls on companies acquiring their own companies' stocks. The government will continue to push for actions to simplify procedures and ease controls on securities market transactions, for instance by enabling corporations to raise capital by issuing corporate bonds at market prices. Watching the conditions of the stock market henceforth, the government will also study ways of facilitating corporations' going public. By implementing all these measures in a package, the government intends to secure an environment which will enable the monetary and securities markets to perform their expected functions well. Now I will explain the key points of the 1994 budget to you. In view of the existing very serious financial situation of the government and difficult economic conditions of the country, the 1994 budget together with the 1993 supplementary budget is meant to give great consideration to its role of stimulating the economy. On the other hand, in order to contain the issuing of deficit-covering bonds [tokurei kosai] which can only prompt worsening of the financial structure, the government has thoroughly reviewed the situation in order to trim down its expenditures. The government has also done its best to allocate funds to projects in priority areas, and to place emphasis on qualitative results in formulating this budget. In the area of expenditures, the government has tried to economize and rationalize expenses by, for example, careful reviewing existing systems and policies. The government has thus contained the scale of the general expenditures to Y40,854.8 billion which is only 2.3 percent higher that the amount for the initial 1993 budget. [passage on containing employment of public officials, details on government bond servicing, grants to local government omitted] As a result, the scale of total expenditures has come to be Y73,081.7 billion, which is an increase of 1.0 percent over the intial budget of 1993. Now I will explain the revenues to you. In the area of taxation, in order to meet the given needs from economic, social and administrative policies, the government will implement reduction of income taxes and the inheritance tax, and take equally appropriate actions on land taxes. The government also intends to review and adjust -- to a more appropriate level -- the taxes on nonprofit foundations, review and improve existing special exception measures related to all taxes, and take other various necessary measures. As regards the overall tax administration, the government will continue to make efforts to ensure appropriateness and fairness, with the trust and cooperation of the public. In the area of nontax revenues, the government -- in view of the very serious financial conditions -- is now making all-out efforts to increase revenues, for instance by taking the action of converting the special account on automobile liability policy into the general account. With regard to government bonds, the government intends to issue construction bonds worth Y10,509.2 billion to secure financial resources to support the so-called NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company] project reimbursement expenses. In addition, the government will issue deficit-covering bonds worth Y3,133.8 billion exclusively to meet the tax revenue shortfalls that will arise from the reduction of income taxes. [passage about deficit- covering bonds, financial investment plans, other details in the revenue budget omitted] As far as defense expenditures are concerned, in view of the very tight finances, we are holding down defense spending as much as possible under the revised Mid-Term Defense Buildup Plan, while maintaining and improving the balance in overall defense capability. The government is doing all it can to maintain and improve defense capabilities, while keeping the overall structure of defense in balance. [passage on grants to local governments omitted]
