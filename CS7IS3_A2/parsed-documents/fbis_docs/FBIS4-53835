FBIS4-53835 "dreas100_c_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-100 Daily Report 22 May 1994 North Korea ROK Denounced for Blocking Suit on Kwangju ROK Denounced for Blocking Suit on Kwangju SK2205085994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0829 GMT 22 May 94 SK2205085994 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Undisguised Perfidy" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today denounces the South Korean puppet prosecution for recently blocking the people from bringing a suit against the culprits of the Kwangju massacre. The news analyst says: When the members of the National Federation for Democracy and Reunification showed a sign of bringing a suit demanding the punishment of 35 culprits of the Kwangju bloodbath including the chief culprits -- traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u -- the puppet Seoul District prosecution authorities hurriedly mobilized riot police for a strict cordon around the prosecution building and violently blocked dissidents from entering the gate. This is a truculent anti-democratic act of fascist tyrants ruthlessly trampling down the elementary democratic rights of the people. It is a very legitimate exercise of their right for the people to indict the culprits of the Kwangju massacre and demand their punishment. Moreover, there is no ground for the present "civilian"-veiled "government" of South Korea, which pretends to have inherited the "spirit of the Kwangju resistance," to refuse to meet the people's demand. The violent hindrance of the presentation of the indictment was aimed at burying into obscurity the crimes of the murderers of Kwangju people and defend them. The Kim Yong-sam clique, though "civilian"-veiled, is a fascist group little different from the military dictatorial forces of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics." If the clique thinks it can go scotfree, protecting the culprits of the Kwangju massacre, it is foolish and stupid, indeed. The South Korean people's unanimous will is to clarify the truth behind the Kwangju bloodbath and judge and punish the murderers. If the Kim Yong-sam group, turning a deaf ear to their demand, persists in "defending" the murderers of Kwangju, it will encounter greater protest and criticism from the people.
