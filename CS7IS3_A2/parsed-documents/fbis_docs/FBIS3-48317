The parties ended Monday night's meeting of the House of Representatives steering committee in a stalemate, holding over their negotiations to the next committee session beginning at 3 P.M. Tuesday [25 January], they said. The ruling coalition parties want to hold the joint council to discuss concessions on the government-sponsored reform bills, in a last-ditch effort to enact the legislation. If two-thirds of a 20-member joint panel agree on a compromise plan, the amended version would then be sent before a plenary session of both houses of the Diet for a vote. The bills would then become law if they are passed by the houses with a majority vote. If the next steering committee meeting reaches agreement to form the council of 10 members each from both houses, the lower house will then have to vote whether to hold the joint panel. However, even if the joint committee is held, the ruling and opposition camps are unlikely to agree on a concession plan, and the package is likely to be then taken to the lower house for another vote, they said. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who has said he would step down if he fails to get the package passed, will put the bills to a floor vote again at a lower house plenary session if the joint council ends in failure, coalition officials said.
