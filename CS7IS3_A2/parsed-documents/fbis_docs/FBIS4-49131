The general committee poll is widely seen as an indicator of whether Mr McGregor will hold his own in next year's contest for the chamber's Legislative Council functional constituency seat, a position he currently occupies. And the overall message is not good for Mr McGregor, or for those who share his views. The veteran legislator ended up at the bottom of the committee poll, winning an embarrassingly low 543 votes. The result is a clear sign the business community no longer sees any role for those who try to reconcile the democratic aspirations of most people in Hong Kong with the need for good relations with Beijing. It is all too easy--amid the headlines about his defeat by pro-China forces--to overlook the fact that Mr McGregor is a moderate. Radicals, such as independent Emily Lau Wai-hing, regard him with suspicion, describing him as only a partial democrat. Although the veteran legislator has been widely associated with Governor Chris Patten's political reform proposals, it is often forgotten that he strenuously opposes one of their central elements: the creation of nine new functional constituencies, embracing virtually all of Hong Kong's 2.7 million workers. Even the Governor's compromise blueprint, put forward during last year's unsuccessful negotiations with Beijing, to instead have nine new organisational-based seats with an electorate of 840,000, is too much for Mr McGregor. He is planning to propose still smaller constituencies during the forthcoming Legislative Council debate on the electoral legislation. As far as he is concerned, Mr Patten's proposals are beyond the pale, since they breach what China understands to be the original concept of functional constituencies: small organisational-based seats. Nor will he have any truck with attempts to bring in more democracy than is allowed under any reasonable interpretation of the Basic Law: he is strongly opposed to the United Democrats attempt to push through 30 directly-elected seats for next year's polls. Yet none of this is enough to satisfy today's business leaders who, as Mr Patten discovered as soon as he arrived, are desperate not to do anything that may offend Beijing. Even Mr McGregor's support for the Governor's modest attempts to reform the voting system for the existing 21 functional constituencies, and introduce a democratically-chosen election committee, is too much for them. As far as they are concerned, the veteran legislator has long been living on borrowed time. His one-time supporter, former Hutchison Whampoa managing director Simon Murray is gone, a victim of tycoon Li Ka-shing's decision, like most of the Hong Kong business community, to concentrate on investments in the mainland. Instead, the attitudes of leading businessmen today are best represented by their decision not to invite Mr Patten to Friday's luncheon with Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office chief Lu Ping for fear it will offend the visiting mainland official. So the most that can be hoped for in today's climate is to see a socially -- rather than politically--liberal businessman take Mr McGregor's place. Fortunately one is available, in the shape of appointed legislator Henry Tang Ying-yen. While Mr Tang may lack Mr McGregor's instinct to push democracy as far as reasonably possible, he has already made his mark as one of the few local businessmen ready to maintain good relations with trade unionists, and even support the introduction of a central provident fund. Mr Tang, who has long been tipped to run for the chamber's functional constituency seat next year, should have no difficulty winning if he chooses to stand. The Liberal Party legislator has just been elected to the chamber's general committee with 1,224 votes, more than twice as many as his potential rival Mr McGregor managed to garner. But all this does not mean the old war-horse should give up without a fight. Although Mr McGregor now looks destined for defeat in next year's contest, it is to be hoped he will give it one more shot. Even if he is defeated, there should be a role for him as an adviser to the new Democratic Party, formed by the merger of the United Democrats and Meeting Point. He will also remain living proof of what is all too rare in Hong Kong: that businessmen can, and should, have a democratic face.
