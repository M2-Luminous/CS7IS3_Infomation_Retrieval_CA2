To this end, the outcome of EHF treatment of 66 patients with limb injuries complicated by would infection with the help of the Yav-1 device under optimum operating conditions is discussed in detail. The patients were divided into two groups: 49 injured and 17 control patients. The irradiation duration varied within 30-60 min, and therapy consisted of 10-15 procedures whereby the wound or chest area (or both) were exposed. The electromagnetic irradiation duration must be sufficient for the development of adaptation reactions (AR) in the organism, or activation or training. The morphological and functional changes in the course of adaptation reactions under radiation, the dynamics of the organism's adaptation reactions under EHF therapy, and the dynamics of the organism's adaptation reaction changes during EHF therapy as a function of exposure localization are summarized. The use of adaptation reactions makes it possible to substantiate the selection of exposure duration and method and the number of treatment sessions for patients with limb wounds complicated by purulent infection. This helps to manifest the therapeutic properties of EHF treatment more fully. It is noted that the above method does not exhaust all possible millimeter wave treatment methods.
