FR940419-1-00008 FR940419-1-00003 E. Request for Comment Election of Directors In consideration of the above factors, the Board requests comment on changes to NCUA's regulation of corporate credit unions, 12 CFR Part 704, to require that the board of directors of a corporate credit union be independently elected by its members, with the condition that at least a majority of the board seats be held by representatives of member credit unions. Recognizing that in many instances interlocks exists as a result of the same representative(s) being separately elected to both the corporate credit union board of directors and the board of a league or other association, the NCUA Board also requests comment on whether it should establish a requirement that all or a majority of the corporate board be comprised of representatives who do not serve in dual capacities other than as officials of both the corporate and a member credit union. The Board requests comments on other issues related to how best to accomplish majority representation by credit unions. For example, elections could be open, with unrestricted nominations. However, once the maximum number of seats permitted to representatives of non-credit union members was filled, the remaining seats would go to credit union representatives, even if a non-credit union representative received more votes. As an alternative, the Board could revise the regulations to revert to the limitations of IRPS 80&hyph;3, i.e. , that non-credit union members have full voting rights but are not eligible to hold seats or place representatives on the board of directors. The Board seeks comments on these and other methods to assure a corporate credit union's board is representative primarily of the interests of the corporate's member credit unions. The Board is aware that this is a departure from the democratic ideal of equal rights for all members, but believes for the reasons described above, that it may be in the best interests of credit unions. As the history of part 704 shows, the rights of various types of corporate credit union members frequently have differed, as the role of corporate credit unions has evolved over the years. In the case of U.S. Central Credit Union, the Board has some concern that majority representation by its member credit unions may not be the best solution. While U.S. Central serves other corporate credit unions, it ultimately has great responsibilities, because of its central and national role, to natural person credit unions and credit union members. The Board requests comment on whether classes of directors should be established at U.S. Central in order to ensure representation by natural person credit unions and others broadly representative of the public interest. Non-natural Person Representation The Board also seeks comment on whether election or appointment of a non-natural person member representative to a position in a corporate credit union should be considered to be an election or appointment of the individual or the non-natural person member. In IRPS 80&hyph;3 the Board took the position that election or appointment was of the individual, not the non-natural person member. The Board stated that while the board of directors of a member credit union (at that time the only non-natural person member permitted to designate a representative to stand for election) was free to change its designated representative at any time, where that representative had been elected to the corporate credit union's board of directors or elected or appointed to a committee, revocation of the designation meant that any position held by that individual must be declared vacant. Such vacancies were to be filled in accordance with the Article VII, Section 3, of the FCU bylaws (the corporate FCU bylaws had not yet been issued), which provides that vacancies on the board, credit committee, or supervisory committee shall be filled by vote of a majority of the directors then holding office. The member credit union's new representative did not automatically assume the old representative's elected or appointed position. As discussed above, IRPS 80&hyph;3 was repealed in the 1984 revision to the regulation. However, there was no discussion of NCUA's position on filling a position when a non-natural person member's designated can no longer serve or the non-natural person member wishes to change its designate. Subsequently, NCUA informally took the position that it was a matter to be determined by each corporate. The Board notes that there are sound arguments for each position. In IRPS 80&hyph;3, it was observed that where the designated representative of a non-natural member has been elected or appointed to a position in the corporate credit union, the voters or appointing official were, at least in part, swayed by the qualifications of the individual. It was reasoned that to permit the board of directors of the non-natural person member to substitute another individual in the place of a representative who has been elected or appointed to an office defeats the purpose of an election in the one case and usurps the power of the appointing official in the other. On the other hand, it is the non-natural person entity that is the actual member of the corporate credit union, not the representative, so it can be argued that it is the non-natural person member that holds the elected or appointed position. As such the member should have the right to determine who serves as its representative. The Board seeks comment on whether all corporates should be required to take the same approach to non-natural person members and which approach is preferable. Recusal Provision Requiring that a majority of the board of directors of a corporate credit union, but not all, be representatives of member credit unions means that some board members may be either representatives of other non-natural person members, such as leagues and service organizations, or natural person members with ties to such entities. Also, depending on the Board's ultimate decision on the issue, individual representatives of member credit unions may, in some cases, continue to serve on the corporate board and, at the same time, serve on the board of a league or other association. Finally, conflicts will continue to arise when matters come before the board of a corporate credit union that directly involve a member credit union whose representative serves on the board. Accordingly, the NCUA Board believes that to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest, it is important to have a strong recusal provision. To address these concerns, the Board is considering returning to the language of Article XV, Section 2, of the standard corporate FCU bylaws, which prohibits directors, committee members, officers, agents, or employees of corporate credit unions from participation in any question affecting the pecuniary interest of any organization in which those individuals are interested. Adopting this language would resolve the conflict, for corporate FCUs, between the bylaw and the regulation, and would make the standard uniform for all corporate credit unions. The Board seeks comment on this idea and on the appropriate definition of ``interested.''
