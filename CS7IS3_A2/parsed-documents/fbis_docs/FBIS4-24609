The purpose of my upcoming visit to China is to explore ways to make the bilateral relationship even better." Fenech Adami recalled his first visit to China in 1978 when he was the leader of Malta's opposition party. He said: "It was at that time that I began to realize the importance of developing the Maltese-Chinese relationship." He said Malta and China may further explore means of cooperation in other areas, including economics and finance. He added that he would exchange views with Chinese leaders over bilateral relations and over mulilateral international cooperation while in Beijing. Discussing the domestic economy, Adami said that Malta is readjusting its economic structure and that Malta has scored positive results in the areas of developing the economy, foreign trade, and in raising the people's living standards. He said that while Western Europe's economy is still in a downturn, Malta is enjoying continued economic growth. Its unemployment rate is only 4 percent. Both its tourism and electronic industry have achieved gratifying developments. He also stressed that Malta is striving to join the European Union, which is very important to Malta economically and politically. Turning to the situation in the Mediterranean, Adami said: "As a country situated in the middle of the Mediterranean, Malta stands for promoting cooperation with other countries in the region and for establishing a permanent organization that will serve as a place for dialogue and cooperation for the countries in the region." He also noted that the situation in the Mediterranean sometimes becomes critical or even very turbulent. However, as a whole, a situation that is cause for undue concern has yet to develop. Still, there is a need to keep a close watch on the development of negative trends.
