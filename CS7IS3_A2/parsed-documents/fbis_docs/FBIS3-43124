Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-04JAN94-CHINA Beijing To Lift Controls on Key Energy Prices Reflecting the determination of party reformers to implement a new round of market reforms, Beijing recently signaled its intention to remove price controls in selected areas of China's heavily subsidized energy sector. A 23 December Renmin Ribao article announced that, pending approval by the State Council, the Ministry of Coal Industry will remove "all restrictions on coal prices" on 1 January 1994. Similarly, a 28 December article in the English-language paper China Daily stated that the price of electricity will be freed "within two to three years." The Renmin Ribao article on coal attempted to allay persistent concerns that price liberalization will engender inflation, asserting that "drastic" rises in coal prices will not occur in 1994 and that "stable supply and demand" of coal and "increasing coal reserves" will mitigate the inflationary impact of price reform. The article went on to say that state control over the production and distribution of coal will also be relaxed so that enterprises can "adapt themselves to market demands" and "organize production according to market needs." The China Daily article on electricity, on the other hand, blamed "uneconomically low prices" for "power shortages that have plagued the country for 23 years" and argued that without market-based pricing, power production could not keep pace with economic growth. It quoted a power industry official as calling for "new regulations on electricity prices" this year. Despite the freeing of prices on coal and electricity, the leadership is moving more cautiously on other energy prices. In an interview with Xinhua publicized on 2 January, Premier Li Peng warned that even though the oil industry "cannot possibly be developed without readjustment of oil prices," such a readjustment would "affect the prices of oil products" and must be done "step by step and in a very prudent manner." The timing of these changes suggests that reformers are moving quickly to implement a recent Central Committee plenum decision loosening state control over prices in key sectors in order to facilitate new market reforms. A document adopted by the plenum stated that "market prices are seldom applied to production factors" and vowed that "on the premise of keeping the general price level relatively stable" the party will "accelerate the marketization of prices" in this area (Renmin Ribao, 17 November). Apparently reflecting efforts by reformers to step up price reform, the Renmin Ribao article of 23 December confirmed that the freeing of coal prices in 1994 was done "ahead of schedule." Until August of last year, PRC media reports consistently held that full liberalization of coal prices would not occur until 1995. Concerned with inflation, the party leadership has been slow to institute meaningful price reforms in coal despite the burden of substantial state subsidies to unprofitable coal-producing enterprises hamstrung by low state- set prices and tight administrative control. Initial attempts at price reform in this sector reportedly did not come until December 1991 (Liaowang, 31 August 1992). Further measures were taken in 1992 and 1993 to increase state purchasing prices and reduce the amount of coal purchased by the state at those prices. As for electricity prices, the 28 December China Daily article stated that they were raised "by a narrow margin" early last year but that "the adjustment was far from enough" to spur power production or "encourage foreign investment."
