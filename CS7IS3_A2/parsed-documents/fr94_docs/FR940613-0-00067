FR940613-0-00067 FR940613-0-00015 In a comment to the SNPRM docket, the American Public Transit Association urged that the temporary exemption language be codified into part 658. The FHWA agrees with this comment. Accordingly, the exemption is codified in this final rule at ยง658.17(k). Temporary Exemption for Emergency Vehicles Section 1023(e) of the ISTEA added the following exemption from 23 U.S.C. 127: (1) Temporary Exemption._The second sentence of section 127 of title 23, United States Code, relating to axle weight limitations and the bridge formula for vehicles using the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways, shall not apply, in the 2-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, to any existing vehicle which is used for the purpose of protecting persons and property from fires and other disasters that threaten public safety and which is in actual operation before such date of enactment and to any new vehicle to be used for such purpose while such vehicle is being delivered to a fire fighting agency. The Secretary may extend such 2-year period for an additional year. This prevented the FHWA from sanctioning States that failed to enforce the Interstate axle-weight and Bridge Formula limits for fire or emergency vehicles in actual operation on or before December 18, 1991, and for such equipment being delivered from the manufacturer to a fire department. The normal gross weight limit was not affected by the exemption. The exemption remained in effect through December 18, 1993. The SNPRM proposed to codify the exemption at ยง658.17(k). Two comments were received on this issue. The South Dakota DOT expressed its desire to go on record as ``not in favor of allowing a temporary or permanent axle weight exemption or bridge formula weight exemption for emergency vehicles.'' The State contends that ``operation of these vehicles overweight threatens the public's safety'' and ``that emergency vehicles should be designed to operate within legal size and weight limits.'' The Caltrans objected to the FHWA's interpretation of the law which indicated that the normal gross weight limit (80,000 pounds) remained in effect during the period of the exemption. They contend that gross weight is determined by the Bridge Formula and that our interpretation was contradictory. The FHWA believes that Congress intended the exemption in section 1023(e)(1) to cover (1) single- and tandem-axle limits, (2) application of the bridge formula to intermediate axles (the inner bridge limits), and (3) application of the Bridge Formula to the overall wheelbase of the vehicle (the outer bridge limit). However, the 80,000-pound maximum gross weight allowed by 23 U.S.C. 127(a) is not inherently part of the Bridge Formula. It is a separate statutory restriction, and we do not believe Congress intended to authorize an exemption to the 80,000-pound limit. The 2-year exemption was included in the ISTEA to allow States to suspend enforcement action against these vehicles while the Secretary conducted the study called for in section 1023(e)(2). That study has been completed, as indicated above, and the authority of the Secretary to extend the temporary exemption an additional year will not be exercised. The temporary exemption expired December 18, 1993. However, the definition of a nondivisible load adopted in this final rule specifically declares emergency vehicles to be nondivisible. States may therefore issue overweight permits for these vehicles if they wish. Interstate System Weight Requirements The first sentence in 23 U.S.C. 127(a) was amended by the STAA of 1982 to require all States to allow the maximum weights permitted by Federal law on the Interstate System. In effect, the weight limits set forth in section 127 became minimums which the States must allow, as well as the maximums the States could allow, on the Interstate System. Since the STAA amendment of section 127 became effective (January 6, 1983), States have occasionally argued that the amendment applied only to the single-axle, tandem-axle, and maximum gross weight limits, and not to gross weights developed by the Bridge Formula. In addition, a degree of confusion regarding applicability has lingered over the years as a result of the regulations issued to implement the STAA (49 FR 23302, June 5, 1984). Although those regulations were published 11/2 years after enactment of the STAA, the statutory action making the weight value minimums was not highlighted nor was any regulatory language included. The SNPRM proposed to clarify and resolve this issue by including a ยง658.17(f) as follows. (f) States may not enforce on the Interstate System vehicle weight limits of less than 20,000 pounds on a single axle, 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle, or the weights derived from the bridge formula, up to a maximum of 80,000 pounds, including all enforcement tolerances. Comments on this proposal were received from six State Departments of Transportation (Arizona, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, and Washington), as well as from the WASHTO's Subcommittee on Highway Transport. All seven commenters objected to the paragraph as proposed for fear that it would no longer allow the States to further control axle weight using a regulation based on pounds per inch of tire width. Each of the six States providing direct comments currently has this type of weight control regulation in force. The ``Guide For Uniform Laws and Regulations Governing Truck Size and Weight Among the WASHTO States,'' prepared by the WASHTO Subcommittee on Highway Transport and adopted by the WASHTO Policy Committee on June 26, 1993, recommends that all 17 member States adopt a 600-pound/inch tire width weight control.
