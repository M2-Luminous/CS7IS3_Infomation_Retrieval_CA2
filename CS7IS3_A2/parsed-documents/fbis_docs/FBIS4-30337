[Watanabe] I shed tears of regret. Mr. Hata has stressed the need to push for political reform. He has asserted that politicians must practice politics not for themselves, but for the people, and they must place importance on the people over themselves. This is a political belief that he has held for the 25 years of his career as a politician. Given his political belief, it is natural for him to made that decision. [NHK] I would like to ask you how the ruling coalition parties plan to form a new coalition government after the Hata cabinet resigns en masse. Will the ruling coalition parties resume talks with the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to discuss the SDPJ's return to the ruling coalition? [Watanabe] The ruling coalition parties are continuing talks with the SDPJ. The SDPJ's biggest demand is that the Hata cabinet must resign en masse and then new political forces must be rallied to form a new coalition government. The SDPJ and the ruling coalition parties formed the Hosokawa government with the aim of preparing Japan for the 21st century. The SDPJ voted for Mr. Hata as prime minister in both houses of the Diet. The SDPJ did not join the Hata cabinet for ceretain reasons. I have confidence that the ruling coalition parties will continue talks with the SDPJ about how to form a new coalition government in order not to set Japan's politics back. [NHK] How about the possibility of the ruling coalition parties forging a coalition with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party? [Watanabe] In the news conference that was held just a while ago, Prime Minister Hata stated: The industrial nations' summit draws nearer. Political parties should not think only of their interests and should place top priority on the people over themselves. I hope that the next government will be formed in tune with the will of the Diet.
