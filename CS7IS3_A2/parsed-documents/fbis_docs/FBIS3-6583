"The administration should try to establish a total security posture by working out new steps to enhance the people's security senses which have somewhat been loosened due to the dialogue in the past," Yi said. Yi's press secretary Kang Hyong-sok said the prime minister made the remarks while presiding over a cabinet session. Kang quoted the premier as saying that the recent North Korean utterances that "we will not hesitate to come to war...," serve as an occasion for the South to re-establish the direction of its stand toward the South-North dialogue and the nuclear issue. Premier Yi also called for detailed plans to ensure uninterrupted function of public facilities in emergency. "The prime minister asked the defense and public peace authorities to be fully vigilant so that there will be no contingency especially during President Kim Yong-sam's upcoming visits to Japan and China," Kang said.
