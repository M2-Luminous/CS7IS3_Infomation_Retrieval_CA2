The television station would also contact the Malaysian Embassy in Washington to rectify the error, he told reporters in southern Johor state. CNN had recently carried a report saying that Malaysia had supplied light weapons to the Muslim army in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mohamed said the government did not want to pick a quarrel with the CNN over the report but hoped that the western media including CNN would be fair and accurate in their reporting, particularly on Malaysia. We only wanted a clarification from CNN... But they said they will carry a denial, which is very good as we want fair reporting, he said, adding that CNN had written to him a few days ago.
