Nobody had agreed it with the Foreign Ministry. Andrey Kozyrev arrived in Pskov to meet Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas, who is in Russia on a working visit. According to the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, the above document had caused a similar astonishment in the Defense Ministry, as well. "We do not need any bases in Latvia," he said quoting Pavel Grachev, defense minister, with whom he had spoken this morning. "There is an installation in Skrunda but it is not a military base, but a radio relay station for space monitoring."
