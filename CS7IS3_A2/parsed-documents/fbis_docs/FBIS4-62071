The duty on boiled sausage goes up from 20 to 100 pct, chocolate from 10 to 100 pct, beer and wines from 20 to 200 pct, vodka and spirits 50 to 350 pct, dairy butter from 10 to 80 pct, sunflower seed oil from 20 to 60 pct, meat from 10 to 50 pct, tobaccos from 50 to 200 and jewelry items from 10 to 150 pct of customs value. Duty on the majority of other goods did not change as dramatically, with video and tape recorders up from 20 to 40 pct and furs and leather clothing from 10 to 150 pct. Ukrainian Presidential Advisor Valeriy Kravchenko considers that the adjustments to customs import duties will provide "more civilized methods" of protecting the interests of Ukrainian manufacturers. The Agriculture Ministry, for example, had made repeated requests for protection of the market against a flood of cheap food products. However, Foreign Economic Relations Ministry experts believe that the introduction of new duties "will not have much bearing on the volume of imported goods on the Ukrainian market." Valentin Kalinin, speaking on behalf of the Ukrainian Tariff Control Department, said that the new duties would be payable in the national currency at an exchange rate fixed by the National Bank of Ukraine (which has stayed at 12,610 karbovantsy to the dollar for the last year and a half, despite rocketing inflation) while the goods themselves would be sold on the internal market at prices recalculated according to the market exchange rate (45,500-46,500 krb. to the dollar on 11 May). This will lead to a reduction in the net duty compared with the price of the import commodity. Ukrainian Vice Premier Valentin Landik told INTERFAX-Ukraine that import duties would now be reviewed on a weekly basis to allow the authorities to keep up with market changes.
