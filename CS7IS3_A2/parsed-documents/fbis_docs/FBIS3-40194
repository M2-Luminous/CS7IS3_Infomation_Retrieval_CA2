These actions show initial results in the form of a preliminary cooling of the overheated economy and the beginning of a readjustment of the overly confused finance and banking order. Nevertheless, a fundamental turn around of the disarray in the finance and banking order and laxity in finance and banking discipline requires full reform of the economic system. Specifically it requires pervasive reform of the finance and banking system. I. Finance and Banking System Reform Holds an Extremely Important Position in Overall Economic System Reform China's economy has developed rapidly as a result of more than a decade of reform and opening up to the outside world. The economic system has also undergone profound changes, one evidence of which is the increasingly important position and the increasingly marked role of finance and banking in the overall operation of the national economy. As the country's national income distribution structure, national savings structure, and investment and financing structure change, and as the degree of commercialization, monetarization, and use of credit in the economy became greater and greater, the finance and banking sector has become the main channel for raising capital, for financing, and for distributing funds in society. It has become the main supplier of construction funds in society. Today, a substantial percentage of funds invested in fixed assets throughout society come from the finance and banking sector, and more than 90 percent of enterprises' working capital comes from the finance and banking sector. During the past several years, the absolute figure increase in bank credit each year has greatly exceeded fiscal expenditures for economic construction. The finance and banking sector has made an outstanding contribution to development of the national economy. At the same time, finance and banking has become the main means of regulating the movement of currency and capital (value). It has become the most important hub for the country's macroeconomic regulation and control. Through currency and credit policies, and the use of both direct and indirect regulation and control measures, including the scale of credit, relending, savings reserve funds, interest rates, and exchange rates, the state has regulated total social demand, has striven to keep the currency stable, and has spurred coordinated development of the national economy. One study shows that virtually all the economic fluctuations of the economy during the past several years have resulted from fiscal and financial policy regulation, and that financial policy has played a more important role than fiscal policy. One might say that after more than a decade of reform, the position of accountant for plan and cashier for government finance that the finance and banking system occupied under the traditional system has changed fundamentally. Finance and banking policy and its macroeconomic regulation and control effect have become of greater and greater decisive importance. It is because of reform that the importance of finance and banking in the national economy has become greater and greater. Therefore, the important position of finance and banking system reform in overall economic system reform has increasingly aroused a high degree of serious attention and widespread concern. In many important ways, however, finance and banking system reform has advanced with difficulty. This difficulty has become a major impediment to progress in reform of macromanagement and reform of the economy as a whole. Progress in finance and banking system reform directly influences and limits progress in overall economic system reform. Truly, with the intensification of economic reform and widening of the opening up to the outside world during the past 14 years, quite a few achievements have been made in financial system reform. Today's finance and banking system has changed quite markedly from the traditional system. A finance and banking system has taken shape in which the Chinese People's Bank plays the leading role, the national banks are the main entities, and finance and banking institutions of various kinds exist together, and in which the division of labor is coordinated. A financial macroeconomic regulation and control system has been preliminarily built that applies economic, administrative, and legal means to control finance and banking. Financial markets dominated by lending markets and national bond markets have begun to form. Financial opening up to the outside world is expanding steadily. Nevertheless, since finance and banking cover a wide area, which makes for great difficulty in reform, progress in reforming the financial system is still fairly slow. Reform has yet to make real headway on some pervasive and fundamental problems. The finance and banking system is unable to meet needs for development of a socialist market economy. This shows up mostly in the following ways: The Chinese People's Bank has not yet become a true central bank. Macroeconomic regulation and control of finance and banking is feeble. China's specialized banks handle both routine commercial business and transactions made for policy reasons. Thus, they cannot become true finance and banking enterprises. The entire banking system lacks competitiveness and vitality. Financial markets lack standardization. Cutting up of markets and mutual market blockading are serious problems. Effective supervision and control are lacking. Financial regulation and control methods, including the regulation and control of interest rates, retain a strong administrative fiat coloration. These problems impair implementation of national macroeconomic policies, and they hamper the further intensification of economic reform and healthy development of the national economy. Therefore, acceleration of financial system reform, and increasing the intensity of financial system reform in order to spur broad and in-depth economic system reform have become problems currently in need of urgent solution. But in what direction should finance and banking system reform be intensified? To meet the needs of a socialist market economy, as well as to solve deep-seated problems in the country's finance and banking realm, the basic goals of China's finance and banking system reform should be as follows: 1) Amplification of the basic functions of the Chinese People's Bank to build a strong central bank regulation and control system that independently executes monetary policy; 2) separation of financing for policy reasons from financing of a commercial nature to build a finance and banking system in which state-owned commercial banks are the main entity, and various kinds of finance and banking institutions exist at the same time; 3) standardization of financial market operation to build a financial market system that is uniformly open, has orderly competition, and is strictly controlled; and 4) straightening out of different interest rates to build a capital pricing system founded on the central bank interest rate. II. Amplification of Chinese People's Bank's Basic Functions To Build a Strong Central Bank Regulation and Control System That Independently Executes Monetary Policy As the nation's central bank, the Chinese People's Bank should faithfully discharge its basic functions like central banks elsewhere throughout the world. On the one hand, it should independently draw up and execute (implement) monetary policy, apply various means, control the currency supply, regulate currency demand, guard against inflation, and maintain the stability of the currency and the entire macroeconomy. On the other hand, it should strictly control and supervise finance and banking institutions, employing policies and laws to regularize all finance and banking activities to ensure that finance and banking institutions operate in a healthy and secure way. Although the Chinese People's Bank nominally became responsible in 1984 for performing the functions of a central bank, it is still a very long way from meeting the standards and requirements of a true central bank. This shows up prominently in the following ways: First, the People's Bank continues to engage in day-to-day financial activities such as handling special loans for economic and technical development, loans for the old, the young, and for people living in border regions or impoverished areas, loans to assist the needy, and loans for gold production. This often mires it in irksome routine currency credit matters, which impedes completion of its basic functions. Second, since the government also checks on the profitability of the People's Bank, instituting a profit retention system for the bank, the People's Bank and its branches and sub-branches are strongly motivated to make a profit by running all kinds of businesses that compete for profit with the "civilian sector." Thus, the bank loses its detached position. Third, the Chinese People's Bank is subject to too much administrative interference from top to bottom. It lacks the independence it should have. For example, the central government frequently overdraws and borrows from the People's Bank. In particular, the strong influence and interference of local governments at all levels on People's Bank branches and sub-branches (that is, the so-called "localization of central bank actions") seriously impair the People's Bank's performance of its functions. Fourth, the People's Bank's macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism is deficient. It lacks effective means of regulation and control. Fifth, the People's Bank lacks sufficient independence in the drafting and execution of monetary policy. The twin goals of "developing the economy and stabilizing the currency" frequently mean that the People's Bank must passively meet the needs of "economic development"; thus, it is unable to attain the goal of "stabilizing the currency." (Examples include the several bouts of inflation that have occurred during the past more than a decade). Sixth, the People's Bank lacks effective supervision and control over financial activities throughout the country. This is also an important reason for the current disarray in the financial order and the laxness of financial discipline. Therefore, the principal goal and task of Chinese finance and banking system reform is to make the People's Bank into a real central bank in fact as well as in name, using this as a basis for the founding of a strong central bank regulation and control system that independently executes monetary policy. This being the requirement, problems in the following several regards must now be solved properly: 1. Draw up laws and regulations that clearly specify the functions of the People's Bank to regulate its conduct. As the authoritative institution for state financial control, the most important task of the People's Bank is to carry out national monetary policy, to control the issuance of currency, to regulate currency supply, and to ensure implementation and exercise of a uniform monetary policy throughout the country. As the bank's bank, or the "ultimate lender," the People's Bank should generally provide finance capital only for the head offices of national commercial banks. It should not engage in day-to-day financial business or business of a commercial nature. As current agencies of the head office of the People's Bank, branches and sub-branches at the provincial (or municipal and autonomous region) level or below should no longer handle the routine issuance of credit, or the scale of credit readjustments. Instead, it should shift its work emphasis to greater financial supervision and control, financial investigation and statistical research, management of the national treasury, affiliated bank settlement of accounts, and foreign exchange control. 2. Straighten out relations between government finance and the banks, putting an end to the correlation between fiscal deficits and currency issuance to begin to build a macroeconomic mechanism of mutual coordination and mutual checks and balances between the People's Bank and public finance. Since the advent of reform, disarray in the fiscal and financial systems, and the mixing of fiscal and banking functions has been extremely serious. This has shown up most prominently in a matter that has already attracted notice, namely "forced nationalization of credit funds" (such as huge government overdrafts on and loans from the People's Bank, and the banks bearing responsibility for disbursements that the government should make but does not make, or compensation that the government should pay but does not pay. It has also appeared in bank issuance of so-called "stabilization and unity loans" and government initiative in making government loans" (such as fiscal units' use of the intermittent funds within budget and funds they control outside of budget to set up government financial credit institutions and to found various kinds of development corporations. Alternatively, government directly invests in various local corporations, or plays a direct role in financial activities such as the buying and selling of negotiable securities, real estate development, trusts, and leasing). The damage this causes is rather severe. The main way to straighten out relations between government finance and the People's Bank lies in legislation that prohibits the government from borrowing or overdrawing funds from the People's Bank, the government solving its problem of a shortage of funds resulting from making pay-outs before obtaining receipts through the issuance of short-term government bonds. Government deficits must be made up through the issuance of medium and long-term government bonds. At the same time, the People's Bank should increase its regulation and control of the basic money supply, and maintain a high degree of funds liquidity. It should use the market mechanism to take money out of and put money into circulation as economic development places demands on the money supply. Yet another point must be raised in connection with the relationship between banks and government finance, and that is the need for earliest possible elimination of the profit retention system and the system for the surrender of tax receipts by the People's Bank and its branches and sub-branches. A People's Bank independent financial budgeting and control system should be set up instead, all profits that the People's Bank realizes being paid to the central government treasury, and all of its losses being borne by the central government treasury. 3. Increase the independence of the central bank. The central bank independence issue is an issue of the relationship between the central bank and the government. Because of differences in economic development and the evolution of the central bank in separate countries, the independence of the central bank in the exercise of functions and powers is not the same in different countries of the world today. In the United States, Germany, and Sweden, the central bank is very independent. It is not responsible to the government, but to the legislative body. Its leaders are not members of the cabinet, and its policies are generally free from government interference. In the United Kingdom, Japan, and France, the central bank is subordinate to the government; however, in the drafting and implementation of financial policies, it maintains substantial independence. In most of these countries, a fairly detached policymaking organization is set up within the central bank. Examples include the board of directors of the Bank of England, the policy committee of the Bank of Japan, and the National Credit Committee of the Bank of France. Why should the central bank be largely independent? The main reason is that governments generally have a pronounced short-term attitude. They frequently place too much emphasis on short-term economic growth, attaching more importance to it than to currency stability. If the central bank is largely independent, it can avoid such a tilt, effectively carry out monetary policy, and ensure currency and price stability, thereby creating conditions for long-term, stable economic growth. Generally, the countries in which the central bank is largely independent are also the ones in which the currency is stable and the economy is rather well-developed. As the nation's central bank, the People's Bank should be substantially independent. The government should ensure that the People's Bank has the authority and the responsibility to conduct an independent monetary policy. It should have the authority to regulate currency circulation to ensure that the basic stability of the renminbi. Under the present circumstances in China, the People's Bank implementation of monetary policy under leadership of the State Council helps bolster central bank macroeconomic regulation and control for better and faster development of the nation's economy. As China's market economy develops, and as the central bank matures and improves, practical experiences will have to be summarized and a decision made on the basis of actual circumstances as to whether the People's Bank's current subordination requires readjustment or change. In addition, in order to avoid People's Bank branches and sub-branches being subjected to local government interference, the approach of setting up People's Bank branches and sub-branches in key cities, that is, a transregional set-up, may be explored and tried out to set the stage for implementation of a central bank uniform currency policy. 4. Perfect the People's Bank's regulation and control mechanism. The ultimate goal of the central bank's currency policy is to keep the currency stable in order to advance economic development. In addition, as the market economy shifts into high gear, going from no development to development, the People's Bank will have to change from mostly direct to mostly indirect methods of regulation and control. Under present conditions, the state must be prepared for active trial, reform, and perfection of the People's Bank's indirect ways and means of regulation and control. This includes the gradual setting of interest rates by the market, gradual institution of a multi-tier savings reserve system, expansion of rediscounting, and trial operation of open market business. Along with this must be speedy establishment of a People's Bank investigation and study information system, and the perfection of a People's Bank system for preparing statistics, analyzing, and forecasting currency supply and the entire macroeconomy to provide scientific data for the formulation of monetary policy. 5. Better People's Bank supervision and control of monetary policy implementation, financial market operations, and financial institutions' actions for the building of a normal financial order. This requires, first of all, paying close attention to the drafting and perfecting of financial laws and regulations, including the drafting of a "Central Bank Law," a "Commercial Bank Law," a "Negotiable Instruments Law," and an "Insurance Law" to provide guidelines for financial operations, and laws on which the People Bank can rely to exercise supervision and control. In addition, the People's Bank must increase its auditing and supervisory forces, improve its auditing and supervisory skills, and exercise strict supervision and control over both banks and non-banking financial institutions to ensure healthy and orderly finance and banking activities in the country, control of the country's finance and banking being regulated according to law. It must be pointed out that in the process of changing from a planned economy to a market economy, making the People's Bank regulation and control system sound, and perfecting its regulation and control mechanism is also a gradual, step-by-step process that cannot be done in haste. Furthermore, in this process, finance and banking activities and conduct may also exhibit a very marked transitional coloration. For example, when conditions do not exist for the implementation of indirect financial regulation and control means or for them to play a role, traditional direct financial regulation and control methods (such as the use of caps on credit) may have to be retained for a period. In short, we must proceed from actual conditions and circumstances in the transformation of the People's Bank's functions and the building of a new central bank regulation and control system, and avoid the creation of "vacuums" and loopholes in the macroregulation and control of finance and banking that may lead to loss of macroeconomic control. III. Separation of Policy Financing From Commercial Financing To Build a Financial System in Which State-Owned Commercial Banks Are the Main Entities With Many Kinds of Financial Institutions Existing at the Same Time Thanks to more than a decade of reform, China's finance and banking system has undergone very many changes. The traditional banking system characterized primarily by "great uniformity" has given way to the current banking system in which many kinds of finance and banking institutions exist at the same time, including the four major specialized banks, nearly 10 regional commercial banks, a number of insurance companies, trust investment corporations, negotiable securities corporations, finance companies, and rural and urban credit cooperatives. The current finance and banking system is still incomplete, not soundly based, and contains numerous problems, principals of which are the following: 1) The specialized banks combine two functions in a single body, namely, they handle both business done for policy reasons and commercial transactions. This combining in a single body of two kinds of business is bound to produce a blurring of the character, the functions, and the responsibilities of the specialized banks, and create confusion in their actions. When called upon to do business of a policy nature, they usually emphasize that they are "commercial banks," and they stress their autonomy and their interests. When called upon to act as commercial banks, and to seek to maintain funds in balance, they frequently emphasize that they are policy banks. The result is to put themselves in position to gain both the favored treatment accorded for performance of policy functions and the rights of finance and banking enterprises while shouldering neither the duties of policy banks nor the responsibilities of financial enterprises. In fact, because the two kinds of business are bundled together, the specialized banks are frequently subjected to control from a higher level and from local governments. This makes it difficult for them to become economic entities that make their own operating decisions, that are responsible for their own profits and losses, that bear their own risks, and that exercise self-restraint. Such a system does not facilitate central bank macroeconomic regulation and control. (For example, impelled by the administrative interference of local governments and their own interests, the specialized banks frequently divert to the development of local industry funds that are intended for policy purposes such as the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. Meanwhile, they blame the central bank for the shortage of credit, thereby forcing the central bank to expand the issuance of currency). Nor does this system facilitate smooth implementation of national industrial policies. (Acting out of their own interests, the specialized banks frequently do not apply low profit, high risk policy credit on time or in the full amount to the intended purpose, or they divert it to other uses, thereby hampering smooth implementation of national industrial policy). Loans for policy purposes are usually issued by the government for designated purposes. Actually, however, they become a large common pot of funds whose good or bad use, or large or small loss for which no one is responsible. Consequently, the specialized banks usually do not make sure to control policy loans closely, and units using the funds also lack the sense of responsibility they should have then they use the funds. Thus, returns from the use of policy loans are extremely low. 2) The specialized banks do not compete with each other; they lack vigor and vitality. The professional division of labor among the four specialized banks has become a professional advantage for each. Professional monopoly enables each of the specialized banks to gain commensurate monopoly profits without having to make any special effort or provide special services. This greatly weakens the operating zeal and the creativity of the specialized banks. In addition, the professional monopoly also leads to the sequestering of funds, and the splitting up of financial markets, which both stifles the vitality and efficiency of the financial system and lowers the effectiveness of central bank macroeconomic regulation and control. 3) Not only do the specialized banks exercise monopoly in the division of labor realm, but in the entire finance and banking system too, the state-owned specialized banks exercise a high degree of monopoly. Currently the four state-owned specialized banks account for 90 percent of the personnel employed in finance and banking nationwide, for 98 percent of the network outlet points, and for 84 percent of financial assets. They monopolize 75 percent of the savings and loan business in society. Other banks and nonbanking financial institutions simply cannot compete with the four state-owned specialized banks; consequently, efficiency and quality of service in China's finance and banking business has declined. Solution to the above problem requires reform of the present system of financial organization to improve it gradually. This includes earliest possibly founding of policy banks; changing the specialized bank's operating mechanism to make them into true commercial banks, and steadily developing nonbanking and other than state-owned financial institutions. First is earliest possible founding of policy banks. The founding of policy banks is the key to separating policy financing from commercial financial to solve the problem of national specialized banks combining two kinds of business in a single institution. It would break the direct link between credit provided for policy reasons and basic money, ensure the People's Bank's initiative in regulating and controlling basic money, and would play a not to be underestimated role in straightening out the relationship between public finance and the People's Bank, and in truly transforming the operating mechanism of the specialized banks. It would enable them to become true commercial banks and both a finance and banking system and finance and banking organization suited to the needs of a socialist market economy. This is a major part of the intensification of finance and banking system reform. Policy banks are financial institutions specifically responsible for handling policy loans. Thus, all policy loans should be within their professional purview. The main kinds of policy loans for which state-owned banks are responsible at the present time are the following: 1) state investment loans for investment in the development of basic industries and basic facilities; 2) loans for the stabilization of agricultural production that the state directs banks to issue for grain, cotton, and edible oil reserves, for contract procurement of agricultural and sideline products, and for the development of agriculture; 3) buyer and seller loans provided for China's import and export of large complete plants; 4) some important special loans that the state directs banks to make to support and promote the economic opening up and development of certain regions. These include loans for the development of science and technology, loans for the aged, the young, people living in border areas, and people living in impoverished areas, and discounted interest loans to help the needy. Such business should be conducted by the policy banks whose founding is contemplated (The State Long-Term Development Credit Bank, the Bank of Agriculture, and the Import-Export Credit Bank). The crux of good operation of policy banks lies in better management and supervision of policy loans, all possible being done to improve returns from the use of policy loans. First, the area of responsibility for policy loans must be defined. Both the banks and the users of the loans must bear the risk and the responsibility for the loans, user unit garnishing, diversion, or defaults on policy loans, and loan losses resulting from bank mistakes being punished so as to ensure that policy loans are issued and used for the purposes, in the amount, and at the interest rate that the state designates, as well as to ensure complete repayment at the designated time. This will avoid the present situation in which responsibility for policy loans is not fixed, and both risks and losses are borne entirely by the state. At the same time, the policy loan supervision and control system and the supervisory mechanism must be perfected. Policy banks must regularly report to the appropriate People's Bank and Ministry of Finance units the issuance of loans and their intended uses. The People's Bank and units concerned must also audit, supervise, and check on policy loan bank's business policies, and how well the value of state-owned funds is being protected and increased. In short, policy banks would not compete with commercial banking institutions, but they would still have to improve administration and management so as to ensure preservation and increase in value of state-owned assets. The founding of policy banks is an extremely complex and daunting task requiring careful planning, painstaking organization, and prudent implementation. Second is the transformation of the specialized banks into true commercial banks. One important goal in founding policy banks is the shedding of specialized banks' policy financing functions, allowing them to concentrate on commercial financing to operate in accordance with the modern commercial bank operating mechanism. Modern commercial banks are a form of a bank related to a developed market economy. Although commercial banks have developed differently in every country of the world, commercial banks share some common characteristics around the world: 1) they employ a modern juridical person corporation as their basic form of enterprise organization, and their basic operating goal is maximization of the rights and interests of shareholders, that is, greatest profit and least risk; 2) commercial bank business consists mostly of industrial and commercial savings accounts and short-term loans; however, they are increasingly becoming full service banks; thus, they are termed "financial department stores"; 3) commercial banks provide exchange and payment services mostly through the handling of check withdrawals from current deposits. Thus they have the ability and the mechanism for creating currency and expanding credit. The transformation from specialized banks to state-owned commercial banks must be based on China's national circumstances while taking into account the successful experiences of foreign commercial banks. This means doing the following: 1) Appropriate splitting up of the specialized national banks. Some banks are too large. Even after becoming commercial banks, they would still be able to maintain a monopoly. Consideration should be given to the appropriate splitting up of some specialized banks in order to overcome the business monopoly of secondary level banks. They might be divided into several independent accounting regional commercial banks responsible for their own profits and losses. Once the specialized banks have been reorganized as commercial banks, the specialized division of labor among them should be dismantled. The overlapping of business should be permitted to encourage fair and normal competition. 2) Clarification of equity relationships. The shortcomings of China's specialized banks today are largely attributable to uncertain equity relationships. Equity relationships might be clarified in any of several ways, but on the basis of the way both domestic ad foreign banks operate, the stock system might be a rather ideal choice. Institution of the stock system in commercial banks would help the separation of government administration and enterprise management, and it would help increase equity limitations, thereby making banks financial enterprises having authority to make their own decisions, that seek to attain balance, that bear their own risks, and that are responsible for their own profits and losses. 3) Strict regulation of commercial banks business. In today's world, banks are providing more services, more complete services, and more international services. However, given the management level of China's banks and the state of development of China's financial markets, commercial banks might better not engage in the insurance, trust, and negotiable securities businesses in order to shield them from the risks of doing business in negotiable securities and trusts and for the sake of the stable development of securities markets and the national economy. 4) Simultaneous with commercial banks own control over the ratio between assets and liabilities, the central bank should also increase supervision and control over commercial banks, both to prevent financial disarray stemming from inept bank management and also to prevent an overly rapid expansion of commercial bank credit and an ensuing intensification of inflation. In addition to the state-owned commercial banks, China's commercial banking system also includes the Bank of Communications, and the China Trust Enterprise Bank, the Shekou Zhaoshang Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, the Fujian Xingye Bank, the Guangdong Development Bank, the Guangda Bank, the Huaxia Bank, the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, and the contemplated Chinese Rural Cooperative Bank (formed from the removal of business functions from the Bank of Agriculture for incorporation into rural credit cooperatives), and the City Cooperative Bank (a bank to be trial operated using urban credit cooperatives as a basis). These commercial banks exist outside the state-owned, state-operated system. They operate under a stock system or they are a fully funded subsidiary of an enterprise bloc. They also exist outside the specialized bank framework of an administrative district-established institution. Instead, they serve an economic area. In their operation, they also avoid the "large common pot" operating style of the specialized banks. They practice the internationally common full service banking and control over the ratio between assets and liabilities; thus, they have become a "new family" possessed of substantial vim and vigor in China's finance and banking system. In overall terms, however, these institutions have little power. Therefore, when improving them, we should encourage the operating of more regional commercial banks, and gradual opening of the development of nonstate owned financial institutions. In addition, we must boldly and actively bring foreign banks into China on the principle of reciprocity and mutual benefit; however, the scale and the pace of their introduction must be consistent with China's financial management level and the legal climate. At the same time, greater control must be exercised over the operations of foreign-owned banks. Third is steady development of nonbanking financial institutions. The creation of a finance and banking organization system that meets the needs of a market economy, and that is fully competitive and imbued with vitality requires not only the founding of policy banks and the conversion of national specialized banks into commercial banks, but also the development of nonbanking financial institutions to bring about a situation in which various kinds of financial institutions exist together. There are two main reasons for the development of nonbanking financial institutions: one is to meet the multifaceted savings and investment needs of different economic entities. The second is to serve as a competitor with the commercial banks. This will help increase pressures on the commercial banks, and stir the initiative, zeal, and creativity of the commercial banks, thereby increasing the operating efficiency of the financial system as a whole. During the past more than a decade of reform, we have actively examined and tried out the development of nonbanking financial institutions, and we have reconstituted or developed a large number of nonbanking financial institutions such as insurance companies, trust and investment companies, negotiable securities companies, financing and leasing companies, and enterprise bloc financial companies. Nevertheless, some problems that cannot be ignored remain. One is that such institutions are very limited in number and scale by comparison with banks. Second, the kinds of such institutions is incomplete. Third, affected by the traditional economic model, quite a few nonbanking financial institutions retain remnants of and prolong the use of the operating methods of the large national banks. They lack flexibility and autonomy. The development of nonbanking financial institutions faces three tasks: One is improvement. The transformation of nonbanking financial institutions must be speeded up to meet the needs of a socialist market economy. The intensification of reform should serve to change their operating approach, their style of operation, and their management system to enable them gradually to make their own operating decisions, be responsible for their own profits and losses, shoulder risks themselves, and develop themselves. At the same time, governments and financial control departments at all levels must simplify administration and delegate authority. They must give nonbanking financial institutions the operating autonomy they need, thereby creating conditions for them to go all out in controlling the ratio between assets and liabilities, or controlling asset risks. Second is development. This means using the existing foundation to innovate, and to develop standardized and diversified nonbanking financial institutions, and the borrowing of foreign experiences to increase the kinds and numbers of China's non-banking financial institutions. Third is better supervision and control. The central bank must increase supervision and control over nonbanking financial institutions regarding their capital, their scale of business, and their methods of operation to prevent their disturbing and damaging the financial operating order. IV. Standardization of Financial Market Operation, Building Financial Markets That Are Uniformly Open, Compete in an Orderly Fashion, and Are Strictly Controlled Financial markets are markets for the borrowing and lending of money, and for the buying and selling of all kinds of negotiable instruments and negotiable securities. On the basis of the time limits set by financial instruments, financial markets may be divided into money markets (also termed short-term funds markets), and capital markets (also termed long-term financial markets). Money markets are financial markets that deal in money funds financing for up to one year. They include bank short-term savings and loan markets, commercial paper acceptance and discounting markets, short-term national bond markets, and same trade short-term lending markets. The latter two are jointly termed negotiable securities markets. The founding of financial markets that are uniformly open, that compete in an orderly fashion, and that are strictly controlled holds important significance for the development of a socialist market economy. As an important integral part of the market system, the basic function of financial markets is the flexible transfer of funds from surplus to shortage areas, and from low yield to high yield areas. This requires the use of various channels and various methods to mobilize and gather together funds to maximize the amount of funds available. At the same time, it requires use of the market optimization mechanism to permit the optimum allocation of funds. Therefore, financial markets are not only an effective way in which to improve the utilization of funds and thus increase society's economic returns, but are also necessary for optimum allocation of social resources and rational readjustment of the industrial structure. Thanks to more than a decade of reform, China's financial markets have seen some development. This is manifested primarily in the following: 1) Varying degrees of development of money markets (including same trade short-term lending markets and negotiable instrument discounting markets), and capital markets (including stock markets and negotiable securities markets); 2) market media institutions (such as negotiable securities companies, negotiable securities exchanges, the negotiable securities quotation system, negotiable securities registration companies, and negotiable securities rating companies), which have gradually become more diversified; 3) market entities have become more numerous: government, enterprises, individuals, banks, and non-banking financial institutions all entering the market to become both market fund suppliers and users; and 4) market control has gradually become more regulated by the law and regulations. At the same time, however, we must also realize that the overall level of both money markets and capital markets is still relatively low. Both still have fairly serious and glaring problems. An example is the inter-bank trade short-term lending markets, which have not yet formed a national inter-bank discounting market status center to provide responsive feedback that transcends the banking system. As a result, national funds discounting channels have narrowed, in addition to which information does not flow smoothly making discounting costs higher. They exceed the time limits, uses, and interest rate ceilings that the People's Bank sets for inter-bank discount funds, as well as the discounted funds that exceed discounted fund inputs as a percentage of all savings or capital. Funds converted to credit funds in the name of discounting are issued as loans in the form of credit, or discounted funds are used to make up for the shortage of working capital in enterprises or to make up for the shortage of investment in fixed assets. The long lack of distinction between long-term funds and short-term funds has resulted in the flow of large amounts of funds from money markets into capital markets and real estate markets. The long-term use of short-term funds is extremely common everywhere, and it upsets the order of financial markets. Another example is the stock market where shares have been issued or indiscriminately issued without the approval of government departments concerned. Stock market self-discipline is poor, falsification and deception occurs, insider trading takes place, stock market speculation is rampant, the juridical entity stock market is separate from the individual stock market, and the A shares market and the B shares market are separate. Other examples may be found in the price formation and the financial instruments interest rate mechanism in financial markets. Problems in financial markets also stem from administrative distortions, which hamper rational flow of all kinds of financial instruments, and macroeconomic regulation and control. With the establishment and development of China's socialist market economy, a nationwide uniform, open, competitive, and orderly financial market becomes a priority task. First, we must use the formation of inter-bank discounting markets in every jurisdiction as a foundation for earliest possible establishment of a nationwide inter-bank discounting market system. Nationwide inter-bank funds discounting supervision and control must also be intensified so that inter-bank funds discounting is done according to law, in a standard way, and scientifically to eliminate disorder in funds discounting. In perfecting money markets, the main entities in the market and their behavior must be clearly defined and standardized, and the direct link between money markets and capital markets must be severed to prevent the use of short-term funds for long-term purposes. This will enable money markets to become monetary policy instruments that the central bank can use, and main markets for the regulation and control of basic currency and the money supply. Improvement of negotiable securities markets includes improvement of national bond markets, and regularization of securities markets, particularly enhancement of the stock markets. Transformation of the enterprise share system must serve as a basis for regularizing the issuance and circulation of stock shares to set the stage for a common juridical person and individual stock market, and A share and B share markets. The regional funds boycotting and the departmental separatism stemming from regional or departmental protectionism must be changed at once to allow the free flow of funds and negotiable securities to give full expression to the overall performance of financial markets. In particularly, more must be done to build a legal system to enhance financial market control. The state must respond to the needs inherent in financial market operation by issuing standard guidelines in the form of laws and regulations about conditions for entry into financial markets, and behavior of the main market entities. It must control, guide, coordinate, and supervise financial trading activities, using its influence on financial market credit costs, credit distribution, and credit structure to balance financial market supply and demand, to reduce market fluctuations, to stabilize the financial order, and to avoid adverse effects on the overall economy resulting from the chaotic behavior of financial markets. As was said above, the second obstacle to current development of financial markets is the price of capital. Serious problems continue in the setting of interest rates by administrative fiat and on the basis of structural distortions. Specifically, the two-track interest rates (meaning the low interest rates of the central bank and all specialized banks, and the high interest rates of money and capital markets) have become the root of numerous problems in China's financial and economic life today (such as funds shortages, but large amounts of funds circulating outside the system; loss of macrofinancial control; disarray in the financial order, or even incipient corruption). Overheating of the stock market, the wild rise in real estate prices, and the fall in the renminbi exchange rate are all attributable to the two-track interest rates. In short, the activation of interest rate measures and reform of the way in which the market sets interest rates are sluggish. Two seemingly contradictory considerations or apprehensions exist. One is the supposition that enterprise can continue to obtain funds from the large national common pot, and thus there is little sensitivity to whether interest rates are high or low. The second is the supposition that enterprises will be unable to stand a rise in interest rates. However, first of all, even though the state-owned economy remains insensitive to interest rate changes, in the final analysis, we have a rather large and rapidly growing nonstate-owned economy that is fairly sensitive to interest rates. In particular, city and countryside individual savings accounts are extremely sensitive to interest rates. This has been attested to by the rise in fall in savings during the past several years. Second, China has a funds shortage. At the officially set price for funds, bank interest rates are relatively low, and even were they raised slightly, they would still be quite low. If enterprises cannot stand even such interest rates, that means that low interest rates are maintaining low efficiency, and at the cost of doing harm to the interests of savings account holders. This low-interest policy that violates efficiency principles and fairness principles cannot continue. Changing the banks officially set too low interest rates and distortions in the interest rate system will require merging the present two-track interest rates to a single track on which the market sets the interest rate to straighten out interest rate relationships. All interest rates must reflect time, cost, and risk differences. Rational differences in interest must be maintained, and an interest rate system must be formed based on basic interest rate of the central bank that is adjusted from time to time to reflect the market interest rate, and that fully reflects the character and needs of a market economy. 30 September 1993 Comrade He Dexu [0149 1795 2485] provided material and helped with the drafting of this article using my line of thinking as a guide. Following discussion and revision, many changes were made to the draft and the article was completed.
