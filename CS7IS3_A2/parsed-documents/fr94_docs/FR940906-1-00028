ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA proposes to redesignate the Huntington, West Virginia area from moderate ozone nonattainment to attainment and proposes to approve the maintenance plan as a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). In the final rules section of this Federal Register , EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial SIP revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: Comments must be received in writing by October 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on this action should be addressed to Thomas J.
