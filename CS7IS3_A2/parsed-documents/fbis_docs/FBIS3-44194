Despite this view, it had been important during the last three years to point out to the nation's enemy during "negotiations" what are in fact the CP's, and therefore the Afrikaner/Boer peoples', "unnegotiables." The capitulating NP government has all along been secretly whispering to the leaders of the Afrikaner nation's enemy, saying the Afrikaners/Boers are just big cowards like the NP's leaders, and that there was no need to comply with the Afrikaner/Boer demands regarding unnegotiable land and self-determination. For example, a prominent ANC [African National Congress] leader admitted to PATRIOT that the government's people "lied to them about the conservative Afrikaner's determination and ability" to assert themselves should their sovereign existence be threatened. After the negotiations it became blatantly obvious that the enemy had no intention whatsoever of favorably looking -- before or after 27 April -- at any of the Afrikaner/Boer's self-determination ideals. That is why CP leader Dr. Hartzenberg personally told Mr. Mandela what the Afrikaner people's unnegotiables were.
