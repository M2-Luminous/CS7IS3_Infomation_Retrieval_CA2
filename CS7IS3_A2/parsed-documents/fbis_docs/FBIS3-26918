This is the most fundamental measure for implementing various environmental policies and plans. Song Jian said: To promote the development of the environmental law system, it is first necessary to quicken and perfect legislation, such as the enactment of regulations on natural preserves, laws preventing solid waste pollution, and other environmental protection laws. Meanwhile, localities should also quickly enact local environmental protection laws. Second, it is necessary to strengthen supervision in law enforcement. For governments at all levels to realistically shoulder law enforcement responsibilities, government organizations and leaders must take the lead. Environmental control is the government's fundamental function, while environmental departments are representatives of the government in enforcing environmental protection laws. This is the mission empowered by the law, and the departments must be bold and strict in enforcing it. If we do not undertake effective environmental protection measures, heavy pollution will affect people's production and lives, and it will be impossible to maintain social stability and progress. Song Jian said: The enforcement of environmental protection laws will be investigated in over a dozen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions this year. Localities must also conduct their own law enforcement investigations. These investigations should focus on checking and penalizing serious violators of the environmental protection law. Seriously harmful souces of pollution will be closed down, while others will be given deadlines to undertake remedial measures. We must also include biodiversity in our work this year as there are many problems in this respect. We must strengthen our control over environmental problems caused by village and town enterprises. For example, we must not allow the heavy pollution caused by small paper mills in the upper reaches of the Huai He to continue. It is learned that the "Ninth Five-Year Program" on environmental protection as well as the 2010 long-term environmental protection and development plan will be formulated this year. The environmental program for adjoining regions of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia as well as the pollution prevention program for the Three Gorges Dam region on the Chang Jiang will also be drawn up. In addition, comprehensive plans on acid rain prevention will be developed. An investigation and sewage disposal registration system will be implemented for tertiary industries such as the catering and service sectors. Meanwhile, environmental control in rural areas will be strengthened; pollution caused by village and town enterprises and its control will be investigated; and namelists of village and town enterprises nationwide as well as regions causing serious pollution will be announced. To further promote our country's environmental protection work, international cooperation will be actively sought and international conventions, of which China is a member, will be earnestly implemented.
