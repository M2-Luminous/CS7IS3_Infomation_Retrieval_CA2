Speaking to the Northern Hesse Marketing Club in Kassel, Hesse paid tribute, however, to the intensity with which in Germany -- as in no other European country -- the companies and working people are successfully trying to overcome the cost crisis. Working people are willing to accept lower wages to preserve jobs. However, it is unclear whether this is going to be enough to ensure traditional market shares, said Hesse, who was a member of the expert council for assessing overall economic development, the "Five Wise Men," from 1985 to 1988. According to Hesse, private consumption, which contributes 57 percent to the overall national product, will decline by 0.9 to 1.5 percent this year compared with 1993. One cannot expect any stimuli for demand from the state, either. State consumption will change by minus to plus 1 percent compared with last year. Because of low interest rates and high rents only building investments will increase by 1 to 2 percent. In the economist's view, the international economic development has jump-started again. Even though the world trade volume will increase by up to 5.5 percent, Germany will benefit from that only at a below-average rate, because in Europe, the main buyer of German exports, the economy will grow by only 1.5 percent. In addition, Germany primarily exports equipment, which is not yet so much in demand. For the coming years Hesse predicted rising and consolidating unemployment. This year the number of unemployed will grow by about 0.5 million. If the forecasts of the Ifo Institute, which predicts an economic growth of 1.8 percent over the next three to five years in West Europe, become reality, "we will not have any increase in employment worth mentioning over the next years," because the number of employed increases only above a growth of about 1.7 percent. Even though this may be politically difficult to implement, there is no way of avoiding major regional and sectoral wage differentiations. The wages in the lower wage groups were raised so much in the past that the respective jobs are no longer competitive. In addition, stimuli must be given for returning to employment, even if the new jobs offer worse conditions than the old ones that have been lost.
