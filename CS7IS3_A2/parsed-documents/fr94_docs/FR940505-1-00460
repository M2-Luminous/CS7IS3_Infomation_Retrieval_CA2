(1) For each certified engine configuration, the engine configuration certifier must establish, maintain and retain for 5 years from the date of certification the following adequately organized and indexed records: (i) Detailed production drawings showing all dimensions, tolerances, performance requirements and material specifications and any other information necessary to completely describe the engine configuration; (ii) All data obtained during testing of the engine configuration and subsequent analyses based on that data, including the mileage and the vehicle or engine configuration determinants; (iii) All information used in determining the engine for which the replacement parts or components are represented as being equivalent from an emissions standpoint to the original equipment parts being replaced; (iv) A description of the quality control plan used to monitor production and assure compliance of in-use engines with the applicable requirements; (v) All data taken in implementing the quality control plan, and any subsequent analyses of that data; and (vi) All in-service data, analyses performed by the engine configuration certifier and correspondence with rebuilders, vendors, distributors, consumers, retail outlets or engine manufacturers regarding any design, production or in-service problems associated with 25 or more engines of the same engine configuration. (2) The records required to be maintained in paragraph (m)(1) of this section shall be made available to the Agency upon the written request of the MOD Director. (n) Decertification. (1) The MOD Director may notify a engine configuration certifier that the Agency has made a preliminary determination that a certain engine configuration should be decertified. (i) Such a preliminary determination may be made if there is reason to believe that the engine configuration has failed to comply with the requirements of this section. Information upon which such a determination will be made includes but is not limited to the following: (A) The engine configuration was certified on the basis of emissions tests, and the procedures used in such tests were not in substantial compliance with a portion or portions of the test procedures required to be used pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section; or (B) Use of the certified engine configuration is causing emissions to exceed any in-use recall emission standard; or (C) Use of the engine configuration causes or contributes to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare or safety or severely degrades driveability operation or function; or (D) The engine configuration has been modified in a manner requiring recertification pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section; or (E) The engine configuration certifier has not established, maintained or retained the records required pursuant to paragraph (m)(1) of this section or fails to make the records available to the MOD Director upon written request pursuant to paragraph (m)(2) of this section. (ii) Notice of a preliminary determination to decertify shall contain: (A) A description of the noncomplying engine configuration; (B) The basis for the MOD Director's preliminary decision; and (C) The date by which the certifier must: (1 ) Terminate the issuance of useful life renewals; or ( 2 ) Make the necessary change (if so recommended by the Agency); or ( 3 ) Request an opportunity in writing to dispute the allegations of the preliminary decertification. (2) If the engine configuration certifier requests an opportunity to respond to the preliminary determination, the manufacturer and other parties interested in the MOD Director's decision whether to decertify the engine configuration shall, within 15 days of the date of the request, submit written presentations, including the relevant information and data, to the MOD Director. The MOD Director, in his or her discretion, may provide an opportunity for oral presentations.
