He expressed opinion that the former speaker's knowledge and prestige would serve Belarus for long time in future. The Belarusian government press service circulated here on Friday the premier's replies to questions on how he appraises parliament's vote against Shushkevich. Kebich said the following: "I regret what has happened. Sure, we had some differences with Shushkevich on how to reform society and to build a sovereign state. Incidentally, I'd like to note that the press was often helpful in lending these differences unduly exaggerated, I would say, hypertrophic importance. "However, we used to find a common language with Shushkevich on the main thing. We were at one on strategic approaches to reforming Belarusian society and saw our main task in ensuring the transition of the republican economy to market relations without any extreme actions and social upheavals. "We wanted to prevent a sharp drop in living standards, to create gradually appropriate conditions and prerequisites for national revival and to maintain stability, accord and civil peace on Belarusian soil. "We did our best for Belarus to become a full-fledged member of the international community and to turn into a European and civilised power."
