Together with local leaders and residents, as well as 50 young pioneers, they planted 80 trees of Chinese pine and willow in the Yuanminyuan Park -- garden of ten thousand gardens -- an imperial park created over a 150-year period from 1709 to 1859, in the north-western suburbs. The first Sunday of April is a tree-planting day for the capital, and over the past few years, government and party leaders have joined in the green activities on this day. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, was told that the trees planted last year by the leaders were growing well. He expressed gratitude to the gardeners, saying that it was they who had taken good care of these trees. He added that what was wanted was to create a general greening spirit. After planting a tree, Jiang said that every citizen should be aware of the importance of tree-planting since it can bring benefit to this generation and coming generations. Also taking part in today's tree-planting were a dozen other high ranking officials.
