According to a Central News Unit correspondent's report Foreign Minister Velayati, who is taking part in the Congress at the invitation of the Ugandan Government, said in a speech at the session: The revival of Islam is one of the most successful replies to the rule of colonialist powers. It is the Islamic movements which are leading the struggle against foreign rule. Mr Velayati described the special circumstances of the Third World countries, particularly African countries, in global equations and referred to the conspiracies of hegemonistic powers to plunder their wealth. He said: In the past, through dangerous propaganda, the people of the Third World were estranged from their spiritual and material values. Today colonialist powers are resorting to fresh political, economic and even military means to continue their rule. Mr Velayati said the South-South cooperation was a prerequisite to the task of the Third World countries. He said: Collective self-sufficiency in the Third World could be further achieved through cooperation in organizations such as the Non-Aligned Movement, the African Unity Organization, and the Islamic Conference Organization. Our country's Foreign Minister referred to the expansion of Iran's cooperation with Africa after the victory of the Islamic revolution. He said: Iran's diplomatic relations with African countries has doubled in the past 15 years. We are actively taking part in the development programs of African countries. Referring to the severance of relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the racist regime of South Africa he said: Iran continues to give the necessary support to freedom-seeking struggles in Africa, such as the struggle of the Namibian nation. We hope that, from now on, through unity and understanding, especially amongst the majority of the deprived peoples of South Africa, the dark days of racism come to an end in that country, too.
