It will finalize detailed ways and means of their privatization with enough time, not sticking to the previously-set deadline of September. The decision was made by senior officials from relevant ministries in a meeting convened by Vice Economic Planning Minister Han I-hun Wednesday which focused on reviews of problems which could arise in the privatization process, officials present at the two-hour session said yesterday. It came after critics blamed the administration for commissioning the Federation of Korean Industries, a lobbying group of conglomerates, to select the winning bidder for the second cellular phone business license and letting some chaebols [business conglomerates] share interests in this project. Concrete measures will be determined later but officials were initially inclined to divide business scopes of Korea Gas Corp. [KGC] into several parts and put them under the control of private investors to lead them to competition. In this regard, each supply network and station of liquefied natural gas will have a different largest shareholder. KGC is subject to privatization next year. A golf course in the Cheju resort of Chungmun, run by Korea National Tourism Corp., will be placed on a public tender after thorough assessment of its value by August. Officials will keep deliberating on whether or not they will allow National Agricultural Cooperative Federation to maintain the controlling share of 25 percent in Namhae Chemical Corp., a chemical fertilizer producer, for stable supply of the key farming material. However, they will positively consider permitting the participation by large companies in a bidding for the purchase of Hanjung shares because the giant firm will not be managed effectively without their involvement. Hanjung, formerly Korea Heavy Industry & Construction Co., will be handed over to private shareholders gradually after 1996 when it will lose its 15-year authorization to solely supply large power generating facilities.
