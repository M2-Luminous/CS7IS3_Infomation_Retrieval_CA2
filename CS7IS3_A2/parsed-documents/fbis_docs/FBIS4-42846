Despite substantial reductions in personnel levels, personnel costs will remain the main problems for municipality financial departments. Municipalities in the east employ 370 full-time employees for every 10,000 inhabitants compared to just 136 in the west. According to a study conducted by the Institute for the German Economy [IW] published in IW-TRENDS, revenue in the eastern municipalities will rise by an annual average of 6.5 percent and will thus increase more substantially than expenditure, which will grow by 4 percent. This means that the deficit will fall from 5.5 billion German marks [DM] to DM3 billion. Compared to the west, the revenue and expenditure of the municipalities in the east will grow substantially faster: Between 1991 and 1993, revenue in the east rose by an annual average of 10 percent and by 6.5 percent in the west. On the expenditure side, the ratio was 17 percent to 7.5 percent. There is a substantial difference between the structure of municipal finance in the east and in the west. In the old laender, tax revenues account for barely 40 percent of the budgets. In the east, they account for just 5 percent. Alongside the collapse of production and the extremely high level of unemployment, the sum of DM600 free of income tax is also a factor. In addition, the tax on business assets will not be levied until the end of 1995. Starting from a low level, tax revenue rose as a result of substantial increases in wages and salaries. In 1993, it amounted to DM5 billion, which is twice as much as in 1991, and thus accounted for a good 9 percent of expenditure. The IW assumes that in 1995, the share will be 11 percent. The second direct source of revenue, municipal charges, contributed more to municipal budgets than taxes (4.9 percent). In 1995, the ratio should be 9 percent to 11 percent, according to the IW. The explanation for the relatively low revenue from charges -- in municipalities in the west, it estimated that charges will account for 15 percent of revenue in 1995 -- in those in the east, some charges are not collected, such as those for sewage treatment and street cleaning. About half the revenue from charges in the east is used for kindergartens and nursing homes. The low level of self-financing capacity on the part of east German municipalities makes it clear that they are dependent on being allotted funds at the federal and laender levels and from the German Unity Fund. The latter will cease at the end of this year, but allotments for specific purposes and assistance with debts will increase at the same time. Compared to 1991, the revenues from taxes and charges will only rise by 8.6 percentage points to 20 percent of overall revenue. That will represent an improvement in financial capacity, but "not to an adequate degree," says the IW. In 1991, municipal revenue per inhabitant reached 96 percent of the level in the west and will be somewhat higher than in the west in 1995: DM3,898 in the east compared to DM3,534 in the west. Expenditure has evolved in a similar direction. In 1991, personal and materials expenditure as well as investment were slightly above the western level, whereas interest rates and social services were markedly below it. According to the IW, the last two elements will be closer to western levels by the end of 1995. In the case of per capita expenditure on personnel, there will be a slight increase in the gap with the west and a substantial one in the case of investment. According to the IW, "only slight progress" is being made in reducing personnel. Towns without administrative subdistricts "only" reduced personnel by 18 percent between the middle of 1992 and the middle of 1993, and those with administrative subunits reduced personnel by 30 percent during the same period. Only "forced reductions" can create more room for maneuver for self-financed investment. The continued increase in investment is striking. The IW estimates that in 1995, the eastern municipalities will invest twice as much as their western counterparts. In 1993, local communities financed 13.4 percent of all investment in the new laender, whereas the figure in the west was only 7.9 percent. The rapid increase in debt on the part of eastern municipalities has led to a situation in which per capita interest payments have increased by a factor of 10 between 1991 and 1995. The per capita level of debt is DM1,406. It is true that it is only half the level in the west, but in 1991, eastern municipalities had practically no debts at all, the institute stressed.
