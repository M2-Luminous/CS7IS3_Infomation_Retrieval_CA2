He is a graduate of the local School No. 7. He served in the Soviet Army from 1983 through 1985. He has been an active participant in the Karabakh movement. He was imprisoned in 1991 during the Safonov Polyanichko regime. After staying in prison for six months he was exchanged with Azerbaijan's deputy chief justice who was "kidnaped" by Samvel's comrades headed by his brother, Garo. Samvel is one of the organizers of Karabakh's first guerrilla squads. During the "Ring" operation his squad liberated the Dzamdzor village of the Hadrut region. He then participated in the liberation of Khojalu, Kharadakhlu, and Shushi. Subsequent military operations were planned and implemented under his leadership. He is also a deputy in the Supreme Council of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR]. He is married and has two children. Below is an interview with Samvel Babayan, commander of the NKR Armed Forces, by Maksim Hovhannisian, head of the NKR's information and press department. The interview was conducted last week just before the regrettable incident at Matakhis [involving an attack on the Russian envoy] for which the NKR State Defense Committee severely criticized the leadership of the defense forces. [Hovhannisian] Let us begin this interview with the most important question: Do we or do we not have an army? [Babayan] We do. Despite all of its flaws, today our republic has a regular army which is able to defend our borders against enemy incursions and ensure that people can work in peace. Furthermore, if it becomes necessary to strike at the enemy on its own territory to ensure the security of the people, our army is capable of accomplishing such tasks. [Hovhannisian] How was the idea of creating a regular army born? [Babayan] When we liberated Shushi and opened the Lachin corridor, we realized that we needed to create a regular army in order to preserve our military gains over the long run. Many agreed with that idea but did not take any concrete steps. At this point certain mistakes were made. Then the painful period of failures began. First we lost Shahumyan, then most of the Martakert region. Many people lost faith in our forces. Despair became our greatest enemy. In order to overcome this string of failures it was necessary to launch a decisive counterstrike against the enemy. That could only be done by a well-trained regular army, which we did not have. At the beginning it was very difficult. Many of the guerrilla squads refused to obey general orders, and their forces operated in a haphazard manner. It was relatively easy to implement our plans in the Askeran region and the results were observed quickly. The process of creating an army began to move forward in August of last year. Of course, it cannot be said that we have solved all the problems associated with the creation of an army. However, we have established a barracks regime in the army, except that a battle proposal by the general command is not considered a battle order. Also, orders are carried out in a qualified manner, although not always. That is related to the training of the army. Mechanisms of army life are being created and perfected with each battle. [Hovhannisian] These days there is much talk in the press about the offensive operations of the NKR Army. It is said that the Army has a vested interest in such operations. [Babayan] Yes, some newspapers have written that everyone wants peace except the Army. That is not true. What the Army is doing has only two objectives: to ensure the security of the population and the inviolability of our state borders and to force the enemy to recognize our national rights. All of our operations are coordinated with the NKR leadership. Let us take the demilitarization of the Kelbajar region. Without that operation it would be impossible to return the refugees from Martakert to their homes because there was always the danger that the enemy could strike from behind. There was a time when the panicked residents of Martakert were not only abandoning their homes but were also deserting the ranks. Now the situation is completely different. Today the borders of that region are defended only by the military units of that region. Let us take another example. Why was it necessary to demilitarize the city of Agdam? First, it was necessary to stop the artillery attacks from Agdam on Askeran and Stepanakert. Second, it was necessary to force the enemy to sit at the negotiating table. As is known, the first official Azeri-Karabakh talks began after the fall of Agdam. However, Azerbaijan declined to continue that dialogue at the instigation of certain international forces. [Hovhannisian] The world press and international organizations hastily condemned the advances of the NKR Army. Despite those condemnations, we undertook military operations on the southern front. How can that be interpreted? Are we thumbing our noses at world opinion? Are we confronting international forces? Is not our posture defiant? [Babayan] That is how it appears at first glance, but the actual state of affairs tells a completely different story. As you know, in 1991 the Azeris occupied 24 villages in Hadrut with their "Ring" operation. Second, they were shelling Martuni, Hadrut, Edillu and other Armenian population centers as well as the Lachin corridor continuously from Fizuli and Kubatlu. Third, we made it known to them that things will not end with Agdam and that they must reckon with the reality that has been created. It is these considerations that prompted the launching of military operations on the southwestern front. As a result, there were Azeri-Karabakh talks in Moscow sponsored by the Russian Federation. It is not a secret for anyone that NKR gained international recognition as a party to the conflict only after our military successes. People recognize might. I repeat: the NKR Army wants peace, and, in my opinion, we must have a strong and battleworthy army so that peace will come quickly. The Azeri side requested several times to extend the ceasefire. We agreed, although we know very well that they are using that time to regroup their forces. We are similarly preparing to greet the enemy appropriately. [Hovhannisian] Let us return to the problems associated with the creation of an army. [Babayan] The [NKR Army] must be a battleworthy mobile entity equipped with modern weaponry; it must be ready to strike at the enemy at any point in the republic; and it must be able to defend our borders on land and in the air. I do not think that it is possible for NKR to survive without such an army. [Hovhannisian] That is how it has turned out to be. Perhaps one of the peculiarities of the Karabakh movement is that our fedayeen [guerrilla] boys have risen to the highest ranks of the Army. These boys are patriotic, brave and prepared to defend our land, but many of them have no military training. Some of them have not even served in the [Soviet] Army. [Babayan] That was the case at the beginning. Today we have in our Army hundreds of senior professional officers who have received serious training in the Soviet Army. As for the fact that many of the commanders are yesterday's fedayeen boys, those men have learned the art of war on the battlefield and passed muster by hard experience. We have young people who are formally trained and who want to serve their homeland in the ranks of the NKR Army. They are the real future of our Army. I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to all staff officers from Karabakh who serve in the armies of Russia and other countries: Brothers, return to Karabakh, and let us defend our homeland together. [Hovhannisian] What has been the principal accomplishment in the creation of the Army? [Babayan] Today every soldier in our Army takes a ceremonious oath, and the orders of the commanders are being executed without objections at all levels. We also managed to end the practice of serving in the Army while staying home. Today we are strictly maintaining a barracks regime in our military. I also consider an important accomplishment the creation of quite normal, technically satisfactory bases for different domains of military service. For example, we take pride in our tank repair facility where everything has been built on solid foundations. Until recently our barracks were housed in buildings formerly occupied by schools and kindergartens. We have now built, with our own resources, barracks with basic facilities, training centers for different military units with their own firing ranges and other facilities. [Hovhannisian] Doubts have been expressed in the foreign press that little Karabakh does not have the economic means to acquire such quantities of military equipment and that Armenia is helping us. [Babayan] The first part of that statement is true. It is true that economically we are not that strong, especially in conditions of a blockade, to acquire as many weapons and as much ammunition as we have in our hands today. However, they are wrong about the sources of such acquisitions. We have captured 80 percent, if not more, of our military means from the enemy. Various anectodes circulate among our soldiers about this subject. [Hovhannisian] For example, about one-time-use aircraft and tanks provided to us by Ukraine and Turkey through Azerbaijan. [Babayan] As for the question of what is our military leadership focusing its attention on at this time, we believe that, having been defeated on land, the enemy will try to attack by air. Now we are working in that direction, with some success. [passage omitted]
