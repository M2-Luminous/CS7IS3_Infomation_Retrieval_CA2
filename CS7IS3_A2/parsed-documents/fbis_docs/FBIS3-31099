On this occasion, you said that the Slovak Republic was prepared to immediately conclude an agreement with Hungary on reconciliation in all spheres, putting their relations on a new basis. [passage omitted] [Meciar] I discussed this issue with the Hungarian prime minister during our meeting in Prague. It is not possible to build on the past, while forever returning, in the negative sense, to what happened in the past. It is necessary to say that we are going to outline a new program for relations between the two states. It is necessary to declare clearly that we are interested in European integration and to respect these regulations in relations between us, too. [passage omitted] Without a settlement of these relations and without embarking on cooperation and mutual integration, our integration into Western Europe is not possible--and, of course, no security structure would ever accept quareling neighbors. [Bartisek] Can one say that both sides, Slovakia and Hungary, are going to meet each other halfway? [Meciar] It would be premature to put it this way, but certainly the Slovak side has made an offer. [passage omitted] [Bartisek] As prime minister, speaking about Radio Free Europe [RFE], private stations, or, rather, already paralyzed Slovak radio, which one do you prefer as your source of information? [Meciar] I have not listened to RFE since 1989. It is their problem how they [word indistinct] report current affairs, but, as far as I know, they are being listened to by 1.04 percent of the population of the Slovak Republic. And they have to put not insignificant money into it. However, this is a matter for RFE. While tuning, I sometimes catch one of the private stations. I have a habit, perhaps a negative or perhaps a positive one, of working with the radio on in the background. My radio is on constantly. I do not think that Slovak radio is in bad shape. I think it is in a phase of looking for its identity, its new organizational structure; rationalization of its management is under way. This may improve its conditions. Of course, if certain steps are taken as regards the management, the government will come to help. We, more or less, are just watching to see how you are coping with some internal matters. I can say that most frequently I listen to Slovak radio. You are not in such a bad situation. It is necessary to be aware of the fact that you have embarked on a rather complicated internal struggle, and this always costs something. You need time to achieve consolidation. However, this is not unique to radio; it is something that can be applied to the entire state.
