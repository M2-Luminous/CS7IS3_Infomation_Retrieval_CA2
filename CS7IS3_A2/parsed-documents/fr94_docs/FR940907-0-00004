ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its policies and procedures governing debt settlement of Community Programs loans. These changes are necessary to comply with Section 2384, Title XXIII, of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;624). This law is to establish and implement a program that is similar to the program established under Section 353 of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2001), except that the debt restructuring and loan servicing procedures shall apply to delinquent Community Facility hospital or health care program loans rather than Farmer Program loans. The intended effect is to keep these facilities in operation with manageable debt. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 7, 1994.

(7 CFR part 3015, subpart V; 48 FR 29112, June 24, 1983, 49 FR 2267, May 31, 1984, 50 FR 14088, April 10, 1985.) Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number 0575&hyph;0124 in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. This final rule does not revise or impose any new information collection requirements from those approved by OMB. Background Information Section 2384 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101&hyph;624, amended the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act and requires the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a debt restructuring and loan servicing program for FmHA hospital or health care facility borrowers. This program is similar to the loan restructuring and servicing program in effect for delinquent Farmer Program loans. This rule amends current FmHA regulations to implement this program. The program is intended to facilitate the continued operation of rural hospitals and health care facilities by implementing all possible debt restructuring options available that will result in an economically viable facility. Given the congressional intent to provide rural hospitals and health care facilities a debt restructuring option similar to that provided Farmer Program borrowers, this regulation is modeled in a general sense on the Farmer Program restructuring scheme. Under this regulation, a hospital or health care debtor who is delinquent on its FmHA loan, and is unable to cure its delinquency through more traditional servicing methods, will be notified of the options available for debt restructuring. The debtor can apply for consideration by providing financial and operational information and proposing its own plan for curing the delinquency. In order to be eligible for consideration for debt restructuring, the debtor's delinquency must have been caused by factors outside the debtor's control. In addition, the debtor must have acted in good faith with regard to the FmHA loan. FmHA will make these determinations based on the debtor's representation and the Agency's review of other documents relevant to these preliminary matters. Once the debtor provides the financial and operational information required, FmHA will conduct a thorough analysis of the debtor's operations. This analysis will typically include contracting for an independent appraisal of the collateral securing the loan and contracting with an independent expert to prepare an ``operations review.'' This review will provide FmHA with information regarding the facility's operations, its financial standing, and suggest alternatives that could be implemented to address the delinquency.
