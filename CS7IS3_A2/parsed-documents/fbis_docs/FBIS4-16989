Together with members of Working Russia, they cleaned up the area around the monument to the participants in the first communist subbotnik. Working Perovo has decided to sponsor this rayon. Several hundred people also went to the monument to Karl Marx that day. During the operation to clean up the adjoining public garden an enormous number of used disposable syringes were discovered among the mountains of garbage which the "democratic" authorities are too busy to remove. Addressing a rally, Working Russia leader Viktor Anpilov said that the time has come to clear not just the city of garbage but society of the filth which we have acquired from the capitalization foisted on us by Yeltsin's reforms. While there I managed to snatch a brief impromptu interview from Anpilov on the actions which Working Russia intends to carry out in the near future. Here is what he said: "Active preparations for the May Day demonstration are underway in all Russia's cities. The assemblies of residents of Tyumen, Ishim, and Voronezh and the congress of working people of Moscow and the greater Moscow region have sent telegrams to Prime Minister Chernomyrdin demanding that the May Day demonstration by Moscow's working people on the 1 May state holiday be held without interference. The appropriate notification has been sent to the Moscow authorities by the Russian Communist Workers Party, the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU, and the Union of Communists.... At 1000 hours on 23 April Working Russia will hold a congress at the Reutovo Palace of Culture in which delegations from communist and workers parties from Brazil, Greece, the United States, Syria, Turkey, and Finland will be taking part. Incidentally, we are inviting Soviet and foreign journalists and accreditation will take place one hour before the congress opens."
