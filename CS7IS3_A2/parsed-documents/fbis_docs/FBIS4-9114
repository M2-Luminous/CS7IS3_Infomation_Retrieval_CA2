This was the second multiple rocket-launcher attack today and it was carried out at about 1600. Altogether six rockets were fired from positions on the left bank of the Sava river, i.e. from the territory of the Republic of Croatia, and both attacks were launched on civilian targets. In addition to multiple rocket-launcher attacks, Croatian artillery fired 16 shells on the [Bosnia] Serb villages of Krepsic and Loncari from positions near Zupanja and Bosnjaci, also from the territory of the Republic of Croatia. Nobody was wounded in the attack but considerable material damage was caused. Republic of Srpska army units were forced to respond to the attacks. All this confirms assumptions that an intensification of attacks can be expected, which is aimed at severing the corridor which links the republic of Serb Krajina and the republic of Srpska with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
