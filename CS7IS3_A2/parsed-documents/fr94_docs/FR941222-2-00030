FR941222-2-00030 FR941222-2-00025 Dixie Pipeline Company; Notice of Complaint [Docket No. OR95&hyph;2&hyph;000] December 16, 1994. Take notice that on November 18, 1994, Santee Distributing Company (Santee) filed a complaint against Dixie Pipeline Company (Dixie) pursuant to section 13(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA). Santee alleges that Dixie's throughput has increased since 1991 and its current rates in Tariff No. 52 are no longer just and reasonable. Santee states that the Commission should investigate, inter alia, Dixie's cost of service and throughput in order to derive new rates, and should order a reduction in Dixie's current rates. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said complaint should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.215. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before January 17, 1995. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Answers to this complaint are due on or before January 17, 1995. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31411 Filed 12&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
