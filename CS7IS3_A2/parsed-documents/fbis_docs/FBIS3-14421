Speaking to our correspondent this morning, Netanyahu warned that such an act would cause a terrible rift. He reiterated his call on the prime minister to consult with leaders of the opposition and with the Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza settlement leaders on ways to safeguard the security of Hebron settlers. Uprooting is not the answer to the problem of their security, Netanyahu said. He further stated that Hebron is the heart of Eretz Yisra'el, and that we have never acknowledged its being an occupied territory. He said he is against the uprooting of Jews from anywhere, including Hebron.
