This is a state bank, in which the controlling share of stock belongs to state structures. Roseximbank has been set up in the form of a privately held joint-stock company with charter capital of 51 billion rubles. Its stockholders are the Central Bank, the Federal Property Fund, the Bank for Foreign Trade, and the foreign trade associations Tekhnopromeksport, Tekhstroyeksport, Machinoeksport, and Selkhozpromeksport. According to Viktor Shilin, deputy minister of foreign economic relations, who became the bank's chairman of the board, the need for its creation became evident as much as a year ago; however, the road from the idea's conception to its implementation proved long. The main task of the new bank is to extend credit to Russian producers of machinery and technical products and stimulate exports. Statistical data show that the share of machinery and equipment in the total volume of exports continues to decline. At the same time there has been and still is a stable demand for many varieties of domestically produced machine-building and technical products in foreign markets. Quite often, however, producers find themselves in a situation of being simply unable to tend to production, since its financing through commercial banks, given the current rate of inflation, is becoming simply impossible. The Roseximbank will finance real export contracts and, judging by all signs, the terms for producers will be very favorable. At the same time the Roseximbank will insure export credits. In the opinion of the Roseximbank president, the new financial structure will occupy its own, quite well-defined, niche and will not compete with other banks.
