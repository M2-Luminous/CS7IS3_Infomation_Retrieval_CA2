With a 6.3-percent growth in the GNP in 1993, the new laender have earned a reputation in Germany and Europe as "Growth Region Number One." A 6- to 8-percent increase in the GNP can be expected this year. However, these growth figures should not cloud the fact that eastern Germany continues to be dependent on the "western bread-basket," for, last year, almost half the east's expenditures were financed by the West. A Divided Industrial Development A gradual rise in eastern Germany's productivity is to be expected over the next few years. However, the increased productivity will not be equal in all industrial spheres. Differentiation is to be expected just as before. In those industrial spheres that produce for local markets or profit directly from west German transfer payments, the progress is obvious. That applies to handicrafts and the retail trade, services and the construction industry, and to industrial branches such as food and mineral resources. On the other hand, those industrial branches involved in competition with the west, such as the textile, machine, and chemical industries, are still faced with considerable difficulties. Many industrial branches should expand their production during 1994, so that the economic growth in the east will reach a new dimension. At the same time, personnel reductions should be halted. In view of the veritable "cold shower" suffered particularly by industry in the new laender, it is not only necessary to halt personnel reductions there, but also create new jobs. This requirement is made all the clearer when one compares the situation in the east with that in the west. In the east, the number of people employed in industry per 1 million of the total population is only 50 percent of the western figure, and industrial turnover is only 20 percent of the western figure. Reasons for the Breakup of Industry There is no doubt that the breakup of industry on a massive scale in the east is the result of a combination of several factors: -- The introduction of the German mark on 1 July 1990 represented a massive change for the enterprises in the former GDR [German democratic Republic]. The east German enterprises were exposed to international competition virtually overnight. They had no time to create the competitiveness that was missing in terms of the quality and price of their products. -- As a result of East European trade's conversion from transfer rubles to hard currency on 1 January 1991 and the subsequent drastic restructuring in the countries of Central and East Europe, east German enterprises lost their traditional markets. After all, 70 percent of east German trade was earmarked for East Europe. -- As a result of the "Rapid Adaptation of the Standard of Living" slogan of 1990, firms found themselves under enormous financial pressure. Industrial plants were compelled to come to terms with wage increases of 25 percent and more, and this at a level of productivity comparable to Greece. This was nothing less than a death sentence to those plants that had found themselves exposed to foreign competition. -- Potential investors encountered numerous obstacles in the new laender. There were major deficiencies in the infrastructure, and major problems with the acquisition of property. Added to this was the inefficiency of the administration and unresolved ecological issues, such as the question of who should take over the responsibility for old waste deposits. -- A comparison with the economic situation of private and due-to-be-privatized enterprises brought home the fact that enterprises managed by the Trust Agency are in a comparatively worse situation with their orders, and have a lower turnover and lower level of investments. -- All the above factors were joined by another one -- the effect of the worldwide recession on Germany. The year 1993 brought Germany the biggest drop in production since the war. In view of all these changes and developments and the combination thereof, industrial development in the new laender comes as a surprise to no one. Needless to say, the dramatic impact of these developments, especially the impact on the labor market, could have been softened by means of different conduct and different concepts. The necessary revision of thinking should have occurred at an early stage. Developing a Feeling for Reality and Confidence In the meantime, it should have become clear to everyone that a centrally managed economy cannot be converted into a free-market economy over the space of just a few years and without major upheavals. Prosperity can neither be decreed nor enforced. Therefore expectations and behavior must be adapted to the reality. This requires that the people of eastern Germany restrain their demands that the people of western Germany cease thinking in materialistic terms. Old habits must be reconsidered and new priorities established. A high degree of restraint and maturity is required in the east and in the west. This must be reflected in wage policy. In order to alleviate the costs crisis in industry and the already precarious situation of the labor market, the social partners in the East can no longer use western wage levels as a pattern, for the only assets enterprises have are those which they themselves create through market competition. To stop the competitiveness of enterprises exposed to competition from deteriorating even further, a clearer orientation of productivity is necessary just as much as a stronger flexibility and differentiation of wages. Reorientation to Western Markets But east German entrepreneurs are also required to alter their way of thinking. Because the traditional Central and East European consumer markets have almost completely disappeared and the development of the situation particularly in the countries of the former Soviet Union is not quite clear, there must be a reorientation to Western markets. There is no alternative to this reorientation, even if external factors still make it difficult to win new customers and markets. In order to increase the market for east German products and thus improve the orders situation for east German enterprises, the Confederation of German Industry and Trust Agency together launched the so-called New Bundeslaender Trade Offensive at the beginning of last year. The purpose of this initiative, sponsored by the "Industrial Initiative for Germany," is to double the trade capacity of the west German economy between 1992 and 1995. At first, 33 west German enterprises belonged to this trade initiative. Now, 100 industrial and trade enterprises belong to it. Even if the New Bundeslaender Trade Offensive has got off to a good start, it cannot solve all the trade problems of east German enterprises on its own. In addition to this, a continuation of the Trust Agency's privatization activity is just as necessary as an increased competitiveness of the products manufactured in the new laender. The introduction of time-limited and regressively structured value-added tax concessions would have been very helpful for industrial enterprises in the new laender, and would have made it easier for them to enter the harsh markets of the Western world. They woid have received a bonus for every mark they earned. The advantage of this idea is that the bonuses would have depended on productivity, and not on the principle whereby "he who incurs the greatest losses receives the largest subsidies." Market forces would not have been paralyzed, and because of the time-limitation and regressive-structure factor, the possible financial burden for households would have been limited. But unfortunately, this proposal, already a subject of debate by the Confederation of German Industry for quite some time, has not been implemented to this very day, even though it would be a useful addition to the economy-promotion programs for the new laender, especially the program to encourage investments. In view of the need to renew the out-dated capital assets in the new laender, the government's proposal to promote capital is most welcome. But because investments need time before they have an impact on the labor market, parallel measures are desirable in at least a few selected branches, measures such as wage restraint and the value-added tax concessions I mentioned earlier. Just as before, the main economic-political challenge is to consolidate investment activity and create permanently profitable jobs in eastern Germany. This challenge can only be met if the locational conditions in the whole of the Federal Republic are improved, for the continually necessary financial help for eastern Germany cannot be permanently provided at the expense of general prosperity, but has to be earned by enterprises in harsh international competition. Solving Structural Problems Therefore the problem is not just to overcome development difficulties, but above all to solve the structural problems. This applies to the high labor costs and costs of environmental protection, the unusually high tax burden, the social security network that can hardly be financed any more, and the runaway national debt. In order to overcome the cost crisis in the economy and the confidence crisis in politics, a priority task is to restrain the ever increasing activity of the state, for economic growth is not an automatic process. It can only occur when market forces are free to develop. For this purpose,the social security system must be made more dependent on one's own contribution. Without appropriate incentives, an abuse of this system at the expense of the socially insured is guaranteed. Last but not least, job guarantees must be accorded greater importance in wages policy. Only when we face the facts and concentrate first of all not on material distribution, but on economic growth, can the competitiveness of German industry be improved and east German industry be provided with fresh prospects.
