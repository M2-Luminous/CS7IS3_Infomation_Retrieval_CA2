FR941230-1-00057 FR941230-1-00004 Example 3. Unrelated garage. City Y issues bonds with proceeds of $50 million for construction of a new public safety building ($30.5 million) and for improvements to an existing courthouse ($15 million). Y uses $3 million of the bond proceeds for renovations to an existing privately operated cafeteria located in the courthouse. The bonds are secured, in part, by the cafeteria. Y also uses $1.5 million of the proceeds to construct a privately operated parking garage adjacent to a private office building. The private business use of the parking garage is unrelated to any government use of proceeds of the issue. Since the proceeds used for unrelated uses and disproportionate uses do not exceed 5 percent of the proceeds, the unrelated or disproportionate use test is not met. Example 4. Disproportionate use of garage. County Z issues bonds with proceeds of $20 million for construction of a hospital with no private business use ($17 million); renovation of an office building with no private business use ($1 million); and construction of a garage that is entirely used for a private business use ($2 million). The use of the garage is related to the use of the office building but not to the use of the hospital. The private business use of the garage results in $1 million of disproportionate use because the proceeds used for the garage ($2 million) exceed the proceeds used for the related government use ($1 million). The bonds are not private activity bonds, however, because the disproportionate use does not exceed 5 percent of the proceeds of the issue. Example 5. Bonds for multiple projects. (i) County X issues bonds with proceeds of $80 million for the following purposes: (1) $72 million to construct a County owned and operated waste incinerator; (2) $1 million for a County owned and operated facility for the temporary storage of hazardous waste prior to final disposal; (3) $1 million to construct a privately owned recycling facility; and (4) $6 million to build a garage adjacent to the County owned incinerator that will be leased to Company Y to store and repair trucks that it owns and uses to haul County X refuse. Company Y uses 75 percent of its trucks to haul materials to the incinerator and the remaining 25 percent of its trucks to haul materials to the temporary storage facility. (ii) The $1 million of proceeds used for the recycling facility is used for an unrelated use. The garage is related use. In addition, 75 percent of the use of the $6 million of proceeds used for the garage is allocable to the government use of proceeds at the incinerator. The remaining 25 percent of the garage ($1.5 million) relates to the government use of proceeds at the temporary storage facility. Thus, this portion of the proceeds used for the garage exceeds the proceeds used for the temporary storage facility by $.5 million and this excess is disproportionate use (but not unrelated use). Thus, the aggregate amount of unrelated use and disproportionate use financed with the proceeds of the issue is $1.5 million. Alternatively, under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, the entire garage may be treated as related to the government use of the incinerator and, under that allocation, the garage is not disproportionate use. In either event, section 141(b)(3) limits the aggregate unrelated use and disproportionate use to $4 million. Therefore, the bonds are not private activity bonds under this section. §1.141&hyph;10 Coordination with volume cap. Section 141(b)(5) provides a special definition of private activity bond for bonds having a nonqualified amount of more than $15 million. The provisions of §§1.141&hyph;1 through 1.141&hyph;16 (except §1.141&hyph;12) apply to section 141(b)(5). §1.141&hyph;11 Acquisition of nongovernmental output property. Section 141(d) provides a special definition of private activity bond for bonds the proceeds of which are used to acquire nongovernmental output property. The provisions of §§1.141&hyph;1 through 1.141&hyph;16 (except §1.141&hyph;12) apply to section 141(d). §1.141&hyph;12 Special rules for qualified bonds. (a) Actual compliance required . Except as provided in §1.145&hyph;1 and this section, a private activity bond is a qualified bond only if the issue of which it is a part satisfies all of the applicable requirements under section 141(e) throughout the term of the issue. (b) Remedial actions available _(1) In general . Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if an action results in nonqualified use, the remedial actions in §1.141&hyph;13 (other than the actions permitted under §1.141&hyph;13(d)) may be applied to prevent the bonds from ceasing to be treated as tax-exempt bonds (but not to failures existing as of the issue date). (2) Nonqualified use . For purposes of this section, nonqualified use means failures to satisfy the applicable requirements of section 142 (except paragraph (d)), 144 (except paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(10)), 147(c), 147(d), 147(e), or 147(f). (c) Limitation on remedial action _(1) Failure to spend proceeds . In the case of a failure to spend on qualifying costs the percentage of net proceeds required under sections 142(a), 144(a)(1), 144(b), or 144(c)(1), paragraph (b) of this section applies only if the amount of the issue was based on reasonable estimates of the cost of facilities (or other property) to be provided by the issue and the failure to expend the net proceeds on qualifying costs was due to circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as of the issue date.
