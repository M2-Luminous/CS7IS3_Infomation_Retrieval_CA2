FR940110-0-00016 FR940110-0-00005 The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are 5 handlers of California olives that will be subject to regulation under the order during the current season, and there are about 1,350 olive producers in California. There are approximately 25 importers of olives subject to the olive import regulation. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR §121.601] as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms, have been defined by the Small Business Administration as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000. None of the domestic olive handlers may be classified as small entities. The majority of olive producers and importers may be classified as small entities. This rule finalizes an interim final rule that establishes grade and size requirements for olives grown in California, which are authorized for limited use styles. The interim final rule was published in the September 17, 1993, Federal Register [58 FR 48592], and provided 30 days to interested persons to file comments. No comments were received. This rule also finalizes an interim final rule that authorizes the importation of smaller sized olives for limited uses. The interim final rule was published in the September 17, 1993, Federal Register [58 FR 48595], and provided 30 days for interested persons to file comments. No comments were received. Nearly all of the olives grown in the United States are produced in California. The growing areas are scattered throughout California with most of the commercial production coming from inland valleys. In 1990, about 77 percent of the production came from the San Joaquin Valley and 23 percent from the Sacramento Valley. California olives are primarily used for canned ripe whole and whole pitted olives which are eaten out of hand as hors d'oeuvres or used as an ingredient in cooking and in salads. The canned ripe olive market is essentially a domestic market. Very few shipments of California olives are exported. Olive production has fluctuated from a low of 24,200 tons during the 1972&hyph;73 crop year to a high of 168,500 tons during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year. The California Olive Committee (committee) indicated that 1991&hyph;92 production totalled about 63,260 tons. The various varieties of olives produced in California have alternate bearing tendencies with high production one year and low the next. Total production for the 1992&hyph;93 crop year is approximately 163,500 tons. Total production for the 1993&hyph;94 crop year is estimated to be 110,000 tons. However, based on past production and marketing experience, the committee believes that handlers will need smaller sized olives during the 1993&hyph;94 crop year to meet market requirements for limited use styles of canned olives for the 1993&hyph;94 year. Absent this action, olives which are smaller than those authorized for whole and whole pitted canning uses would have to be disposed of by handlers into non-canning uses such as crushing into oil. Paragraph (a)(3) of §932.52 of the order provides that processed olives smaller than the sizes prescribed for whole and whole pitted styles may be used for limited uses if recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. Until October 1, 1991, paragraph (a)(3) also prescribed minimum sizes, by variety group, which could be authorized for use in the production of limited use styles by the Secretary. Effective October 1, 1991, certain non-canning size disposition requirements specified in §932.51(a)(3) and minimum sizes authorized for limited use specified in §932.52(a)(3) of the marketing order were suspended. The committee may now recommend the use of olives for limited uses that are smaller than those previously permitted under the order. Minimum size and grade requirements may be recommended annually by the committee and approved by the Secretary. The sizes authorized herein are the same as those established for the 1992&hyph;93 crop year. The minimum sizes which could previously be authorized for limited uses were established in a 1971 amendment to the marketing order. Olives smaller than the prescribed minimum sizes which could be authorized for limited uses had to be disposed of through less profitable non-canning uses such as crushing for oil. Returns to producers are lower on smaller fruit used for such purposes. The use of smaller sized olives for limited use styles has been authorized in all but two crop years since the order was instituted in 1965. Since the 1971 amendment, there have been substantial changes within the olive industry. In spite of the annual limited use authorization, in recent years the industry has not been able to meet market needs for its products, especially the limited use styles used primarily by the food service industry. The demand for processed olives and for limited use styles is expected to continue to increase. At the same time, the industry has not been able to increase production to meet market needs for canned ripe olives. The committee conducted a study during the 1990&hyph;91 crop year to determine the feasibility of utilizing smaller sized olives in the production of limited use styles and to determine which sizes could be efficiently processed into such styles. All olive handlers within the industry participated in the study. All handlers reported that smaller sizes can be efficiently processed into limited use styles. Advanced technology in the form of better processing equipment is currently available. The new technology allows handlers to process smaller olives into limited use styles more efficiently than was possible in the past. This action will help growers and handlers to meet the growing market requirements for limited use style olives based upon current conditions. The size requirements allow the use of sizes which would otherwise have to be disposed of for non-canning use. In turn, growers should receive a larger return from such olives. By a mail ballot vote ending June 15, 1993, the committee unanimously recommended establishment of grade and size regulations during the 1993&hyph;94 crop year pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of §932.52 of the order. The grade requirements are the same as established in recent seasons. The specific sizes for the variety groups are the minimum sizes which are deemed desirable for use in the production of limited use styles at this time. As in past years, permitting the use of the smaller olives in the production of limited use styles allowed handlers to take advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives. Handlers will be able to market more olives than would be permitted in the absence of this relaxation in size requirements. This additional opportunity is provided to maximize the use of the available olive supplies and facilitate market expansion, thereby increasing returns to growers. In the absence of this action, the smaller fruit would have to be disposed of for less profitable, non-canning uses. Section 8(e) of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements are in effect for olives under a domestic marketing order, imported olives must meet the same or comparable requirements. This action allows smaller olives for limited use styles under the marketing order. Therefore, a corresponding change is needed in the olive import regulation. Canned ripe olives, and bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives, imported into the United States must meet certain minimum grade and size requirements specified in Olive Regulation 1 (7 CFR 944.401). All canned ripe olives are required to be inspected and certified prior to importation (release from custody of the United States Custom Service), and all bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives must be inspected and certified prior to canning. ``Canned ripe olives'' means olives in hermetically sealed containers and heat sterilized under pressure, of two distinct types, ``ripe'' and ``green-ripe'', as defined in the current U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives (7 CFR 52.3751&hyph;52.3764). The term does not include Spanish-style green olives. Any lot of olives failing to meet the import requirements may be exported or disposed of under the supervision of the Processed Products Branch of the Fruit and Vegetable Division, with the costs of certifying the disposal of the olives borne by the importer. Any person may import up to 100 pounds (drained weight) of canned ripe olives or bulk olives exempt from these grade and size requirements. This final rule modifies paragraph (b)(12) of the olive import regulation (7 CFR 944.401 (b)(12)) to authorize the importation of bulk olives which do not meet the minimum size requirements established for olives for whole and whole pitted uses to be used in the production of limited use styles for the 1993&hyph;94 season which begins August 1, 1993. This rule also establishes size regulations for such olives in paragraph (b)(12). Import regulations issued under the Act are based on regulations established under Federal marketing orders to regulate domestically produced products. The grade and size requirements contained in the olive import regulation are based on those in effect for olives grown in California under Marketing Order No. 932. This action reflects a recommendation by the committee to change the requirements for olives for limited use styles grown in California. The committee works with the Department in administering the marketing order program for California olives.
