The objective is to form a united front to defeat the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD] in the coming elections. Legislator Gloria Moreno, spokesperson for the group, read a statement titled "For the Unity of Democratic Forces," in which they made their summons. The document was presented at the seat of the Assembly Credential Commission. According to election polls, the PRD is the people's favorite, with a 35 percent lead. Opponents are trying to unite in order to defeat the front runner in the upcoming election. The document reads: "We hereby offer our services as mediators to facilitate a broad-based understanding among democratic forces. We also call upon the candidates and the people to support this statement." The statement is signed by Marco Ameglio, for the National Renewal Movement; Gisela Chung, for the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement [MOLIRENA]; Raquel Lanuza, for the Christian Democratic Party; Rodrigo Molina for Solidarity Party; Jose Paredes mayoral candidate for the National Unity Mission; Jilmer Gonzalez of the Arnulfist Party; Mario Lasso for MOLIRENA, and Gloria Moreno. They have also called a meeting among all sectors opposed to the PRD in the next few days "to discuss the contents of an agreement to defend democracy." The politicians highlighted the historic relevance of President Guillermo Endara's "brave decision" to disclose several videotaped recordings of corruption within the military government. The note adds that "the president's action constitutes a vital measure that made the people realize what the PRD really represents. It also made the democratic leaders reflect on the unity needed to prevent the allies of the military from rising to power." Opponents of the PRD condemned the disgraceful past of "demagoguery and violence against those who struggled under a single flag, a past that the PRD now wishes to hide with unrestrained cynicism." The PRD is the former political wing of the dismembered military regime. Many of the party's activists have been accused of corruption and other illegal activities, although the party maintains that the accusations are part of a persecution campaign launched by the present government. Following the meeting of the legislators, PRD Legislator Elias Castillo affirmed that "this is the expression of those who want to rise to power and those who want to remain." He questioned the possibility of unity among the forces that oppose the PRD and said that his party has "the force of the organized population." Castillo added that the PRD also has "a personality of its own; it is not divided. The PRD is united," while its opponents are divided. "The people are intelligent and have a keen eye. They will not be fooled by the false prophesies of its opponents. They only demonstrate their division. The only thing that unites them is their ambition for power," he argued. Castillo said that the videotapes Endara showed "will not affect the party's image at all," which has received the full support of its activists and followers.
