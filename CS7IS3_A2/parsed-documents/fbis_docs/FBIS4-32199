I can confirm what President Iliescu has said, namely that between our countries there are no differences at all in the field of foreign policy regarding events in Europe and the goals that the two countries promote in their foreign policies. I have recalled on various occasions the stages that can indeed confirm the mutual feelings of sympathy that have developed between our two nations throughout history. I can remember the favorable way in which the public in Czechoslovakia hailed the support granted to them by Romania in 1968 and I can remember just as well the state of anxiety and disgust that the public in Czechoslovakia felt toward what was happening in the last years of the Ceausescu era. For example, Ceausescu's initiative to destroy villages met with the Czechoslovak public's complete disapproval. I can also remember the great interest showed by the public in Czechoslovakia in the events that led to the fall of the Ceausescu regime, as well as the feelings of empathy nurtured by the Czechoslovak public for the revolution that unfortunately resulted in the loss of so many lives. Apart from the political goal of this visit which culminated with the signing of the treaty on friendly relations and cooperation between Romania and the Czech Republic, our presence in Bucharest has also made a contribution to a more profound familiarization with realities in Romania and with the development of the political situation in this country. During the official talks we held with President Iliescu, Prime Minister Vacaroiu, and the presidents of the two chambers of the Romanian Parliament, but also during informal occasions, such as the official dinner that took place last night, I had an opportunity to understand more clearly the way in which democracy in Romania operates. The meeting I had at Bucharest University with representatives of the opposition, with whom I discussed various aspects of Romanian life, gave me the opportunity to get to know Romania better. I am firmly convinced that the economic and political relations between our countries will continue to progress and I have the feeling that the next step that we could take would be to sign an accord on free trade. We estimate that such an accord could be signed this coming fall on the occasion of the meeting of the two premiers. In conditions of a market economy, as far as a development of economic relations are concerned, everything depends on economic companies. However, governments can also make a contribution to this development by creating a concrete framework for the development of such relations and I am sure that the governments of these two countries, that is, of Romania and the Czech Republic, can do this. Once again, I wish to express thanks for this invitation and the hospitality extended to me and for the fact that I was given the opportunity to visit Romania for the first time in my life.
