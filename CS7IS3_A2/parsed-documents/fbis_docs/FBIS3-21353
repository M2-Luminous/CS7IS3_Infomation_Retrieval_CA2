It is also an accurate indicator of the extent to which the leadership of this country, may God save it, is keen on paying the utmost attention to whatever is of interest to citizens in their daily lives. At a time when the currencies of many advanced nations are tumbling, such as the U.S. dollar versus the Japanese yen and the collapse of the exchange rate of European currencies last August following the decline of the French franc and the pound Sterling--that collapse which prompted the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta, and the Portuguese escudo to leave the European exchange system.... At a time when all this is happening, maintaining the Saudi riyal's value vis-a-vis the dollar and other world currencies is irrefutable proof of the strength and solidity of the Saudi economy in spite of all international and regional challenges. At a time when budget deficits are widening in many countries of the world--one such country is suffering a $200 billion deficit as a result of world economic recession--there was earnest intent to prepare a balanced Saudi budget without a deficit for the first time in five years. Revenue and expenditure estimates balance at 160 billion riyals [R], reflecting our astute government's insistence on positioning our economy at the head of the economies of the region and of the world as far as strength and rate of growth are concerned. It also reflects our astute government's care to preserve the high standard of living of citizens and residents, and [to protect it from] all inflationary measures or additional burdens on citizens. Comparative cost of living figures in the Kingdom indicate that it continues to be low. The annual increase in the last month of this past year did not exceed 1.8 percent in comparison with the same month a year earlier [as published]. This rate [of increase] is very minuscule in comparison with most countries of the world, as the Ministry of Finance and National Economy pointed out in its statement accompanying the budget. Doubtless, there is no comparison between this rate and the high rates of inflation, exceeding 20 or 30 percent in most cases, that are scorching numerous nations of the world around us. R160 Billion For What? [This is the] climate in which the Kingdom's general budget for 1414/15H [1993/94] was issued. One may wonder why budget estimates settled at R160 billion and no higher. The answer is summarized in the remarks made by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in the recent extraordinary session held by the Council of Ministers to ratify the budget. He said, may God save him: "When preparing and debating this budget, care was taken, as it is every year, to take into consideration services to citizens and [to look after] their interests in all areas of administrative, educational, and health services." This Is No Contraction World economic conditions and increased petroleum supply have [adversely] impacted world [oil] prices and depressed our country's [oil] revenues even further. There was considerable softening of oil prices last year. [Oil] is considered the main source of state income and accounts for 75 percent of total state revenues. This past fiscal year closed with crude prices at an average of $13.20, or a 40-percent drop from $22.00 at the beginning of last year. That was its steepest rate of decline in the past five years. It follows, therefore, that this factor would influence our revenue in the new budget. This is not to be construed as a move towards contraction, since development appropriations were not affected. Our astute government has been keen on preserving the strength of the national economy within the limitations of available resources, and according to the dictate of acumen and discernment, without encumbering citizens with tax burdens as other countries do, and without impeding the course of development in this blessed country. The state had the option, and the right, to impose taxes or fees on citizens, residents, and businessmen, or on the services it offers gratis, in order to boost revenues, or at least to make up for this year's shortfall in public revenues. But our leadership is always insistent on lightening the burden of citizens in order that they may enjoy a high and stable quality of life. It insists, at the same time, on providing the private sector with an opportunity to contribute effectively to the development process without limitations, impediments, or restrictions. This discerning state perception of the private sector's role is in harmony and in tandem with five-year plan objectives of allowing this sector effective participation in the development process, as well as with world trends in this direction. Preliminary estimates of private sector performance last year indicate that it rose up to expectations and accomplished close to a 5.1-percent rate of growth from a year earlier. That rate confirms the continued expansion of the national economy's absorptive capacity thanks to private investments over the past few years. Solid Infrastructure These private sector accomplishments did not come out of thin air, but are rooted in the solid infrastructure developed by the state over the past 20 years at a generous expenditure of $900 billion (R3.375 trillion). This means that our economy is maturing. The state continues to make interest-free soft loans available in the new year to citizens and to investors in the fields of industry, agriculture, real estate, and lending, having appropriated $7.870 billion to the three development funds. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table Shows State Budget Development Over Past 5 Yearsfigures in billion riy-| |als | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Year |Expenditures |Revenues | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1994 |160 |160 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1993 |196.95 |169 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1992 |181 |151 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1991 |143 |118 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1990 |143 |118 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Actual expenditures in the years 1990 and 1991 are estimated at 472.360 bill-| |ion because of additional costs incurred for the war to liberate Kuwait. | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
