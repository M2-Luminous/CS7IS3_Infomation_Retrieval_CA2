These are the findings of an public opinion poll commissioned by Labor for private consumption. According to the poll, 60 percent of the public supports the promotion of the talks and, in part, demands that it be advanced rapidly while making compromises. Only 17 percent favor terminating the talks and 13 percent say they should be frozen. These are the findings of a poll conducted over a representative sample of the Jewish population during the last week of 1993. The poll also shows that the public mainly demands that the government see to it that terror stops, but does not oppose making compromises. The option of a peace agreement and the establishment of a Palestinian state with agreed-on borders won a majority of 47 percent of those surveyed, while 27 percent strongly oppose it, and 13 percent are still hesitant about it. Only 33 percent oppose the abandoning of Judaea and Samaria settlements in return for peace with the Palestinians, while nearly 40 percent are willing to support this. According to the poll, conducted between 27 and 30 December, a majority of the public supports the Oslo and Washington agreements with the PLO, viewing them as correct steps toward peace between Israel and the Palestinians. This is the view of 53 percent of those polled, while 28 percent believe the steps to be wrong. Nearly 70 percent of the public will regard a peace agreement with a Palestinian autonomy an achievement, while 22 percent will not. The continuation of terrorism is an issue seriously troubling the public. A large majority, some 70 percent, said that if terror continues, they will view it as a failure of the government policy. The public will also regard it a failure if the PLO fails to impose order in the Gaza Strip and terror from there continue. Some 52 percent of those polled stated they will regard this a failure.
