The last point to be discussed by the military council was the fishing industry. The last point of the 30 February visit was the People's Fish Breeding Center in Sibanicu municipality, reflecting the importance with which the country's leadership regards this sector, which is decisive in increasing the food levels of the population. (Enrique Ortosqui), vice minister of the fishing industry, presented the current situation and goals in the development of artificial breeding of fish on the island. In the same manner, Division General Carlos Fernandez Gondin, first vice minister of the interior, presented a detailed analysis, which is being made throughout the country against criminal activities and social indiscipline. He pointed out advances made, as well as difficulties, and expressed his conviction that with the participation of the masses, the perfection of the Unified Vigilance and Protection System, and the required action of the judiciary power within the framework of existing laws or those that need to be established, this struggle will be won by the Revolution. In his tour of the Oriente Rebelde community in Sibanicu, Raul visited the Salvador Cisneros Betancourt elementary school, which was completed in just 45 days by FAR combatants and by instruction from the second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC]. At the facility, which has capacity for more than 200 children, Raul received detailed information on the characteristics of the center. At the nearby plaza, the children presented an art show, which reflected the different stages of our history, including the uprising of Ignacio Agramonte in November 1868 at the Oriente sugar Mill, very close to the place where the community is established today. Emilia Betancourt, president of the people's council and deputy to the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], explained to the visitors aspects of this cattle-raising zone in self-sufficiency, services, the defense tasks, and among other things, the fight against crime. A plaque at the school reads: With great satisfaction I have come to learn the experience of Oriente Rebelde. Everything I have seen has been very interesting, including conversations with the workers and cadres. We have analyzed agriculture in general, enterprises, farms, Basic Cooperative Production Units, self-sufficiency, subsidies that must be eliminated, [words indistinct] seek efficiency and productivity, and work hard to increase the food levels in the fields [words indistinct]. Signed: Fidel Castro. At the historical sugarmill, which is destined to become a museum of the sugar industry, Raul conversed on the characteristics of the installation, the largest in the province in the second half of the last century. He expressed his admiration for Ignacio Agramonte, one of our most important historical figures, and the fact that in the war of 1895, in their advance towards the West, Maximo Gomez camped there also. Fish Breeding is one of the main objectives for Sibanicu. In 1993, the municipality caught more than 300 [words indistinct] and this year they hope to exceed that figure. [words indistinct] in half hectare each they can produce [words indistinct] and at the same time, the cattle can take advantage of the water in these small dams. After listening to the exposition of Omar del Risco, first secretary of the PCC in Sibanicu, Raul congratulated him for the exemplary work of this municipality in the development of the fishing industry, which is currently the cheapest and fastest means of production of animal protein, and states that it would be very useful if representatives from other provinces could come here to gain experience in this important task. In his tour of Sibanicu, Raul was accompanied by the first secretaries of the six provinces that are part of the Eastern Army, Ramon Espinosa Martin, head of the Eastern Army; and Vilma Espin, president of the Federation of Cuban Women.
