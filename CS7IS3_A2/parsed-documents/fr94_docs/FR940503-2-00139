SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of the alteration is to bring the existing Privacy Act notice into compliance with the requirements of the Privacy Act, as amended. The alteration increases the number of locations at which records of the public transportation incentive program are kept, identifies the system manager responsible for the records of the Office of Inspector General, and discloses the address for notification and access to the records. The Office of Inspector General will be maintaining records pertaining to its employees who have applied for, and those who have been accepted as participants in, the Public Transportation Incentive Program (PTI Program). The records ensure that only one fare incentive per month is available to eligible employees. The records are also used to generate reports on changes in the participants' commuting methods.
