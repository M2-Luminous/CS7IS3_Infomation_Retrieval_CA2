In the presence of Nationalrat President Heinz Fischer, the Austrian president and the Chinese parliamentary president held a talk, lasting about one hour, discussing the developments in the Asian area and on the territory of the former Soviet Union as well as bilateral relations. The president also expressed Western concerns in connection with the human rights situation in China and with the situation in Tibet. In his answer, President Qiao Shi expressed the conviction that the different assessments of the human rights issues can be explained primarily by the differences between the history and traditions in Europe and those of the Chinese people. Tibet has always been part of the Chinese territory, but the government in Beijing is willing to "negotiate about all issues" with the Dalai Lama -- "with the exception of Tibet's independence." The Dalai Lama, with whom there have been indirect contacts, is, however, not willing to do so. The Austrian president and his guest extensively discussed the instability in the successor states of the Soviet Union, which, in the Chinese view, has developed mainly because political and economic reforms "are not synchronous" and that additional hotbeds of danger have arisen from the great number of ethnic conflicts. The president of the Chinese parliamen, who also was asked by the Austrian president about the topical discussion about North Korea's nuclear potential, expressed satisfaction about the initiation of talks between the North Korean Government and the United States -- obviously, progress has been made there. China's central position is the desire for stability in Southeast Asia. Thus, the process of reunification between the two parts of Korea and between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan must be achieved in peace and not by war or tensions. Beijing is trying to make rapprochement easier through direct airline, post, and trade contacts with Taiwan. President Qiao Shi also reported on the state of affairs and the problems in the process of Hong Kong's reintegration in the PRC. It is Beijing's firm will to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of the current British crown colony along the principle of "one country, two systems." Both sides emphatically stressed the desire for even closer economic cooperation, which has been put on a new basis as a result of Chancellor Vranitzky's visit to China. According to the Chinese guest, Austria is "a country that we can take as a model." In this connection, the president of the parliament renewed the invitation to the Austrian president to visit the PRC and conveyed personal greetings from Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
