Full-scale extrication from the recession will be impossible without a countermeasure for this. Over a year has past since the new gang law came into effect. It is believed that the new law is steadily taking root in Japanese society, but it cannot be said that corporate society, which has been on the verge of crisis, has been resuscitated because of it. Just by reviewing newspaper reports for the past several months, one can see an incident where five masked gang members fired five shots into the home of a bank president in Nagoya in September, and the vice president of a bank in Wakayama Prefecture was shot with a gun and died in August. From February to May, a series of fire bombs were thrown at the homes of branch offices of life insurance, bank, and real estate heads affiliated with a former zaibatsu. My true feeling is that "the crisis of corporate society" is still not over. The current gang force is 90,600 people in 3,490 gangs. Among these are 56,600 full-fledged members, and the remaining 34,000 are quasi-members. The big three, the Yamaguchi-gumi, Inagawa-kai, and Sumiyoshi-kai respectively have 37,200 people (41.4 percent), 9,800 people (10.8 percent), and 11,400 people (12.6 percent), and the aggregate total of the three gangs accounts for about 65 percent. The National Police Agency [NPA] estimates the income for all these gangs at 1.3 trillion yen in 1989 figures. However, this is a very low estimate; it is probably several times that, certainly about 5 trillion yen, since it is a figure from before the bubble economy. Incidentally, the Mafia of the United States has a core of 5,000 people in 26 families, and their income is about 10 trillion yen. The Mafia of Italy is said to have an income between 2 trillion to 4 trillion yen. The breakdown of the income of Japanese gangs, also in NPA estimates, is 34.4 percent or 450 billion yen in income from stimulant drugs; about three tons a year are smuggled in. Since about 33 shots can be made with one gram, it is an amount that reaches 100 million shots. Gambling, bucket shop operations, bodyguard fees, violent intervention in civic affairs, and violence against corporations are also big income sources. In an investigation by the NPA, besides the aforementioned illegal income, 20 percent of the whole is considered to be income other than illegal such as corporate activities. However, this part of the income, which is not illegal, is much greater and has been estimated to be about equal to the illegal income. It is believed that the weight of this was especially high during the bubble period. Transformation of Gangs There have been four characteristic changes in gangs in recent years. The first is oligopolization. The number of big three gang members was 24.6 percent of the whole in 1983. Since it currently is 65 percent, it calculates to a share increase of about 40 percent in the 10-year period. What the gangsters call "the force of the substitute family crest" and what the police call "the force of organization intimidation" is the motive force for oligopolization. The Mafia in the United States and Italy have "an invisible existence." However, Japanese gangs, far from being invisible, are "visible gangs," and threaten by showing themselves openly. In order to threaten by showing themselves, it is more convenient to have great organizational backing. Profits are quite different when one can present a business card to show great organizational backing. Therefore, weak gangs all get under the umbrella of big gangs. A brake finally has begun to be put to that trend recently, but that is because the substitute family crest charge, or in other words, the payment to those in charge has become high and payment has become difficult. The second change is infiltration into civic life and economic activities for fund resource activities. Before the new gang law was put into force in March 1992, there was "the principle of nonintervention in civic affairs" among the police and, speaking in extremes, gangs intervening in civic affairs were left alone in a situation close to noninterference. In the meantime, violent intervention in civic matters ballooned into a large income source for gangs. Furthermore, there is violence targeted at corporations. Not only have gangs that have become political associations, including sokaiya [gangsters who promise not to disrupt shareholders' general meetings in return for payoffs or who work for companies in shouting down dissenting shareholders at such meetings], rapidly increased, but gangs of racketeers specializing in banks called "bank racketeers" have also appeared. Banks are overly concerned about appearances and easily become targets. Furthermore, they have become active in dummy corporations. There are companies that supply oshibori [steamed towels to freshen hands] to bars and clubs, or lease paintings. Many have also advanced into civil engineering and construction or the financial business. A gang source calls these "legitimate businesses," but they are backed by the force of organization intimidation and the police do not view them as legitimate businesses so long as the groups are not disbanded. The third change is armament. For about the past 10 years except for 1990, over 1,000 guns a year have been confiscated. Last year, it numbered 1,450, the highest in history. It is said that one gun has already been distributed to each gang member. The fourth change is the advance of Japanese gangs overseas and the advance of foreign gangs into Japan, that is, the problem of the internationalization of gangs. The United States has two concerns about this. One is that it will be disastrous if those with good brains such as the Japanese come and form violent organizations. The Mafia in the United States originally was created by local people who were apt to be viewed lowly in American society, but in reality that group has seized the neck of the United States. Who is to say what would happen if Japanese who are said to have good brains came in. The other is rooted in the so-called "Japanese uniqueness theory" advocated by revisionists. In other words, the viewpoint is rapidly spreading that Japan is a unique country that cannot get along without the association of gangsters. In any case, their flashy actions overseas have been conspicuous such as purchasing golf courses in order to launder money earned during the bubble era. Contacts seeking a smuggling route for drugs are also becoming active and caution is necessary. On the other hand, inroads into Japan by foreign gang organizations have become active along with the rapid increase in foreign workers. There are also activities organized by illegal residents and persons smuggled into the country. Organized crime groups from Taiwan and Hong Kong have already landed and situations where they are conspiring with Japanese or feuding with each other have become a reality. Infiltration Into Corporate Society With the bubble economy sandwiched in between, the infiltration of gangs into corporations has become serious. The first crisis when Japanese corporate society was infiltrated by gangs was about the time of revision of the Commercial Code in 1982. It is common knowledge that the sokaiya of the ruling party had the role of suppressing the sokaiya of the opposition parties in addition to being thoroughly familiar with the intimate details of corporations. The employment of gangs by those sokaiya to demonstrate power at general stockholder meetings was an opportunity for sokaiya inroads by gangs. At first, gangs came in cautiously, but they found that there was no other such profitable business. While in gangs, they had been treated as if they had no human rights by detectives of the Metropolitan Police Department, for instance, but as soon as they became sokaiya, they came to be called "sensei" [title of respect for teachers, doctors, etc.]. Prior to the 1982 revision of the Commercial Code, it is estimated that from 100 billion yen to 200 billion yen flowed to sokaiya. By gangs taking the place of sokaiya, the intimate details of corporations were grasped by the gangs. Therefore, the Commercial Code was hastily revised. It prohibited provision of profits to sokaiya. In addition, the authority of the chairman at general stockholder meetings was strengthened, and the unit stock system was also introduced. By this, laws were prepared to eliminate sokaiya, and the existence of sokaiya was no longer necessary if there were resolute managers. Problems no longer occurred so long as they kept an attentive eye on management. Nevertheless, they were not able to eliminate sokaiya entirely. When general meetings of the stockholders neared, some managers even become cross with the general affairs staff, demanding to know why they had to study such a thing, and sokaiya came to shake up such companies. Such a thing was solely a problem of manager attitude. Although there was some decrease in sokaiya, they did not disappear completely because there were some companies giving profits to sokaiya. Then, the bubble economy occurred and the situation completely changed. Greatest Shackle to Economic Recovery I say that the current Heisei recession is "a gangster recession," and many managers would agree and say, "That is right." The economists, however, do not seem to see the connection between gangs and the current recession. I believe that extrication from the recession will be impossible without this viewpoint. There are three reasons for that. First, some corporations transferred the excess money in the bubble era to stock, and moreover, some corporations rode the wave of urban redevelopment and invested in office buildings and planned for the construction of golf courses and leisure facilities. Land speculators were necessary for that, and many gangs were involved with land speculators. Initially, there was a middleman, but it soon became troublesome. Moreover, gangs always sought acquaintance with corporate officers. Cases of gang members and corporate employees drinking with each other increased, and the things they said, snide remarks about superiors, and other corporate gossip that was unintentionally revealed, looking at it now, are all becoming the material for their threats. Moreover, although they depended on land speculators, there were many projects that collapsed midway. If that happened, the gangs learned how much loss was incurred by whose responsibility within the corporation. They also knew how much embellishment was made in the March 1992 settlement of accounts when the bubble burst, and how much coverup was made in the stockholders general meeting. Even worse, gossip about the plans of corporation heads, starting with the creation of condos for when they retire and shifting company money to compensate for those losses, was also snared in the net of considerable information of the gangs. The gangs believe that it will be to their advantage not to make threats immediately, but to intimidate them after corporate performance improves a little more. When the economy has begun to recover, there will be an increase in the corporations that cannot refuse if they propose to do new work jointly. By this, even if there is somewhat of an upturn in the economy, there will be no frame of mind for facilities investment. Second, there is the problem of bad debts. As economists have also pointed out, a considerable portion of the bad debts, which some say amount to 40 trillion yen in financial institutions alone, are said to be related to gangs. There are some managers who seek help from gangs in disposing of bad debts, although they are not related to gangs. The relationship between bad debts and gangs is proceeding in a rather bad direction and there will be no resolution of the bad debt problem by ignoring gang countermeasures. Third, the amassing of public works projects is being conducted as a recession countermeasure. However, from 1 percent to 3 percent of the public works expenditures have flowed to gangs under the pretext of periphery countermeasure expenses or cooperation money. Some say that if they don't pay money to gangs, they will not be allowed to go through the streets. That is because some gangs are involved in ready mixed concrete, gravel, and waste disposal businesses. In some areas gangs control dump trucks and the structure is such that projects are impossible without paying cooperation money. Thus, gangs are incorporated into the basic structure of the Japanese economy. Even if the official rate is lowered, and even if public works projects are amassed, there is one more big factor why a clear response does not appear, and that is because we close our eyes to gangs. The media also has a serious responsibility for the gang problem. Even if illegal activities of bank branch managers occur, gang involvement is not reported until an announcement by the police. Before that, hardly anything is written about the bad parts of corporations, perhaps the result of corporate public relations countermeasures. It is said that "beat reporters" have made politics worse, but what about economic journalists? I believe that grave reflection is called for on the way journalists report about coporations. Of course, it goes without saying that a strengthening of controls on underground money with the systematic cooperation of the police, National Tax Administration, and public prosecutors offices is necessary for extrication from the recession, but more than anything, self-awareness by managers is most important. They must have self-awareness that having relationships with gangs as a corporation and as an individual is itself a crime and keep in mind that gangs are organized criminal groups that will do anything for money. Extrication from the "gangster recession" will be impossible without a resolute attitude.
