Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said "constructive" talks with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on the sidelines of the all-party Geneva conference had focused on "a model of organisation of Bosnia-Herzegovina after a general normalisation" of relations between the two sides. In a joint statement both men said separate letters would be sent to the UN Security Council calling for border surveillance. Zagreb has denied repeated accusations that regular Croatian troops are fighting in central Bosnia, where Bosnian Croat and mainly-Moslem Bosnian Government forces are engaged in a bitter territorial conflict. Granic said military chiefs from the two warring parties were scheduled to meet next week in Sarajevo. He added that he and Silajdzic would step up efforts to ensure the unconditional exchange of prisoners of war and the repatriation of refugees. Bosnia's ambassador to Bern, Muhamad Filipovic, told AFP that the bilateral talks offered "a very good chance to improve relations and stop the fighting in central Bosnia." UN-led controls on Bosnia's borders were desirable to prevent Belgrade from equipping Bosnian Serb forces with extra men and weapons, he added. Zagreb's ambassador to the United Nations, Mario Nobilo, said border controls would staunch the flow of arms from Serb-held areas of Bosnia to Krajina, the self-declared Serbian republic inside Croatia. Nobilo also stressed the need to avoid "further misunderstandings" over the nature of ZAgreb's support for the Bosnian Croats. He added that Bosnian Government and Croatian officials were also discussing the make-up of the future Bosnia-Herzegovina. "The Moslems would like to see a more centralised form of government, with cantons," he said, while the Croatian side favoured a three-way union also incorportating a Serb mini-state. Earlier Thursday Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said the all-party Geneva talks aimed at securing a negotiated settlement to the Bosnian war had stalled because the Moslems were refusing to investigate Saturday's bloody mortar attack in Sarajevo which has been widely blamed on his forces. "We could not go further until we resolve this," Karadzic told reporters, referring to establishing responsibility for the mortar attack that killed 68 and sparked a NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to remove their heavy weapons from Sarajevo by February 21 or face air strikes.
