FR940606-1-00053 FR940606-1-00008 As long as this equipment is installed, operated, and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications, it should perform with high transfer efficiency. Therefore, the EPA is not proposing any test methods or procedures for this part of the primer and topcoat standards. Owners or operators who want to use application equipment other than that specified in the proposed rule must demonstrate that it is equivalent in reducing organic HAP and VOC emissions. To make an equivalency determination, the owner or operator must demonstrate that the organic HAP and VOC emissions generated by the alternative method are equal to or less than the emissions generated by HVLP or electrostatic spray guns under the actual production conditions in which the alternative method is intended to be used. This level of emissions is equivalent to the emissions demonstrated by California facilities that are subject to similar rules. Before implementing the alternative application method, the facility must determine the organic HAP and VOC emissions that were generated by the process over the 90-day period immediately preceding the implementation of the alternative application method. During this initial 90-day period, only HVLP or electrostatic spray guns could be used. These emissions would be compared to the organic HAP and VOC emissions generated by the same process using the alternative application method to coat an equivalent amount of parts and assemblies as coated during the initial 90-day period using identical coatings. The organic HAP and VOC emissions generated during the use of the alternative application method must be equal to or less than the emissions generated during the initial 90-day period. In determining compliance with the organic HAP and VOC content levels, an owner or operator would have the flexibility to use compliant coatings or to average uncontrolled compliant and non-compliant coatings. (Averaging between primers and topcoats would not be allowed, nor would averaging between controlled and uncontrolled coatings.) Test methods and procedures are, therefore, necessary to determine the organic HAP and VOC content of each primer and topcoat as applied. The EPA is proposing that Method 24 be used for determining the VOC content. This is a long-standing method for such determinations. Sources may, at their discretion, use manufacturer's data for determining the VOC content rather than Method 24. However, if there is found to be a difference in the VOC content as determined from the manufacturer's data and that determined using Method 24, then the value obtained using Method 24 will always take precedence in compliance determinations. Since there are no generally available methods for testing organic HAP content, the EPA is proposing that the organic HAP content level be determined by each facility based on the formulation of each coating. The formulation data would be supplied to the facility by the coating manufacturer. This would reduce the burden to the industry and promote consistent identification of the total organic HAP content among all users. Several coating manufacturers have indicated to the EPA that they are willing to supply such information. As noted above, the proposed standards would require the organic HAP contents to be determined on a ``less water as applied'' basis and VOC contents on a ``less water and exempt solvents as applied'' basis. Thus, unless the coating is applied as received, procedures must be adopted to change ``as received'' organic HAP and VOC content levels to ``as applied'' levels. This could be accomplished by analyzing a sample of the coating as applied using Method 24 or through a calculation. The calculations to do this are well known and established (see A Guideline for Surface Coating Calculations, EPA&hyph;340/1&hyph;86&hyph;016, July 1986) and, thus, the EPA did not consider it necessary to include the basic calculation formulas in the proposed rule. A determination of what is added to the coating before it is applied must be made so that the ``as applied'' levels can be calculated. The EPA is proposing that each owner or operator make such determinations on the basis of records kept at the facility. These are records that will be required by the proposed rule and will be readily available to the owner or operator for making the necessary calculations. The pertinent information (i.e., density, organic HAP content, and VOC content) of the additives would be based on manufacturer supplied information. If that information is not available, then the owner or operator would be required to develop a procedure for determining the missing information for approval by the Administrator.
