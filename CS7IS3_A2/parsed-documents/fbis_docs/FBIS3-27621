Thus we should make every possible endeavor to force price hikes to stay at an appropriate level. To this end, governments at all levels across the province should intensify macroeconomic regulation, control, and management of commodity prices; persist in and perfect the existing price control responsibility system; strengthen market price supervision and examination; further both distribution and wage system reform among enterprises, administrative organs, and undertakings; and enable people to earn more on the basis of expanded production.
