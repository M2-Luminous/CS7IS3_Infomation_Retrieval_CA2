FR940630-2-00054 FR940630-2-00040 Filing Procedures for Earth Stations Who Must Pay VSAT and Equivalent C-Band Antennas: Earth station systems comprising very small aperture terminals make up authorized networks operating in the 12 and 14 GHz bands that provide a variety of communications services to other stations in the network. Each system, authorized pursuant to blanket licensing procedures in part 25 of the Rules, consists of a network of technically-identical small fixed-satellite earth stations which often includes a larger hub station. This category also includes earth stations operating 4/6 GHz frequency bands using networks of technically identical antennas that are 2 meters or less in diameter. For FY 1994, entities holding these types of authorizations as of October 1, 1993, will be assessed a regulatory fee of $0.06 per antenna per call sign. Licensees with less than 100 antennas per call sign will be subject to a minimum $6.00 fee per call sign. Mobile Satellite Earth Stations: Under part 25 of the Rules, mobile satellite service providers operate under blanket licenses for mobile antennas (transceivers), which are small than one meter and provide voice or data communications, including position location information, for mobile platforms such as cars, buses or trucks. For FY 1994, entities holding these types of authorizations as of October 1, 1993, will be assessed a fee of $0.06 per antenna per call sign. Entities with less than 100 antennas per call sign will be subject to a minimum $6.00 fee per call sign. Each Station Antennas Less Than 9 Meters: Persons authorized or registered under part 25 to operate fixed-satellite earth station antennas that are less than 9 meters in diameter providing telephone, television, data and other forms of communications. This category includes antennas used to transmit and receive, transmit only or receive only. Also included in this category are telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C) earth stations. For FY 1994, holders of these types of authorizations as of October 1, 1993, will be assessed a fee of $0.06 per antenna per call sign. Licensees with less than 100 antennas per call sign will be subject to a minimum $6.00 per call sign. Earth Station Antennas 9 Meters or Greater: This category covers fixed-satellite earth station antennas authorized under part 25 that are equal to or greater than 9 meters in diameter. These earth stations are operated by private carriers and common carriers to provide telephone, television, data, and other forms of communication. Included in this category are telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C) earth stations equal to or greater than 9 meters in diameter. For FY 1994, persons or entities authorized to operate transmit/receive or transmit-only antennas as of October 1, 1993, will be assessed a regulatory fee of $85.00 per meter. Persons or entities authorized to operate receive-only antennas as of October 1, 1993, will be assessed a regulatory fee of $55.00 per meter. All measurements will be to the tenth of a meter. Governments and nonprofit (exempt under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code) carriers and licensees are exempt from paying regulatory fees and should not submit payment, but may be asked to submit a current IRS Determination Letter documenting its nonprofit status, or a certification of government authority. Note: When an earth station's license limits its operational authority to a particular satellite system which is not yet operational, the regulatory fee payment for the earth station will not be used until the first satellite of the related system becomes operational pursuant to 25.120(d) of our rules.
