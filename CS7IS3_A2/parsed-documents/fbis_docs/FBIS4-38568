The international experts did not commit themselves to a specific amount of assistance to Ukraine to build new nuclear power stations in place of Chernobyl, Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov told ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview today. "Billions of dollars are needed to carry out the whole package of projects. At least four billion is needed to close down Chernobyl nuclear power station alone." Valeriy Shmarov said the talks will be continued. He described Ukraine's position as follows: "If you want to avert danger, help us."
