On 20 November 1958, the USSR Council of Ministers, "with the aim of eliminating excesses in the material support provided Soviet citizens working in the apparatuses of international organizations," began collecting from them two-thirds of their currency wages and all of their pension accruals on a compulsory basis. Instead of dollars, our fellow countrymen began receiving Soviet rubles. It is quite curious that pensioners could officially choose between receiving the allowance from the United Nations Pension Fund in currency or transferring their accumulated savings to the USSR Social Security Fund and receiving rubles. But in fact, as the victims themselves assert, they did not have any choice whatsoever and had to subordinate themselves to the dictate of the government under threat of sanctions. It should also be taken into account that whereas prior to the end of the 1980's, "international" pensioners were entirely able to exist on a 160-ruble individual pension of USSR value, and possibly did not grumble too much for that reason, today most of them receive not 100, 200, or even more dollars, but no more than 80,000 rubles. Their situation is truly problematic. Thus, we have to say that for 30 and some odd years, our own state scraped together a decent amount of capital on hundreds, if not thousands, of "hard-currency" pensioners. According to the Russian Pension Fund, these funds did not go to the budget account of USSR State Social Insurance, allocated for pension security. For want of a currency account there, the funds simply went to the state budget. The discriminatory decree remained in force until 1 January 1991, when the USSR Council of Ministers decided to repeal it. Serving as the impetus for this, apparently, was a letter of Perez de Cuellar, Secretary General of the United Nations, addressed to countries that have confiscated funds from their citizens working within the United Nations system. The message emphasized that "this practice does not conform to the United Nations Charter, contradicts personnel regulations, and is damaging to basic principles of international civil service." Since January 1991, not one former Soviet--or today Russian--international civil servant retiring on pension has chosen a ruble pension over a hard-currency one. However, extending at last to Russian employees of international organizations the opportunity to themselves dispose of their earned hard currency, the state "forgot" to restore the rights of those who "voluntarily" exchanged their currency pension for a ruble one over the course of the past 30 years. To the numerous applications by members of the Association to Russian and international authorities requesting reinstatement in the United Nations Pension Fund and the return of unlawfully confiscated money, the majority of such organizations responded with silence. The scandalous story continued following the appeal of Vladislav Tikhomirov, former United Nations employee, to the Constitutional Court. On 1 July 1993, examining the case of Mr. Tikhomirov, the court also acknowledged the right of the Association of Former International Employees to stand up for the interests of their members. The court established that the 1 December 1958 decree violated the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the Convention on UN Privileges and Immunities, and so on. Indeed, it was recommended that the government reinstate the plaintiffs in the UN Pension Fund. Following this, upon request of the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the process was postponed two months. A representative of the ministry promised to resolve the problem on the governmental level over this time frame. However, the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Social Security took up a rigid stance--there was no money. In the meantime, the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs admitted that pensions were confiscated from former Soviet employees of the UN in violation of the Charter of this worldwide organization and other international agreements concluded under its aegis. As a result, a double standard was put into effect: 158 former employees receive pensions from the UN Pension Fund, and 87 individuals are denied this right. Not too long ago, the Constitutional Court received a response from Mr. Chernomyrdin, prime minister of the Russian Federation Government, stating that the government intends to examine this issue. In the meantime, the UN Pension Fund is attempting somehow to resolve this problem as it conducts negotiations with the Russian representation of the United Nations in New York. Without instructions from Moscow, however, the latter is not competent to decide this question, and the matter will most likely again come to a standstill. It should also be noted that the search for palliative measures on the national level will not resolve this problem and will not halt the stream of complaints to the United Nations and the courts. UN provisions with respect to securing pensions for its employees have been ratified by the General Assembly of this organization. These provisions are unique. They do not coincide, and indeed cannot coincide, with the national pension plans formulated in isolation and effective in 160 member states of the United Nations.
