Viktor Viktorovich, PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat has just ended a visit to Russia. Yitzhaq Rabin began a visit today. It is thought that attempts are being made to draw Moscow more actively into Middle Eastern affairs. However, some say that after our diplomacy's major fiasco in Bosnia, this is the last straw. What do you think? [Posuvalyuk] Vitaliy, despite the shortage of time and the fact that this is not my area of competence, not my territory, I would like very briefly to oppose the view of those who talk about the fiasco of Russian diplomacy in Yugoslav affairs. First, this problem is insoluble without Russia. Second, events have revealed the nonuniformity, the political diversity of the Bosnian Serbs. Third, I am convinced that had it not been for the minister's visit--had it not been for Vitaliy Churkin's mission--events would immediately have acquired an even more ominous nature. Fourth, and maybe most importantly, strong-arm methods are not in themselves effective. As someone who sat through the bombing in Baghdad during the Gulf War, I can very definitely testify to that. Now with regard to the visits, Russia, as a great power, has two key roles with relation to the Middle East. First, it is a close neighbor, a major power with very broad interests--economic, political, spiritual, religious, and, of course, military. Its second role is as a permanent member of the Security Council and a cosponsor alongside the United States in the Middle East peace process. These visits and talks--'Arafat's visit that has already taken place and Rabin's visit that has begun--will be guided by these two functions, Russia's political functions in the Middle East. There have already been and there will be specific conversations on bilateral relations. At the same time, the president and the minister have already heard 'Arafat's view, and now they will have conversations with Rabin on the state of the Middle East peace process. Here there are mutual claims and reproaches from both sides. I think that Russia has an opportunity as cosponsor to smooth out some points and move matters forward. God willing, an agreement on Gaza and Jericho will be signed at the beginning of May. [Gan] It is said that 'Arafat's authority and influence in the Arab world has been on the decline since he signed the agreement with Israel. Is that correct? [Posuvalyuk] I think it would be more correct not to talk about how far 'Arafat's popularity rating has risen or fallen. I think the point is that 'Arafat has risked his political career, his political future. Here one must talk not just about 'Arafat but about Prime Minister Rabin as well. In our view, these are courageous political leaders; they are undoubtedly courageous. Take 'Arafat, for example. People are burning photographs of him, burning effigies. Incidentally, it is not only the loudmouths and extremists who are talking about this, but also sometimes, unfortunately, some of our correspondents who are there. Take [RTV correspondent] Vladislav Flyarkovskiy in Tel Aviv, who relishes this subject and has reported on it several times already. Although, incidentally, Israeli television avoids reports of that kind because they understand that the matter concerns a political partner. They are effectively in the same boat. Their future depends on the outcome of the peace process. As for Rabin, I was in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv recently, and I saw how the radical left-wing [as heard], the extremist wing of Israel's political structure, is trying to whip up hysteria against the government. For Rabin, it is an enormous psychological strain to drive around the city and see everywhere: "Rabin, Rabin the Traitor". I am convinced, however, that the majority of both Palestinians and Israelis are in favor of the peace process and the continuation of talks. [Gan] Viktor Viktorovich, what do you think are the prospects for a peaceful settlement? [Posuvalyuk] Well, we have the image--perhaps it is hackneyed-- of light at the end of the tunnel. Using the same image, I will say that for many decades--the conflict has been going on practically since the beginning of the century--for many decades, at the end of the tunnel there was either gloom and darkness or the fire of six wars and innumerable senseless conflicts. Now a distant light has appeared. I would not like to fall into euphoria; a distant light has appeared. We all fell into euphoria, incidentally, after 13 September, when the Declaration of Principles was signed in Washington. Maybe we even underestimated the strength of opposition to the peace process. So a distant light has appeared. In the Palestinian talks, in particular, things are moving forward. I say let us hope that an agreement will be signed at the beginning of May.
