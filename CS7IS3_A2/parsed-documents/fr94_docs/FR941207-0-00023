The processor shall pay directly to the eligible recipient agency within 30 days of receipt of the refund application from the recipient agency, an amount equal to the established agreement value of donated food per case of end product multiplied by the number of cases delivered to and accepted by the recipient agency, except that processors may group together refund applications for a single recipient agency on a Federal fiscal quarterly basis if the total anticipated refund due that recipient agency during the quarter is 25 dollars or less. In no event shall refund applications for purchases during the period of agreement be accepted by the processor later than 60 days after the close of the agreement period. * * * * * (iii) *␣*␣* FCS may consider the paperwork and resource burden associated with alternative value pass-through systems when considering approval and reserves the right to deny approval of systems which are labor-intensive and provide no greater accountability than those systems permitted under paragraph (c)(4) of this section. * * * * * (7)(i) Only butter, cheese, corn grits, cornmeal, flour, macaroni, nonfat dry milk, peanut butter, peanut granules, roasted peanuts, rice, rolled oats, rolled wheat, shortening, vegetable oil, and spaghetti may be substituted as defined in §252.2 and such other food as FCS specifically approves as substitutable under paragraph (c)(7)(i)(A) of this section (substitution of meat and poultry items shall not be permitted). (A) Processors may request approval to substitute commercial foods for donated foods not listed in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section by submitting such request to FCS in writing and satisfying the requirements of paragraph (c)(7) of this section.

(B) The processor shall maintain records to substantiate that it continues to acquire on the commercial market amounts of substitutable food consistent with their levels of non-NCP Program production and to document the receipt and disposition of the donated food.
