He has suffered two coups and has bounced back. The military has intervened twice to oust Demirel from office, once in 1971 and the second time in 1980. Those of us who still want to be kind to him call the coups "mishaps," while his critics, who are now growing in number, say in both cases Demirel failed to run the country properly and it was his incompetence that led to the military takeovers. After the 1980 coup, Demirel became a banned leader. The press, with the exception of the TURKISH DAILY NEWS, which defied all anti-democratic measures, could not mention his name, and many writers started calling him "bir bilen," which means "the one who knows." Demirel was under house arrest for a short period and his movements were restricted by the military. The years went by and true democrats, including some in the TURKISH DAILY NEWS, rallied behind him as he launched his successful campaign to get the bans lifted. The bans were eventually lifted in a referendum, and Demirel started climbing the ladder back to power. In 1991 he became prime minister, and then in 1993 he was elected president by the Parliament after the sad demise of Turgut Ozal. Demirel is a politician of vast experience. But, despite all his qualities, either he could not see the 1971 and 1980 coups coming or he could not do anything to avoid them. Now he has started to speak of his "deep concerns" about the current state of affairs. He has recently said he is concerned with the spate of terrorist bomb attacks in major cities. On Monday he told a meeting of geology experts: "If the country loses its democratic calm, the people will seek calm through the fist." Which means if you cannot secure calm and tranquility in the country through a democratic environment, then the only way will be for the military to do it with an iron fist after a coup. We have given several warnings in the past few years that we could end up in the current situation. It is sad that people in responsible positions just turned a deaf ear to our warnings and are now paying the price. It is also sad that once again people have started pronouncing the words "military takeover." It is especially sad that such talk has been resurrected when Demirel is the head of state and is once again in a responsible position in Turkey. Let us hope Demirel does not go into history books not only as the "one who knows," but also as "the one who suffered three mishaps." Let us also hope no one turns round and says: "If some one suffers so many mishaps then there must be something wrong with him."
