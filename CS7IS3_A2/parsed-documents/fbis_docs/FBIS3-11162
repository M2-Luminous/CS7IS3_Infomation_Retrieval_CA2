The OAS-sponsored meeting opened in Buenos Aires yesterday, Chatting informally, the participants were more emphatic than Di Tella. They stated that "every time the OAS discusses the security issue, the Armed Forces of member countries have been systematically excluded. It is time the military component of the policies of member countries was considered as a factor in the OAS assessments." Di Tella addressed an auditorium in which uniformed members of the Armed Forces of the OAS member countries mingled with suited diplomats. He stated: "Until we can impose a new pace in the military field, the integration process lacks an indispensable component for its consolidation." The Argentine foreign minister said: "It is time to combine our political, economic, and social progress with the military aspect." He said this should be based on the following essential premises: Defining military doctrines based on legitimate defense needs; and "clarity" through communication, information, observation, verification, and the maintenance of a subregional military balance that will finally lead to a "functional integration." This change of attitude by OAS member countries comes just as the United States is exerting pressure on the Latin American military to engage directly in the struggle against trafficking. This contradicts an ancient and deep-rooted lack of confidence within OAS member countries: The Armed Forces are considered latent coupist elements -- following the experience of decades -- against democratic governments. As for the possible objectives of the meeting, Di Tella said that the OAS can become "a natural forum for discussion, agreement, and implementation of hemispheric decisions on security issues." There is also "the possibility of establishing a regional center to prevent and handle conflicts and controversies." Hernan Patino Mayer -- the Argentine ambassador to the OAS, who is one of the main promoters of the meeting -- asserted that the Armed Forces of the region "have a special role to play in this continental integration process."
