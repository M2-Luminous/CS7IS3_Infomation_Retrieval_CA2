Gulan: "Sell Your Land To Pay the Taxes"] [Excerpts] By the Serbian Government's Decree on Taxation of Property, Agriculture, Forestry, and Independent Businesses, the farmers across the entire country, and there are more than 2 million of them, who are the only ones to produce anything in these times, have again been brought to a hopeless situation. Taxes have been levied on them that they cannot pay. Not to mention how they are going to carry out the spring sowing of about 2.5 million hectares when the state has not ensured a single liter of oil. At these times, the most difficult situation is with households consisting of old people who possess land, but earn no income from it. The following example shows best what troubles farmers are experiencing when, instead on investing money into sowing and new production, they have to fill the state coffers. Last year, a farmer with about eight acres (five hectares) of land got three tons of wheat or two tons of sunflower seed per acre, which is considered to be good for a dry year. Income from four acres of wheat, when one deducts the costs of seed and harvesting, totalled 500 German marks [DM]. The income earned from sunflowers, when the costs of seed and harvesting are deducted, was charged in kind, more than 600 liters of edible oil. Some of that edible oil was immediately exchanged for oil, and DM200 were immediately given for wheat seed. Added to this are the cost of wheat harvest (DM80 to DM100 per acre), plowing DM100, cultivation DM10 to DM15 per acre.... Along with all this, the household must pay the utilities charges, not to speak of what happens if a machine breaks down, or a pig-pen needs repair, Dragisa Maric, a farmer from Kac told BORBA. [passage omitted] About 2 billion new dinars are needed for spring sowing this year. For the first time in half a century, primary issue cannot be used, and banks say that they have no money for loans. Moreover, the state, which is asking farmers to give money, has not made it possible for them to buy diesel fuel (not a single liter has been allocated for agriculture for several months), and the question is whether artificial fertilizers are going to be ensured and how is it going to be done (750,000 tons are needed by the middle of the year). Therefore, the state is addressing farmers again and asking for money from them.
