FR940602-1-00095 FR940602-1-00014 The second proposed mechanism for enhancing public notice of the pre-application meeting is a requirement that the facility owner or operator post a sign on the facility property displaying information about the meeting. This requirement will give clear notice of the facility location, and activity the facility is, or will be, conducting. The posted sign must show the same information as the other notices, except for the requirement to include a facility map, which is unnecessary. The sign must be large enough so that the wording is readable from the facility boundary; it should be located where it will be visible to the public, including passers-by. The Agency encourages facilities to post similar signs within the local community, where appropriate, to encourage people to attend the pre-application meeting. In some cases, the option of posting additional signs around the community may be a cost-effective way for the facility to communicate with the public. The third requirement is that the facility owner or operator must provide a radio broadcast announcement of the pre-application meeting. This is a current mechanism for providing public notice in ยง124.10(c)(2)(ii). The Agency is including it within today's proposed requirements for the pre-application meeting in order to maintain consistency with existing public notice requirements under ยง124.10. Over the years, EPA has received many questions from authorized states and the public concerning radio announcements. Today's proposal requires a radio announcement to be broadcast from at least one local radio station serving the community, which is the same as the current part 124 regulations. As mentioned earlier in the Equitable Public Participation section, EPA considers the community to be all residents in the vicinity of the facility who might be most affected by the facility's operations. Facilities can, of course, go beyond the minimum requirement being proposed today. EPA provides the following suggestions as guidance for those facilities interested in going beyond the proposed minimum requirements. In some rural areas, community members may listen predominantly to one station; in this case, EPA recommends that the applicant use this station as the vehicle for the notice. Some areas are part of a radio market (i.e., as defined by services such as Arbitron's Radio Market Definitions) and have competing radio stations. Where there is more than one radio station, the facility owner or operator should carefully consider the likely listeners of the radio stations in order to ensure a substantial listener audience. For example, if the facility is located within a predominately Hispanic-American community, the applicant should use the local Spanish language station as the vehicle for the notice. Areas with many competing stations are more likely to have listener groups that may be delineated by, for instance, age, ethnicity, or income. In these situations, broadcasting the notice on several stations, or in more than one language, may be beneficial. In all cases, EPA suggests that the announcement occur at listening hours with a substantial audience, which will vary for each community as well as within listener groups. The facility may consult with radio stations and community members to determine the best times to broadcast the public notice. The notice of the pre-application meeting is perhaps the most important of the permit notices, since it is the first notice of the permitting process for new or existing facilities. The applicant should make an attempt to ensure that all interested citizens are aware of the pre-application meeting. The new requirements proposed today_display ads, notices published across jurisdictional boundaries, and posted signs at facilities_are more likely to reach a wider audience than a single notice in the legal section of the paper. In analyzing other approaches, such as applying the new pre-application notice requirements to all other RCRA public notices, EPA found that the requirements may become burdensome to regulatory agencies, who must publish a number of notices throughout the permitting process. (As proposed today, the facility bears the burden of the pre-application meeting requirements.) EPA's goal in proposing this approach is the efficient use of resources for effective public notice. EPA proposes a larger initial outreach effort to help establish a mailing list. By initiating a larger effort early in the process, people who desire to be put on the mailing list are included as early as possible in the permit process. The facility will conduct subsequent notices using the existing notice requirements, which have proven adequate when accompanied by a well-developed mailing list. The Agency requests comment on the proposed requirements for public notice of the pre-application meeting. For example, EPA would like comments regarding the practicality or usefulness of these requirements and their application within the permitting process. b.2. Conducting the pre-application meeting. Today's proposed rule requires the applicant to hold at least one informational meeting, open to all interested members of the public, before submitting a permit application. This meeting will provide earlier public involvement opportunities in the RCRA permitting process, and enable the applicant to explain facility plans and the scope of the project to the public. In addition, EPA intends this meeting to create a dialogue with the community, raise public awareness, determine public views and questions raised with respect to the facility, and provide the applicant with the opportunity to make changes to its application based on public comments. (The facility may choose to hold additional meetings to answer questions raised at the pre-application meeting.) It is appropriate for the facility to conduct the public meeting because the facility initiates the permit process and conducts business in the area. The permit applicant must give the public adequate notice, at least 30 days before the date, of the pre-application meeting. The Agency believes that the meeting should be informal and informational. This approach is consistent with the preamble discussion of public meeting requirements for Class 3 permit modification procedures (see 53 FR 37912, September 28, 1988). However, in contrast to the requirements for Class 3 modifications, today's rule would require the facility to submit a record of the pre-application meeting, a list of attendees and their addresses, and copies of any written comments or materials submitted at the meeting, to the Director. The facility must include this record as part of the permit application and, if required, the information repository. The record requirement will provide the public, especially people who are unable to attend the meeting, and the Agency with a summary of information and issues raised at the pre-application meeting. The proposed rule does not require the permitting authority to attend the meeting. The Agency believes that attendance by the permitting authority, in certain instances, may undercut one of the main purposes of the meeting, which is to open a dialogue between the facility and the community. In some cases, attendance by the permitting authority might be useful in gaining a better understanding of public perceptions and issues for a particular facility. However, it should always remain clear that it is a facility-lead meeting. EPA believes it is important for the public to understand that it is the facility's responsibility both to initiate the permit process, by submitting an application to EPA, and to inform the public of its intentions. EPA would like to solicit comments on whether the permitting agency should attend the pre-application meetings.
