As has been known, U.S. President Clinton on 22 March ordered Patriot missiles to be deployed to South Korea and, accordingly, some 40 missile launch vehicles and the Patriot missile battalion consisting of 800 troops began to move from Texas toward South Korea on the same day. On the same day, the U.S. Government reviewed instituting new military steps, such as dispatching additional U.S. troops to South Korea, forward deployment of an aircraft carrier on the sea off the Korean peninsula, and arming the U.S. forces in South Korea and the South Korean puppet army with new antichemical military equipment. Along with these steps by the Clinton administration, the hardline conservative forces in the U.S. Congress as well are making bellicose outbursts aimed at crushing us by force of arms. According to foreign press, Richard Gephardt, Democratic Party floor leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, urged the U.S. Government to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea, to resume the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise, and to dispatch additional U.S. troops to South Korea. In the meantime, Robert Dole, Republican minority leader of the U.S. Senate, also babbled about economic sanctions against us and said that the United States should urgently take the next stage steps, such as the resumption of the Team Spirit joint military exercise and additional dispatch of U.S. troops to South Korea in order to send necessary signals to North Korea. These bellicose remarks by the leaders of the two major U.S. parties of both houses of the U.S. Congress show that not only the U.S. Government authorities but also the U.S. congressmen are following a more reckless road. What is more important, the hardline conservative forces of the U.S. Congress raved about so-called necessary signals to our republic. These bellicose maneuvers of the U.S. Government authorities and other high-level political figures are leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to a situation where a war could break out at any time. As has been reported, the U.S. Navy fleet consisting of 30 ships is positioned on the sea from which it can reach the territory of our republic in no more than 24 hours. On 22 March, the Japan Self-Defense Forces openly conducted a field maneuver of Patriot missiles on the Shariki base in Aomori Prefecture, Japan. TOKYO SHIMBUN dated 23 March reported that the missiles in this base are aimed at our republic. Some time ago, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] of the seven-party ruling coalition, who is known to be a behind-the-scenes controller of Japan's Hosokawa government, said that Japan cannot sit still if a fire breaks out in a neighbor's house, asserting that Japan Self-Defense Forces can participate as UN Forces in case of emergency on the Korean peninsula. From this we can infer that the said field maneuver with Patriot missiles by the Japan Self-Defense Forces manifests the fact that Japan is accelerating full-fledged preparations to participate directly in the Korean war. This is a military move which we must regard as very serious. Meanwhile, in South Korea as well, traitor Kim Yong-sam held a meeting of chiefs of staff of the three services of the puppet armed forces on 22 March and ordered the entire puppet armed forces to enter an alert posture. In the wake of this order, frantic war exercises are continuing all over South Korea aimed at our Republic. The peace-loving people of the world are expressing deep concern over this tense situation created on the Korean peninsula and are urging the United States to give deep thought to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. However, the United States does not listen to this demand, but continues to follow the road of confrontation and war. However, no matter what political and diplomatic pressure and military threat and blackmail the United States may employ, they are unworkable to us. The more the United States puts pressure on us, the tougher our will to defend our sovereignty will be. This will of ours will turn out mightier than the U.S. nuclear weapon. As we have already made clear, we will regard any U.S. sanctions as a declaration of war against us, and will strongly deal with it [kue kangnyokhi taechohae nagalkosimnida]. We mean what we say [urinun kyolko pinmarul haji anssumnida]. The U.S. hardline conservative forces should see the trend of the situation squarely and act with discretion.
