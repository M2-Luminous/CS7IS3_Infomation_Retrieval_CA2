Caballero Vargas underlined: "There is no marked difference between the three (economic) projects that were publicly expounded during the campaign leading to the 9 May elections. There may be slight differences, mainly in the procedures involved in the privatization scheme, but the three all agree on the need to privatize government-owned enterprises." The meeting was held at the presidential residence at 0700 local time and lasted approximately two hours. It was convened by President Wasmosy. Milciades Rafael Casabianca, AEN bloc leader in the Senate, also attended this meeting. Commenting on the purpose of this meeting, Caballero Vargas noted that "there are obvious disagreements" between the executive branch and the Colorado Party about privatization. Asked if Wasmosy was trying to curry favor with the opposition as he lacks the support of the Colorado Party for his economic program, Caballero Vargas replied: "This is the impression we all have. If we have that impression, the president must certainly have it." He continued: "I think the opposition has a more coherent stance on this issue. The president believes he will find more support on the opposition benches than on the Colorado Party benches." Caballero Vargas added that differences will be reflected on very specific subjects, but "we must achieve consensus and compromise, especially regarding the preference the Constitution grants workers in privatizations." He stated that direct dialogue like the one proposed by Wasmosy is the best way to analyze subjects like this, "since it seeks to iron out difficulties and prevent misunderstandings." Wasmosy and Caballero Vargas also broached the subject of financing this year's harvest and the inflow of foreign exchange even though, according to the AEN leader, these were not the main points of their discussion. Wasmosy convened this meeting to sound out the opposition on the implementation of his privatizations program and to obtain its support in Congress. Caballero Vargas said the problem of how to finance farmers was mentioned "only in passing" during the meeting. He added that another subject raised was the noteworthy entry of foreign exchange. He said: "Those of us who believe we know something about our country's economy are dumbfounded by this phenomenon," adding: "Paraguay's economic variables are under control. Yet, as I told the president, the miracle does not lie in the stabilization of macroeconomic variables, inflation, exchange rates, etc. The miracle lies in controlling inflation with an exchange rate policy that enables the country to be competitive and, above all, with interest rates that help to achieve development." Caballero Vargas observed that there is economic stability in Paraguay, but "at this rate the whole productive apparatus will go bankrupt. Much has been done, but the test of these achievements is to be found in interest rates, which must be considerably reduced." Although it is not known if anything concrete resulted from this meeting, Wasmosy's objective in convening this meeting is to prop up his economic program with the help of the opposition since it lacks the support of the Colorado Party. This is evinced in remarks by Vice President Angel Roberto Seifart and Colorado Party President Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, who voiced their reluctance to undertake the massive privatization of government-owned enterprises. Opposition to the privatizations has a mainly political tone because the Colorado Party draws a considerable number of votes from government-owned enterprises.
