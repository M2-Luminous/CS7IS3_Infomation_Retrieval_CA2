Opening the golden jubilee session of the United Nation's Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific -- ESCAP -- in New Delhi today, he said the third world countries should resist any move to put extraneous concerns on the trade agenda after the conclusion of GATT treaty. He said the Western countries are trying to use social and environmental issues for nullifying the comparative advantage of the developing countries. Urging the rich countries to understand the aspirations of the Third World countries to catch up with the rest of the world, he said a great opportunity will be lost if instead of concentrating efforts to globalize the benefits from GATT, fresh impediments are introduced in the form of unjustified controversies. Calling upon the members for adopting the real declaration on environment protection, Mr. Rao said it is a comprehensive declaration with a broader charter which not only addresses the present ecological and developmental problems, but also aims at preparing the world for the challenges of the next century. Appreciating the role of the commission, he said it provides a vast scope for mutual cooperation among the nations of the region in the development of infrastructure. Highlighting the importance of massive investment in the social sector, he said poverty alleviation must be addressed on priority basis, if the goal of sustainable development is to be achieved. He called for sharing the benefits of human capital formation and technological development among the countries of the commission. The prime minister urged the members of the Asia Pacific region to give highest priority and unconditional support to the imperatives of economic cooperation, including trade, investment, technology transfer, and tourism over the other aspects of mutual relations. The Commerce minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, was unanimously elected chairman of the session. His name was proposed by China and was seconded by Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Mongolia. The executive secretary of ESCAP, Mr. Rafiuddin Ahmad, in his report to the conference asked member countries to remain on guard against imposition of new forms of nontariff barriers after the new GATT deal comes into force. He said already attempts are being made to impose restrictions to affect the exports of the developing countries. About the ESCAP agenda, he outlined an action plan for greater focus on infrastructure development in the region. One hundred and forty billion dollars will be needed every year to improve the network of road, communication, and power generation facilities. Since the external assistance will not be forthcoming to the required extent, pragmatic measures will be necessary to mobilize resources through private sector participation and efficient operation. This action plan will be adopted as the New Delhi Declaration. Our correspondent covering the conference reports that Armenia has been admitted as a member of the ESCAP though it is not a part of the Asia Pacific region. This has been done as a special case following a request from the former Soviet Republic. Today's discussions are covering recent economic and social developments in the region and their impact as also the need for sustainable development.
