"We said in December that very likely the budget objectives for 1994 would not be met and that new measures would have to be taken within the year," said Russo. "We are now confirming that opinion, which is widely shared," he said. He also said he believed the elections were weighing on Italy's economy, and that "political uncertainties have to be clarified before a full-scale recovery can take place." "The U.S. recovery reflects the fact that recession began there first and now the country is recovering. The rate of recovery is good but not exceptional; for Europe the timing is slower," Russo said. Italy's gross domestic product should grow 1-1.1 percent, "as predicted in December," he added.
