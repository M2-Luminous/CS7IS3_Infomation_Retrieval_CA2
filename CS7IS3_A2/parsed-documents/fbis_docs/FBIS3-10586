It is a complex draft resolution and the Council needs some time to examine it, Mr. Merimee told the press after a Security Council consultative meeting attended by Dante Caputo. It should be recalled that on 4 March, the group of four [France, Canada, Venezuela, and the United States] submitted to the Security Council, a resolution providing notably for the imposition of a trade embargo against Haiti and some sanctions against the military. Those measures, which would be added to the oil and military embargo in effect since last year, would constitute a new attempt from the international community to force the Haitian military to give back power to President Aristide and to facilitate his return to Haiti. However, the resolution requires the effective cooperation of Mr. Aristide in the search for a political solution before the imposition of new sanctions against Haiti.
