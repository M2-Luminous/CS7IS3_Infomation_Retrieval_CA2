The current seminar is of particular significance as it is open at a time of historical turn when the cold war ended and the desire of the popular masses for independence has grown stronger than ever before, the joint message says, and goes on: The chuche idea is the most independent idea for defence of the independence of the country and its free development against all manner of domination and subjugation; it is a peaceloving and internationalist idea which opposes aggression and war and urges the peoples of all countries to love and cooperate with one another and achieve common prosperity. As they have strictly applied the chuche idea to the building of a new society under the wise guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the Korean people have been able to build an independent socialism centred on the popular masses and firmly defend the sovereignty of the country and strengthen friendship and solidarity with the world progressive people in face of the imperialists' moves to stifle our country, which have been intensified as never before. When the idea of independence, peace and friendship indicated by the chuche idea is upheld, the age-old desire of mankind to live a free and peaceful life in an independent world and achieve an eternal prosperity, uniting and cooperating with one another, will certainly be realized. Although there still remain on the globe the old forces seeking domination and subjugation, aggression and war and the people's cause of independence is undergoing a grim test, it is temporary and no force on earth can arrest the onward movement of mankind on the track of independence. The message expresses the belief that the seminar will make a great contribution to the accomplishment of the noble cause of mankind for realizing the idea of independence, peace and friendship and wishes the seminar success.
