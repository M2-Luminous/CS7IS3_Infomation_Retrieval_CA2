Arsenic: "Revelation From Letter to Split's FERAL TRIBUN: Genuine Camp for Non-Croats Near Zagreb"] [Text] The "foreigner reception center" in Dugo Selo is actually a classic camp where non-Croat citizens are taken to await deportation under inhumane conditions, without any court decision, in makeshift shacks, despite the fact that they have had a regular residence and houses in Croatia for as long as several decades. Zagreb, 8 Mar--A letter that arrived recently at the editorial office of FERAL TRIBUN in Split, one of the rare independent newspapers in present-day Croatia, has raised quite a stir among the local public, because it provided first-hand confirmation that there exists a genuine concentration camp in this republic. The facility in question is the foreigner reception center in Dugo Selo, near Zagreb, which is on the level of the very worst camps in terms of its organization and treatment of detainees. Letter From Camp Inmate Those citizens of the Republic of Croatia [RH] who were not issued certificates of citizenship and whose residence permits were not extended are taken to this camp in handcuffs. They include many people who have spent several decades in Croatia and have property and permanent addresses there. Naturally, they are all "non-Croats," because as we know--under the current law--all Croats are regarded as citizens of the Republic of Croatia, regardless of where they are and where they were born. The letter from an inmate at the aforementioned "center" states the following, among other things: "We are at the foreigner reception center in Dugo Selo (across the road from the `Gorica' tableware factory, middle shack). These dwellings are that in name only, and I can tell you completely reliably that this is a classic camp, that we did not even know that such things existed in this state, and that we are shocked at the very knowledge of their existence." The letter goes on to say that the number of prisoners varies from 15 to 25 people, mostly citizens of the RH, many of whom have lived in Croatia for 10, 20, or even 30 years, and deportations are carried out over a period of 10 to 20 days: Muslims rounded up in Zagreb are taken to Tomislavgrad for exchange, Albanians from Kosovo and Macedonia are taken to Rijeka to be placed on a ship for Durres, and so forth. Many people spend up to several months under literally inhumane conditions (there are no bed linens, the blankets are never changed, the prisoners are not given soap or towels, and they do not change their clothes the whole time they are at the "center"), and there are some who are there--without changing their bed sheets and clothes--for six to seven months. Hygiene is nonexistent, nor is there any health care provided, so that scabies, lice, and so on are ordinary occurrences. In a 24-hour day, only one hour is spent outside--under guard--and all the rest of the time is spent in a closed shack encircled by wire, with makeshift windows. The Croatian Helsinki Committee [HHO] (chaired by Ivan Zvonimir Cicak) sent its team to take a look at what is going on there, and they confirmed everything that the letter said. Moreover, besides the "classic" camp lodgings, the prisoners have undergone corresponding treatment, and have often been mistreated; the atmosphere in which this has taken place is illustrated by their testimony to the Helsinki Commission, when they said that one night two members of the HV [Croatian Armed Forces] were turned loose among them, who asked the familiar question before they had even made it in the door: "Who here is a Serb?" It is interesting that none of the government officials approached by the HHO knew about the existence of this camp in Dugo Selo. The chairman of the Assembly Human Rights Committee, Ljubomir Antic, the chief of staff of the minister of labor and social welfare, Ivan Ujakovic, and the minister of health, Dr. Andrija Hebrang, were amazed that such a thing exists. Under the current Law on Movement and Residence by Foreigners (Article 68), shelters for foreigners are set up and looked after by the Ministries of Health and Labor, but no one at the ministries in question had any knowledge of this "center." It is maintained by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Even Father of First Croatian Pilot Is in Camp The type of people encountered by the HHO delegation headed by I.Z. Cicak in the fenced-off shack is indicated by several examples: Zoran Petrovic was born in Kraljevo, but has lived in Zagreb for a number of years, with a regular residence and apartment. He was among the first athletes to appear under the Croatian flag at a competition in Germany, but that did not help him to obtain a certificate of citizenship or an extension of his residence permit. He has not been punished, but he has been at the "center" for 103 days now. He was transported by plane to Skopje in handcuffs, but the Macedonian authorities refused to accept him. A member of the Croatian Armed Forces has already moved into his apartment at Lj. Posavski Street 19, and Zoran--who is neither guilty nor to blame for everything that he is undergoing here--began a hunger strike on 31 December. No one was interested. Edib Sejfovic, born in Novi Pazar, was a major in the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], but was "dismissed" at his own request. He has lived in Croatia since 1967, he lived in Vinkovci for 26 years, and his wife is a Croat and the mother of "the first Croatian pilot of Bukusic, who died in Vukovar." He has been imprisoned in the camp for four months now. Also here is Ramzi Mahmud from Iraq, who has lived in Karlovac for the past 15 years. Since the beginning of the war, he has spent 15 months in the Croatian Armed Forces. All of these people are being held at this camp--as the HHO delegation confirmed--without any decision by a competent court.
