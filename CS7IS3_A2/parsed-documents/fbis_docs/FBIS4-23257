Abelanda in Luanda, Angola; date not given] [Text] [no dateline as received] Zairian leader Mobutu Sese Seko, who has been in office for nearly three decades, remains in power thanks to the close ties he has maintained with the U.S. CIA since taking power on 24 November 1965. Jaques Matanda, a member of the Executive Bureau of the Zairian Sacred Union of Radical Opposition (USOR), currently Mobutu's major opposition force, made this statement during an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA in Luanda, the Angolan capital. During a lengthy discussion, Matanda charged that the ties between the chief of the Kinshasa regime and the U.S. intelligence service date back to before the military coup that brought him to power. The USOR leader and supporter of Etienne Tshisekedi, the political figure heading the opposition in the former Belgian Congo, stated that Mobutu was responsible for the murder of the country's leader Patrice Lumumba. At that time, the current Zairian president was Lumumba's secretary and later became the chief of the Army's General Staff, a position he used to work in favor of the interests of the U.S. Government, which at that time was basically interested in stopping liberation movements on the African continent and preventing the installation of progressive systems, Matanda recalled. He added that Lumumba, who fought for the liberation of the people of the continent, was a figure not to Washington's liking because of his support for the region's political and economic independence. This happened at the time of the Cold War, the height of the socialist community led by the now defunct Soviet Union, and a period in which Washington struggled against what it referred to as communist expansion, he added. He noted that Mobutu undoubtedly appeared as an important spearhead of U.S. administrations in Africa, a role he performed to the letter and which reaped him countless benefits. According to Matanda, Mobutu was given a green light to control Zaire any way he wanted, despite the fact that he was repeatedly accused of violating human rights, embezzling from the national treasury, and using corruption as a means to silence foes and win over supporters. The USOR leader added that this is how Mobutu has managed to maintain a regime that has not adjusted to the democratic model, a model to be applied in Africa, as well as throughout the Third World, according to speeches by politicians in Washington, and how he has blocked attempts by his adversaries to install a democratic regime in Zaire. Matanda admitted that today, Mobutu lacks the open support he once had for nearly 30 years from the U.S., French, and Belgian Governments, but, he added it is also true that conservative sectors with abundant financial resources in those three countries, primarily in Washington and Paris, are still providing him with vital assistance. Otherwise, in Matanda's opinion, the chief of the Kinshasa regime would have been ousted by the strong pressure his opponents have been exerting to create a democratic and pluralist system in Zaire in line with those installed in almost every African state since the beginning of the 1990's. Since the start of the struggle for a transition toward democracy in Zaire, USOR (which groups the country's major opposition forces) has worked peacefully to pressure Mobutu into accepting the challenge of multiparty elections, he added. He said, however, that peaceful means do not appear to be the way to convince someone who is willing to kill to remain in power and who continues to enrich himself at the cost of the growing acute poverty suffered by the Zairian people. In the interviewee's opinion, there will be no other alternative left but to begin an armed struggle if Mobutu insists on hampering the installation of a democratic system in the country. Matanda's remarks coincide with the views of African political analysts who feel "times of war are looming over Zaire unless the severe socioeconomic deterioration of that country is halted. [no closing quotation marks as received] According to various sources, the situation is already explosive, but Mobutu's exit from the political scene could ease the tension and prevent an armed conflict in the future. Despite the disapperance of the alleged communist expansion, Mobutu continues to be an important part of Washington's and Paris' economic and political interests in Africa. It is no secret that the United States and France are vying for greater economic control in that region of the world.
