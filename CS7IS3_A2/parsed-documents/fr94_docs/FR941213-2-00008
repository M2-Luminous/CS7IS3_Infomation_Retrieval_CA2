FR941213-2-00008 FR941213-2-00005 International Trade Administration [A&hyph;570&hyph;834] Notice of Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Disposable Pocket Lighters From the People's Republic of China AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Julie Anne Osgood or Todd Hansen, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;0167 or 482&hyph;1276, respectively. Preliminary Determination We preliminarily determine that disposable pocket lighters from the People's Republic of China (PRC) are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (the ``Act''), as amended. The estimated margins of sales at less than fair value are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. Case History Since the initiation of this investigation on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 29412, June 7, 1994), the following events have occurred: On June 23, 1994, the United States International Trade Commission (``ITC'') issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination (see ITC Investigation No. 303&hyph;TA&hyph;25). On June 13, 1994, we sent a letter to the China Chamber of Commerce for Machinery and Electronic Products Import and Export (``CCCME'') requesting names and addresses of PRC producers and exporters of disposable pocket lighters (``lighters'') sold in the United States. On June 22, 1994, we received a list of producers and exporters of lighters from the CCCME. A questionnaire was presented on July 1, 1994, to the CCCME and to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (``MOFTEC'') for distribution to PRC producers and exporters of lighters. On September 20, 1994, we postponed the preliminary determination until December 5, 1994 (59 FR 48284). On September 9, 1994, responses to the Department's questionnaire were received from the following exporters of lighters: China National Overseas Trading Corporation (Ningbo) (``COTCO''), Guangdong Light Industrial Products Import and Export (``GLIP''), Gao Yao (Hong Kong) Hua Fa Industrial Company, Ltd. (``Gao Yao''), PolyCity Industrial, Ltd. (``PolyCity''), and Cli-Claque Company Limited (``Cli-Claque''). On October 12 and 18, 1994, we sent supplemental/deficiency questionnaires to the respondents. Responses to the supplemental questionnaires were received on November 14, 1994. On November 23, 1994, petitioner alleged critical circumstances. Scope of the Investigation The products covered by this investigation are disposable pocket lighters, whether or not refillable, whose fuel is butane, isobutane, propane, or other liquified hydrocarbon, or a mixture containing any of these, whose vapor pressure at 75 degrees fahrenheit (24 degrees celsius) exceeds a gage pressure of 15 pounds per square inch. Non-refillable pocket lighters are imported under subheading 9613.10.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). Refillable, disposable pocket lighters would be imported under subheading 9613.20.0000. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. Windproof refillable lighters, as described in a memorandum to Barbara R. Stafford, dated December 5, 1994, are excluded from the scope of this investigation. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (``POI'') is December 1, 1993 through May 31, 1994. Nonmarket Economy Country Status The Department has treated the PRC as a nonmarket economy country (``NME'') in all past antidumping investigations (see, e.g., Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Saccharin from the PRC (59 FR 58818, November 15, 1994). No information has been provided in this proceeding that would lead us to overturn our former determinations. Therefore, in accordance with section 771(18)(c) of the Act, we have treated the PRC as an NME for purposes of this investigation. Where the Department is investigating imports from an NME, section 773(c)(1) of the Act directs us to base foreign market value (``FMV'') on the NME producers' factors of production, valued in a market economy that is at a level of economic development comparable to that of the NME under investigation and that is a significant producer of comparable merchandise. Section 773(c)(2) of the Act alternatively provides that where available information is inadequate for using the factors of production methodology, FMV may be based on the export prices for comparable merchandise from market economy countries at a comparable level of economic development. For purposes of the preliminary determination, we have relied on the methodology provided by section 773(c)(1) of the Act to determine FMV. The sources of individual factor prices are discussed in the FMV section below.
