Ramadan Mucolli reports from Prishtina: [Mucolli] At the beginning of the conference, President of the Republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova acquainted the reporters with the Serbian police repression against the Albanian people of Kosova. During the last week, this repression was manifested in the form of raids, harassments, arrests, interventions into educational institutions, etc. In this framework, he defined as a drastic case the siege to Seraj village in the Leposaviq commune and the raids on 22 homes in this village. Rugova assessed that repressive measures in the northernmost villages in Kosova are carried out with the intention of obliging Albanians to leave their territories. President Rugova also commented on the sending of summons for recruiting the Albanian youngsters to the Serbian Army and added that we should express gratitude to those who refused to participate in the wars waged in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia, because in this way, they have made a contribution to stopping the war. Mr. Rugova also stressed that many Serbian civilians have recently been involved in brutal interventions against the Albanian institutions and the harassment of Albanians. Rugova also warned these civilians, if they are from Kosova, not to play with fire and causing greater enmity between Albanians and Serbs. In the course of the sequestration of the buildings of various Albanian cultural, educational, and scientific institutions in Kosova, President Rugova mentioned the sequestration of the building of the High Pedagogical School of Gjakove. As a testimony to the Serbian attempts to recolonize Kosova, Rugova underlined the warning against starting to construct buildings for refugees or laying aside land for newcomers, as well as against threats of proceedings against Albanian refugees who may return to Kosova. President Rugova then assessed highly the rallies of Albanians in Germany, England, and Norway as successful efforts for the internationalization of the question of Kosova and their political will. On this occasion, he thanked all the persons and institutions of those countries that joined the rallies and supported the demands of Albanians. Mr. Rugova particularly hailed the debate on Kosova in the Belgian Parliament, especially the statement of Foreign Minister Willy Claes that the status of 1974 for Kosova is surpassed [as heard]. Answering a question on the signing of the agreement between the Muslims and Croats and an eventual similar model in the case of the Albanians of Kosova, President Rugova stressed that I hail the Muslim-Croat agreement and consider it to be a first step in stopping the war in Bosnia. Further on, he stressed that ideas for federations and confederations have existed before in the Balkans but, as testified in the case of former Yugoslavia, they have been unsuccessful. We are not against integrations on the basis of new principles, but first of all, every people should be independent and should then decide on relations with others. President Rugova also answered other questions by reporters.
