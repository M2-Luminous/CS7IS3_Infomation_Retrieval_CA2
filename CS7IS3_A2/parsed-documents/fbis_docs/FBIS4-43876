The one-page document was released as Russia completed an historic turnabout by signing NATO's Partnership for Peace programme of military cooperation. The document was titled "Summary of Conclusions of Discussions Between the North Atlantic Council and Foreign Minister of Russia Andrey Kozyrev." Herewith are the four main points as outlined in the release: 1. Both the Alliance and Russia have important contributions to make to European stability and security. Constructive, cooperative relations of mutual respect, benefit and friendship between the Alliance and Russia are therefore a key element for security and stability in Europe and in the interest of all other states in the CSCE (Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe) area. Both the Alliance and Russia welcome the progress already made in their relations, including within the NACC (North Atlantic Cooperation Council), and seek to strengthen them further. 2. The signature of Partnership for Peace by Russia opens a further important opportunity to develop relations through practical cooperation in the fields included in the Partnership for Peace Framework Document. The Alliance agreed to develop an extensive Individual Partnership Programme coresponding to Russia's size, importance and capabilities. 3. They agreed to set in train the development of a far-reaching, cooperative NATO/Russia relationship, both inside and outside Partnership for Peace. This relationship, aimed at enhancing mutual confidence and openness, will be developed in a way that reflects common objectives and complements and reinforces relations with all other states, and is not directed against the interest of third countries and is transparent to others. 4. The Alliance and Russia agreed to pursue broad, enhanced dialogue and cooperation in areas where Russia has unique and important contributions to make, commensurate with its weight and responsibility as a major European, international and nuclear power through: sharing of information on issues regarding politico-security related to matters having a European dimension; political consultations, as appropriate, on issues of common concern; cooperation in a range of security related areas including, as appropriate, in the peacekeeping field.
