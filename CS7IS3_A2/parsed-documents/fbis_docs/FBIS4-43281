Hayrettin Uzun, who heads Turkey's state pipeline company Botas, said Monday [6 June] that Ankara had assured Baghdad that it would repair the damage that was caused on the Iraqi side of the 986-kilometer (616-mile) trans-Turkey pipeline, Baghdad's main oil export artery. The pipeline, which has become the focal point of Turkish diplomacy, holds an estimated 12 million barrels of crude oil. Turkey says it has already paid for 3.8 million barrels and would keep the rest for its own use. The United Nations, however, says that it would incur a loss of $80 million if it adopted Turkey's plan. This sum was to go into a UN fund set up to compensate victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Uzun denied any claim that Turkey had "proposed" to pay 30 percent of the flushed oil revenues to the UN Sanctions Committee, as alleged by a Middle East Economic Survey newsletter. While Turkish officials voiced understanding that the three to four million barrels owned by Iraq and any subsequent flushings "would be fully liable to the mandatory 30 percent contribution to the compensation fund plus other sums to offset UN costs in Iraq," they have maintained that this is a question that should be addressed to Iraq, not to Turkey. Turkey closed down the oil pipeline in 1990, a few days after Iraq invaded Kuwait. But Turkish officials now argue that the oil should be flushed--up to three times--to prevent deterioration of the pipeline. "The deterioration would not have happened if we had flushed it when we closed down the pipeline," complained Uzun. He said that the spoiled oil should be removed "as soon as possible" to prevent corrosion, claiming it would be ideal if a political decision could be made by the end of June. "If the UN leaves it until September, it may be delayed another year. Technically, we could start the flushing right away. We have been told that there has been no major damage to the pipeline on the Iraqi side, but if there has been, we have told them (the Iraqis) that we would carry out the repairs ourselves," he said. Uzun hinted that Iraq, which lacks sufficient government funds and has lost its sovereignty in the Karkuk area, could not be expected to take the necessary steps to repair the pipeline, which lies in the northern portion of the country. "I do not even want to think about the consequences of a further delay in efforts to save the $2.2 billion pipeline," Uzun said, noting that the pipeline was covered by an insurance policy that did not include damage caused by deterioration. Turkey's losses over the closed pipeline are calculated to be $1.5 billion. "If Turkey would have had this money, it could have been used to initiate major projects," he added. Uzun: No UNSC Decision Necessary While Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk lobbied in New York for a resolution on technical immunity--i.e. that the flushing is a technical necessity rather than a breach of the UN embargo--Uzun said that a UN Security Council resolution may not be necessary. "The flushing is a technical matter. It has nothing to do with the embargo. I personally believe that a statement by the UN secretary general might be enough," he said. But he firmly denied that Turkey would act independently or contrary to any UN decision. "If we had intended to do that, we would not have waited for four rounds of talks," he said. Uzun also brushed aside any allegations that the flushing of the pipeline was linked to a third issue--a reference to the often cited linkage between an extension of the mandate for the Poised Hammer forces and the flushing of the pipeline. "The pipeline is one of the most important issues in Turkish foreign policy. It should be dealt with consistently, not on and off," he said. The Botas chief said that Turkey would either store the flushed oil or use it for its own domestic consumption. "It certainly will not be offered on the international markets," he said. But he added that the storing of the oil could be problematic in terms of Turkey's limited tank capacity, particularly after the first flushing process.
