FBIS4-52301 "dreas089_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 7 May 1994 South Korea DPRK Response `Unsatisfactory' DPRK Response `Unsatisfactory' SK0705010294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0055 GMT 7 May 94 SK0705010294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Berlin, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] received a North Korean message on Friday but its contents were deemed insufficient for the IAEA to send inspectors to observe the changing of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, spokesman Hans Meyer said. Pyongyang sent the message in response to IAEA Director-General Hans Blix's letter to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam urging the communist state to accept the agency's conditions for the presence of IAEA inspectors during the refueling process. As of Friday, the IAEA had no information on whether North Korea had already changed nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor, Meyer said. Meyer confirmed that the North Korean message from Foreign Minister Kim addressed to Blix came by telex Friday. Based on the message's contents, however, the IAEA could not send inspectors to North Korea, Meyer said. "The North Korean response to conditions (set by the IAEA) was unsatisfactory," he said. "And it did not provide grounds for the IAEA to send inspectors to North Korea." The IAEA will study the Kim Yong-nam message in detail and take follow-up steps, he said. Meyer added, however, that he did not know whether Blix would send another letter to North Korea. Asked to confirm a North Korean Foreign Ministry statement that the country planned to go ahead and change the fuel rods and whether the work was already underway, Meyer said he had no information on these matters. In his letter to Kim Yong-nam last Tuesday, Blix warned that if North Korea changed the fuel rods without an IAEA presence, it would constitute a grave violation of the nuclear safeguards agreement. IAEA sources noted some progress in IAEA-North Korean negotiations, saying Pyongyang told the agency it was willing to allow additional inspections of a key radiochemical laboratory and maintenance work on equipment the IAEA installed last March. But such headway means nothing if the problem of inspecting the fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor remains unresolved, they said. Although IAEA observation of the refueling at the 5-megawatt reactor was not specifically mentioned in the statement issued by the U.N. Security Council president, the work constitutes "a core item" in the nuclear safeguards agreement. Therefore, if the IAEA cannot witness the changing of the reactor's fuel rods, it will not be able to check the true nature of North Korea's nuclear program, diplomatic sources said. The agency reportedly feels it has reached a dead-end in its negotiations with North Korea and that the United States must find a breakthrough in dialogue with Pyongyang, they said.
