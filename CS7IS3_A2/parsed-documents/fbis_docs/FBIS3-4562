Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference Japan welcomes the scheduled inspections of North Korea's declared nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) following an accord between Pyongyang and Washington last weekend. Saito said the focal point now lies on whether the inspections, slated to begin Tuesday, will be fully carried out, whether North Korea "seriously" engages in dialogue with South Korea, and as a result, whether a third round of talks will resume between North Korea and the United States. More important, he said, is to seek a drastic solution to North Korea's nuclear problem through Pyongyang's complete return to the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), implementation of special inspections of its nuclear sites and carrying out a joint declaration with Seoul to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. "We strongly expect North Korea to take positive measures to achieve that," Saito said. Japan also welcomes the U.S. initiative leading up to now, Saito said. Tokyo will continue to maintain close contact with Washington, Seoul and other related countries and make efforts toward solutions to the problem, he said. An IAEA inspection team left Vienna Sunday to inspect seven declared nuclear sites in Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. The seven-member group is expected to arrive in Pyongyang Tuesday. But so far, North Korea has rejected pressure to allow inspections of two other undeclared sites at the nuclear complex that are suspected of being part of a nuclear weapons project. The inspection will be the first in more than a year by the IAEA, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog. North Korea allowed six inspections of its declared nuclear facilities in 1992, but threatened to withdraw from the NPT last March when pressed to open to checks of the two undeclared facilities.
