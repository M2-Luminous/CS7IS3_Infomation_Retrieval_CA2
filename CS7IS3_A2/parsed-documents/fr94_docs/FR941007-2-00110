SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 27, 1994, the Department of Labor (the Department) published a notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 27581) of the pendency of a proposed class exemption from the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1) (A) through (D), 406(a)(2), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of ERISA and from the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code. The Department proposed the class exemption on its own motion pursuant to section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990). 1 1 Section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) generally transferred the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue administrative exemptions under section 4975(c)(2) of the Code to the Secretary of Labor. The notice gave interested persons an opportunity to submit written comments or requests for a hearing on the proposed exemption to the Department. No public comments and no requests for a public hearing with respect to the proposed class exemption were received by the Department. Upon consideration of the record as a whole, the Department has determined to grant the class exemption as proposed. 2 2 The Department notes that the exemption will not affect the liability of any person for the civil penalties imposed on applicable recovery amounts under section 502(l) of ERISA.
