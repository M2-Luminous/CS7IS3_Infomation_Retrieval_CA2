Balladur disclosed the meeting took place but gave no details. It was held after the regular weekly cabinet meeting of the full government. Government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said there was "no change in French policy on Bosnia" and "there is no need to change anything at all." France was "doing its duty" even if the results were "far from satisfactory." After the failure of a visit here on Monday by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher when France sought strong United States support for a new diplomatic initiative, Mitterrand said France would make detailed new proposals on Bosnia, after the failure of the Geneva peace conference. Mitterrand's spokesman said that the president had insisted to Christopher that the situation could not be left without hope. The president also repeated France's opposition to lifting the international arms embargo against the belligerents, which would mean the withdrawal of UN peacekeepers and the end of the humanitarian relief effort. Meanwhile the Defence Ministry said Wednesday the UN Security Council was expected to approve the appointment of French General Bertrand de Lapresle to head the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in ex-Yugoslavia.
