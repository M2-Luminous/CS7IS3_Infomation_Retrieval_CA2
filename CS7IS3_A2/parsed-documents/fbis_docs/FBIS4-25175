Within three years, China has not only set up a fairly complete copyright protection system in the country, but also has taken a giant step into the big international family of copyrights and achieved the link-up of domestic copyright protection system with international ones. A young and modernized copyright protection system has basically been set up in China. As the spring tide of reform and opening up rose, China began building its copyright protection system from naught. In 1979, the drafting of the "PRC Copyright Law" began and over repeated discussions and revisions, New China's first "Copyright Law" was adopted at the 15th Session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress [NPC] in 1990, and officially took effect in June 1991. Meanwhile, the "Regulations for the Implementation of the PRC Copyright Law" and the "Regulations on Computer Software Protection" were promulgated one after another; China's copyright protection legislation had taken shape. This significant progress in the field of intellectual property right protection aroused enthusiastic responses from various social circles, and the Chinese intelligentsia were particularly elated. In fact, as a world-acknowledged high-level "Copyright Law," the law has not only reaped the rewards it deserves, but has also offered an overall legal protection to copyright holders through various levels. Over the past three years, courts around China have accepted over 500 copyright-related cases. More and more people engaged in literature, arts, and science and technology are walking to the solemn court with perfect assurance to declare war against the infringements on their signatory rights, rights to preserve the integrity of, and rights to use their works. Over three years of practice has proven that the enforcement of the "Copyright Law" has not only offered a legal basis for the protection of undertakings in literature, arts, and science and technology in China, which then greatly inspires the enthusiasm of people creating such works and directly promotes the development of spiritual and material civilization, but has also shown the whole society its respect for knowledge, creative works, and human dignity. Many experts believed that this would be of profound influence on the long-term development and progress of Chinese society. While establishing and improving the domestic copyright protection system, China also actively promoted the progress of joining the international copyright protection system. As early as the beginning of the drafting of the "Copyright Law," China had been paying great attention to absorbing the experiences and strong points of international copyright circles, and had been fully aware of the requirements of the international copyright convention, so as to make corresponding preparations for joining international copyright organizations. On 1 July 1992, the NPC Standing Committee made a decision on joining the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Universal Copyright Convention; on 7 November, it made the decision to join the "Sound-Recorded Products Convention." In October 1992 and April 1993, the three international copyright conventions took effect in China successively. Thus, China has become a member of major international conventions on copyright and relevant rights, set up relations with over 100 countries for mutual copyright protection, and basically normalized relations with foreign countries in copyright. It can be said that within a couple of years, China has walked a path that took many countries decades or even more than a century to walk. China's rapid advances in the work of copyright protection have drawn attention from the international community. Bogsch, director-general of the World Intellectual Property Organization, termed China's accession to the Berne Convention "an important historic achievement" and "a tremendous success of the international copyright circles" and China. He maintained that this would be a significant matter to the Chinese culture, science and technology, and social development, as well as to the entire international community.
