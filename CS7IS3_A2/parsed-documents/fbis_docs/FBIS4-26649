Regarding the news, spokesman Wu Jianmin said at the press briefing yesterday: "The news is not true. There is no such a thing." To prove the inaccuracy of the report, Wu stressed in English: "It is not true." When a reporter further inquired about the whereabouts of Deng Xiaoping and asked whether Deng was recuperating somewhere around Qingdao, Wu Jianmin did not answer the question directly. He simply said: "Mr. Deng Xiaoping is wherever he is." Yesterday, WEN WEI PO front-paged a report which said: "During a recent tour of Qingdao, Deng Xiaoping discussed three major issues concerning China's development: First, the principle of taking economic development as the center must never change; second, it is necessary to sum up the lesson of the former Soviet Union and properly handle the relationship between the center and the localities; and third, uphold party leadership and do not practice a multiparty system." However, a Qingdao government official yesterday denied the report about Deng Xiaoping's recent inspection tour of the city. In response to an inquiry from a MING PAO reporter, the official said there was no such thing. In a telephone inquiry FROM MING PAO reporter Zhang Qingyun, the first deputy editor-in-chief of WEN WEI PO, refused to make any comment on the paper's response to the matter.
