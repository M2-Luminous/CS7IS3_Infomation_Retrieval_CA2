The heads of the two states, Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze, spoke one-on-one. Also held behind closed doors were meetings of official delegations. Oleg Soskovets, first vice premier, and Georgian Cabinet of Ministers Chairman Otar Patsatsiya discussed a complex of reciprocal, primarily economic, relations. Political aspects of intergovernmental cooperation were taken up by Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev and Aleksandr Chikvaidze. Representing the Georgian side in the negotiations were Dzhaba Ioseliani, chairman of the Temporary Committee on the Extraordinary Situation in the Republic, and Aleksandr Kavsadze, chief of the State Committee on Protection of Rights of Man and Interethnic Relations. The agenda went beyond general Russian-Georgian relations to include certain aspects of the Abkhaz and South Ossetian problems and the situation concerning rights of non-native ethnic groups, particularly the Russian population. Also held was a meeting between Russian Minister of Defense Army General Pavel Grachev and Major General Guram Nikolayshvili, chief of the General Staff of the Georgian Armed Forces, and Major General Paata Datyashvili. Army General Pavel Grachev was highly pleased with the progress of the talks, emphasizing that it was found possible to realize agreement on the entire military cooperation agenda. Incidentally, the start of the Russian-Georgian talks was preceded by a terrorist act: Georgian Deputy Minister of Defense Nikolay Kekelidze was killed in an explosion occurring in his apartment on 3 February. The minister of defense himself, Major General Georgiy Karkarashvili, retired from his position on the eve of the talks. A KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent was able to determine that the reason for the retirement was "unacceptability of a policy of establishing closer relations between Georgia and Russia." Completion of the talks was followed by the signing of a package of Russian-Georgian bilateral agreements, chief of which was the Agreement on Friendship, Neighborly Relations, and Cooperation. Also signed was a number of intergovernmental agreements relating to trade and economic ties, status of Russian Border Troops stationed on Georgian soil, and cooperation in science and technology, cultural matters, education, and communications. One of the agreements signed that is of great importance governs the migration process and protects rights of settlers. Another agreement pertains to cooperation in prevention and clean-up operations in emergency situations. A provision to create three Russian military bases on Georgian soil was set down in writing in a protocol of intentions signed by the representatives of the defense ministries of the two countries. Army General Pavel Grachev stated that they could be created as early as 1994, with the sites being Batumi, Akhalkalaki, and Vaziani. The minister of defense also stated that "Eduard Shevardnadze's refusal to accept our offer of introducing Russian peacekeeping forces into Abkhazia in September of 1993 was a mistake on Georgia's part." Pavel Grachev pointed out that this was admitted by representatives of Georgia's Ministry of Defense. Following the signing ceremony, Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze held a joint press conference. Relative to prospects of Georgia's entering into the ruble zone, Boris Yeltsin stated at the press conference that it was necessary to organize a working group which would weigh the positive and the negative aspects of this kind of step, and only after that would it be possible to make a decision. Eduard Shevardnadze in principle shared Boris Yeltsin's view, adding that in Georgia there are ardent supporters and persons adamantly opposed to the republic's entering into the ruble zone. Boris Yeltsin, responding to journalists' questions relative to Abkhazia's concern and alarm over the article in the agreement providing for military-technical cooperation, stated emphatically that technical assistance to Georgia is not a matter of the present. The military cooperation process is to take place gradually, in phases, tied closely to the rate of progress made in political settlement of the Abkhaz problem. Eduard Shevardnadze in turn stated emphatically that Georgia will not be capable of creating an army without Russia, and she has no intention of posing a threat to anyone. He also said that he sees nothing that could preclude resolving the Abkhaz and South Ossetian problem. The conflict settlement process, in Shevardnadze's opinion, should proceed under the aegis of the UN and the CSCE, with the employment of peacekeeping forces, including those supplied by Russia. In the opinion of Emil Pain, Presidential Council member, all the provisions of the Agreement on Friendship, Neighborly Relations, and Cooperation between Russia and Georgia, which today was signed by the heads of the two states, are "useful for Russia largely in the political aspect." The Presidential Council member singled out the problem of stationing Russian troops on Georgian soil and creating military bases. "Georgia," he said, "is giving a guarantee of setting up Russian servicemen." Emil Pain continued by saying that there is a complex of strategic military agreements which are of general significance to the CIS member countries. He cited an example: It would cost Russia tens of millions of rubles if she were to erect a new border. Also of importance are agreements made with Georgia which pertain to moving Russian freight through Georgia by land and sea. Thus, the Agreement on Friendship, Neighborly Relations, and Cooperation between Russia and Georgia has been signed. It is a thing already done. This is illustrated to some extent in the photograph of the unnamed soldier - taken by our correspondent - who is a member of the Russian peacekeeping forces stationed in South Ossetia. Thanks to young men such as he, Ossetian and Georgian peasants for the first time in many years of the bloody encounters are able to do their work as before on the land of their ancestors. Without him, the Russian peacekeeping soldier, the knot of Caucasian contradictions could not be cut. And it seems that this is finally being recognized by those who only yesterday were shouting "occupier" at him. In the afternoon of the day, Boris Yeltsin met with Patriarch Ilya the Second, the head of the Church of all Georgia. Later the President of Russia and Eduard Shevardnadze held a meeting with representatives of Georgia's intelligentsia. In the evening, Chairman of the Parliament and Head of State of the Republic Eduard Shevardnadze hosted an official dinner in honor of the President of Russia.
