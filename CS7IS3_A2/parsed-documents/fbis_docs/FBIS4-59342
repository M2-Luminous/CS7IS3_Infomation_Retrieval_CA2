The appeal, issued by the national bloc of opposition on 9 May on halting the war, is one of the nationalist appeals which condemns the choice of war which has been imposed upon the homeland. The people and the YSP, which has condemned the war from its outset on 27 April, reiterates its support for the appeal made by the national opposition bloc, proceeding from its antiwar stance and its defense for the unity and for the Pledge and Concord Accord. The YSP appeals to the political and popular forces to condemn the war and the warmongers, who have been refusing to spare the blood of Yemenis, and to condemn the continuity of the war and the fighting between sons of the same country. The YSP and the armed forces' response to unity and democracy, as well as the appeals to stop the war, falls within the framework of our stance, which has been rejecting and condemning the military option. [Words indistinct] on the crimes which are being committed by the war criminals against citizens, the armed forces, and the country's unity and future. It will not be possible for those people to realize their miserable illusions. The heroic resistance of the people, with all its social forces, together with the armed forces, which have been defending unity and democracy, has thwarted and will thwart their illusions, which has sunk Yemen deep in this dirty war. Furthermore, it will not be possible for them to wash their hands of their crimes through their (?dirty interpretation). In addition, their use of foreign forces in full view of the world has proved their bankruptcy as well as their defeat in front of the steadfast heroes of unity and the martyrs of the homeland.
