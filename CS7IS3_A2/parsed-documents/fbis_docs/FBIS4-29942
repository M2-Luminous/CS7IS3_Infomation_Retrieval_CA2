The Japan-U.S. Joint Committee agreed on 16 June to set up a task force mandated to discuss ways to return the airfield. The task force will begin studying technical ways to resolve the radio wave obstacle problem. U.S. forces in Okinawa have already assigned experts to do research on the relocation of the communications station. The question is where the current parachute training ground should be relocated from Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. U.S. forces in Okinawa have often conducted parachute training on Ie Island. U.S. forces in Okinawa have said: "The parachute training ground on Ie Island is located near coastal areas and paratroopers are in danger of losing their lives if they land in the water. We have to ferry our paratroopers to the island the day before parachute training is conducted on the island and preposition rescue boats in waters near the parachute training ground. We have to spend a lot of time and money to conduct parachute training on the island." In this way, U.S. forces in Okinawa think it improper to relocate the parachute training ground from Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield to Ie Island. Chubu Training Ground at Camp Hansen, which is located between Kin Town and Ginoza Village, is being mentioned as a potential site for the relocation. U.S. forces in Okinawa use Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield not only as a ground for parachute training, but as a radio wage buffer area for the Sube Communications Station. The communications station is managed by a U.S. naval communications security group assigned to the Naval Communications Security Group Command (NSGC). U.S. forces in Okinawa call the communications station Hanza base. The communications station is part of the global U.S. communications network. The station intercepts foreign communications and secret codes in the Asian region and sends them back to the NSGC in Washington D.C. after decoding them. According to an American serviceman, economic activities are expected to be brisk as one building after another is constructed near the communications station and U.S. forces in Okinawa are concerned that such buildings would obstruct the smooth operation of the communications station. According to the same American serviceman, a group of American electronics engineers are looking for an alternative site on the premise of relocating the communications station. If the parachute training ground is relocated from Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, then the Sube Communications Station would have to be relocated. There is a high possibility that their relocations could abruptly lead to a full return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. It is said that plans worked out by U.S. forces to resolve problems facing the communications station definitely indicate the possibility of fully returning the communications station. The biggest task will be the technical study of how to relocate the communication station and the study of how to persuade Okinawans residing in an area where the communications station is relocated.
