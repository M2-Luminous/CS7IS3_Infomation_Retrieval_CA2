Department Registrar Maria Rocio Cortes told the media that "we still do not know how we are going to solve the problem" created by the resignation of electoral delegates and voting officers in 20 corregimientos of Simiti and Santa Rosa Municipalities. She admitted that, despite the fact that units from two Army brigades are in control of the area, the people are just as afraid as they were during the 29 May elections, when the abstention rate in the area reached 85 percent. It has just been learned that with the support of regular troops, efforts are being made to transport civil registry personnel from other communities by helicopter so the elections can be held. In Medellin, the country's second largest city in the northwest, a drop in the number of buses providing service was noticed today due to threats by the People's Militias, which yesterday burned a bus in an effort to hinder the elections.
