It may even reach 9 percent in January. This is the highest unemployment rate since January 1959. The all-time low of 0.8 percent was registered in August 1974. The decisive factor was the extraordinarily high seasonal unemployment in the construction industry. A similar development was also observed last year, but unemployment was .5 percent lower at the time. Experts believe that the unemployment rate is currently higher than in January 1993, when 8.4 percent was registered. Erhard Fuerst, head of the Industrialists' Association Economic Department, dashed hopes that an upward economic trend might substantively improve the situation in the labor market. Austria needs an economic growth of at least 2.5 percent to prevent another rise in the unemployment rate. The forecasts, however, predict 1.5 percent for 1994. According to a method of calculation applied in other industrialized countries, the unemployment rate in Austria stands at 4.3 percent. This method bases its calculations on the whole working population plus the unemployed, not just on employed persons.
