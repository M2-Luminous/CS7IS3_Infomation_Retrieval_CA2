It is envisaged to end federal financing of 89 regional Russian television and radio companies; if local budgets are unable to support them, they will be auctioned off and privatized. This is a tempting business, and according to the plan's authors it will be of value to Russia. Of course, not a single reform in our country in the post-Soviet period has hit its mark, and has usually hit another target--the one it was meant to defend. Previously, innovators had little chance of participating in these attempts at reform, but now more successful people have become involved in this matter. Possibly they will be the first in Russia to promptly manage to do two things at once: break up the old and build the new.
