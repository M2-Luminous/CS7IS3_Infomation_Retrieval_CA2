They agreed that if Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, leaves the Liberal Democratic Party and joins the new administration either as deputy prime minister or in some other capacity, then the SDPJ and DSP may have to leave the coalition. According to senior DSP officials, Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation [Rengo], also supports Murayama and Ouchi's position. It is believed Murayama and Ouchi's coming out with such a position is timed to warn Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito against cooperating with Watanabe, and to change the composition of the coalition by dropping Sakigake [Harbinger].
