Jin Renqing made the above remarks when he attended the 1994 spring meeting of the World Bank Development Committee. He hoped that the developed countries would proceed from the view of helping the joint development of all mankind and adopt some effective measures to solve the world population problem, such as providing money and technical assistance to and improving the outside environment for developing countries. He also hoped that international organizations, including the World Bank, would adopt more positive policies on the population issue. Jin Renqing said: There is a close relationship between population and development. To the many developing countries, rapid population growth will certainly limit their economic development, obstruct their efforts to raise people's standard of living, and put heavy pressure on their natural resources and ecological environment. The cheering thing is that more and more countries and people have realized this and are making positive efforts in this respect. Touching on the issue of international trade, Jin Renqing pointed out: The implementation of GATT's Uruguay Round agreement still needs to be solved. He hoped that all concerned parties, especially the developed countries, would keep their promises and make due contributions to promoting the developing countries' economic development as well as promoting international trade and world economy. Jin Renqing emphatically pointed out that the international community should closely watch the continuous fall of prices of primary products, which account for the major part of the developing countries' income. This situation will not only cause the unreasonable shift of the deserved income of poor countries to rich ones but also will adversely affect some developing countries' efforts to adjust their economic development policies.
