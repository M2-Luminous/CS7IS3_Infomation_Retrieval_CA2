Speaking at a press conference, Panov said that the agreements signed by the former Soviet Union and DPRK are still effective, but Russia will make decisions on the basis of its own analysis. Panov also briefed reporters on Russia's new proposal for solving the crisis in the Korean peninsula. According to Panov, the situation on the Korean peninsula is so tense that it is on the verge of war. He suggested that an international conference be held among China, the United States, Japan, Russia, DPRK, the Republic of Korea, as well as the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). He said that such a conference should first of all discuss how to guarantee the non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula including the joint announcement on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula by both sides of Korea. Panov suggested the international conference be held first in Geneva and then in Pyongyang and Seoul in turn. He said the United Nations and IAEA have made great efforts to solve the Korean issue, but the results are not always satisfactory. He added that all related parties are considering Russia's new proposal.
