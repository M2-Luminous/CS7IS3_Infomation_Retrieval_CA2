Invitations to attend the talks in Doha have already started being sent out to interested countries and institutions to take part in the fifth round of talks on weapons non-proliferation, sources said. But they refused to discuss any details of Israel's involvement in the negotiations, which form one of the five working groups set up as part of the multilateral Arab-Israeli peace process. Israel is due to attend a meeting in Oman next Sunday to discuss water resources in the Middle East. Oman will be the first Gulf monarchy to host a round of Middle East peace talks, at which the Israeli delegation is due to be led by Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin. Neither Oman or Qatar, like the other Gulf monarchies, have any official diplomatic relations with Israel.
