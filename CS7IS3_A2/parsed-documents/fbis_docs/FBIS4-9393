The chetniks continue to shell the defense lines." The announcer adds that "the defense lines on the Bosanska Krupa and Grabez fronts have also come under attack. Fresh chetnik regrouping has been noted in this part, too." Reporting on the situation on the Brcko front, Hamiz Deronjic says that "most active on the aggressor's side were the snipers, who targeted all the defense positions throughout the day. The enemy also intensified the attacks with small arms and antiaircraft machine guns along the entire front line. The areas of the most frequent and strongest attacks over the past 14 days of the enemy offensive -- Vranovaca and Boderiste -- were not spared shelling today either. The chetniks fired 50- and 82-mm mortars at this part of Brcko's defenses today." A report by the Information Service of the 1st Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports that "the chetniks disturbed the deceptive lull on several occasions" in Sarajevo today. It is reported that "they were most active from the direction of Vozlica Kuca near Brijesece, from where they used a death sower and an antiaircraft machine gun and fired rifle grenades at the town's defense lines. A similar thing happened from their positions in the so-called Sarabina Kuca, from where they attacked the free territories using an antiaircraft machine gun on several occasions."
