However, the situation on the whole remains utterly alarming, and the command of Russian border troops in Tajikistan do not rule out the possibility of fresh large-scale provocations at the border within the next few days. Provocations may be engineered by Tajik opposition militants who entrenched themselves in Afghanistan's northern provinces, TASS learned from well-informed military sources on Sunday [8 May]. The same sources reported that Tajik militants continued massing on Afghan territory in close proximity to the border with Tajikistan, with an obvious aim to attempt a breakthrough into the former Soviet Republic. Similar attempts have already been thwarted at the Shurobad and Pyandzh border segments on Friday and Saturday by means of mass artillery and rocket fire, a spokesman for Russian border troops in Tajikistan said. He stressed that the enemy should know that such provocations would not go unpunished. Russian border guards and Tajik national security forces have enough weapons and ammunition to foil any attempts of aggression from outside. This was announced unequivocally by the commander of Russian border troops in Tajikistan, Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, at a recent news conference for local and foreign journalists, the spokesman recalled.
