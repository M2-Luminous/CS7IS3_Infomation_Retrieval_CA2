FR940317-1-00199 FR940317-1-00017 In withdrawing the riskless principal mark-up disclosure proposal in the 1978 Release, the Commission stated that it would ``maintain close scrutiny to prevent excessive mark-ups and take enforcement action where appropriate.'' 20 Since 1982, the Commission and NASD have undertaken a number of enforcement actions against broker-dealers involving undisclosed, excessive mark-ups in debt securities. 21 Requiring disclosure of mark-ups in riskless principal trades in debt securities would supplement the Commission's and self-regulatory organizations' enforcement programs, by giving investors greater ability to review the mark-ups on their transactions. As a practical matter, the proposed amendment also may permit broker-dealers that consistently observe the highest standards of practice to compete more effectively against broker-dealers that charge excessive mark-ups. 22 20 Securities Exchange Release No. 18987 (Aug. 20, 1982), 47 FR 37919, at 37920. 21 See, e.g., F.B. Horner & Associates v. S.E.C., 994 F.2d 61 (2d Cir. 1993) (mark-ups charged of 5% for collateralized mortgage obligations held to be excessive); First Honolulu Securities Corp., mark-ups of 5% for municipal and corporate bonds held to be excessive); Investment Planning, Inc., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32687 (July 28, 1993) (upholding NASD finding that mark-ups of 4% on certain corporate and municipal bonds were excessive); Lake Securities, Inc., (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31283 (Oct. 2, 1992) (mark-down of 7.4% on FNMA mortgage-backed securities held to be fraudulent); Hamilton Bohner, 44 S.E.C. Doc. 1297 (1989) (mark-downs ranging from 5.3% to 10.2% in excess of permissible levels and NASD's findings of violations upheld); Donald T. Sheldon, Admin. Proc. File No. 3&hyph;6626 (December 2, 1988)[available on LEXIS](undisclosed mark-ups of over 8% for municipal bonds and over 5% for government securities found to be excessive), appeal docketed, No. 93&hyph;4405 (11th Cir.); Alan Charles Refkin, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26311 (Nov. 25, 1988), 42 S.E.C. Doc. 490 (consent decree included findings that certain registered representatives executed transactions involving mark-ups of between 10% and 34% in zero coupon bonds); PaineWebber, Inc., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25418 (Mar. 4, 1988), 40 S.E.C.

Codispoti, 48 S.E.C. 842 (1987) (mark-ups of 6.1% to 32.7% on municipal bonds with inactive market found to be excessive); Sutro & Co., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23663 (Sept. 30, 1986), 36 S.E.C. Docket 1199 (offer of settlement included finding that transactions were executed with mark-ups and mark-downs of between 10% and 34% on U.S. Treasury bonds); Hanauer, Stern & Co., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21313 (Sept. 11, 1984), 31 S.E.C. Doc. 483 (consent decree included findings of excessive mark-ups on municipal securities transactions); S.E.C. v. MV Securities, Inc. (S.D.N.Y., No. Civ. 1164), Litigation Release No. 10289 (Feb. 21, 1984), 29 S.E.C. Doc. 1591, (defendants enjoined from, inter alia, paying or charging unfair prices to customers in municipal bond transactions). The Commission brought an injunctive action against an unregistered broker-dealer for defrauding his customers by secretly interpositioning himself between customers and dealers in certain government and municipal securities, and appropriating for himself better market prices that should have been made available to his customers. SEC v. Ridenour, 913 F.2d 515 (8th Cir. 1990). In addition, the Commission has submitted amicus briefs in cases alleging excessive mark-ups in debt securities. See, e.g., Amicus Curiae Brief of the SEC and Elysian Federal Savings Bank v. First Interregional Equity Corp., 713 F. Supp. 737 (D. N.J. 1989)(brief arguing that mark-ups ranging from 17.4% to 21.27% for principal only trust certificates were excessive and mark-ups ranging between 5.3% to 7.39% on collateral mortgage obligations were excessive). 22 The Commission is aware of instances in which the customer, while being correctly informed that no ``commission'' is involved in a principal transaction in a debt security, has been given the impression that no transaction fee is being charged. See ``Firms Must Accurately Disclose Bond Trading Charges,'' NASD Regulatory & Compliance Alert (June 1990). Irrespective of current or future Rule 10b-10 disclosure requirements, a misleading statement or a failure to disclose material facts about the compensation received by the broker-dealer constitutes an antifraud violation. Because riskless principal transactions do not involve holding securities in inventory for any appreciable length of time, 23 the broker-dealer's compensation easily can be calculated by comparing the order tickets for the purchase and sale involved. In addition, a broker-dealer must assess whether its mark-ups violate NASD or Commission mark-up policies. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe that the proposal would be overly burdensome for broker-dealers. 23 The riskless principal disclosure requirements are intended to apply to offsetting transactions, regardless of the sequencing of the transaction. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 15219 (Oct. 6, 1978), at n. 20; and Letter regarding Buys-MacGregor, McNaughton-Greenwalt & Co., (Feb. 1, 1980), [1980] Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¶76,313.
