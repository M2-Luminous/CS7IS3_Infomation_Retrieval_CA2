"It is war time now, and those who evade their duty, primarily youth and refugees, must be expelled from Georgia," he stressed. In his words, "a critical situation has come about" in the Kodor gorge. Georgia's Defence Ministry has "taken no steps to help the local residents, whose squad numbers only 150 men," he said. "The militiamen lack weapons, most of them are untrained soldiers, however, despite that, they have been holding the gorge and have been resisting the nearly 2000-men-strong Abkhazi unit mainly thanks to the mountainous terrain," Ioseliani noted. On the incident in parliament on March 31 and a rally of advocates of the late ex-president Gamsakhurdia, he declared that "he was shocked by the site." "What rallies can be held and what birthdays of the traitor-president can be celebrated today? All his followers should be isolated, and that will be done to restore order to the country without law, where everyone does as he pleases", Ioseliani emphasized.
