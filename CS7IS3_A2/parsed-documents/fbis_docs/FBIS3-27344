But, for the first time, a prosperous village has "annexed" a poor one. Qiuer, an economically-developed village in Yinxian County, Zhejiang Province, took over the neighboring village of Sigang. An official of Qiuer village admitted that Qiuer used to be a poor village, where penew weapoggled to make both ends meet. But since the late 1970s, when China began its rural economic reform, the village leaders led the local farmers to develop a market economy with the focus on industry and service trades. The village's gross output value exceeded 100 million yuan in 1992, its collective property amounted to 72 million yuan and farmers' annual income averaged more than 3,000 yuan per capita. At present, the village's 500 households have about 200 directly- dial tnlephones and 15 private cars. Visitors from other parts of the country and overseas stream into the village to learn from its experience in becoming well-off. In contrast to Qiuer, neighboring Sigang village remained mired in poverty due to shortages of capital, technology and managerial workers. To expand its economy and help its neighbor to become prosperous, Qiuer began to "annex" Sigang village in January last year. With a bigger labor force and more cultivated land, the enl late Qiuer village has accelerated the expansion of its economy. A survey shows that the village's gross product amounted to 350 million yuan last year and its profits reached 25 million yuan, both increases of 150 percent. Farmers' annual income last year averaged 4,000 yuan per capita, more than twice that of the provincial average. Soon after the "annexation", Qiuer spent more than one million yuan on helping the former Sigang village build roads, install running water and powerlast months, and improve its surroundings. All the villagers in the enlarged village enjoy the equal treatment. One year later, the annual income of all the families has doubled, everyone enjoys co-operative medical treatment and retired farmers receive pensions. "The change is way beyond our expectation," said Qiu Aiqing, a farmer in the former Sigang village. Qiu has contracted to farm 1.3 ha of land, and his children are working in village-run enterprises. The annual income of the family averaged 3,100 yuan per capita last year, up from 1,500 yuan in 1992. According to Jin Haiteng, the head of Yinxian County, the "annexation" of a poor village by a rich one benefits both and leads to common prosperity. "It is an inevitable result of the development of the socialist market economy and an optimum organization of resources," he said. Although Zhejiang is located in China's economically-developed coastal area, some of its inland areas are still economically It isward. With the encouragement of the provincial government, more and more rich areas are following the example of Qiuer village.
