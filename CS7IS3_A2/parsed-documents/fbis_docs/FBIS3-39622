Prime Minister Cavaco Silva enunciated three basic rules allowing the government to choose a combination of budgetary and monetary policies. "The first is that there are no general revenues; each case is different and must be dealt with according to its own specificity; the second is that the stabilization policy must be be seen in the context of the medium- and long-term development of the country; the third is pragmatism: Woe to the individual who does not respect theoretical principles, but also woe to whomever is led only by them," said Cavaco Silva, affirming that these are the norms he has always taken into account. Of the three rules, only the second is purely economic. Despite the fact that the others also reveal the relative fragility of economic theory, they are much closer to the objectives of the purely political world, that is, maintaining power and reconciling interests within the context of minimizing for electoral purposes the social costs of the implementation of these policies. The speech by Minister of Finance Eduardo Catroga is the application of these rules. The present situation "demands a combination of macroeconomic policies that foster economic recovery through the adequate use of available instruments in the areas of budgetary, monetary, and incomes policies," said Catroga in the speech outlining for the benefit of entrepreneurs the 1994-95 economic policy. Catroga denied there was a change in economic policy and emphasized that "each concrete moment" needs a certain combination of different policies [passage omitted]. The problems mentioned by Catroga and his promises--both within the confines of the entrepreneurs' concerns--as well as the constant use of the word "company"--are the most explicit elements of pragmatism advocated by Cavaco Silva. Interest rates must drop; the government will reduce the stamp tax in 1995, reduce reserves and the weight of state debt, stimulate savings, energize the capitals market, and practice wage moderation. In short, a group of marvelous proposals for an entrepreneur. The constant praise of companies that Catroga says are "the agents of change," as well as the implicit minimization of macroeconomics--quite opportune in recessionary times--complete the favorable aspect of the message. However, since no one believes in miracles, realism emerges with regard to difficulties. For instance, Catroga repeated what others have already said: "Recovery may be slow and difficult." More important than the message is the messenger. Catroga is a finance minister who has been an entrepreneur all his life, and he is likable and affable. Entrepreneurs heard the right message at the right time, enunciated by the right person; thus all ingredients are present to make the speech credible and optimistic enough to foster investment. Catroga's appointment, therefore, seems to be a genuine example of Cavaco Silva's three rules. [passage omitted]
