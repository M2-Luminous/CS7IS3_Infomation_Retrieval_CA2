We have something to show and of what to be proud," Major-General Nikolay Zlenko, representative of the general staff of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, who arrived today in Vladimir at the military exhibition as a member of a government delegation, told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. According to the general, the high rating of Russian firearms is confirmed by a keen interest to them shown by buyers from 17 countries of the world including the United States, Britain, Germany and Israel. Despite the difficulties in financing the Russian military- industrial complex, the defense ministry of the Russian Federation is still interested in advertising its products and the permanent participation in exhibitions of armaments and materiel, the major- general pointed out. In reply to a question by ITAR-TASS about participation of the defense ministry in the conversion of defense industry to peace-time production, Nikolay Zlenko said that this participation was reflected in dozens of displayed exhibits. According to the general, the defense ministry has become a sponsor of a series of developments of hunting rifles on the basis of a Kalashnikov submachine gun, in particular a "saiga" carbine. The defense ministry, Nikolay Zlenko said, also financed the designing of a rifle for a farmer "of-93", various kinds of ammunition including for a gas pistol. This work, the general noted, will be continued with due account for maintaining of the military potential and mobilizing possibilities of defense enterprises in Russia.
