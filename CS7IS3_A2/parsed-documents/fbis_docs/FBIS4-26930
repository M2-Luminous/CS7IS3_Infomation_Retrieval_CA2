The meeting will be continued on Thursday -- the day after the Legislative Council [Legco] vote on the territory's democratic reforms. Yesterday's Sino-British Joint Liaison Group [JLG] talks followed an inconclusive three-day session of the JLG last week, during which the two sides failed to finalise a deal on the handover of defence sites. Further delays in ending the seven-year wrangle sparked speculation that China was attempting to block a deal until after the Legco debate on Governor Chris Patten's reform tomorrow. Independent legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing said: "This sort of action would send a signal to Hong Kong and to the world, that `now I (China) am watching you, so you'd better behave, and you'd better vote the way we want, otherwise there could be serious economic consequences.' If you vote against Mr Patten's proposal, you would be rewarded and if you don't, you could be punished," she said. However, British officials denied a link between the Legco debate and the defence talks. Officials maintained there were no fundamental differences between the views of the two governments. Speaking after yesterday's meeting, China's chief negotiator at the JLG, Guo Fengmin, said: "Our experts have accomplished significant progress but some technical issues remain to be dealt with." Before the talks, British chief negotiator Hugh Davies had said he hoped the JLG session would be completed at the meeting. Later, he said: "Until we have an agreement I'm not counting my chickens." He said the meeting had been adjourned "to allow us to complete work on the defence lands and on the remaining issues on the agenda." It is understood experts from both sides had round-the-clock discussions at the weekend on the draft agreement on the handover of military sites. Both Mr Guo and Mr Davies said they expected they could finalise the agreement on Thursday. In separate talks on the draft agreement on how to finance the Chek Lap Kok Airport, experts from the two governments met yesterday morning to tackle outstanding differences. Officials said they had no idea when the deal could be finalised but indicated there were no major obstacles. Sources close to the negotiations said the Chinese had made no new demands on their British counterparts about a completion date for the airport project.
