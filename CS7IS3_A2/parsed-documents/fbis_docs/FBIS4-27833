In his letter sent to participants of the national light industry meeting, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il indicated: Cherishing in their hearts the lofty honor and dignity of working in an important sector in improving the people's living, all functionaries and working people in the light industry sector should thoroughly carry out the revolution of light industry and, thus, should effect a decisive turn for development. In the historic letter the dear comrade leader concretely elucidated the essence and task of the revolution in light industry and its implementation method and wisely led all functionaries and working people in the light industry sector to furiously lift up the flames of the light industry revolution in order to effect a great turn in the development of light industry and production of people's consumer goods. This is a brief statement on a new development of light industry by Comrade Yi Sang-chun, deputy director of a bureau at the Committee of Light Industry. [Begin Yi Sang-chun recording] Four years have passed since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has been interested in improving our people's living standards, provided a national light industry meeting on 2 June 1990 and sent a historic letter, "On Thoroughly Carrying Out the Light Industry Revolution," to participants of the meeting. In retrospect, the dear comrade leader, who is consummating the chuche revolutionary cause created by the great leader [suryong] generation after generation, has been dedicating a lot of work and energy to improving our people's living standards day and night, without even taking a rest, since he began leading our party's work 30 years ago. Even after the national light industry meeting where he provided the occasion for an epochal turn in the production of people's consumer goods the dear comrade leader gave a great benevolence to the working people in developing the country's light industry and, thus, wisely led them to more furiously lift up the flames of the light industry revolution. In particular, the dear comrade leader has constantly taken measures to smoothly guarantee raw materials and materials for light industry. He has seen to it that consumer goods producers concentrate greater efforts on further increasing the kinds, quantity, and quality of consumer goods. He not only has provided consumer goods producers with necessary funds, but has also established measures for supplying the raw materials to produce people's consumer goods. Last December, the dear comrade leader specifically decided even the kinds of consumer goods that the light industry sector should produce this year. He also paid deep interest to the problems related to improving the quality of people's consumer goods and wisely led consumer goods producers to improve their quality. He also elucidated the direction and method in accelerating the modernization of light industry by rebuilding facilities of the existing light industry plants and their production process into more modernized ones and by building more new light industry plants equipped with up-to-date technology. The dear comrade leader also led the production of 3 August people's consumer goods to be carried out more vigorously. [end recording] Indeed, the dear comrade leader's wise leadership and benevolent love have provided a guideline which makes it possible for our light industry to devote itself to improving the people's living. This is why, along with our people, people's consumer goods producers are singing in reverence to him. [music] The following is a questions-and-answers session between Comrade Kim Kwang-chu from the Light Industry Committee and a station reporter at Pyongyang General Textile Plant: [Begin recording] [Reporter] How are you? I have seen you many times at this plant. You are working so hard. [Kim Kwang-chu] Not at all. [Reporter] Four years have passed since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il sent a programmatic letter to the participants of the national light industry meeting on 2 June, 1990. Since then, not only Pyongyang General Textile Plant but the country's general light industry has shown considerable development. [Kim] Yes. Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader, during the four years after the national light industry meeting, the material and technological basis of our light industry has peerlessly developed and there have been new achievements in the production of people's consumer goods. Above all, the struggle to make light industry chuche-based has advanced greatly, thus providing a basis for further increasing the production of people's consumer goods by thoroughly relying on our own material and resources. In particular, quite a few scientific and technical problems in further increasing the production of quality threads and fabric mainly using vinalon -- the chuche textile -- were solved and actively applied to practice. [Reporter] I understand that light industry has been further modernized in the flame of the light industry revolution kindled by the dear comrade leader. [Kim] Yes. In the textile industry sector alone, spinning and weaving equipment now has higher speed and more precision, and the production process is more automatized. Pyongyang General Textile Plant, as well as Kaesong Textile Plant, Kangso Weaving Plant, Pyongyang Silk Plant, and many other plants and enterprises have significantly increased production capacity with modern equipment such as air bearing spinning machines, highly efficient metal weaving machines, silk looms, and automatic reeling machines. [Reporter] I also understand that there has been considerable achievement in the shoe industry sector, including the modernization of equipment. [Kim] Thanks to the benevolent love of the dear comrade leader, who is deeply concerned about our people's living, the production capacity has been increased by the newly installed shoe catapult machines and automatic assembly lines at Pyongyang Vinyl Chloride Shoe Plant, Sinuiju Shoe Plant, Sunchon Leather Shoe Plant, and many other plants. In recent years, the models and quantity have been further increased, and the quality has also improved remarkably. [Reporter] In the flame of light industry revolution kindled by the dear comrade leader, our light industry is provided with a strong springboard for a higher leap. New achievements are made in succession in the production of people's consumer goods. We should have great pride and self-esteem about this. [end recording] [music] Producers of consumer goods are filled with confidence and optimism bearing deep in their hearts the fact that there can only be innovations and achievements in the construction of a chuche-based, modern light industry base, and in the production of people's consumer goods when we follow the leadership of the dear comrade leader in practical life. [music] Together with all the producers of people's consumer goods in the entire country, who received the letter "On Thoroughly Carrying Out the Light Industry Revolution" by the dear comrade leader to the participants of the national light industry meeting, functionaries, workers, and technicians of Sukchon Foodstuffs Plant are also increasing the production of people's consumer goods. Engraving his intention in the heart. Functionaries, workers, and technicians of Sukchon Foodstuffs Plant, who have the dear comrade leader's intention engraved in their hearts, are actively waging the struggle to increase foodstuffs production by renewing the production process and creating more raw material bases. Comrade Yi Chang-yun, chief of technical preparations of the plant, said: [Begin Yi Chang-yun recording] Thanks to the love and care of the dear comrade leader, who is always deeply concerned about improving our people's living, during the past four years, our Sukchon Foodstuffs Plant has also shown a significant increase in production capacity as well as quantity. What we are particularly proud of is that, as the dear comrade leader has taught in his letter, we further inflamed the light industry revolution by expanding the internal raw material bases to tens of chongbo [one chongbo equals 10,000 square meters], adding children's foodstuffs production lines and normalizing the production, and by modifying various production lines, including the cookie lines, in a modern way. Compared with the past, the production volume of foodstuffs increased almost twofold. We will more vigorously wage the light industry revolution presented by the dear comrade leader so as to further modernize production lines and actively increase various foodstuffs production. In particular, we will further display the spirit of self-reliance and fortitude to improve the children's foodstuffs production lines with our own strength and wisdom and thereby enhance the quality and quantity of the production of highly nutritious children's foodstuffs, including soybean milk, soybean milk power, and rice powder, for supply to more children. [end recording] It is not easy to normalize production in a relatively small plant and in the meantime to add new production lines with their own strength and wisdom, and increase the raw material bases. However, functionaries, workers, and technicians of Sukchon Foodstuffs Plant are steadily working with all their wisdom and zeal bearing deep in their minds that vigorously waging the light industry revolution is an honorable and rewarding work which contributes to improving the people's living while loyally upholding the leadership of the dear comrade leader. In a short period, the plant renewed the children's foodstuffs production lines, meat processing lines, and cookie production lines, and formed more raw material bases to actively increase the production of various foodstuffs. Producers of consumer goods in Sukchon Foodstuffs Plant are vigorously inflaming the light industry revolution to better implement the task presented in the letter sent by the dear comrade leader. In the future, too, these functionaries, workers, and technicians of the light industry sector in the entire country, who are displaying the honor of the producers of consumer goods, on the road of loyally upholding the leadership of the dear comrade leader, will vigorously run along the single road of innovation while highly upholding the flame of the light industry revolution.
