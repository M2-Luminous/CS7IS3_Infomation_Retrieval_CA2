Russia is putting forward quite strict terms for this; in particular, it is ready to accept Georgia in this zone provided Georgia refuses that part of the foreign countries' debt which, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, belonged to it, and refuses foreign assets, gold mines (if such are available or will be available in future), and independent credit emissions. According to the reports by the same source, Russia may also demand that nominees for the posts of finance minister and president of the national bank be chosen only with Russia's participation.
