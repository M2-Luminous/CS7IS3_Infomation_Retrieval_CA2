FR941207-2-00094 FR941207-2-00065 (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5). 4 Specifically, the Commission finds that the Phlx proposal to expand its rules regarding enhanced parity splits for specialists to include index options, in addition to equity options, does not create any regulatory concerns that were not adequately addressed by the Phlx when the Commission approved the enhanced parity splits available to specialists trading equity options. 5 Index options trade on the Exchange's Equity Options Floor and are subject to trading rules substantially similar to those applicable to equity options. Accordingly, the Commission believes that there is no regulatory reason to distinguish between equity and index options with regard the availability of an enhanced participation for specialists in parity option transactions. 4 15 U.S.C. ยง78f(b)(5) (1988). 5 See supra notes 2 and 3. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register in order to provide specialists trading index options with the same benefits available to specialists trading equity options. Additionally, because one of the enhanced parity split proposals was approved as a one-year pilot program, 6 the Commission believes it is appropriate to accelerate approval of the proposed rule change to provide the Exchange with as much time as possible in order to gather data on the effect and utility of the pilot program prior to its expiration. Accordingly, the commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. 6 See supra note 3. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;57 and should be submitted by December 28, 1994. It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act 7 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;57), as amended, is hereby approved. 7 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 8 8 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
