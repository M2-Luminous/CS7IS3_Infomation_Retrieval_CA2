FBIS3-230 "drafr042_c_94025" FBIS-AFR-94-042 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 3 Mar MB0303132794 MB0303132794 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN Housing Scheme Becomes `Political Football' -- Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 2 March in its page-6 editorial comments on Housing Minister Louis Shill's announcement of a 90 billion rand housing plan, saying "it is a shame that a vast housing scheme for the low-income group should be turned into a political football, to be kicked around by the ANC [African National Congress] and its associates." It is also "a disgrace" that the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) should not only call for the schemes's suspension but summon a minister before it to explain his actions. "But then the TEC has gone far beyond the State President's original intention that it should have advisory and not executive powers. It intends to run the country ahead of the election and it refuses to allow the government to take decisions without its consent, even on such matters as a housing scheme which brings great benefits to poorer people. It is not that Mr Shill has jumped the gun, but that the ANC and its allies are pointing the gun at Mr Shill and the government." THE STAR Mandela-Buthelezi Meeting Breaks Talks Deadlock -- Referring to the Mandela-Buthelezi meeting, Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 3 March in a page-14 editorial states that "whether it had been broken, breached or merely dented, something had happened to the deadlock." "Emotionally, we have a new lease on the hope of peace. The outlines of a compromise are discernible. The ANC and the Government should now, while feelings are warm and spirits high, drop their insistence on so much overriding central power. The Freedom Alliance should forgo its insistence on the restoration of the pre-colonial Zulu monarchy and the establishment of an ethnically exclusive Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland]." BUSINESS DAY Buthelezi Changes Negotiating Style -- It is "premature and wishful thinking" to believe that the Mandela-Buthelezi meeting represents a breaking of the talks deadlock, says a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 3 March. Buthelezi changed his "negotiating style" and "instead of responding to Mandela's approach with the usual, gruff `this proposal is fatally flawed', was `all smiles'." An explanation for Buthelezi's new approach is that faced with pressures, Buthelezi and Inkatha decided on the new approach "because they needed extra breathing space to avoid a poll they are likely to lose. The process of international mediation could also help them regain some moral high ground." BEELD Intimidation Campaign Against De Klerk -- An editorial on page 10 of Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 25 February says: "Intimidation is an evil which cannot be easily erased during the current election campaign. It is clear that no political party can be declared entirely innocent, but nevertheless a certain pattern is beginning to take form." "What emerges is that President F.W. de Klerk, as leader of the National Party, has all too often been on the receiving end from ANC supporters. In contrast, ANC leader Mr. Nelson Mandela is able to address his followers relatively unhindered. Mr. Tony Leon of the Democratic Party was this week able to move through Alexander township peacefully, as was Minister Roelf Meyer through Soweto. Examples of the campaign against President de Klerk were evident during his visits to the various regions...reaching a low point...when he was struck by an object thrown at him, and at Kimberley...where a meeting had to be cancelled for his safety. It is clearly no coincidence that these attacks follow bitter personal criticsm of President de Klerk by Mr. Mandela." Homeland Sets Time Bomb Ticking -- In his "Political Beeld" column on the same page Willie Kuhn warns: "Even among those who ought to know better, a dangerous oh-well-why-not approach has emerged -- give the right wing their homeland, so there can be peace in the land." "Therein lies the danger -- that half-baked plans will be accepted in order to achieve temporary peace; but this will set a time bomb ticking." He adds: "What happened at Newcastle this week is an indication of the explosive force which can be triggered by homeland claims. The right wing says Newcastle belongs to it, the Zulus consider it as part of the Zulu kingdom, the ANC supporters believe it is part of South Africa -- and the Indians are probably wondering how they are going to be Pakistanized. Even in Standerton the right wing and the ANC are fighting for possession." "A homeland cannot be established through emotional force," as this "would simply repeat and multiply the mistakes of the past. Sober reasoning is needed, rather than irresponsible surrender." "There must be thousands of right wingers who realize that a homeland cannot be simply wished into being. The blacks in the so-called homeland towns will not simply evaporate; nor will they accept sudden alien status in their own country." "These right wingers cannot close their eyes to the creation of a tragedy in South Africa." ID Document Fraud Causes Concern -- An editorial on page 8 of Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 28 February says: "The alleged fraud involving the issuing of identity documents to young Zimbabweans entering northern Transvaal legally or illegally is reason for great concern. Should the allegations prove to be true, it could mean that thousands of Zimbabweans will be able to vote in the April election. Apart from the fact that this would be illegal, the implications of such voting are enormous. Such foreigners could even play a decisive role in the election in the north of the country. Part of the problem appears to be that Shangaan-and Venda- speaking blacks live on both sides of the South African-Zimbabwean border. As a result of a lack of jobs, and sometimes food, in Zimbabwe, many of these people enter the northern Transvaal and they can be mistaken for, and registered as, South African citizens." "We hope that the Department of Home Affairs and the electoral commission will investigate these allegations urgently and get hold of the offenders."
