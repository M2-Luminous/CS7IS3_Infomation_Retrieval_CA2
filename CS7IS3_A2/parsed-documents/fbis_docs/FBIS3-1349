FBIS3-1349 "drafr058_c_94022" FBIS-AFR-94-058 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 25 Mar MB2503135394 MB2503135394 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Call for Generals' Withdrawal -- If the generals named in the Goldstone Commission report on police involvement in the violence in Natal are innocent, "then they, their colleagues and the Commissioner of Police should accept their withdrawal from duty instead of fighting it on procedural grounds," declares a page 14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 25 March. "It is, of course, correct that proper procedures must be followed, but this is a quibble that the commissioner could have sorted out in hours. There can be no argument at all that the generals and all others accused in the report should be kept out of the way until innocence or guilt is proven." Editorial Skeptical About Mediation Success -- A second editorial on the same page says Lord Carrington and Henry Kissinger, named to mediate between the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the African National Congress (ANC), "face a most daunting task even before they begin their work." "Ideally, the mediation should be completed before the election, so that the IFP can be included in the process. But mediation can be long and cumbersome and preparations for the election must, therefore, go ahead as planned. Perhaps the mediators' wisdom can devise a means by which agreements reached after the election could yet be included in the constitution. We wouldn't bet on it, however." BUSINESS DAY TEC `Gave In' To Prisoners' Protests -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 25 March in a page-6 editorial notes that the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) "gave in to violent protest in deciding that all prisoners should be allowed to vote in South Africa's first democratic election." "Having won their first battle through rioting which cost at least 23 lives, some prisoners are already setting out new demands. Some long-term prisoners want to vote `at home', and this novel idea is sure to catch on. Demands do not stop there. Other Ciskei prisoners say they should be released because `there is no government'. If they riot savagely enough, will the TEC decide they have a point, and let them loose?" SOWETAN Government, TEC `Dawdled' Over Issues -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 25 March in a page-12 editorial says the TEC and the government "dawdled" on the issues of prisoners' voting rights and the lack of free political activity in Bophuthatswana (Bop). The TEC and the government "huffed and puffed and wrung their hands until Bop folk took the law into their hands and sent Mangope scuttling. It was only then that the TEC and the Government stepped in." Now it is "happening in kwaZulu, the Ciskei and the other homelands. It's happening with decisions on the other violence racking the country. The message from all this is that only might is right. It is the old story of the liberation struggle: Lives have to be sacrificed first before there is action. This is all against the message that the TEC and the Government are trying to give us -- that negotiations and democracy are the way of a new South Africa." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN Call for SADF Intervention in Natal/kwaZulu -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English for 25-30 March in a page-20 editorial believes that to avoid "direct and bloody conflict" between the IFP and the ANC, "the South African Defence Force should be sent in to isolate the Inkatha warriors, separate the ANC mass activist from their IFP rivals, neutralise the kwaZulu Police, disarm all parties and stop the informal training of warriors. Their purpose should not be to depose anyone -- that would worsen the situation -- but to secure the region for elections and reduce the death rate."
