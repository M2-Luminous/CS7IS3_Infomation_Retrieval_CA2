He was on an election road show stop at the Kanhym feeder farm outside Middelburg where he addressed an audience of a 1,000, two thirds of them black. He was welcomed in jamboree style with a four-piece band, singalongs and viva shouts along with a constant drone of boos from an apparently ANC supporting section of the audience. Mr de Klerk told his audience South Africa had changed under the transition process initiated by the NP [National Party]. "Now it is the ANC who tells you you may not buy there, you may not walk here and you may not go to that meeting." He warned the ANC was not to be trusted and would become a suppressing party. "Mr Mandela recently claimed ours is a lame duck government. But this party is a very alive duck swimming to a win. It is the ANC that is way down in the water as a lame duck carrying the weight of the South African Communist Party [SACP] and all the failures of communism across the world." The ANC list of political candidates carried names of failed politicians such as Nelson Ramodike and Prince James Mahlangu who had wrecked their respective homelands of Lebowa and kwaNdebele with maladministration. "They are way down on the list along with Winnie Mandela... Let me say no more." Mr de Klerk was supported throughout with shouts of viva. The group which booed fell silent towards the end of the meeting when he referred to the ANC's economic policies and specifically to Mozambique as an example of such policies. "The world is divided into a rich half and a poor half," he said. "The poor half of the world is where the policies of communism and Marxism have been applied -- where the policies of the ANC have been applied." "Just look at Mozambique where everybody has been made poor, jobs have been lost and the country has retrogressed." "South Africa looks much better. And what party's policy was applied? -- the NP's". The NP stood for one man, one job and for economic growth, but the ANC was introducing aspects of SACP and Cosatu [Congress of South African Trade Unions] policies to satisfy them and this would make all South Africans poorer and frighten off international investors.
