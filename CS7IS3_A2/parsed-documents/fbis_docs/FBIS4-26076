In the southern part of Gansu Province, which covers an area of 3,345 square kilometers, the poverty-stricken areas have dropped from 66 percent to 18 percent as a result of a five-year effort in water and soil control drive. For a long time in the past, the southern part of Gansu, including the Qingba Mountain areas and the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang River, was one of the four main areas in China suffering from mud-rock flow. It now has over 800 crevasses caused by mud- rock flows and over 200 remains of landslides. In 1988, the Chinese State Council designated seven counties in southern Gansu as key project areas for water and soil control. Since then, more than 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million U.S. Dollars) has been invested in the project each year. As part of the project, land has been terraced, trees planted and grass sown in a 3,345 square kilometer area. Local people describe the project as "life engineering". The project has brought 57 percent of water loss and soil erosion under control. The forest coverage in the area has increased by 4 percent. With the improving of farming conditions, the grain output in the area has increased. Last year, the total grain output was 716 million kilograms, a record for the area. Production centers for apples, oranges and Chinese prickly ash have emerged along rivers and in mountain areas in the south of Gansu Province.
