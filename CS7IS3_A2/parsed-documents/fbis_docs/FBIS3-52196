The English daily `TEHRAN TIMES' called for an immediate summit meeting of regional countries including Iran, Pakistan and some others with influence in Afghanistan. It said that the meet would be aimed to "chalk out a plan for free and fair elections which is a must and that many believe can silence the guns." The editorial considered as insufficient whatever the neighboring countries have done so far to bring peace to the country stressing that "a concrete step should be taken." The Persian daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' said that impartial people who are trusted by the Afghan nation should enter the scene to narrow the gap in the viewpoints of the jihad groups and to extinguish the flames of wrath which would eliminate the properties of the Afghan nation. It also expressed surprise that some of the jihad groups have shown such a strong will to remove their rivals.
