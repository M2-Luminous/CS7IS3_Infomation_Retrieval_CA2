In an hour-long meeting with Cyrus Vance, former U.S. secretary of state today, Li noted that many big U.S. companies have submitted tenders for infrastructural projects in China. He said that China and the U.S. are complementary to each other economically, noting that the U.S. has a very strong economic force and is a leader in hi-tech and infrastructure while China enjoys sustained economic growth and has a vast market, rich resource of manpower and fairly strong technical force. Therefore, he said, the two sides can accomplish much in launching multi-form economic and technical cooperation. He reaffirmed that China attaches great importance to its relations with the U.S. and hopes that such ties will turn for the better. As China and the U.S. are big and influential powers, statesmen of the two sides should look towards the future and even to the 21st century while handling their bilateral relations, the premier said. Li also briefed the visitor on the reform of China's taxation system, policies for absorbing foreign funds, the role played by the People's Bank of China as the central bank and how the interest rates are fixed. Vance told Li that he saw tremendous changes in Beijing. He expressed the conviction that when in Shanghai, he would see even greater development and prosperity. Vance said he knows that President Clinton wants very much to establish a stable and healthy relationship with China. He believed that there would be further development of the mutually-beneficial U.S.-China cooperation in various fields. Li Peng recalled that the doors between China and the U.S. were opened when the Republicans were in power and the diplomatic relations were established while the Democrats were in office. Therefore, "we have many friends in both parties in the U.S.," Li said. Vance said that the two parties are of the same opinion that no matter which party is in power, the U.S. will continue to work to promote relations with China.
