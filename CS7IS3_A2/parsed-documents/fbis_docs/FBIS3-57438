Dubinin and Shcherbakov Tipped To Head Finance Ministry"] [Text] Yesterday, the president and the prime minister held the final meeting on forming a new government. Small wonder that the last, decisive seat in the Cabinet of Ministers -- the post of finance minister, which Boris Fedorov has reserved for himself for the period in which a financial report for 1993 will be written -- remains effectively vacant. One may hold any opinion about Fedorov. Drawing on recent reports you may keep dispelling as long as you wish the myth about trends that prompted the former minister to do what he has been doing. What may appear to be the finance minister's overly spectacular line of conduct, however, has transformed the post of finance minister from a work place into a crown of thorns of a great reformist martyr. If this trend is to be followed, finding a replacement for Boris Fedorov will be fairly easy. The more so because the Fedorov-style activity (refusals to pay money according to the government's own estimates, delays in paying wages, depositing money in commercial banks) will hardly be possible if the would-be finance minister lacks a deputy prime minister's title. Hence, both owing to the demotion and the postponed budget deficit (government debts to the agro-industrial and the military-industrial sectors), the minister's seat will no longer be a pedestal for a charismatic figure. The important, influential (and credit-disbursing) post of finance minister can only be occupied by a person from Viktor Chernomyrdin's team. Moreover, the candidacy will have to be approved by Viktor Gerashchenko. The West's opinion, which was not heeded when forming the bulk of the cabinet, is no longer decisive for a whole number of reasons. At present, two candidates are being publicly broken in: from among Boris Fedorov's deputies, the Central Bank-backed Sergey Dubinin (albeit "smeared" by the GAZ scandal, which Boris Nemtsov would not let die out), has been nominated for promotion, and at the same time a rumor has been spread about former Deputy Council of Ministers Chairman Vladimir Shcherbakov's possible appointment to the post. As for the latter, it can be said that he, like many other former government officials, has not squandered a certain clout he wielded at the Council of Ministers; meanwhile, following his dismissal he set up the "Interprivatizatsiya" fund, through which billion-dollar foreign investments are being attracted to the former USSR. On New Year's eve, television viewers could watch his address as chief of a large investment fund. This candidacy is preferable in terms of publicity than is Dubinin's, to say nothing of the fact that it may be the most "market-oriented" one compared to all other options -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA readers could see that point: in an article entitled "Management, Technology, Money: Only in This Sequence Will We Be Able To Integrate Ourselves in the World Economy" (No. 105 of 8 June 1993) we wrote about his views on the domestic investment climate and the transformation of Russian enterprises' management. What is unclear is another thing -- whether Shcherbakov, a successful businessman, will want to return to government service. The new finance minister will have to untangle a web of "Fedorov's contradictions' and to bear responsibility for rising inflation, for which those who had created a semblance of "monetarism" by postponing the budget deficit are also to blame, at least in part. The pro-radicalist press campaign of active opposition to Fedorov's successor was just as inevitable and ineluctable as strikes and credit commission meetings. Furthermore, although for a person of purely state interests a ministerial post means a realistic opportunity to influence decisionmaking on specific matters, the assumption of this responsibility can scarcely open up bright prospects for the office holder; filling the last vacancy in the cabinet (discounting Panfilova's seat) is turning into one of the most serious personnel problems.
