It was learned that when inspecting Zhuhai, Li Peng said that in the surging tide of reform and opening, Zhuhai's construction had been successful, and its experience should be introduced and disseminated to all parts of the country. Li Peng expressed satisfaction and appreciation for the achievements made by Zhuhai in its economic construction in the last few years. Reportedly, Li Peng called for quickening the development of Hengqing Dao, saying that the island is a very special piece of treasured land and should be properly developed as soon as possible. According to sources, Li Peng also affirmed the border management policy of "relaxing control on the primary line and tightening control on the secondary line," and instructed Zhuhai to continue to run the special economic zone well, thus playing an exemplary role for the people of the whole country. In addition, Yang Rudai, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, and Hu Ping, director of the State Council's Special Economic Zone Affairs Office, also inspected Zhuhai separately on Monday [31 January] and Tuesday [1 February] of this week. Yang Rudai said that Zhuhai had raised construction funds through its land, and wasted hills have been transformed into treasured land. More land is being prepared in the course of development. Thus, Zhuhai has turned itself into an economically prosperous and beautiful city without needing any money allocated by the state. It has gained some very successful experience and has painted a good picture. It is hoped that Zhuhai will become "China's Singapore." After inspecting Zhuhai, Hu Ping also said that the special economic zones should still be special and should create a special microclimate to heat up their economies. In the course of reform and opening and in the process of developing the socialist market economy, the special economic zones should play a leading role. Hu Ping inspected Yazhou Fangzhen Company, a biochemical pharmaceutical factory, a shopping center, some duty-free shops, and some large construction projects in the western district of the city.
