Broadly speaking, it was to create the conditions for economic upliftment and the modernisation of society. Just last week, State Secretary Murdiono told a seminar that any political system had to be dynamic and open to change in accordance with new demands and conditions. "The global political trend demands greater political openness and greater respect for human rights," he had said. All that is worthwhile. For the country to advance, it takes more than opening up the economy to foreign participation. Domestic strengths need to be maximised. It can be no surprise then that a liberalisation of the spirit has brought with it an exuberance among activists that can come uncomfortably close to upsetting public order. Recent events have been revealing. If they spin out of control, the consequences can be dire as Indonesian society in urban centres remains a combustible mix of extreme wealth and unfulfilled wants. It lacks the buffer of a growing middle class found in Taiwan and South Korea when these countries began to ease off on societal restrictions less than a decade ago. If not managed properly, it could deal Indonesia's cause of openness a blow which would take years to repair. That equally would be harmful to an emancipating society. The Medan labour riots over minimum pay were bad enough, but they began to take on a racial complexion with the discovery of anti-Chinese leaflets. Then came the Bapindo corruption case, which has dramatised for many Indonesians to hold the Chinese have on the economy and their friends in high places. Earlier, the virulence of student agitation over a state-sponsored lottery had warned the security agencies of the dangers of pent-up emotions being released suddenly. In a separate case, the sentencing of 21 students for defaming the president brought home to many the power of pressure groups. These are internal dynamics. Recent remarks by two key generals leave one in doubt that the authorities are alive to the dangers. This is a comfort to Indonesia's neighbours who share its concern for internal stability to drive economic expansion. Gen. Feisal Tanjung, head of the armed forces, cautioned last month that political dialogue had to come with a sense of responsibility and consensus to "take into account our cultural condition". Brig-Gen Agum Gumelar, head of the Kopassus [Special Commando Force] force which aided the crushing of the communist forces after the abortive 1965 coup by the PKI, the Indonesian Communist Party, has warned of the communist revival. In today's context, that could be taken as a code for the radical groups -- student and labour activists, environmentalists and human rights advocates -- which some quarters see as troublesome. Here, the hope must be that just as it is vital to secure public order, care must be taken that debate and legitimate expressions of grievance are not snuffed out. Such a development would ill-serve Indonesia. The difficulty, as is standard when discussing a polity as complex as Indonesia's, is in making the ground rules for participatory democracy as clear as can be. Complicating the equation is the internal dimension. Indonesia is the chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, and it has hopes for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. In November, it will stage the second summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation members. Wanting to be a player on the world stage carries with it obligations, such as adherence to certain standards of behaviour, which may be at odds with what has been happening at home. But domestic stability is paramount -- this is an absolute to preserve conditions for uninterrupted growth in Southeast Asia.
