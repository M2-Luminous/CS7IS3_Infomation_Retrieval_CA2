In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Ahmad Mubayyidin, spokesman for the ministry, said that the proposal says that an international company -- namely the British company Lloyd's Register, which is not a commercial company -- would inspect the ships and cargo in port, not at sea as is happening now. He denied that there is a specific date for implementing this proposal. He added: Of course, legally, the blockade does not concern the United States in particular, as it falls under the powers of the UN Security Council sanctions committee. Thus consultations must be held within the framework of this committee in order to take a decision to begin implementing the proposal, which stipulates that al-'Aqabah-bound ships should not be subjected to obstacles or search measures by U.S. Navy units or any other units, and that these ships should arrive in the port very easily. Cargo should be examined inside the port by the international company's representative in cooperation with a competent Jordanian committee. [passage omitted]
