Martinez said he saw no other factor that might have a negative effect on Latvia's acceptance into the European body. He underscored that the "common European family" was missing Latvia. The president of the Parliamentary Assembly pointed out in positive aspect the work of Estonia's representatives in the assembly. He said quick rise of Estonian parliament Deputy Speaker Tunne Kelam to one of the leading figures in the assembly was another great contribution to the country's good standing. Martinez is expected to visit Estonia in May or June for meetings with the country's leaders and representatives of different factions in the parliament. He is also to meet then Uno Lohmus, who was elected member to the European Human Rights Committee at the assembly session Thursday. Tunne Kelam, the leader of the Estonian delegation, at the meeting delivered to Martinez Estonia's propositions concerning the agenda of the visit.
