"There's no alternative," said Pietro Larizza, secretary-general of the UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] labour federation. "If the new executive decides to interrupt the present model of economic and welfare state management, room would emerge for concern and hostility since our productive system would be headed for economic adventures." "In other words," he explained, "the ball is now in the court of whoever offers himself to lead the country. Italy's hopes of emerging from the crisis depend on what government programme he offers." Concern over governability after the elections also emerged from the observations of Guglielmo Epifani, assistant secretary-general at the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] labour federation, by far the country's largest, ahead of the CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] and the UIL, in that order. "The platforms presented by the Right are very distant from the unions are proposing," he said. "Certainly, if I were to go by the platforms circulating during the election campaign, I would have reason for alarm," added Raffaele Morese, assistant secretary- general at the CISL, who added that people now had to get used to alternation between opposition and government. "It remains to be seen how the electoral alliance will be transformed in a government alliance," he added as top union officials said a meeting of the Big Three labour federations already scheduled tomorrow for consultations on trade-union unity would now devote some time to the political situation. "One can imagine Italy with the most laissez-faire government in its history," added Morese, "but you certainly can't imagine it with higher inflation or high unemployment." Morese also noted in a warning footnote that the new government could "theoretically" decide its majority is all it needs to govern: "But the case of the Balladur government in France is a lesson; when you decide without the consent of the other partners to the social pact, you may be forced into reverse by what happens in the streets." Morese's superior at the CISL, Secretary-General Sergio D'Antoni, agreed that judgement should be suspended until the government platform is clear, but the Berlusconi cartel has "distinguished itself only for its contradictory proposals, with a touch of laissez-faire, corporativism, a vocation to state interventionism and secessionist temptations." In an article to be published by a trade-union periodical tomorrow, D'Antoni said the premises for the unions' position remains a debate in a "constructive spirit" on "work, employment and social equity." On the extreme right, the CISNAL [Italian Confederation of National Trade Unions] labour federation, the neo-Fascist labour organisation whose political equivalent is now the National Alliance, also pledged firm support for keeping social insurance, health and education in government hands, against plans from other members of the Berlusconi cartel for radical privatisation. "If anything," said the CISNAL, "the systems for managing social welfare programmes must be re-designed and their objectives renewed so as to re-establish efficiency and administrative transparency."
