K."-initialed report: "Karadzic: We Do Not Wish Anyone To Be Our Hostage"] [Text] Banja Luka 9 June -- In light of the statement by [FRY President] Zoran Lilic that the citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia cannot be the hostages of the political leaders from the republic of Srpska, the republic of Serbian Krajina, or the FRY, Radovan Karadzic in a statement for JAVNOST emphasized: "We do not believe that President Lilic referred to us when he spoke about sabotage of the negotiations. As regards Yugoslavia distancing itself from this problem, we have always favored something of the kind. We do not wish anyone to be our hostage, however, we will, by the same token, not accept the fate of Mica Ljubibratic, the leader of the Herzegovina uprising, or the outcome of the Berlin Congress." "Therefore, we do not accept any custody over us. We have created our own state and our aim is to unite with Serbia into one state. If this is not possible, then with Yugoslavia as a federation, and if even this is not possible, then we will remain an independent state until the unification with our mother country is facilitated for us."
