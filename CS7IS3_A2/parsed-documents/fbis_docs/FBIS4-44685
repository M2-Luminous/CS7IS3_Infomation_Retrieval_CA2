Since that time, details of the reorganization were worked out by the agency's director general, Mr. Jean-Marie Luton. Mr. Jorg Feustel-Buechl will head the manned flight and microgravity programs, and in that capacity he will be responsible for all studies on ESA participation in the international R-Alpha station as well as negotiations with partners in the project, including the Americans, Russians, Canadians, Japanese, and the 14 ESA member countries. Specifically, he will be responsible for the Columbus laboratory-module program which is to link up with Columbus, related systems (polar platform, etc.), and vehicles for transporting crew and cargo (Crew Transport Vehicle, or CTV, and Automatized Transport Vehicle, ATV), plus the precursor flights scheduled with the Russians between now and the year 2000. He will also oversee all technological aspects of the orbital rendezvous, the future European remote manipulator arm, and the EVA suits that ESA astronauts will wear, as well as operations of the European Astronaut Center at Cologne. Mr. Fredrick Engstrom as launch director has been given oversight responsibility for the Ariane-5 heavy rocket program, technologies pertaining thereto, future spin-off launcher programs, and co-management (with the National Center for Space Studies) of all ESA utilization of the Guyana Space Center, a spokesman said.
