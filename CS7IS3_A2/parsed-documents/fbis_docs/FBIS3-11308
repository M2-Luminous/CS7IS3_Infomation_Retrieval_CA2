Personnel of the Counterterrorism Provincial Police (Jecote) have been significantly reduced, thus affecting the technical side of investigative work. The personnel from these units, which formed a division and were headed by colonels (in regions) and commanders (in subregions), will now occupy administrative posts. This absurd measure by the PNP has cut personnel and reduced the duties of the National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote), the National Criminal Investigative Directorate [Direccion Nacional de Investigacion Criminal -- Dinincri], and the Fiscal Patrimony National Directorate. On 4 March, the PNP issued Internal Resolution 2848-DGPNP/EMP, approving the PNP organization for this year. This entails substantial changes in the structure of the PNP, which was established by Legislative Decree No. 744 issued in 1991. Sources have criticized the changes, stating that a resolution issued by the PNP director cannot modify a resolution issued by a higher institution. The biggest concern is that the changes have taken place in the provinces. EL COMERCIO correspondents have reported that, for example, the Criminal Investigative Police and the Fiscal Patrimony Directorate have already been dismantled and the specialized investigative tasks that they carried out have been assigned to the local police stations which are short of personnel who, in turn, are not properly trained to do this job. The source said that this measure represents a ``green light'' for delinquency in the interior because personnel at police stations are scarce and their logistic and investigative capabilities are well below that of criminals in the provinces. Reduction of Jecote personnel and duties was also criticized because, although terrorist actions have decreased, one can hardly ``sing victory'' or afford to deploy personnel onto other duties. Proof of this is that the Armed Forces continue in a "state of emergency" in many zones that have apparently been pacified. The military authorities, in a more responsible attitude, believe there is still work to be done in these areas. The aforementioned resolution prompted the removal of 200 Dincote detectives specialized in counterterrorism, who will be placed at the disposal of the Public Order Directorate [Direccion de Orden Publico]. This means they will wear uniforms and be assigned to patrol the streets. Dinincri functions have also been reduced. For example, the Kidnap Investigation Division (Didcol) -- which handled cases of adult rape, seduction and rape of minors, procuring, and indecent assault -- has been dismantled. The departments and operation groups of five other Dinincri divisions have also been reduced. Three departments of the Division for Crimes Against Life, Body, and Health [Division de Delitos Contra la Vida, el Cuerpo, y la Salud] have been dismantled and only the Homicide Department is left. The same goes for the Theft Division. The Contraband, Customs Tariff Evasion Division, and other divisions of the Fiscal Patrimony Directorate have been reduced. As with Dincote, personnel that leave the units will be placed at the disposal of the Public Order Directorate or will be given administrative jobs.
