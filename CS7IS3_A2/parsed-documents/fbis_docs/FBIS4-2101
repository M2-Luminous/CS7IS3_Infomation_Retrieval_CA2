The temperature in March was fairly low, thus causing a delay in the wheat sowing period. According to data provided by meteorological departments, precipitation in our province last autumn and winter was greater than the average by 20 percent. In March this year, snowfall was 78 percent greater than the same period of previous years, thus making 28 counties and cities across the province suffer from varying degrees of spring waterlogging. The afflicted areas are estimated at 10 million mu, 5 million mu of which are areas for sowing wheat, which accounts for one-fourth of the total wheat sowing area. In addition, our province experienced low temperatures in March. No warm temperatures were seen before 26 March. By 27 March, which should be the upsurge period for wheat sowing in normal years, only a small number of counties and cities across the province had begun to tentively plant wheat. Based on the information provided by the provincial agricultural departments, as of 4 April, less than 1 million mu of wheat had been planted, only accounting for one-twentieth of the planned sowing acreage. However, during the same period of last year, more than 3 million mu of wheat were planted across the province. The province's wheat sowing period has been delayed by 7 to 10 days, compared with normal years. The delay in the wheat sowing period will prevent us from guaranteeing a bumper harvest in some areas and will make us rush to plant other field crops. In this connection, the provincial agricultural committee has issued a circular calling for concentrated planting of wheat on a crash basis. Specialists have proposed efforts be made to adopt measures to drain excess water to stop spring waterlogging.
