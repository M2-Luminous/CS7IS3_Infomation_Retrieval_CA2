The Presidential Press Office announced the order to the ITAR- TASS NEWS AGENCY this morning and said the decision was based on the country's constitution. Many of Russia's important policies have been worked out with the counsel of the Security Council, which is directly under Yeltsin's leadership. Since a Yeltsin-proposed reshuffle in February, the council had had eight members including ministers of defense, foreign and home affairs as well as heads of the country's intelligence departments.
