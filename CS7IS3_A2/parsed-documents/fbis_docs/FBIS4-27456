The report said that about 500 Vietnamese families totaling some 3,000 persons have occupied the (Kbal Tao) area along Tonle Sap lake in Pursat Province. They control all land and waterways in the area, where there are all sorts of facilities resembling a floating city for the Vietnamese. As for the Cambodian people, they cannot earn their living independently because (Kbal Tao) belongs to the Vietnamese. The Cambodians can earn a living only by catching fish for the Vietnamese boss. [passage omitted] While the Vietnamese earn from 50,000 to 100,000 riel from selling fish caught by Cambodians, the Cambodian workers do not have enough to eat. On the afternoon of 25 May, about 30 Cambodian workers returned from fishing to ask the Vietnamese employer for their weekly pay. They told the boss that they wanted to go home to grow rice because the planting season has come. The Vietnamese employer told his 12-year-old (?son) to give a glass of liquor to each Cambodian worker and told the workers that he would not give them pay and rice this week, as the pay and rice would be given only after they finished working at the end of June when the fishing season ended. After arguing for a while, both sides were furious. [passage omitted] The boss then drew an AK rifle from his table and shot at the workers, killing two and wounding five others. The dead and wounded fell down from the brick house. The boss continued firing at the workers, who fled unhurt. At 2100 on 26 May, while the Vietnamese men and women were drinking and watching television under the bright electric light, every brick house and sampan were burning. [passage omitted] Suddenly, the fire blazed up brightly. Next morning, eyewitnesses said that 30 Vietnamese men and women were killed and 60 brick houses and 27 sampans were burned. [passage omitted] Who killed these Vietnamese? Who set fire to this floating Vietnamese city? What devices were used? Was it a bomb, a resin torch, or turpentine? Some said everything, even fuel oil, could be found in (Kbal Tao). [passage omitted]
