After the Security Council meeting he held a brief news conference, where he stated, in particular: "The Georgian side came to the Security Council session with good ideas. It was very important for us to know to what degree the point of view of the Georgian leadership on the conflict in Abkhazia coincides with that held by the Security Council members. I would like to note with satisfaction that our views and those of the Security Council members coincide on most of the fundamental issues; our views coincide on issues relating to Georgia's territorial integrity and the creation of safe conditions for the return of refugees and for the stationing of peacekeeping forces in the region." Touching on further UN measures regarding the Abkhazian conflict, Shevardnadze said: "After studying the situation the UN secretary general will deliver a report to the Security Council; this will take place on 21 March. On the basis of this report the Security Council will adopt a decision on sending peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia." Shevardnadze reported that in the course of the Georgian-Abkhazian talks held at the UN headquarters work on documents has not been yet concluded. "Work on them will be continued in Geneva later," he said. He stated that the Geneva talks should be resumed before 20 March. An ITAR-TASS correspondent asked whether a plan for stationing peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia was discussed at his meeting with President Clinton. "The issue relating to the need to send peacekeeping forces was discussed with President Clinton in principle, and in this respect we reached good understanding," E. Shevardnadze answered. Asked whether it would suit Georgia if Russian troops were part of the peacemaking forces, E. Shevardnadze said: "Absolutely, with the participation of Russian troops and those of other countries. As to what other countries will be taking part, it is not of any fundamental importance to us." On the issue of the proportion of Russia's participation in operations, he stressed: "Everything will be decided at the Security Council sitting. It is not a very significant issue for us. What is important for us is that this operation is taking place under the aegis of the United Nations."
