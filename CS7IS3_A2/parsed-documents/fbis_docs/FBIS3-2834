Concern was expressed at yesterday's meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC) after a faxed appeal from the Hong Kong Journalists' Association. The letter highlighted the lack of transparency surrounding the case and criticised the delay in the hearing. It cited China's Criminal Prosecution Law which stated that all criminal cases should be brought to the court within 1 1/2 months of the arrest. Xi, a reporter for Ming Pao, was arrested by public security officers last September in Beijing. The authority later accused him of stealing state information. Officials from the judiciary have refused to reveal details of his case, saying it is being processed. Outspoken lawyer Liu Yiu-chu queried why Xi had been barred from meeting relatives, colleagues and even his lawyer. "He should be punished through an open trial," she said.
