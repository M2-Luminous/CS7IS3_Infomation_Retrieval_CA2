After three hours of talks in Pretoria, they said in a joint communique the possibilities for this included constitutional options and multiparty agreements. Other issues of a more general nature would be discussed at multiparty negotiations that have been arranged for this week, Mr De Klerk said. The communique said the king had expressed his concern at the lack of recognition for the position of the Zulu monarchy and kwaZulu in the transitional constitution. Mr De Klerk had assured the king of his high consideration for the king, the Zulu monarchy and the Kingdom of kwaZulu, and pointed out that adequate provision could be made for the entrenchment of these institutions in the envisaged provincial constitution. "He (Mr De Klerk) committed himself to support these institutions as strongly as he could," the joint statement said. Mr De Klerk said he regretted the incidents of violence which surrounded the Zulu supporters' trek to Pretoria on Monday. He sincerely hoped the guilty would be brought to book. Political differences should be resolved democratically and not through force, he said. Police estimated 35,000 Zulu supporters went to the Union Buildings in support of their king. Mr De Klerk said he and his ministers had also consulted the Zulu delegation, which included Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, on the framework for ending East Rand violence. Mr Buthelezi would reply to the proposals on Tuesday. Mr Buthelezi said he also regretted the incidents of violence but the gathering at the Union Buildings had been voluntary and the IFP had had nothing to do with the event. The IFP opposed stayaways and it was not its policy to intimidate people. On the participation of the Zulu people in the elections, King Zwelithini said that depended on how the issues discussed on Monday were handled. Mr Buthelezi added that the stance of his party was reflected by the Freedom Alliance's position. Mr De Klerk said the government was not totally opposed to the double-ballot system, a major concern of the Zulu delegation. The issue would be discussed at multiparty talks this week. The bilateral discussions with the Zulu kingdom would necessarily have to be broadened to multilateral discussions if they were to be fruitful, but that would not necessarily affect the January 24 Freedom Alliance talks deadline, said Mr De Klerk. However, the position of kwaZulu and the king had to be addressed with a great sense of urgency and well before the election. Negotiations on outstanding points had become crucial and the government would approach them with a sense of urgency. Government was committed to "try to really find solutions on a multiparty basis which can ensure the inclusion of all significant parties in the electoral process", Mr De Klerk said.
