[Correspondent Murtazin] To judge by all events, for the first time in the six years of the Karabakh conflict, today the warring sides have reached a final accord on a ceasefire. This is to take place at midnight on 16-17 May. Pavel Grachev has taken the process of disengaging the troops into his own hands. Journalists were invited to the meeting, which probably witnesses to the fact that all fundamental issues had already been settled. The main thing is a total ceasefire along the entire frontline. According to the Russian minister's plan, by 25 May the warring sides should be withdrawn to a distance of between 5 and 15 kms from the contact lines. The security zones thus created will be occupied by Russia's peacekeeping forces under the command of First Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev. Issues relating to the withdrawal of troops from the territory of Azerbaijan will be resolved not by the military, but by politicians: it is they who will determine the staus of Nagorno-Karabakh.
