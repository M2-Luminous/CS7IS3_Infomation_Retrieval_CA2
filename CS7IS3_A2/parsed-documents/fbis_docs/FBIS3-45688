With the issuance of a joint statement by the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee yesterday, a new framework for closer trade and economic contacts between the two countries was set up. This was a successful attempt to handle matters concerning the economic interests of both countries in the spirit of "seeking common ground while reserving differences." The joint statement pointed out: The financial ministers of both countries agree that the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee will meet every year in the two countries by rotation. Meetings of the committee have been suspended for seven years. Now with the establishment of a new cooperative mechanism under which the committee will meet once a year, cooperation between the two countries in the industrial, agricultural, scientific and technological, financial, and trade fields will surely be vigorously promoted. China is now going all out to promote market-oriented economic reform and trying to dovetail its economy into the world economy. This is not only a good thing for China but also a good thing for the world. The United States clearly expressed its stand of "firmly supporting China to restore its position as a signatory state to GATT." If China's position as a signatory state to GATT is restored, all countries will be able to open up commodity, financial, and service markets in China, and Western countries, which are striving hard for economic prosperity, will be greatly benefited. That is why the United States is firmly supporting restoration of China's position as a signatory state to GATT. More than that, Lloyd Bentsen gave the following message to China on behalf of President Clinton: "The United States supports a stable, prosperous, and modernized China." The United States has not only spoken favorably of China's policy decisions on reform of its monetary and financial, tax, and foreign exchange systems, but also expressed willingness to provide technological aid for these reforms. To help China carry out reform of its monetary system, the United States is willing to provide China with professional knowledge and practical experience. For this reason, Chairman Greenspan of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will also visit China later this year. The United States always carries out macroeconomic regulation and control, regulates the exchange rates of the dollar, and readjusts relations between the issuance of banknotes and its internal and external economic and trade activities by means of the interest rate and other means such as issuing bonds and bills and directly interfering in the exchange market. Undoubtedly, these are all experiences for China to study. Of course, the United States has its own interests. The more mature China's market system is, the more opportunities there will be for U.S. investment in China. Moreover, establishment of close, friendly, and cooperative relations with China is also good for the United States in opening up and occupying the Chinese market. That is why the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will follow the treasury secretary and come to visit China. Apart from cabinet members, some sub-cabinet work groups will also be engaged in handling three major items, namely, "currency and banks," exchange rates, and investment and economic cooperation. The three subministerial work groups will meet once every six months. Between the meetings, there will be some special technological officials to take charge of coordination matters and provide aid so that the work groups can make achievements as soon as possible. The third item, "investment and economic cooperation," is particularly eye-catching. In the next five years, China will import $700 billion worth of equipment. All countries are vying with one another for these contracts, which will be carried over to the next century. By establishing a work-group-level permanent channel and promoting economic cooperation with China, the United States has taken an early step into the Chinese market and gained an advantage of being in a favored position. Following the United States, there will be another "China craze" in the Western countries. Japan and west European countries will come one after another to take "China--an economic express train." This is because if one does not get a seat at the crucial moment and lets the market be occupied by others, one will find it very difficult to enter the market in the future and will always be at a disadvantage in competition. Trade between China and the United States is still being obstructed by some outdated laws. The United States should relax restrictions on exports of certain scientific and technological products to China and on China trade. The dispute over China's MFN status every year also seriously hinders development of Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations. Therefore, at a press conference, Lloyd Bentsen pointed out that China and the United States should first resolve the MFN issue. This is a change in policy for looking ahead. Provided China and the United States observe guidelines of the communique on establishing diplomatic relations and do not interfere in each other's internal affairs, all issues can be resolved through consultations. China is now adopting an open and pragmatic attitude. It is hoped that the U.S. side will also do more solid work and break away from quibbling over certain issues to vigorously make a new step forward.
