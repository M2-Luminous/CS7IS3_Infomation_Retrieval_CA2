This statement was made yesterday by Hans Van den Broek, European Commission member for external political relations, in an interview granted to MLADA FRONTA DNES following a symposium organized by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and the Bohemia Foundation. He added that the basic requirements for admission consist of stability in the institutions guaranteeing democracy, the existence of a law-governed state, the observation of human rights, protection for minorities, and the ability to come to terms with the competitive pressures of the market within the Union. The candidate must also identify with the aims of the Union. "We will no longer place new requirements on the candidates from your region because you would consider this to be an obstacle. And perhaps this would also bolster certain nationalist and sectarian tendencies. Moreover, there is also another side to the coin--the Union's further enlargement depends on our ability to absorb new members at the appropriate moment," said Van den Broek. [Vesely] How do you perceive the obligation to identify with the aims of the European Union? [Van den Broek] Each country that wants to become a member will be invited to sign a whole set of regulations, laws, and obligations, including the Maastricht Treaty. This defines the future of Europe. We also want to develop new spheres of cooperation here. Among other things, we intend to establish a monetary union and formulate common security and foreign policy. Later, we should move on from coordinating defense policy to a real common defense. [Vesely] Of course, it may transpire that a specific country will not want to commit itself so heavily. [Van den Broek] If someone were to tell us that he has difficulty in fulfilling this or that aspect and, therefore, that, at the moment, he is only interested in the economic or trade aspect, or, as the case may be, that he has not yet sufficiently adapted his laws to those valid in the European Union, then I believe it would be possible to reach an agreement with him on conditional admission. A transitional period would be determined, during which the issue would be resolved. However, in no way would it be acceptable to us if a candidate were not to adopt as his own the fundamental principles on which the European Union is based. And it will not be at all possible for him to refuse to share our final political aims, aims derived from everything that has already been achieved. [Vesely] What do you think of the suggestions to establish a kind of intermediate stage that would bridge the period between association and full membership? [Van den Broek] Our immediate aim is to put into practice everything on which we have already reached agreement. We will certainly still have a great deal of work with this, especially in intensifying the political dialogue. The European Union, therefore, has proposed, for example, that a meeting be held annually involving the heads of government, foreign ministers, and, as the case may be, the policy directors of ministries. We want to have joint working groups to deal with specific foreign and security policy issues. Here, we are distinctly aware of the common interest of the Czech Republic and the other Central and East European countries, on the one hand, and the European Union, on the other.
