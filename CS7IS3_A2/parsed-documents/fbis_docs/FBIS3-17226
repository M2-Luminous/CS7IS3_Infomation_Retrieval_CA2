The talks were broken in December, 1993 when SOCAR rejected the draft of the agreement prepared by Manafov's group of independent experts. The same month the Consortium rejected the variant of the draft of SOCAR due to unfavourable conditions. The Western companies were surprised that Azerbaijan rejected Manafov's draft since he is official representative of Azeri government. On February 4 President Aliyev ordered SOCAR to work out a new variant. Last week President of Russian Oil Company Lukoil, Vahid Alekperov, signed the agreement in Baku. Under the agreement his Company will get the share of 10 per cent. Lukoil will get one third of Azeri oil which amounts to 80 per cent of the whole extracted oil. As is known, total reserves of oil in Chirag and Azeri fields amount to 450 million tons. According to experts, since world prices for oil decreased, the consortium will try to achieve advantageous conditions in the contract. Western companies intend to change the world price for oil which presently totals $18 for 1 barrel. In the nearest future Azerbaijan will have to pay a great volume of oil for Western investments. It means that the share of the Consortium will change from 20 to 23 per cent and the share of Azerbaijan in the contract will decrease.
