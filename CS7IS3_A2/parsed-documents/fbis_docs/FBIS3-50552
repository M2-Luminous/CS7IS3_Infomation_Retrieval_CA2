Maria Vera, a former Procup member imprisoned since 1990, said in statements published by the newspaper EL FINANCIERO today, Monday, that Procup backs the EZLN armed movement although it has no relations with them. "The EZLN has our acceptance and moral support. We are sure other armed groups will salute, in their own way, the struggle of the companions in Chiapas," she stated. The government's only option is a political one. The situation will become very critical if it represses the EZLN and the people of Chiapas, she added. In her opinion, the government is interested in presenting an image of a country with social and political stability due to the start up of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This is the only explanation for the government's willingness to negotiate with the rebels, Vera added. She believes the EZLN's appearance is one of the most important events for the armed struggle in Mexico, and she warned that the confrontations in Chiapas could generate similar actions in other parts of the country. "This is due to the fact that there are large sectors of the population that live under conditions of extreme poverty similar to those in Chiapas," the former guerrilla said. It will be very difficult, she said, for the government to choose an increase in "its low-intensity war against the people and to annihilate the Zapatist army, as such actions would have a high political cost." Vera revealed that she had heard reports on the formation of a guerrilla movement--although it had not proclaimed itself as the EZLN--in the Chiapas region for several years. She said that the clashes in Chiapas could prompt rebel movements to arise in Mexico; events have shown that the EZLN has an authentic belligerent character in the country. Procup has its roots in the guerrilla movements that developed in the southern State of Guerrero during the 1970's. The group was allegedly headed by former Oaxaca University Director Felipe Martinez Soriano, who is imprisoned for his responsibility in the attack against the Mexican newspaper LA JORNADA, in which two guards lost their lives, in April 1990.
