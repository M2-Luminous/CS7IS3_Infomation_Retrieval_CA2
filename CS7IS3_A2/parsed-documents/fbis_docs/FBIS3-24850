[passage omitted] I would like to indicate another point and, in reality, tell you about my own belief and then say several sentences on the general deputization [niyabat-e 'ammeh -- reference to eminent Shiite religious scholars guiding the ummah on behalf of the disappeared imam] I say that the imam of the age, may God hasten his advent, who has the responsibility for managing the Shiites -- or the Islamic ummah -- is, we say, our 12th Imam. He is alive, observant and present. He awaits and is waited for. He will spread justice throughout the world by his presence. Perhaps it should be said that the Islamic ummah is managed through his imamate. Taking into cosideration our Islamic knowledge, it must be said that the lives of human beings are connected with the existence of the imam. Speaking more carefully on this matter, it must be said that the existence of the totality of life [jahan-e hasti] is connected with the existence of the imam. [passage omitted] Regarding the type of guidance and leadership under the conditions of absence [the time during which the 12th imam has absented himself], for example in our time, we think that if the imam of the age observes that a problem is going to emerge so that the foundations of shar'iah -- and under our conditions, the foundations of sovereignty -- are threatened he will give guidance by any reasoning possible and in any way possible. He will correct the mistake. He will guide so that the danger does not come about for the Shiites or the Islamic ummah. At the beginning of the great absence we came across a problem when a jurisconsult would issue a fatwa [religious edict]. Then it would become clear that he has made a mistake and the imam of the age would eliminate the mistake even before the jurisconsult realized. And then when he did realize he would inform him that you do your work; you issue your fatwa; you perform your duty and we will perform ours. That is why I tell you that, especially in crucial issues, if it comes to a point where decisionmaking or action requires guidance and the person who actually has the responsibility for the ummah has a problem in making a decision or it is difficult for him or there is a possibility of making a mistake, then the imam [of the age] must come to his aid. We believe that during the Islamic revolution in Iran the leader of the revolution, the departed imam [Khomeyni], may God Almighty be satisfied with him, made use of such guidance time and again; especially in crucial and dangerous issues where decisionmaking is most difficult. I noted in another session that all of the imam's friends -- even the members of the Revolution Council who had been appointed by the imam -- wrote to him saying that conditions are not right; do not come to Iran. The conditions are severe and that is not possible. It is not possible to foresee what will happen. He replied forthrightly: I will definitely come and if I am to be killed, I should be killed among my own people. And when he set foot on the Iranian soil and when his face was first sighted from the plane -- take careful note of that; I note some meticulous observers have been most careful [in this] -- a very deep tranquillity could be sensed in the imam. Those who are acquainted with psychological matters can read a person's mind from his face. With utmost calm as if there was no problem. As if he saw that with his coming the victory of the revolution was final and there would be no problems either. [passage omitted] In my view and in my belief this issue [Khomeyni's decision to come to Iran] is a sign of the so-called divine guidance [ershadat-e gheybi] by the imam of the age, God's peace be on him, to aid and guide his deputy -- the person who has taken on the responsibility -- to the extent that he himself [the imam of the age] manages affairs according to principles and there will not be any problems. If there is to be an issue that will be to the detriment of the umma, his imamate requires that he does not abandon his ummah and guides his deputy. [passage omitted] His imamate requires that in the vital issues concerning the ummah the deputy must be guided even if it means somehow to take over his heart, his thoughts, and his brain. The absence does not mean severance; that he has sat in a corner and the jurisconsults administer. That is not so. Those jurisconsults who take the responsibility of managing are under special conditions where they must, so to speak, have that privilege. I have very little time. Nevertheless there are several issues that I must tell you, so I'll try to be very concise. Let me say something in this same regard. During the absence [of the imam of the age] grand jurisconsults became the imam's general deputy and manage the ummah. The deputization was given by title; that is the title of jurisconsult. And at any time the titles are many and can be many. There are jurisconsults. In our time there are many jurisconsults and those titles and conditions are true in their case. In al-Najaf, in Qom, in Mashhad, in various cities where Shiites are present. [passage omitted on history of imamate] Eventually, thanks be to God, all those skirmishes and confrontations by jurisconsults and deputies of the 12th Imam with the governments came to fruition in our time with the hands of the departed imam [Khomeyni] and in reality a government in the name of the Islamic Republic of Iran was founded in the name of the imam [of the age]]. [passage omitted] When the Islamic government was founded it meant that during more than 1,000 years of confrontation with rulers infidelity vanished and Islam came. It was not like a dynasty vanishing and another dynasty appearing. That is most important. [passage omitted] The Islamic Republic of Iran means infidelity vanished in the government and Islam replaced it. The jurisconsult who has the responsibility of sovereignty of Islam is a theologian, a deputy of the imam [of the age] and acts according to Islam and must observe all the Islamic conditions. He himself is subject to Islamic laws and regulations. It is Islam that rules, not the individual. Under such circumstances I have a question: If during 1,000 years our jurisconsults, our religious scholars throughout the Islamic cities used to answer the people's religious problems, used to receive the religious tax and spent it on religious matters, act in areas that they were allowed to act and would say they had no duty in the areas were they could not act, and the tyrant rulers used to act at the time of the sovereignty of Islam, a jurisconsult somewhere cannot set himself up as a judge. [as received] He cannot say that there is a judicial system in the Islamic Republic and someone has been appointed as its head by the leader and they are administering the judicial system, but I am a religious scholar and wish to set up a judicial system in Shiraz [capital of Fars Province]; I can get involved in matters of jihad and war and peace; get involved in collecting tax. My insistence that the conditions before and after the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran have changed and differ is for this point. If today grand jurisconsults are sources of emulation and issue fatwas, nothing is wrong with that. Let them issue fatwas: A particular prayer must be said once or three times. That is not crucial, let them issue fatwas. What is wrong with that? [passage omitted] But if under the conditions of sovereignty of Islam a jurisconsult -- for example in a corner of say this Islamic state of Iran -- should say, after the leadership has announced that there should not be any ties with such and such country, that: he is a jurisconsult and I am a jurisconsult. He is talking nonsense when he says there should be no ties! I say there should be! The leadership says war must be waged. He says: no it should not. The leadership says the government can set a tax. The jurisconsult says no it cannot. [passage omitted] What will be the result? Will not the result be for Islam to vanish and infidelity to come and rule once again? The question is one of government, and not one of nongovernmental issue. The multiplicity of sources of emulation and grand jurisconsults poses no problems for the community. During the life of the imam [Khomeyni], also, there were many jurisconsults. Not only did none of them interfere in government affairs, but they gave support to the government. They used to say that whatever the imam says we accept. They either did not interfere in government affairs, or they offered support. [passage omitted] I say that the multiplicity of grand jurisconsults for sources of emulation is no problem. But multiple sources of emulation who seek to somehow confront the leadership, interfere in government affairs, involve their fatwas in government affairs and undermine the government means once again separating politics from religion and a return to some people issuing fatwas somewhere and the people acting on their fatwas while others are ruling somewhere else according to worldy matters. All the 1,000-year troubles of the great religious scholars and grand jurisconsults which came to fruition by the hands of the departed imam will be destroyed again. I say this must be carefully looked into. That is why I say that those jurisconsults who are presented as sources of emulation must be aware of the times. They must respond to the realities existing in the community. They must recognize the friends and foes of the Islamic ummah. They must distinguish the plots that the enemies of Islam hatch for Islam and the Muslims. That is why the departed imam easily and frankly said says that if a jurisconsult does not know the issues of the time and is incapable of distinguishing them in his view he fails to be a jurisconsult. [passage omitted] That is why when I claim that a lofty jurisconsult, an exalted jurisconsult, an administering and adroit jurisconsult, a jurisconsult who is aware of today's world of Islam and has adequate and complete experience, that is, the exalted leader, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, is at the very least, of the same rank as others who are being considered. Of course this debate belongs to follow the Grand Ayatollah Araki [chosen to replace Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani as a source of emulation], may God Almighty preserve him. When I make a claim, this is the point I base my claim on. That is, the issue must be judged in its totality. [passage omitted]
