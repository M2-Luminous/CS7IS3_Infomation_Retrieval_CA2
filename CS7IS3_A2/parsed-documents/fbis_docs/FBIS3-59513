Billerbeck: "Japanese Company Does Research in Oxford; Part of European Research Landscape"] [Text] Oxford, VDI-N, 17 Sep--Japanese firms see in the countries of Europe not only lucrative sales markets; they are also interested in the ideas of local researchers and developers. Technologies for future products are by no means being developed only in Japan. An example of this is Sharp Laboratories Europe (SLE) in the English university town of Oxford. Clive C. Bradley, the managing director of SLE in Oxford, came right to the point: "Why does a company like Sharp invest in research facilities abroad?" In his answer to the question he cited several arguments for such a commitment. For one thing, a technology company with international commitments cannot afford to do without the productive influences of another scientific culture, the creativity of researchers who have other ways of looking at things. And for another, research on the spot also supports integration into the respective markets. "Moreover," Bradley went on, "we in Europe have easier access to what goes on here in colleges and universities. And, naturally, we also want to avoid friction in international trade and to improve our image." Under no circumstances do the approximately 50 SLE employees feel that they are an appendage to a central laboratory in Japan. They have their own research areas in which each of them wants to occupy a technologically leading position. They are working on four main areas in Oxford: optoelectronics, image processing, information technology -- especially in the fields of translation systems and disseminated artificial intelligence -- and liquid crystal technology. The laboratory was founded in 1990 and was initially housed in rented rooms. Then about 13 million pounds were invested until 1992 in the construction and furnishing of its own building, which is located in a technology park near Oxford. It is anticipated that about 100 scientists and engineers will be working here in the finally expanded building. Sharp employs a total of 6,500 people worldwide in research and development. Its investments in R & D amount to about 660 million pounds a year. All SLE research projects are coordinated with Sharp's central research and development, but are then developed in Europe. The patents that are produced by the projects are also first applied for in Europe or England. Bradley: "We think of ourselves as part of the European research landscape and want to be accepted as such. Our goal is broad collaboration with other research facilities -- in so doing, we're trying to be as open as we can." Of course, there are already cooperative ventures with British universities -- first of all with those in Oxford -- but universities on the European continent are also on Bradley's wishlist: "We also participate in various European research programs." The open admission that they are moving toward becoming a European research facility is also expressed in the company's personnel policy. The majority of its employees come from Europe, some from the United States, and some from Japan. Occupied by a European, the post of managing director is also part of this policy. He admits that European engineers have to in part be paid higher salaries than for comparable positions in Japan. But this is compensated for by the already mentioned advantages. SLE research projects are conducted in large part in the field of basic research. Dr. Robert G.W. Brown, the head of the optoelectronics department: "We're working on, for example, semiconductor nanostructures to be able to produce new kinds of laser diodes with a broad color spectrum. Another team is working with optical neuron networks. These make possible completely new approaches to image processing since they process optical data optically." In his opinion, the work they have been doing on blue and ultraviolet lasers for optical storage and printing systems has almost reached the production stage. In the image processing sector in Oxford they are in particular working on a new technique for the three-dimensional electronic representation of images. The new method gets by without any additional aids -- stereo eyeglasses, for example -- and works like 3-D printing, with which we have been long familiar. Another project is the development of a high-quality, high-resolution color printing process. Bradley cited a computer-supported translation system as a typical example of a development project that is oriented toward European market requirements. It should be capable of automatically translating texts from one European language into another. In the process the programmers have had to solve serious problems inherent in the different structures of the individual languages. However, a demonstration of the system produced no distortion of meaning, not even after a sentence was translated from English into German, then into French, and back into English. Research projects in the field of liquid crystals constitute the fourth pillar in Oxford. For the present they are being used in a big way in display units for portable computers. The Oxford developers are working here especially with so-called ferroelectric LCs, which permit substantially higher switching speeds as compared with conventional materials. SLE is one example of the Sharp Company's European commitment, but not the only one by far. Kenjiro Tsugawa, the head of the information systems department, alluded proudly to the 25th anniversary of the head office in Hamburg, which is to be celebrated this year. Worldwide, the company has 64,000 employees and it had a sales volume of about DM19 billion in 1992. Tsugawa: "We were able to triple our sales volume in Europe in the past 10 years. Even in the difficult financial year, 1992-1993, we were able to attain a sales volume of DM1.2 billion." Unlike other firms, they are determined to further increase their investments in buildings and equipment as well as their expenditures for research development since "these are investments in our future."
