Mr. Mikhailidhis will hold talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel and other members of the government. The main topics of the talks will be the latest developments in the Cyprus issue and Cyprus' application for accession to the European Union. Mr. Mikhailidhis will also meet with former German foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. In a statement at Larnaca Airport, Mr. Mikhailidhis referred to the first phase of the proximity talks, saying that we cannot say that any progress has been made. He added: Consequently, we did not move at all. However, Mr. Mikhailidhis noted that it is premature to say that we have been reached a deadlock. He added: We should give every chance to the UN Secretary General's representatives to hold meetings with their contacts. The next meetings will be very critical, he said, and it will become obvious from the beginning whether there are any prospects or not. Mr. Mikhailidhis further noted: We want to cooperate in implementing the [confidence-building] measures but we do not want to enter a useless and endless dialogue, and that is what will happen if we leave critical issues pending. Responding to a question on whether the United Nations will submit new ideas in the next phase of the talks, Mr. Mikhailidhis said: As is natural, after experiencing two meetings at which there was substantive disagreement on the critical issues, the UN Secretary General's representatives will seek ways to put the entire process in motion and it is possible that they will proceed with recommendations and advice addressing these issues.
