Mr. Kriel insisted, however, that the documents were not secret, but were party political papers and personal documents. But a source close to the department claimed that officials shredded documents which showed that the SAP [South African Police] favoured the NP [National Party] over the ANC. The source said so much paper had to be destroyed ahead of elections that the ministry's own paper shedders could not cope.
