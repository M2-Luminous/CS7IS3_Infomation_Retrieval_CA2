The general indicated the Haitian died from a bullet wound in the thigh when he was struggling with a soldier. This is the first violent death of a Haitian since the UN Security Council declared a total embargo against Haiti two weeks ago. According to Gen. Luna Paulino, the incident occurred when a soldier tried to stop a group of Haitians who were returning to their country with a few liters of fuel. "The quickest were able to escape, but the soldier was able to stop one of them, with whom he began to struggle. The other Haitians then returned and in the scuffle to seize the weapon, the weapon was fired, wounding a Haitian in the thigh," the general said. "Considering that the weapon was a military weapon, it was too late when the ambulance arrived, even though first aid was provided," he added. Gen. Luna Paulino also confirmed that some soldiers deployed on the border have been attacked, although he did not specify how many. "It seems the embargo is very hard for the Haitians and they now cross the border not only in search of fuel but also to take anything, a pitcher of water, ice...," he explained.
