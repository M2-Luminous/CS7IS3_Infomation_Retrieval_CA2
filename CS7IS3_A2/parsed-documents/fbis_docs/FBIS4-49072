FBIS4-49072 "drchi085_k_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political & Social Triads, Clans Supplant Communist Party in Rural Areas Triads, Clans Supplant Communist Party in Rural Areas HK0305112494 Hong Kong AFP in English 1104 GMT 3 May 94 HK0305112494 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] Beijing, May 3 (AFP) -- Crime has become so rampant in the Chinese countryside that in some places clans and triads are now more powerful than the communist party, the LEGAL DAILY [FAZHI RIBAO] warned Tuesday. The lawlessness means Beijing is having more and more trouble controlling the social, economic and political situation outside the big cities, it said. "All types of criminality and delinquency are increasing in the country," the newspaper reported, adding that in certain villages "clans and triad-type organisations have supplanted the communist party." Triads -- secretive groups with extensive involvement in organised crime activities -- have long been banned in China but have reportedly been making a comeback. It said clans, which have deep roots in China because of the cultural importance given to lineage and family ties, have also gotten out of hand, often seizing control of land, water, roads and crops. Faced with this explosive situation, "party organisations are sometimes in a state of paralysis," the newspaper complained, calling for an increase in the number of police. The Legal Daily said the fault lay with local leaders but also with a general population obsessed with getting rich at any cost, and had led many individuals and even villages to decide to settle scores with rivals. Last year, police listed 600 such battles between villages that had left 100 peasants dead and another 2,000 wounded. Making a resurgence in the countryside along with traditional local hatreds was what the LEGAL DAILY described as reactionary behaviour, notably prostitution and the sale of women and children. If many peasants find themselves richer as a result of the economic reforms which led to the dismantling of the commune system set up by Mao Zedong, tens of millions are worse off and find themselves living in harsh conditions. More than 100 million people in the countryside are now considered surplus labour. Disturbances in several provinces broke out last year, provoked by rural discontent over rising prices and taxes and the corruption of local officials, and officials have expressed fear the trouble will be repeated this year.
