Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: Sakuma, a professional SDF officer, let out the bellicose blast as soon as he took office as an advisor to the SDF. This is a very ill-boding act. This indicates that the Japanese military quarters, having built up strength for turning Japan into a military power, are now going to embark upon the road of reinvasion, exerting a direct influence even on the state power. His utterances show how frenziedly the war-thirsty military quarters are trying to proceed overseas by destroying the domestic device of legal control. Sakuma disclosed the scheme to create a legal condition for a war of aggression when he rattled on "revision of the SDF law" and "study and enactment of a law on the case of emergency." Should the arbitrariness of the military be allowed and given greater scope in Japan with a record of aggression behind her, it will, no doubt, follow in the footsteps of the Japanese imperialists. Korea is the first target of reinvasion of the Japanese reactionaries. Sakuma's claim that Japan, together with South Korea, "is a party concerned in a possible Korean war" cannot be construed otherwise than an outcry of Japan threatening a war in Korea. The war-hungry military quarters of Japan should ponder over the matter, not making a mistake as regards the DPRK.
