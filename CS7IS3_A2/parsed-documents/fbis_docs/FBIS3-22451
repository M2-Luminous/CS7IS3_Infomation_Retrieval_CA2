The plans were strongly criticised by the Government's chief safety adviser last year. Mr. Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, who has indicated that he wanted to see privatisation before the next election, has been pressing for what some officials call a "short and dirty" review. This would focus narrowly on the potential commercial viability of privatised Pressurised Water Reactors and would report by the summer. But Mr. John Gummer, Environment Secretary, is adamant that the review should cover both long-term liabilities from decommissioning nuclear plants -- costing an estimated 20 billion pounds -- and plans for disposing of nuclear power waste. A remit for the waste review, to be carried out by the Department of the Environment, has been long delayed but is now expected within weeks. The review would be expected to take until the end of the year. Yet some industry observers say Mr. Heseltine must take a decision this summer on the sell-off of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear if privatisation is to happen before the next election. It was uncertainty about the scale of long-term liabilities that led to the nuclear industry being dropped from privatisation in 1989. The waste review is likely to focus on plans of the nuclear waste agency, Nirex, for a 3 billion pound national nuclear waste dump at Sellafield -- and how realistic these are. These plans have slipped from around 2003 to after 2010 while waste continues to mount at Magnox power stations. The review is also likely to look at costs and strategies for decommissioning nuclear power stations, many of them closing in the next 10 years. This alone will cost up to 10 billion pounds. Other liabilities, including disposing of Atomic Energy Authority sites and British Nuclear Fuels, bring the total closer to 20 billion pounds. Final disposal of waste, which environmentalists say has never been properly planned, is expected to cost more than that but has never been fully costed. The recent approval given for the British Nuclear Fuels Thorp plant will probably mean that a lot of extra waste is likely to be generated, with nowhere for it to go. Last autumn Prof. John Horlock, departing chairman of the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations, criticised the quantities of waste piling up at power stations and nuclear stores. He called on the Government to ensure that the Nirex waste repository proposed for Sellafield came into operation earlier than 2010. It is not known if the review will cover reprocessing or dry storage. If it were to do so, it would be a new blow to British Nuclear Fuels which has just won a 16-year battle to open its Thorp reprocessing plant: dry storage is seen by many as a cheaper option than reprocessing. Nuclear analysts reacted without surprise to the news of a nuclear waste review. Mr. Gordon MacKerron, senior fellow at the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University, said: "There is a clear public perception that our nuclear waste disposal policy is in a complete mess." "Nuclear Electric will want the Government to clear up all the historic liabilities because it is clear that the City does not want to take them on." A spokesman for Nuclear Electric disputed whether a waste review would mean delay for privatisation.
