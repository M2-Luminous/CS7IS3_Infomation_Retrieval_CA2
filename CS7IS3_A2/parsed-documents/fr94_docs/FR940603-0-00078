FR940603-0-00078 FR940603-0-00028 The Board did not adopt five proposals requesting relief on method and means restrictions. Of the five proposals, four were related to the use of designated hunters to harvest wildlife for others, especially the elderly or incapacitated. The Board recognized that the taking of resources by a few hunters in a community and the sharing of the harvest is a cultural tradition throughout Alaska. The Board in rejecting these proposals directed the staff to work with the Regional Councils to develop proposed regulations for the 1995&hyph;96 regulatory year that address the situation on a State-wide basis. One proposal requested liberalization of same day airborne trapping of wolves and other furbearers. Seven of the Regional Councils recommended rejection of this proposal because the use of airplanes to shoot furbearers does not constitute a customary and traditional use. Three Regional Councils supported the proposal. Following the recommendation supplied by seven Regional Councils, the Board rejected this proposal. Seven proposals to change existing seasons were rejected by the Board because approval of the action was not biologically justified or would unnecessarily restrict existing subsistence uses. All seven were either not acted upon by the respective Regional Council because of other pending proposals or were recommended for rejection. Two proposals to alter existing subsistence moose hunting regulations for Unit 1(B) were rejected by the Board. These proposals requested removing antler restrictions in the Stikine River area. The Regional Council recommended rejecting these proposals, and the Board followed the Regional Council's recommendation denying these proposals due to the declining moose population and concern regarding future harvest. The Board addressed a proposal to open a moose hunt in Unit 3, but found insufficient customary and traditional use information to warrant establishment of a moose season without going through a process for making a customary and traditional use determination. The Board addressed two proposals to modify the deer season in Unit 4. In addressing these proposals, the Board adopted another proposal supported by the Regional Council that better addressed the opportunity for both subsistence and non-subsistence hunters. Five proposals requesting establishment of seasons for caribou and moose on the Kenai Peninsula (Units 7 and 15) were deferred, as recommended by the relevant Regional Council, until customary and traditional uses of those species could be comprehensively evaluated. In the interim, the Board's past action prevents adoption of any new subsistence seasons on the Kenai Peninsula until the full review of customary and traditional uses is completed. One proposal was submitted to open Federal lands in Units 11 and 13 to nonsubsistence uses. The Regional Council recommended that the Board reject this proposal because of potential adverse impacts on a declining wolverine population. The Board agreed with the Regional Council and rejected the proposal. One proposal to close Federal lands to non-subsistence uses was considered as three separate proposals to allow a more detailed examination of each area requested for closure. All three were rejected: two were deferred at the request of the Regional Council to allow for more study, and the third was deferred because administrative changes may resolve perceived conflicts. In the third area, uses will also be closely monitored and will be reviewed during the next regulatory cycle. Three proposals dealt with the reestablishment of a special Lime Village Management Area, a revision in the harvest system from a community to an individual system, and the establishment of a State permit system. After considerable deliberation, with the support of the Lime Village community and Regional Council, and with acceptance of ADF&G, the Board rejected all three, retaining the present subsistence regulations for the area and emphasizing a community harvest reporting system. Two proposals dealing with moose in Unit 19(A) and 21(E) were deferred until the next Board meeting because an adjacent, affected Regional Council had not had the opportunity to make recommendations on the proposals. Two proposals on Dall Sheep in Units 23 and 26, proposing boundary adjustments and horn curl restrictions, were rejected based on Regional Council recommendations that the additional curl restrictions would adversely impact subsistence uses. The boundary modifications were handled in another proposal. To assure the continued viability of the Chisana caribou herd, the Board rejected a proposal calling for a continued subsistence season on the herd. The Regional Council had recommended that the Board take such action. The Board rejected two proposals that were adequately addressed in other proposals. This was done in concurrence with Regional Council recommendations. One proposal raised the issue of the amount of land in a given area that is necessary to justify establishment of Federal subsistence regulations. Because there exists no established policy regarding the minimum acreage or Federal/State land ratios at which Federal authority should be exercised, the Board followed the Regional Council's advice and rejected this proposal.
