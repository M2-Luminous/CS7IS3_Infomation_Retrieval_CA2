FR941020-0-00037 FR941020-0-00011 32 CFR Part 706 Certifications and Exemptions Under the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972; Amendment AGENCY: Department of the Navy, DOD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined that USS TOLEDO (SSN 769) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with its special functions as a naval submarine. The intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS apply. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 9, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Commander K. P. McMahon, JAGC, U.S. Navy Admiralty Counsel, Office of the Judge Advocate General Navy Department, 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332&hyph;2400 Telephone number: (703) 325&hyph;9744 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR Part 706. This amendment provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy, has certified that USS TOLEDO (SSN 769) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully with 72 COLREGS: Rule 21(c), pertaining to the arc of visibility of the sternlight; Annex I, section 2(a)(i), pertaining to the height of the masthead light; Annex I, section 2(k), pertaining to the height and relative positions of the anchor lights; and Annex I, section 3(b), pertaining to the location of the sidelights. Full compliance with the above-mentioned 72 COLREGS provisions would interfere with the special functions and purposes of the vessel. The Judge Advocate General of the Navy has also certified that the aforementioned lights are located in closest possible compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements. Notice is also provided to the effect that USS TOLEDO (SSN 769) is a member of the SSN&hyph;688 class of vessels for which certain exemptions, pursuant to 72 COLREGS, Rule 38, have been previously authorized by the Secretary of the Navy. The exemptions pertaining to that class, found in the existing tables of section 706.3, are equally applicable to USS TOLEDO (SSN 769). Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR Parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based on technical findings that the placement of lights on this vessel in a manner differently from that prescribed herein will adversely affect the vessel's ability to perform its military functions.
