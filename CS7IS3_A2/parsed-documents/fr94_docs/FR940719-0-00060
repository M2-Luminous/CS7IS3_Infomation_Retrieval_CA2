FR940719-0-00060 FR940719-0-00019 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Administration for Children and Families 45 CFR Parts 205 and 233 RIN 0970&hyph;AB14 Aid to Families With Dependent Children Program; Certain Provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 AGENCY: Administration for Children and Families (ACF), HHS. ACTION: Final rules. SUMMARY: These final rules apply to State agencies administering the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program under Title IV&hyph;A of the Social Security Act. They implement three provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90), Public Law 101&hyph;508. The changes delete all references to income-deeming by legal guardians in minor parent cases; expand State agency responsibility for reporting, to an appropriate agency or official, known or suspected instances of child abuse and neglect of a child receiving AFDC; and add an explicit reference to title IV&hyph;E on the list of programs for which information about AFDC applicants and recipients may be made available. In addition, the reference to tile IV&hyph;C from 45 CFR 205.50(a)(1)(A) was deleted since the WIN program is no longer operative. The regulatory provisions contained in these final rules reflect a direct implementation of the statutory requirements and do not include any changes to the interim final rules previously published on September 22, 1993. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mack A. Storrs, Director, Division of AFDC Program, Office of Family Assistance, Fifth Floor, 370 L'Enfant Promenade SW., Washington, DC 20447, telephone (202) 401&hyph;9289. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 22, 1993, we published an interim final regulation (see 58 FR 49218&hyph;49220) to implement three provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended. Discussion of these provisions follow. Eliminating the Use of the Term ``Legal Guardian'' (Section 233.20 of the Final Rule) The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1981 added section 402(a)9(39) of the Social Security Act to acquire that, in determining AFDC benefits for a dependent child whose parent or legal guardian is under the age of 18, the State agency must include the income of the minor parent's own parents or legal guardians who are living in the same home. Section 5053 of Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90) amended section 402(a)(39) of the Social Security Act by eliminating the use of the term ``legal guardian.'' Section 402(a)(39) provides that in determining AFDC benefits for a dependent child whose parent is under the age of 18, the State agency must include the income of the minor parent's own parents who are living in the same home. We have amended Federal regulations at ยง233.20(a)(3)(xviii) to reflect this statutory change. As stated in the OBRA 90 conference report (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong. 2d Sess. (Oct. 1990) pp. 911&hyph;12), Congress recognized that legal guardianship is not relevant to eligibility determination. Even if a legal guardian were appointed, the child would not be eligible for AFDC unless living with a relative as defined in section 406 of the Social Security Act. Congress also recognized that the use of the term ``legal guardian'' with respect to the deeming of income is inappropriate in the context of the AFDC statute. Unlike the parent-child relationship, legal guardianship has not been a basis for attributing income to AFDC beneficiaries. An example given in the Conference report illustrates that there is the potential for unequal treatment under the AFDC program when legal guardianship is used as a source of attributed income in three-generation families. If a minor child is living with an aunt who is her legal guardian, the aunt's income is not automatically attributed to the AFDC beneficiary; however, if the minor has a child, the guardian's income is included in the AFDC determination for the minor and her child. (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong. 2d Sess. (Oct. 1990) p. 912). The OBRA amendment resolved these problems. Reporting of Child Abuse and Neglect (Sections 205.50 and 233.90 of the Final Rule) Prior to OBRA 90, section 402(a)(16) of the Social Security Act provided that, if the State agency has reason to believe that a child and a relative receiving aid are residing in an unsuitable home due to the neglect, abuse, or exploitation of the child, the State must take action. The State is required to report the situation with all the relevant information to the appropriate court or law enforcement agencies in the State. This statutory provision is currently reflected in the Federal regulations at ยง233.90(a)(2).
