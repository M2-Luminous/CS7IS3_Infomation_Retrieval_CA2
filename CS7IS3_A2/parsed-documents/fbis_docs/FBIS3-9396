FBIS3-9396 "dreeu057_d_94004" FBIS-EEU-94-057 Document Type:Daily Report 24 Mar 1994 SLOVAKIA Dailies View VSZ `Purges,' Sale of Stock AU2303133194 AU2303133194 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Slovak and Czech newspapers on 19 and 21 March publish a number of items dealing with the "political background" to recent "purges" in the management of the East Slovak Ironworks [VSZ], Slovakia's largest company, and the suspicious circumstances of the sale of a major package of VSZ shares by Vladimir Meciar's Cabinet shortly before it was dismissed on 14 March. According to a report in Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak on 14 March on page 5, VSZ is "the flagship of Slovak industry," which employs 27,000 people, exports 80 percent of its annual turnover of over $1 billion, and generates 25 percent of Slovakia's hard-currency earnings. Prague DENNI TELEGRAF in Czech on 21 March on page 5 carries a 1,000-word article by Peter Schutz, the newspaper's Kosice correspondent, entitled "Privatization in the Style of Vladimir Meciar: I Scratch Your Back, You Scratch Mine." The article deals with the decision made by the Slovak Government on 11 March at night, a few hours after the Slovak parliament passed the vote of no-confidence in Vladimir Meciar, to sell 1.5 million VSZ shares, 9.52 percent of the total, to "VSZ Manager Ltd.," a company established by the ironworks' recently installed new management. According to Schutz, the package has been sold for 200 Slovak korunas [Sk] per share, although the shares' nominal value is Sk1,000 and their market value (that is, the price at which they are currently being traded on the Bratislava Stock Exchange) Sk500. Commenting on the decision, Schutz says: "What is involved is a transparent and simple `I scratch your back, you scratch mine' system. VSZ Manager Ltd. was entered in the company register at a municipal district court in Kosice on Friday, 11 March--that is, on the day when the no-confidence vote in the government was passed. The decision on the transaction was made Friday night. The most interesting thing about the transaction is that participants in VSZ Manager Ltd., whose capital stock is Sk100,000, are five members of the VSZ Board of Directors, who had been installed in their posts by a decision of the National Property Fund [FNM] Supervisory Board at the end of December 1993. The FNM Supervisory Board was chaired at that time by Finance Minister Julius Toth." As Schutz goes on to say, while it was chaired by Julius Toth, the FNM Supervisory Board also convened an extraordinary general meeting of VSZ shareholders. This meeting, which was held on 17 March, elected Julius Toth to be chairman of the VSZ Supervisory Board. "But this is not all," Schutz says in conclusion: "The entire transaction was made possible by Banka Slovakia, whose capital is covered fully by FNM property, in the form of a credit extended to Priemyselna Banka [Industrial Bank] in Kosice. Priemyselna Banka promptly granted a loan to VSZ Manager Ltd. so that it could pay the first 15 percent installment. It will no longer come as a surprise that, on Thursday [17 March], Julius Toth was elected deputy chairman of the Priemyselna Banka Board of Directors." Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 19 March on page 1 carries a 600-word interview with Zsolt Komlosi, a member of the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] Privatization Committee, by Alena Gottweisova, entitled "The FNM Damaged Itself." In the interview, the place and date of which are not given, Komlosi discusses the circumstances of the sale of 9.53 percent of VSZ shares to five members of the VSZ top management. Komlosi confirms that the transaction was made possible by a loan provided by Banka Slovakia, whose financial resources come from the FNM, to Priemyselna Banka in Kosice, which, in turn, lent the money to the five members of the VSZ management. He also confirms that Priemyselna Banka "is linked to the former minister of finance." According to Komlosi, through this transaction, the FNM "caused itself damage of Sk1 billion," which is the difference between the price at which the VSZ shares were sold to the managers and the price they would fetch on the stock exchange. Komlosi also points out that the capital stock of VSZ Manager Ltd. represents only Sk100,000 (with each of the five partners contributing Sk20,000) and wonders "how a limited liability company that is accountable for sums up to Sk100,000 can realize in only five days a transaction through which it acquires Sk1 billion or property to this value." He announces that, on Tuesday, 22 March, the NRSR Privatization Committee "will start reexamining the documentation of privatization projects at the FNM." Bratislava SME in Slovak on 21 March on pages 1 and 2 carries a 1,300-word "eb"-signed report entitled "Purges in VSZ, but Not Only in VSZ, Had a Political Background." The report cites a statement issued by four former members of the VSZ Board of Directors--Zoltan Berghauer, Dionyz Kunder, Stanislav Polak, and Marian Sarissky--who were dismissed in December 1993. In the statement, the four managers explain their decision to lodge a complaint against what they regard as their "unlawful dismissal." The complaint was lodged with the Kosice Regional Court on 17 March. The four managers' statement is also the subject of a 1,000-word "er"-signed report entitled "What Was Going On Behind the Metallurgical Curtain," in Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 21 March on pages 1 and 2. In the first part of their statement, the four managers discuss the economic results achieved by the VSZ under their management. They point out that, even though the company set aside Sk800 million as a "strategic reserve" and Sk124 million as a "bad debt reserve" in 1993, it exceeded the projected pretax profit for that year by 26 percent. They note that the value of VSZ assets went up from Sk32 to Sk46.8 billion, that the price of VSZ shares increased by 240 percent, that the number of VSZ employees did not decline, despite the high average monthly wages of Sk9,500, and that a dividend was expected to be paid to shareholders. Therefore, they express their conviction that "the personnel purges" of December 1993 did not have economic motives but "a political background." The managers' statement goes on to say that, shortly after the Kosice mayoral elections in the fall of 1992, in which the candidate of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] did not win, "our former colleague Julius Toth, who was then minister of finance, conveyed to us the great dissatisfaction of the HZDS's leading representatives with the VSZ management" and "reproached the VSZ top management for having done little or nothing for the HZDS candidate to get elected." Toth's criticism reportedly culminated in the proposal that Zoltan Berghauer, then chairman of the VSZ Board of Directors, dismiss Marian Sarissky and Dionyz Kunder from the Board of Directors "because Sarissky had signed a statement of the Forum of Slovak Intelligentsia and Kunder was a sympathizer of the Christian Democratic Movement." According to the four managers' statement, Berghauer "rejected Toth's demands as unfounded and unprecedented." In conclusion, the managers say: "We suppose that this rejection prompted Julius Toth to seek other forms and instruments to bring about changes in the VSZ Board of Directors, which he implemented through certain members of the VSZ Supervisory Board and the FNM. Not just two, but four members of the Board of Directors were recalled in this way, this time without citing any reasons or objections."
