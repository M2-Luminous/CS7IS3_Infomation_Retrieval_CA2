[Begin Rivas recording] We view the plight of the Haitians as regrettable. The Nicaraguan Government's policy is strictly for export purposes. Here in Nicaragua we are very much aware of the situation we are confronting. Here in Nicaragua more than 50 percent of the work force is unemployed. We do not believe it would be advisable for people from other countries, in this case Haiti, to come here when we cannot solve the problems of the Nicaraguan people. The government has implemented many economic plans that have not worked out. Many Nicaraguans cannot understand why. I believe that if we were to accept Haitian refugees in Nicaragua we would face situations which would be difficult to describe at this time. We do not believe Nicaragua should be a laboratory to test this type of social program. They are overlooking the real situation experienced by the Nicaraguan people. I do not believe this would be good for us and it worries us. [end recording]
