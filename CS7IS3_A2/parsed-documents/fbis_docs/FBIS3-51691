After two days of negotiations in the Chapadmalal tourist resort, the government was able to get practically all the provinces to join the economic and fiscal guidelines of the central power. Eduardo Angeloz [Cordoba Province governor] thus remained the single "rebel" governor who has not yet signed the pact drawn up by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. But the legislature of Corrientes Province must also decide whether or not it will approve the signing of the pact by Ideler Tonelli, who was then the trustee of that province. Intense negotiations were carried out by Domingo Cavallo, presidential General Secretary Eduardo Bauza, and Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf to get Neuquen Governor Jorge Sobisch and Rio Negro Governor Horacio Massaccesi to sign the pact. Bauza himself later denied that pressure was exerted on the two governors, saying that the agreement with Neuquen and Rio Negro "considers the interests of the nation and of each province."
