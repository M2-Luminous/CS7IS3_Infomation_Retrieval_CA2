The demand comes in the wake of the announcement by the Independent Electoral Commission chairman, Mr Justice Johann Kriegler that elections cannot be held in the current political climate in kwaZulu. The AVF, in a statement released on Wednesday [6 April], said the situation in Natal/kwaZulu was clear proof that negotiations had failed. "There can never be peace before the freedom of the Zulus and the Afrikaner is properly addressed," said the statement. The attempts by the National Party [NP] and the African National Congress to intimidate the Zulu nation had also failed. Military steps were being directed at Inkatha Freedom Party members and certainly not at ANC members who were the aggressors, said the AVF. Which was why violence in the region had not been curbed. The AVF said an end had to be brought to the "soft" way in which the NP dealt with the hunger for power exhibited by the ANC-South African Communist Party.
