Italtel will supply 100,000 lines of programme-controlled telephone switching equipment to Shenyang, Harbin, Hohhot and Lanzhou railway bureaus. It is the first equipment supply contract Italtel has won on the Chinese market. The four cities are major railway hubs in China. Chinese officials said the operation of the equipment, scheduled to begin next year, will improve management and transport capacity in Northeast and Northwest China. The project was funded by a World Bank loan. Italtel defeated other contenders because of its reasonable price, Chinese officials said. "We're proud of this contract," said Alberto Cnirieleison [as published], chief representative of Italtel in Beijing, "because it signifies a new starting point for the co-operation between Italtel and China." The company's equipment is used in 18 countries, mostly in Europe. But officials predicted it could get a sizable share of the Chinese market relatively soon because the market here is huge. The untapped potential of China's telecommunications sector was the focus of a conference held last week in Beijing as foreign manufacturers fiercely compete to pry open the market. Many of them have already started manufacturing in China, like Canadian North Telecom and Siemens of Germany. China is expected to spend $6 billion on telecommunications equipment this year and up to $90 billion by the year 2000. Italtel does have a short history of aiding the Chinese. It agreed to transfer the technology of producing digital transmission equipment to the Number 515 Factory in Chongqing, Sichuan Province, in 1985. The products have now been sold abroad.
