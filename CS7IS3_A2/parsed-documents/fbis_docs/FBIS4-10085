Yet, when it comes to making a decision on concrete measures, there is no more unanimity. While some people emphasize the legal side of the matter, advocating the use of laws to fight this scourge, others emphasize the ethical side, advocating the teaching of principles to people. The truth is that both are right. A society without sufficient legal instruments, both for preventing and for sanctioning corruption, will have little success in the fight against it. Yet it is also true that people without principles are more likely to engage in practices leading to the unethical and illegal obtaining of wealth. Within this context, it is highly positive that the first "heated debate" at the Chamber of Deputies focused on the search for feasible mechanisms for controlling this scourge. Because even though Chile has traditionally observed the law and the standards of morality, there are indications that the corruption wave affecting other countries might also spread to Chile. An outstanding point in the broad debate on the subject was the need to strengthen the structure and functions of control organs. Proposals were made to expedite and modernize the procedures of the Office of the Comptroller General of the Republic and to expand the supervisory duties of the Council for the Defense of the State and of the Chamber of Deputies. A proposal was also made to install an Ombudsman [preceding word in English], or people's defender, and a Superintendency of State-Run Companies. Within the private sector it was proposed to impose sanctions against the illegal obtaining of wealth and the engagement of employees in crimes against the state [delitos funcionarios]. It was also proposed to reestablish the power that professional associations had for sanctioning ethical violations. The government is sponsoring an interesting initiative, which considers the possibility of creating a top-level commission for proposing the necessary legal amendments to prevent fraud in all public sector organs. This initiative, which would in practice call for creation of a National Commission Against Corruption similar to the commission that will be created for fighting poverty, has the advantage that all sectors of the country will be represented in it. In fact, all Chileans should obviously engage in the fight against this scourge, which is the main threat that jeopardizes a democracy. In sum, there is pressing need for promptly designing an appropriate strategy for fighting this fearful phenomenon. Only in this way will our action reflect our words.
