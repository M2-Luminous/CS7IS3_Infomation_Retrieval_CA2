The Matignon [office of the prime minister] now wants to split it into three parts. Is the Treasury to be the scapegoat for the Credit Lyonnais scandal? The French Government's most prestigious--and long most powerful--directorate has been called on the carpet at the worst possible moment. The country's leading bank was on its way to the wall and the Treasury Directorate, which both oversees it and represents the shareholder government on the board of directors, either knew or said nothing. That is, unless--and at no risk to himself--the then minister sat on detailed warnings, an indication of what little real influence this much vaunted power machine enjoys. Actually, until the summer of 1992, the "memo for the minister" concerning the Credit Lyonnais were as rare as they were vague. Much was made of Jean-Yves Haberer's bold strategy, the great risks taken, the wager that could win big. "The Treasury is organized like a loose holding company," one official says, springing to its defense. "It is concerned with strategy, but its supervision depends on external systems, auditors, the Banking Commission, headed by the governor of the Bank of France, acting as its secretariat, followed by the General Inspectorship of the aforementioned Bank of France." The year 1991 was a decisive one. Credit Lyonnais was still posting good profits (3.2 billion francs [Fr] in the black), surpassing those of the BNP [National Bank of Paris]. Questions were beginning to emerge here and there, however, even before the gloom-and-doom predictions from Francois d'Aubert, UDF [French Democratic Union] deputy from Mayenne, ENA [National School of Administration] graduate, and adviser to the Audit Office, who in late 1980 embarked upon a continuing crusade against the Credit Lyonnais that was met with widespread indifference. "The Banking Commission and Treasury were somewhat timid," a former member of Pierre Beregovoy's cabinet now admits. Bank of France Governor Jacques de Larosiere, Haberer's predecessor as head of the Treasury, did not get along with the boss of the Credit Lyonnais, which detracted from the Banking Commission's warnings. As for the Treasury, it is far more stringent with poor people in need of money than it is with government finance barons. Nor is it easy for a bureau chief to tweak a former great who served as Treasury director 10 years previously. By the summer of 1992, no doubters were left. Earnings for the first half of the year were catastrophic. When the bank was placed under close monitoring--and Treasury insiders now say it "was high time"--the task was given to Haberer, who did not conceal his anger. "What kind of daily control can be effective enough to allow the minister to be warned in time?" the then Economics and Finance Minister Michel Sapin now wonders. Until the arrival of Jean-Pascal Beaufret at the head of the Department of Monetary and Financial Affairs in the summer of 1992, the Treasury's representative on the Credit Lyonnais board of directors was not the official in charge of the matter, which certainly did not facilitate the monitoring task. Beginning in December 1993, the recapitalization of the Lyonnais, negotiated by its new president, Jean Peyrelevade, set the stage for one more setback for the Treasury and its minister. Beaufret intended to reduce the government's backing to a minimum, forcing the bank to draw upon its reserves (Fr60 billion francs in shares, the best backed network in Europe). The Matignon went to bat for the Lyonnais: The government, Thomson SA, and the Deposit Fund would dole out funds. The concern for not weakening the French economy as it emerged with difficulty from the crisis won out over the traditional impulses of the Treasury, ever anxious to limit government commitments. A parliamentary commission of inquiry is to scrutinize the Lyonnais matter. Selection of its members--a minimum of nine--and definition of its task is providing fuel for a fierce behind-the-scenes fight. The spokesman for the National Assembly's Finance Committee, Philippe Auberger, a former Bercy [Finance Ministry] official from the RPR [Rally for the Republic], wants to challenge certain colleagues, who "failed to execute their duties properly...and submitted accounts for a number of years which were in error." Centrist Jacques Barrot, chairman of the Finance Committee, wants no witch hunt and is trying to "understand where things went wrong between the oversight authorities and nationalized businesses." In other words, he prefers to aim the spotlight at the Treasury rather than the Credit Lyonnais, whose customers, partners, and deposits must be handled with kid gloves. Overnight, the Lyonnais affair and its parliamentary aftereffects could speed up reform at Bercy, one of Edouard Balladur's main secret plans. Since the fall, 40 high-level Matignon officials have been working under Jean Picq, adviser to the Audit Office and former member of various Gaullist cabinets, to define "the government's responsibilities and organization." The inquiries, hearings, and studies have spared no sector, from Education to Economy. One of the main points of the general 150-page report to be submitted to the prime minister on 30 April deals with a redistribution of power between the Matignon and Bercy. Balladur, economics and and finance minister from 1986 to 1988, had the next five years--working from within the opposition--to reflect on the redistribution of real power between the government's two fortresses. As prime minister, he worked hard to accentuate the split between Finance and Budget ministries authored by Pierre Beregovoy in April 1992. It was no accident that the three most influential finance ministers of the Fifth Republic: Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Pierre Beregovoy, and Edouard Balladur, each tried to blow up the citadel once they were out of the ministry. Recommended Solution: One Grand Ministry of National Economy, Patterned After the German Model Of the three, Balladur went the farthest. His was the first government since the end of the Napoleonic wars to have no minister of finance. Edmond Alphandery is only economics minister. The preeminence tacitly recognized at that ministry and by its top officials in the Treasury is now carefully blurred. What is more, it is under attack from a Budget Ministry that has been stimulated the influence of its young head, Nicolas Sarkozy, who is also the government's spokesman and, in fact, its number-two man. "What can you expect? The mayor of Neuilly [Sarkozy] is more important than the mayor of Longue-Jumelles [Alphandery]," one Bercy boss says with a sigh. It is a well-designed arrangement, one that has heretofore done all that its authors had hoped it would: Economic and financial arbitration takes place at the Matignon rather than at Bercy, which had been rapped on the knuckles for the Balladur loan--which the Treasury did not want--as well as for the abortive reform of the Deposit Fund. Interministerial debate behind closed doors, settled by the finance minister, has given way to interministerial meetings dominated by the Matignon. The power to say "yes" has shifted from the 12th district to the seventh. Unlike Michel Rocard or Edith Cresson, the prime minister no longer has before him packages neatly tied together at Bercy that he must either accept as they are or reject, risking a political or monetary crisis. "Today, the Matignon intervenes in matters involving Fr50 million," observes one veteran of the "golden age" of the Beregovoy-Trichet team, one a powerful minister and the other a flashy Treasury director. The last example to date of the recurring conflicts separating the feuding brothers at Bercy is the struggle over the pension fund and the income tax reduction. Alphandery defends the former and Nicolas Sarkozy the latter. Both would mean substantial losses in fiscal revenue and in slack times it is not possible to do both. The decision will therefore be made at the Matignon. Based on early leaks, the Picq mission is tending toward a German-type model: one grand Economics Ministry combining the current responsibilities of [Economics Minister Edmond] Alphandery and [Industry Minister] Gerard Longuet. Such a rapprochement between Bercy and Avenue de Segur [Industry Ministry] would be accompanied by a reorganization of both administrations. Part of the Treasury administration, the one that handles monetary and financial affairs and government participation, would be merged with the General Industrial Strategies Directorate (DGSI), which now monitors the manufacturing sector. The other part of the Treasury, international affairs, would be grouped together with the Directorate of Foreign Economic Relations (DREE), placing under the same ministerial and administrative authority all foreign trade questions, foreign loans, credit insurance, debt and development. "In the future, with the creation of the World Trade Organization scheduled to succeed GATT on 1 January 1995, matters relating to international trade, foreign exchange, and global debt will be inextricably combined. A single command unit is essential if France wants to avoid the 1992-93 mess it had with the Uruguay Round," one manufacturer argues. Based on such a scenario, a Finance Ministry would remain at Bercy, built around the Budget Directorate and the Tax Directorate, along with an office in charge of financing government deficits. From the perspective of Pavillon Colbert, located at Bercy's sixth pillar, headquarters of the Treasury Directorate, the plan amounts to sacrilege. If reform there must be, there can be no question of taking away Finance or of separating Budget, taxes, and the Treasury. "Right now, in spite of everything, we are trying to achieve the successful separation of persons, ie., the existence of two ministers, with the needs of a harmonious operation, but if that were to become a real, permanent, final split, it would be a very bad thing," says one of the Bercy barons, resolutely arguing for the unity of the financial leadership of the government. Furthermore, what would be the purpose of the "little schemes" invented to safeguard the unity of the institution, the common notes sent by the Budget Directorate and Treasury Directorate to the two ministers? And yet, the young mining engineer entrusted by the Picq mission with the task of inventorying the responsibilities of the Treasury Directorate has been forced to note the undeniable and rapid shrinkage of its prerogatives in recent years. As for the monetary mission, since February all action has shifted to the Bank of France. The Council on Monetary Policy establishes short-term interest rates, oversees rates day by day, and buys and sells foreign exchange for the government with complete freedom. The last straw: The Treasury director is barred from meetings if the minister is present! As for the mission of overseeing the banks, the Treasury continues to share it with the Bank of France, which acts as the general secretariat for the Banking Commission. Its independence has buttressed the preponderance accorded it by its expertise: Investigation of cases is done on Rue de La Vrilliere. "The Bank of France is the only independent central bank to enjoy the right of oversight over commercial banks," complains one former head of the A1 office, long one of the most prestigious directorates. "That throws everything off balance," he adds. Nor is supervision of financial markets what it once was! The Stock Exchange Operations Commission (COB), which bears that responsibility, has strengthened its position in recent years. The law of 2 August 1989 drove out the government's commissioner, the Treasury's oversight agent. Its budget no longer depends on Bercy. A representative of the directorate may participate in its work, but on the condition that he be asked to do so and that he remain silent. A sign of the times, on 8 February 1993, the COB suspended the quotation of the Businessman's Accounting Office, a specialized financial institution under the Treasury, without even notifying the latter. Privatization is one of Treasury's few new missions, but a naturally temporary one at that. Unlike under the first cohabitation, it must now share the task with the Privatization Commission. In addition to appraising the value of privatized companies the latter will henceforth choose the members of the "hard-core investors" itself. Once the privatization program has been completed, the number of board seats occupied by Treasury officials will have dwindled. In 1992, a third of the personnel in the financial sector (banking and insurance) came under the government shareholder and therefore under the Treasury. Treasury board seats will comprise scarcely 5 percent in 1997 when the privatization process has been completed and will essentially be under the independent Bank of France. Decline of the G7 Regime; Paris Club Weakens Treasury's International Role The Department of International Affairs, the most highly esteemed of the three in the Treasury's unwritten hierarchy and the source of two of the four last Treasury directors, has run out of things to do. The G-7, a body which brings the seven chiefs of state or heads of government from the seven richest countries in the world together with their respective Treasury directors, and which, according to Jean-Claude Trichet, comprised "the World Directorate," is on stand-by. It may well discuss employment, the environment, or Bosnia, but never interest rates or exchange policy! "Monetary coordination between great powers that led to the Plaza agreement and later the Louvre agreement in 1986-87 flowed from one man, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jim Baker. Since his departure, nothing important happens there," one old Sherpa says. The Department's other leading institution, the Club of Paris, whose members since 1956 have been the world's main creditor nations, experienced a spectacular run in the 1980's with the Third World debt. International investors have now returned alone to the road of exotic or emerging markets ($40 billion in 1992). Only subscribers now go to the Club and they are often small, bankrupt countries sliding into the Fourth World amidst an attitude of general indifference. The only important matter on the horizon concerns Russia, once the International Monetary Fund has uttered its final word. Europe, which is inexorably nibbling away at national prerogatives and which could have been a new frontier for the entire Treasury, has taken on the look of an opportunity missed. Trichet did indeed negotiate Economic and Monetary Union in 1991, but nothing has happened since. One office out of 25 follows European affairs and two more are interested in it as a sideline. Actually, that issue has already been taken over by the General Secretariat for International Cooperation (SGCI), which is under the Matignon. Made up of 140 persons, some 100 of whom are A-ranking officials, it is, like the Treasury, "a miniature France," housed in a discreet building on Boulevard Diderot devoid of any plaque or flag. Operating between Brussels and Paris, the SGCI plans European Council of Minister meetings and referees interministerial disputes. For example, ever since Bercy was split in two, the SGCI has served as an arbiter between Budget and Economy when the ministers have to go to meetings of EC economics and finance ministers in Brussels. It is a formidable rival for the Treasury and not only for European Affairs. Its boss, Yves-Thibault de Silguy, who is as blustering and extroverted as Christian Noyer is circumspect and sugar-coated, is Balladur's adviser for European affairs. At his prompting, the SGCI puts in overtime and provides the Matignon with memorandums on practically every subject, including financial, based on demand. Maladept at seizing new responsibilities, outside of OPA's [public offer to purchase], from the venerable Insurance Directorate in 1989, the Treasury is in danger of losing its power of influence, the rare and fragile commodity that, more than regulations and procedures, was its real strength. This dynamic PME [small- and medium-sized business] with just over 50 young managers: three department heads, nine deputy directors, 24 bureau chiefs and their assistants, the rest having no voice, has been accustomed to winning interministerial arbitration much like one wins market shares, with a winner's attitude and the feeling--sometimes justified--of being the best. The departure of previous director Jean-Claude Trichet to the Bank of France in November was a stiff blow, a bit like a ranking general going over to the enemy. The three colonels themselves, all older than the new director, Christian Noyer, and who served on leftist Cabinet officials' staffs, are leaving. With respect to the Lyonnais, the four days which the minister took to reply to a low blow which a daily newspaper had aimed at a department chief were viewed as desertion. Precisely what place does the "government's strategic master plan" being concocted at the Matignon reserve for the Treasury? "The organization of the Economics Ministry has scarcely changed since 1960, but there have nevertheless been gigantic upheavals since that time," observes Jean-Ludovic Silicani, general reporter for the Picq mission. The most gigantic of all is undoubtedly the end of the economy of indebtedness and inflation, a revolution in which the Treasury, the sprinkler that got its own self wet, played a major part. Today, one no longer operates with loan authorizations and regulations, but rather, with tens of billions of francs of one's own funds and on open markets. [Box, p 50] Failures and Blunders Even before the Credit Lyonnais imbroglio, a series of failures and blunders had already tarnished the aura of excellence traditionally surrounding the Treasury Directorate somewhat. Inadequately overseen, in the midst of their 1980's euphoria, the Regional Development Companies (SDR), whose annual loans are backed by the government, confused infrastructural development with development of golf courses! Several SDR's could simply vanish! "A relic that was not controlled by the government or their shareholders," Treasury officials now admit. Another setback: the Businessman's Accounting Office, more of a government agency than a bank and responsible for setting up property ownership loans (PAP). However, its board chairman blundered by becoming involved in real estate speculation. The result: a plan to salvage Fr15 billion to save accessways to the property of lower-income owners. In 1989, the Treasury completed an OPA on savings taxes, an area covered by the department of fiscal legislation and the Budget Ministry. The deduction in legal tender was reduced to 15 percent and the savings stash of the monetary SICAV's [Variable Capital Investment Companies] took wing. "From 1986 to 1989, the Treasury expanded tax relief without calculating the amount of revenue lost," one tax expert charges. The sum: Fr50 billion a year. Following the German unification in 1990, the Department of International Affairs worried about the German economy because of the exchange rate chosen (1 West German mark, DM, to 1 GDR mark), but failed to foresee the tension induced on interest rates throughout Europe. In particular, no one apparently thought about the chance to marry the franc with a DM appreciated by the Bundesbank's expensive money policy. It is a fact that nothing moved in 1990 and that the escalation of interest rates took off in June 1991. Is the Maastricht monetary compromise itself not illusory? Germany has indeed accepted the single currency, but postponed it indefinitely!
