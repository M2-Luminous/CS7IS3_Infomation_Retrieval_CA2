(a) Requirement to notify account holder(s). When the RDFI receives a reclamation, it shall send written notification to the account holder(s) stating that a collection action may be or has been initiated. This notice should be sent no later than the date the RDFI recovers funds from the account. (b) Forfeiture of right to limit liability for failure to notify account holder(s). Failure to provide notice to account holders, as prescribed in §210.11 shall result in the forfeiture by the RDFI of its ability to limit its liability under this part.

Proof may include, but is not limited to, a file copy of the notice, a certified mail receipt, or documentation pertaining to the standard operating procedure of the RDFI that such a notice is routinely sent.

Until the RDFI is notified otherwise, however, it remains liable for Government credits as specified in §210.10 of this part. (b) Relief from or reduction in liability_error in fact or error in date of death. The Government Originator will determine whether the report of an error in the fact of a Receiver's death or legal incapacity, or the date of death, is correct. After its review, the Government Originator will certify its determination in writing to the RDFI and inform the RDFI of relief from or change to its liability. If the Government Originator agrees that the original notice of death or legal incapacity was incorrect, or the date of death is materially different from the original notice, it shall stop further reclamation activity that it determines to be inappropriate. (c) Restitution by the Government of RDFI funds improperly reclaimed. When appropriate, the Government Originator will remit to the RDFI any funds incorrectly returned or otherwise received from the RDFI. (d) Over/under recoveries. In the event of an over recovery by the Government for an erroneous credit, the Government Originator will return immediately the excess amount, by appropriate means, to the party suffering the loss.
