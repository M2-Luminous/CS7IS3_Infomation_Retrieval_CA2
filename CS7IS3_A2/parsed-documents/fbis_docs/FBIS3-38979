The leader of the Polish Government, who has been in Brussels since Wednesday, met European Commission's President Jacques Delors at noon on Thursday to discuss in particular prospects for an association accord uniting the EU with Poland and Hungary as well as the "pact for development" as recommended by Warsaw to further strengthen the economic ties between the EU and Central Europe. "The association accord is of essential significance to us, because Poland has been seeking since 1989 to expand all of its contacts with the EU. We have thus proposed to supplement the Partnership for Peace, which binds us to NATO, with a partnership for development," Mr. Pawlak explained at a news conference. "We propose an open formula, and we stress the regional dimension of this pact, which could take the form of a free trade area within the Visegrad group and could strengthen economic cooperation with the EU," such as in relation to trade in transportation and telecommunications infrastructures, he added in substance. But "this cooperation must not solely benefit those sectors where profits are most easily obtained," the Polish prime minister added, stressing the need for closer cooperation in areas such as the processing of agricultural products or coal. Mr. Pawlak and Mr. Delors also spoke of the EU's PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program of economic aid for the countries of Central and East Europe. An "overall assessment" of the effectiveness of this program is called for, the head of the European executive indicated. Jacques Delors also stressed the need to help the Polish authorities to "solve the crucial problem of agriculture, which is suffering from internal problems and difficulties in finding external markets." The Commission president expressed his understanding of the hopes for future membership expressed by Poland. "I am not able to say in advance when the conditions for Poland's membership will be fulfilled, but the EU has already made an unreserved political commitment on its future enlargement to include the countries of East Europe. It has the historical responsibility to respond to the appeals of these countries," he stated. In the meantime, Mr. Delors has given his commitment on behalf of the Twelve to increase political contacts with Warsaw over the coming months. He believes Poland already fulfills the first condition for membership of the Community club by having acquired a democracy which is "pluralist and respects human rights." But it will be up to the Polish people themselves to say when they will be able to satisfy the second condition, which involves an open economy that is able to "stand up to the Community economy," he added in substance.
