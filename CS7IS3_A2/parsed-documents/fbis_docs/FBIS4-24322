Mr. Samuel Dhokie, according to reports, visited Guinea to seek cooperation from local Guinean authorities for the use of Guinean soil for his planned attack, under the guise of arranging the repatriation of Liberian refugees there. But he is reported to have been refused any cooperation from the Guinean Government. The NPFL controversial nominee to the Liberian National Transitional Government, who cut short his trip to Guinea as a result of the refusal of authorities there to cooperate with him, visited many refugee camps seeking support for his so-called Nimba Defense Force. Observers are questioning the credibility of Minister Dhokie and his cohorts, accusing them of working contrary to the social peace of Liberia and their original organizations that nominated them. There are even calls for their replacement.
