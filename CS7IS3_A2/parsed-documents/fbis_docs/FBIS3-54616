Our settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman reports that several dozen settlers from Judaea and Samaria arrived in Qiryat Arba' and started preparations for setting up a new presettlement about one km from Qiryat Arba'. Our correspondent reports that the settlers set up a special headquarters for this purpose in a Qiryat Arba' apartment, and the operation is being conducted to all intents and purposes as a military operation. The heads of the operation told our correspondent they have not coordinated their actions with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], and that if they are asked to evacuate the place they will evince passive resistance. Reacting to the settlement operation, Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer said Israel is a state of law and whoever breaks the law in Qiryat Arba' will be dealt with in the same manner as someone breaking the law in Herzliyya. Minister Ben-Eli'ezer made these remarks during a tour with the heads of his ministry to the 'Etzyon Bloc and Ma'ale Adumim. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1605 GMT on 26 January carries a report on Minister Ben-Eli'ezer's tour, in which correspondent Gil Litman asks the minister whether the government intends to territorially unite Jerusalem with Ma'ale Adumim on the east and the 'Etzyon Bloc on the south. Minister Ben-Eli'ezer is quoted as saying: "I want to tell you that I do not know of any such territorial linkage plan." Later on Ben-Eli'ezer adds: "If you ask me whether there is any plan to link the 'Etzyon Bloc to Jerusalem, the answer is negative."]
