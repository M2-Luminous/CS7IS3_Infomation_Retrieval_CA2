The TPP leadership council, whips, and administrative council members met with Tansu Ciller, party leader and Prime Minister, in Ankara today. In a statement after the two hour meeting, TPP deputy leader Esat Kiratlioglu said: The citizens gave us the responsibility to solve the problems of terrorism and economy. They want us to find solutions. Aware of our responsiblity, we are determined to solve these problems and lead our country in a spirit of unity and solidarity and in stability to the elections in 1996. Kiratlioglu stressed that within this framework, the TPP follows the principle of finding solutions to the country's problems over and beyond political considerations. He added: We want the coalition to continue. We do not want it destroyed. We want it to fulfill its duties until the scheduled elections. We will not be the ones to destroy the coalition. We will certainly not be the ones to destroy it. At this stage, the country needs stability, not a search for a new government. Asked to comment on the fact that certain TPP deputies were collecting signatures, Kiratlioglu said that this signature campaign was not aimed at ending the coalition, but at bringing counterproposals to the one that might be posited by the Social Democratic Populist Party [SDPP]. The TPP deputy leader stressed that at this stage, the party is not seeking a coalition with the Motherland Party. If the SDPP leaves the coalition, he said, every combination within the parliament will be considered.
