It would also have `suitable arrangements' (preferably a regulatory authority) to implement the policy allowing the private sector into the basic services. The much-awaited national telecom policy was announced in both Houses of Parliament today. The Government, however, did not intend to change the present part departmental, part corporation structure of the telecom sector. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and Mahanagar Telecommunications Ltd (MTNL) would be allowed to remain in the present form along with the private sector entities in providing the basic telephone service, in voice, data and other connections. The announcement heralding a new era in the telecom sector was made by the Minister of State for Communications, Mr. Sukh Ram, after the Union Cabinet cleared the policy at its meeting earlier in the day. The minister later addressed a press conference giving details of the policy. `With a view to supplementing the effort of the DoT in providing telecommunications services to the people, companies registered in India will be allowed to participate in the area of basic telephone services also', the new policy said. Various international telecom companies had already put in proposals worth $3 billion offering to run telephone services in various parts of the country. The new policy clears the hurdles in their joining the Indian network. Mr. Sukh Ram announced at the press conference that the Government would fix the telecom tariff and a decision on the regulatory body to ensure competition and interface problems would be taken at a later date. He felt that India had one of the lowest telephone tariffs and he wanted that status to be maintained. Mr Sukh Ram noted that the 0.8 per cent telephone density was much below the world average of 10 per cent. The new policy also announced revised targets for the telecom sector for the Eighth Plan and noted that additional resources required to achieve the revised targets would be well over Rs. 23,000 crores. `Private investment and association of the private sector would be needed in a big way to bridge the resource gap,' the policy said. It went on to add that private initiative would be used to complement the departmental efforts to raise additional resources both through increased internal generation and adopting innovative means like leasing, deferred payments, build-operate-transfer (BOT), build-lease-transfer (BLT), build-transfer-operate (BTO) etc. About the private participation, the policy noted that `these companies will be required to maintain a balance in their coverage between urban and rural areas. Their conditions of operation will include agreed tariff and revenue sharing agreements. Other terms applicable to such companies will be similar to those indicated for value added services'. `In order to implement the above policy, suitable arrangements will have to be made to (a) protect and promote the interests of the consumers and (b) ensure fair competition,' the policy said indicating the formation of a regulatory authority. Introduction to the policy document said the telecom services of world class quality are necessary for the success of the new economic policy. To achieve the new policy objectives the Government also announced the revised targets for the Eighth Plan. According to the new targets, telephone should be made available on demand by 1997. All villages should be covered by 1997. In the urban areas a PCO [public call office] should be provided for every 500 persons by 1997. All value-added services available internationally should be introduced in India to raise the telecom services to international standards, preferably by 1996. Even with the comparatively modest targets of the Eighth Plan, as originally fixed, there is a resource gap of Rs. 7,500 crores. The additional resources required to achieve the revised targets would be over Rs. 23,000 crores. `Clearly, this is beyond the capacity of Government funding and internal generation of resources,' the policy said. About the value added services, the policy pointed out that apart from continuing with the tendering system, the track record of the company, compatibility of the company, usefulness of the technology being offered for future development, protection of national security interests, ability to give the best quality of service to the consumer at the most competitive cost and attractiveness of the commercial terms to the DoT would also be criteria for selection to award licence. The policy also encourages introduction of new technologies. `Pilot projects will be encouraged directly by the Government in order to access new technologies, new systems in basic as well as value added services'. The policy emphasises the need for administration of the telecom sector in such a way that the inflow of technology is made easy and India does not lag behind in getting full advantage of the emerging new technologies.
