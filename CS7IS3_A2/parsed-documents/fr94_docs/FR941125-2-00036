FR941125-2-00036 FR941125-2-00028 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Conduct of Employees; Waiver Pursuant to Section 602(c) of the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95&hyph;91) Section 602(a) of the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95&hyph;91, hereinafter referred to as the ``Act'') prohibits a ``supervisory employee'' (defined in section 601(a) of the Act) of the Department from knowingly receiving compensation from, holding any official relation with, or having any pecuniary interest in any ``energy concern'' (defined in section 601(b) of the Act). Section 602(c) of the Act authorizes the Secretary of Energy to waive the requirements of section 602(a) in cases where the interest is a pension, insurance, or other similarly vested interest. Mr. Reginal W. Spiller has been appointed as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Gas and Petroleum Technology. As a result of his previous employment with Maxus Energy Corporation, Mr. Spiller has a vested pension interest, within the meaning of section 602(c) of the Act, in the Maxus Energy Corporation Career Average Retirement Income Plan. I have granted Mr. Spiller a waiver of the divestiture requirement of section 602(a) of the Act with respect to this vested pension interest for the duration of his employment with the Department as a supervisory employee. In accordance with section 208, title 18, United States Code, Mr. Spiller has been directed not to participate personally and substantially, as a Government employee, in any particular matter the outcome of which could have a direct and predictable effect upon Maxus Energy Corporation, unless his appointing official determines that his financial interest in the particular matter is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the services which the Government may expect from Mr. Spiller. Dated: October 28, 1994. Hazel R. O'Leary, Secretary of Energy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29086 Filed 11&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
