Nuuk -- Why should Greenland's negotiations with the EU follow a single track just because Lars Emil Johansen, the head of the provincial government, has gotten the EU stuck in his throat? This question is asked by the top leadership of Atassut [Solidarity Party] that has just come together for its first meeting after the turbulent convention in which many of the party's top leadership were moved out. Solidarity's Landsting group also participated at the meeting. Greenland is faced with the coming renewal of the fishing agreement they had, with what was first the EC and now is the EU, that has been in effect ever since Greenland resigned its membership in the EC in 1985. The fishing agreement expires 31 January 1995, but negotiations as to an extension of the fishing agreement for the next six-year period are under way. Today the fishing agreement means an annual income for Greenland of 270 million kroner. Several Possibilities The Solidarity Party's top leadership is dissatisfied with the fact that the provincial government one-sidedly is concentrating on a continuation of the fishing agreement, which in return for the 270 million kroner will grant EU fishermen set fishing quotas in Greenland's waters. "The Solidarity Party thinks that the provincial government in parallel negotiations should investigate other alternative affiliations to the European Union, the EU," says Lars Chemnitz, the party's political deputy leader, to GRONLANDSPOSTEN. The Landsting and the people have the right to be informed on whether the tremendous increase in the amount of money in the EU's guaranteed funds, among other things, will upset old considerations of the advantages and disadvantages of remaining outside the EU. [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] Are we then to have a renewed debate as to Greenland's membership in the EU? [Chemnitz] Not at the present time, but we want a thorough investigation and evaluation of the current conditions of [membership in] the EU. We have resigned from the EU, but that is not unchangeable. Development both in the EU and in Greenland since we resigned in 1985 has been very strong, and we will always consider the new situation. Countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria are knocking on the EU's door, and an expanded market might have far-reaching consequences for Greenland's fishing agreements, duty-free status, and trade agreements with the EU. New Situation [Chemnitz] A further consideration is Greenland's location, which has become more significant in recent years. After the end of the Cold War, Greenland was no longer located midway between the two superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States, but on the outskirts of the world. At present nationalists are rattling their sabers in Russia, and again there is tension between East and West. Therefore Greenland, because of its strategic location, is once again of consequence as a partner for the Western world, and we will take advantage of the possibilities of this new world order. Moreover, the EU and the new free trade agreement between Canada, the United States, and Mexico will play a more important role in the future. Greenland is at risk of being squeezed between these two powerful trade blocs if we continue to remain outside the EU. EU Funds [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] What is your personal opinion? [Chemnitz] The Solidarity Party maintains that full membership in the EU will be the most advantageous thing for Greenland. To begin with we would like to have a dialogue with the EU, not only about fishing, but also about many other subjects. [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] Why is it so important for the Solidarity Party to get Greenland to join the EU? [Chemnitz] Because we think it will offer many advantages to become a member. We built the two large airports in Nuuk and Ilulissat with support from EU funds, but we were alone in building the hydroelectric power stations in Buksefjorden. Now we are faced with the demand of new capital investments in the form of many airstrips on the West Coast. Why not apply for regional support from the EU for this large construction project as a readmitted member instead of taking on large foreign loans that would burden our economy. [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] Is not the Solidarity Party afraid of interference in internal Greenland affairs? [Chemnitz] Today we have a fully developed trawler fleet that can compete on an equal footing with those of other nations. That was not the case 10 years ago, and that is why we saw many EC trawlers in Greenland's territorial waters the first few years of home rule. Moreover, today we are much more dependent on free access to markets for our fish products because we no longer export mineral natural resources. [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] And you do not think that there will be a problem in entering [the EU] again. [Chemnitz] That is not up to us, but we are a member of a commonwealth with the EU country Denmark, and this commonwealth might give us an admission ticket. Poor Election [Chemnitz] The Solidarity Party brought Greenland's relationship with the EC into the election campaign before the Landsting election in 1991. The Solidarity Party did very poorly in the election, partly because Akulliit Partiiat [Center Party] did very well in the election and partly because of people's resistance to a renewed membership in the EC, now called the EU. The Solidarity Party will not make a proposal regarding renewed membership in the EU either for this or the coming Landsting meeting, but we cannot avoid including this question in the coming election campaign before the Landsting election next year. [GRONLANDSPOSTEN] Are you not afraid of another poor election showing? [Chemnitz] No, because we learned much from the election of 1991. We came on too strongly with our EC proposal and people were frightened. The other parties misunderstood our proposal on purpose and drew a frightening picture of the EC in Greenland. That will not happen this time.
