Dr. Silajdic, are you, after the talks you have held here in Washington today, and after the expiry of the ultimatum, more optimistic? [Silajdzic] Yes, the American involvement in this initiative gives us hope. We believe that Bosnia is a global issue. It must be viewed globally by the international community and, as far as that international community is concerned, the United States plays a leading role. We therefore believe that we are closer to a solution than before. [Horne] How do you see the Russian involvement? [Silajdzic] Well, I think they have tried to come in rather late to remain there in that theater. They were undoubtedly much more committed to the Serb side than we had expected. They are therefore lacking in objectivity in some cases, it has to be said. [Horne] Are you nevertheless not very disappointed over the fact that NATO and the UN needed nearly 23 months for the ultimatum and that so many people had to die in the meantime? [Silajdzic] Yes, we have expressed our opinion about that. We think that whatever is lost in Bosnia also applies to the rest of the world. Much is at stake here -- democracy, human rights, humanity, in short, civilization. We believe it is time to state: better late than never. This applies to those forces in Bosnia that are fighting for democracy and against aggressive nationalism, which stand for order and do not embody chaos and dictatorship. We expected the world to help us fight this evil, but as I already said: better late than never. [Horne] But, nevertheless, what are your expectations now? The fighting continues, heavy weapons encircle Tuzla, Bihac, Srebrenica, and Mostar? [Silajdzic] We expect a peace settlement, a comprehensive peace settlement that would ultimately make it possible to withdraw those heavy weapons from the encircled towns in Bosnia. But the main issue is the establishment of a permanent peace, not an unjust, but a just peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The latter cannot consist in moving guns 20 km away, for Sarajevo and other towns remain besieged. The point is to establish peace without rewarding aggression and genocide. I stress this once again most strongly, for this is important, as we will otherwise serve as an example for future adventurers and petty dictatorships. [Horne] Are you at all capable of still trusting people like Milosevic and Karadzic, or do you believe that only force can bring a peace agreement? [Silajdzic] Trust people like them? I think they only recognize force, just like any classroom bully who understands only force. That is why we think that this NATO decision has made it quite clear that force works. [Horne] Talking about force, did you receive any guarantees from the U.S. Government as far as the deployment of ground troops operating under the UN flag is concerned? [Silajdzic] Well, within the implementation, yes. Because a serious implementation of the peace plan is not possible without international guarantees. I believe that the international community has much at stake in Bosnia. The implementation has to take place with full NATO support. The UN, more or less by decree, guarantees the status quo. It is neutral, whatever that means. This has proven counterproductive so far. For this reason we have to change the situation in Bosnia and other parts of Europe. What counts is the credible threat of force: that is now proved to be working. [Horne] You have problems not just with the Bosnian Serbs but also with the Croats. There are efforts at present aimed at bringing the both of you back to the negotiating table together with the objective of creating a bloc against the Serbs. This has already been attempted, although in vain. [Silajdzic] Yes, you're right. Why didn't it work? Because there was a basic assumption of the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina between the Serbs and Croats. This made agreement impossible, and the concept has to be changed entirely. This is not 1939, when Bosnia was divided between these two. There must be a very serious attempt to reconsider this concept and to accept the fact that Bosnia is not a territory for grabs, but a state and must be dealt with that way. [Horne] Mr. Prime Minister, what do expect in the humanitarian sector from Europe now, and more precisely from Germany? [Silajdzic] Well, unfortunately we have to continue that and I'm afraid that we are facing a dramatic humanitarian crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We don't want to be the welfare recipient, the international welfare recipient here. But we must consider that, because it is the guilt of the European nations that things happened this way. We had an arms embargo, we could not defend ourselves, so now they must have a welfare state on their hands. We will try to get out of this situation as soon as possible. As for Germany, they have taken care of a lot of our own people and we do appreciate that fact. [Horne] Mr. Prime Minister, many thanks and best wishes for the people in your country.
