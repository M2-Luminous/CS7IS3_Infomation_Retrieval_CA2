The minister for environment, Mr. Kamalnath, says India is opposed to any absolute specifications for conservation of forests which are a community asset. Addressing a round table discussion organized by the UN Environment Program and UNCTAD [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development] in Geneva, he termed the efforts to put environmental barriers on trade as green imperialism. Mr. Kamalnath said any move for a global (?ecological) system amounts to legitimizing extraterritorial interference. He called for a moratorium on linking trade with the environment unless it impinges clearly on collective ecological security.
