A response from the government -- a final approval of a corresponding program -- is to come today. It seems that when he first addressed the State Duma, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, in response to appeals by Anatoliy Chubays to observe the time limit, let drop the phrase: "Mr. Chubays, you will be watching the clock in Lefortovo! [prison]" Yesterday's session confirmed the seriousness of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader's intentions. The LDPR faction submitted to the Duma a bill with a "telltale" name: "On Suspending the Process of Privatization in Russia as of 1 July 1994 Pending Examination of the Results of Voucher Privatization and Approval by the Russian Federation Federal Assembly of a Concept and a State Program for Post-Voucher Privatization." The Duma Council at its session did not approve this move. The Council decided to find a compromise and confine itself to an appeal to the president and the prime minister. The draft appeal, submitted by Privatization Committee Chairman Sergey Burkov, is effectively a warning. It says that owing to lack of guarantees of ownership rights for owners of former state property, the Duma will be forced to suspend the law On Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises. Responsibility for this lies "with those state officials who have failed to create a legal foundation for this process." The appeal was not supported by the deputies. Then Zhirinovskiy, stating that "behind each instance of privatization there is a crime," demanded that the bill drafted by his faction be passed immediately. It was supported by 194 deputies (226 votes were needed to pass it). As a result, "the matter will be finalized" in the privatization and economic policy committees. It's now the government's turn. Sings are that the post-voucher privatization program will be considered today. It remains unclear, however, whether this program will be presented to the Federal Assembly. On the one hand, until now Anatoliy Chubays has insisted that the post-voucher program be enacted by a presidential edict. His position is understandable: First, there is little time, to put it mildly, for normal consideration in parliament, and second, the Duma's intentions to punish embezzlers and corrupt officials speak for themselves. On the other hand, the State Duma's warning is serious enough. Moreover, there is nothing to prevent the LDPR from regularly moving its bill, which will hang like a sword of Damocles over the government. In these conditions the likelihood of the post-voucher privatization program's being presented to the Federal Assembly increases. If this happens, Chubays will apparently have nothing left to do but follow the fate of the voucher and resign. While he found it possible to avoid this move when the president ordered him to leave Moscow privatization to Luzhkov, discussion in the Duma will have more far-reaching consequences.
