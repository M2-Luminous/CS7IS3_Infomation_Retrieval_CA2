Tuzla airport, closed since May 1992, is surrounded by Serb forces who have refused to allow UN humanitarian flights into the Muslem-held city from where aid could be dispatched to other people in the northeast of the country. Reopening of Tuzla airport "had to follow immediately in the steps of the Sarajevo operation," Leotard told France Inter radio station, speaking of this month's North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) ultimatum to force Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy weapons from around the besieged Bosnian capital. "Everything has to follow up immediately on the Sarajevo ultimatum" even if force has to be used, the minister also said. NATO has also called for the reopening of Tuzla airport, but so far has refrained from issuing an ultimatum to the Serbs in this respect. The UN has indicated it hoped the airport might be opened to humanitarian flights in March.
