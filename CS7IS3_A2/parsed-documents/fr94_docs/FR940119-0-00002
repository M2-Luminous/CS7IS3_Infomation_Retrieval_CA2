SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 13301 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66, 26 U.S.C. 1391&hyph;1393, established the Rural Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Program. Under this program, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to designate up to 3 Empowerment Zones and up to 30 Enterprise Communities in rural areas. This document authorizes the Under Secretary for Small Community and Rural Development and the Administrator of the Rural Development Administration to carry out that program. This rule relates to internal agency management. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, notice of proposed rule making and opportunity for comment are not required, and this rule is effective January 18, 1994. Further, since this rule relates to internal agency management, it is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order Nos. 12866 and 12778. This action is not a rule as defined by Public Law 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and thus is exempt from the provisions of that Act.
