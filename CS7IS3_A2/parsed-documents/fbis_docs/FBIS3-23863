Some see in this a "recoil" from market reforms, others--the beginning of the next period of "shock-free therapy." Everyone assesses differently the statement of Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin to the effect that the state must pay back its debts. Just think--the deed (entirely natural, even obligatory) has not yet been done, and the mere promise of its fulfillment has evoked such polarized judgments. "Trillions are being shelled out to further develop the `black hole' of agriculture," one central newspaper reported a few days ago. But indeed, these trillions in question are not being "shelled out." And this is not the charity of V. Chernomyrdin and A. Zaveryukha, but rather a debt to the farmers. We are already eating the final portions of the bread procured from them last year. We paid for this--but to whom? Why did the money not reach those who made the bread? At the end of last year, the ideologues of stabilization gladdened Russian hearts: Look, they said--we have already curbed inflation, and the ruble is stronger. Just a little more, a little bit more... But let us take a look at what stands behind this report of victory. What has this "thrifty economics" turned into for the producers? My desk is covered with statements, appeals, and open letters to the president, prime minister, and ministries, which are similar in tone. You become dumbfounded when you read them, and wonder what state of deep crisis our production is in today. Plants are standing idle. People have not received wages for months. Workers are in a state of pre-strike frenzy. It is not possible to enumerate everything. Let us consider as an example just the key sectors. Once again the voices of our country's miners are sounding the alarm. The coal miners' union recently issued a statement which reads, in part: "Our trade union has always strived to resolve complex problems of social protection for the working people on the basis of mutual understanding and cooperation with the government. However, irresponsible promises by our partners in talks and their infringement of the terms of the wage-scale agreement compel us to take up a more rigid position." The rigidity of this position is today manifest in the active preparation being made for demonstrations on the part of miners in the Kuzbass, Vorkuta, Chita, and the Maritime Kray coal fields. Once again the demands of the miners are "simple": The state must pay back the 272 billion rubles it owes them from last year. Delay in this regard may result in social upheaval. Workers at several coal enterprises have still not received their pay for...October! An interdepartmental commission on socioeconomic problems of the coal producing regions created by the government is doing nothing, according to trade union leaders. Instead of developing a specific program, they are engaging in empty debate. A catastrophic situation has also come about at enterprises of the oil and gas production industry. It turns out that the "oil kings" are not wearing any clothes. The most profitable sector in the country, one would think, providing huge amounts of hard currency, is presently on the verge of coming to a halt. Workers have not received their wages for three or four months. And this is in Siberia, in the regions of the Far North! From 18 through 24 January, all the general directors of the oil and gas production and refining industries gathered together with specialists from the Ministry of Fuel and Energy to develop a program for extricating the sector out of its crisis. A package of documents was prepared. Unfortunately, their authors (as reported in the press) have not as yet been able to "get through" to the prime minister to have these documents signed. In the meantime, you and I have believed that in "shelling out" significant portions of our wages at the gas pump, we have thereby been ensuring normal labor and living conditions for our oil producers. We pay conscientiously for our bread and gasoline, but our money is not reaching those who produce all of this. For a long time, "shock therapy" was relatively forgiving to metallurgists. But rapid price increases for energy and increased rail transportation charges have brought this sector to its knees as well. No halt is seen in the production decline. Entire enterprises are shutting down. A similar situation has come about at enterprises of the shipbuilding industry, in the textile, machine-building, and other commodity producing sectors. The picture we see emerging here is an alarming one. There is cause for despair. So, should the government be criticized for its attempt, albeit tardy, to rescue production from certain collapse? And it is not "shock-free therapy" that our economy needs today, but real resuscitation--without turning away from the market, of course.
