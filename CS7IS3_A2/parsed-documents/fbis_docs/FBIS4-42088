We have not been asked by the UN secretary general. I understand that one party to the conflict does not want our participation. That is fine and we take note. What France is doing from this point of view is exemplary. Few countries have done as much in such a short period of time as France in helping the refugees and setting up humanitarian aid. [Velli] What do you intend to do to improve French relations with Rwanda if the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] takes power? [Juppe] Well, if the RPF takes power, this will mean that an agreement and reconciliation between all the parties to the conflict should be reached. This is what France did successfully last year with the conclusion of the Arusha agreement. The latter was based on the idea of power-sharing between the various parties representing the Rwandan population. There is no other way. There will come a time when talks on a political agreement will have to be held after a cease-fire. I am convinced that the usefulness of the French contribution will be considered then. [end recording] [Announcer] Another statement was made by Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin. He said the Rwandan tragedy is the biggest human catastrophe of the end of this century.
