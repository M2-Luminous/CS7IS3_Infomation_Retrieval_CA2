We were officially notified of the cassette during the latter part of last week when it was officially given to us at the [words indistinct]. At the time, we were also told that it had been given to the president of the Republic. This cassette contains very serious accusations against both campaigns; Dr. Andres Pastrana's campaign as well as ours. I am adamant about having this matter so thoroughly cleared up that we may know exactly which representatives of Dr. Pastrana's campaign and my campaign, were apparently involved in using drug trafficking money during the past presidential elections. I will accept the results of the investigations that must be made by the Prosecutor General, and if anyone who worked for my campaign, is proven to have been involved -- as the cassette indicates -- in this incident, they will be withdrawn from my government and they will not participate in my administration, regardless of the legal penalties that may be imposed on them. Thus, I believe, this case has to be totally clarified. I, as President, assure Colombians that this procedure will allow us to know the truth regarding the events described in the cassette, which was revealed yesterday and which involves my and Dr. Pastrana's campaign. [Unidentified reporter] Initially, it was said [words indistinct] because there was information that drug trafficking money was being used in politics. Does this have anything to do with this latest incident? [Samper] Maribel, the code of ethics was really implemented rigorously throughout. Today, I obtained the information I had requested on the campaign and it allows me to reiterate, as I said yesterday, that money of doubtful origin has not been used in my campaign. I want to invite any Colombian or media source, who cares to do so, to conduct a thorough examination of my campaign's accounting books. I made this commitment and I maintained it to the end. Likewise, the ethical prosecutor studied the origin of all the resources used in my campaign. That is why I am absolutely at ease and I want to express my total tranquility to Colombians. No drug trafficking resources were used in my campaign and the Prosecutor General will also be able to assess this in the books we presented to him today for his scrutiny. [Reporter] Good evening, Dr. Samper. You said the tape was officially delivered to you. Were you informed at that time who the people in this recording were? [Samper] No. We simply received the tape. We were told it contained accusations against both campaigns and that the government wanted us to know about it. After viewing the tape, we issued a first declaration rejecting the statements made in the tape. Second, I met with the prosecutor general today for over three hours and, as president-elect, officially requested this investigation. It is in the best interests of the former Samper and Pastrana campaigns and of democracy that this issue be clarified. I repeat: I will abide by the results of the prosecutor general's investigation. If that investigation reveals that people from my campaign are involved in the events described on the tape, I am willing to remove them from the campaign team. They will not join the government and will be subject to the appropriate penalties. [Reporter] Dr. Samper, considering that microphones were found at your home and campaign headquarters, do you think this could be a campaign against you? What do you think is the origin of this [word indistinct]? [Samper] I do not know. Based on what has been said by the people who conducted the preliminary investigation, I think the tape is authentic. I hope it is not part of a plot against me because that would have the effect not of discrediting Ernesto Samper but of undermining democracy. I want to reiterate to all Colombians that we have paid a high price in blood over the last 10 years to move our country ahead and defeat narcoterrorism. I was personally a victim of narcoterrorism. That gives me the moral authority to tell Colombians that we will continue to work at home and abroad to let the world know we are not the perpetrator but the main victim of drug trafficking. [Reporter] Good evening, Dr. Samper. There is a recording linking your campaign to drug money. How can you justify this incident? What is your opinion? How will this affect national and international public opinion, considering that you were just elected president on Sunday? [Samper] As I have said, this tape implicates the two campaign groups of the recent presidential campaign. I think the mere act of sowing doubt adversely affects the country. It affects the country's image abroad. I am therefore committed to clarifying this matter, not only as Ernesto Samper, former presidential candidate -- I assume this commitment because I must defend the integrity of my campaign, as I have reiterated over the past year -- but also as president of Colombia so this issue will not affect Colombia's long struggle against drug trafficking. This evening, I reaffirm my commitment to continue fighting drug trafficking in all its forms. I also wish to reaffirm this commitment so Colombia's international image will not be affected. I emphatically reject the charges. It is disturbing to think that these incidents could become a regular thing, as is thought by people in some parts of the world where they believe all Colombians are drug traffickers. I reject this assertion and the insinuations in the tape, in which two people are holding a dialogue apart from any campaign. This dialogue ultimately affects the two main candidates in the recent election.
