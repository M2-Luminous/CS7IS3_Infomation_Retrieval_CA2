FR941019-1-00021 FR941019-1-00002 Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis The FDIC does not believe that adoption of this proposal would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities (in this case, small banks), in accord with the spirit and purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C 601 et. seq.). In this regard, while some small banks with limited derivative portfolios may experience an increase in capital charges, for most banks the overall effect of the proposal will be to reduce regulatory burden and to reduce the capital charge for certain transactions. Paperwork Reduction Act The FDIC has determined that its proposed amendments, if adopted, would not increase the regulatory paperwork burden of state nonmember banks pursuant to the provisions of the paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq.). List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 325 Bank deposit insurance, Banks, banking, Capital adequacy, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Savings associations, State nonmember banks.
