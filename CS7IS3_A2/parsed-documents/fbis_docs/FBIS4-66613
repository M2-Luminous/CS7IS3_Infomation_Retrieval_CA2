FBIS4-66613 "jpnea021___94044" JPRS-NEA-94-021 JPRS Near East & South Asia 25 February 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Paper Summarizes 1994/95 Railway Budget Paper Summarizes 1994/95 Railway Budget 94AS0240E Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 25 Feb 94 p 1 94AS0240E Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA English CSO [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 24--The railway budget for 1994-95 today proposed a six percent hike in upper class passenger fares and a marginal increase of up to Rs [Rupees] 20 in second class fares along with modifications in freight tariffs for long distance haulage to raise an additional revenue of Rs 997 crores to cover a budgetary gap of an equal amount, report Agencies. An additional revenue of Rs 800 crores is expected to be mopped up from freight traffic and another Rs 197 crores from the travelling public. The estimated Rs 197 crores includes Rs 45 crores from second class passengers. By hiking the fares of monthly season tickets, the railways expects Rs 17 crores. This amount was included in the anticipated additional revenue of Rs 45 crores from second class travellers. Presenting the budget in Parliament, the railway minister, Mr C.K. Jaffar Shariff, left untouched the poorer sections, who travel up to 100 km in second class ordinary trains, while proposing a marginal increase between Re 1 and Rs 5 for distances beyond 100 km. While second class mail and express fares for distances up to 155 km are proposed to be marginally reduced, a modest increase from Re 1 to Rs 20 has been proposed in the fares for distances beyond. An increase between Re 1 and Rs 40 has been effected for second class monthly season ticket fares in the suburban sector. By a sleight of hand, the railway minister has modified the telescopic freight tariff by reducing the taper for long distance haulage and made changes in classification of items. The items covered by upward revision in classification include coal, iron and steel, cement, HSD [high-speed diesel] oil, oil cake and molasses. With a view to avoiding undue burden on the common man, Mr Shariff does not propose to change the classification for grains and pulses meant for the public distribution system. Mr Shariff also proposed to continue the exemption from freight increases for 12 essential commodities, including salt, kerosene, livestock, LPG [liquified petroleum gas], edible oil and fodder. The present rebate of six percent on freight allowed for cement and chemical manures loaded in open wagons is to be enhanced to ten percent. In his bit to maximise revenue, Mr Shariff also proposed to reduce the minimum distance for charge in respect of freight traffic from 100 km to 75 km and reduce the distance blocks for charge beyond 2,400 km from the present 50 km to 25 km. The minister announced the introduction of new trains, extension of the runs of a few existing trains and increasing the frequency of some. In a politically significant decision, the budget has earmarked Rs 50 crores in the next year for the Jammu-Udhampur link while final location survey has been ordered for extending this rail link to Srinagar. All the new proposals will come into force from April 1, 1994. Sleeper class fares will continue to be 25 percent higher than the second class fares as at present. The six percent increase for upper class fares covers AC [airconditioned] first class, first class, AC sleeper and AC chair car. Fares for the new AC three tier will be charged at 25 percent higher than the fares of AC chair car as at present. The fares for Rajdhani, including August Kranti Rajdhani and Shatabdi Express trains are also proposed to be suitably revised. Among the highlights of the budget are introduction of 12 new trains including the weekly Rajdhani Expresses linking Delhi and Guwahati and Bhubaneshwar. In the suburban railway sector, the fares for second class monthly season ticket up to a distance of 90 km are to be increased by Re 1 to Rs 9, depending upon the distance. For distances beyond 90 km the increase in the season ticket fares would range from Rs 11 to Rs 40. Mr Shariff claimed that 90 percent of the monthly season ticket holders travel up to 90 km only and they have to pay extra a maximum amount of only Rs 9 per month. There will be no change in the quarterly season tickets which will continue to be charged at 2.5 times the monthly season ticket fares, while first class season tickets will continue to be charged at four times the second class fares. The fees now levied for computerised reservations are proposed to be made applicable for manual reservations also. The reservation charges are Rs 5 for second class seat, Rs 10 for sleeper class, Rs 15 for AC chair car, AC three tier, first class and AC sleeper and Rs 25 for AC first class. Mr Shariff said that the railways' strategies for growth include gauge conversion and railway electrification of selected routes, strengthening tracks, more powerful locomotives, speeding up freight trains, terminals for goods and parcel traffic, lighter and more comfortable passenger traffic, lighter and more comfortable passenger coaches, improved customer service and development of real estate to supplement resources. In the next financial year, the railways expect to carry 380 million tonnes of freight traffic. As regards passenger traffic, a growth rate of two percent over the traffic likely to be carried this year is anticipated. Concerned over accidents at unmanned level crossings, the minister has provided Rs 25 crores in the budget for maning about 500 level crossings.
