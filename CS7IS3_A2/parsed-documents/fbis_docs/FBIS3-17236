Russia Intends To Guard 'All That Coincides With ex-USSR Borders'"] [Text] The Russian Armed Forces General Staff has received no presidential directive to prepare a plan for the withdrawal of border troops from four islands in the Kuril chain. This was announced by Lieutenant General Leontiy Shevtsov, deputy chief of the General Staff operations directorate, in parliamentary hearings on the problems of the Russian Federation state border yesterday. Answering a question from Duma security committee head Viktor Ilyukhin on such a directive, Gen. Shevtsov said that had it existed it is the General Staff operations directorate that "would be responsible for preparations for and the very pullout of troops, but there has not been even any talk on this topic." The directorate deputy head is also sure that had there been a directive, the General Staff's and Defense Ministry's reaction to it would have undoubtedly been negative. "I doubt the president could have issued such a directive without having agreed on it with the General Staff; it is too presumptuous to do such a thing without having consulted specialists," Mr. Shevtsov underscored. Major General Aleksey Shcherbakov, deputy border troops commander, who presented a report at the hearings, stated: "Everything coinciding with the borders of the former USSR should be guarded." In his words, "It is important to produce a series of measures to implement the law on the state border passed last April and, in particular, to step up work on giving the border validity under international law, on delimitation of waters with contiguous countries -- primarily with Japan, the United States, and the newly formed states." The border with Mongolia should be strengthened, as well as in the "Arctic region." Mr. Shcherbakov is convinced that the border with the Baltic countries "should be equipped like the one with the 'far abroad.'" Besides, he stated, it is necessary to resolve the existing territorial problems with Norway, the Baltic countries, Mongolia, China, and Japan, and to preclude possible problems with Finland, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan. Speaking about a concept of organizational development of the border troops in 1994, Gen. Shcherbakov intimated that, in the view of their commanders, the principle of forming the units sent, for example, to Tajikistan or Georgia, from volunteers should be dropped. "The border is the face of the state," he stated, adding that the volunteer service had entailed a decline in the general level of literacy, training, and health of the soldiers. Alongside this, Mr. Shcherbakov said, there is a discussion that it may be wise to alter the call-up age to 19 or even 21 years. The resolution summing up yesterday's parliamentary hearings notes that "in the wake of the USSR's disintegration... an effectively functioning system of measures protecting the Russian Federation state border only exists where it coincides with the border of the former USSR." It is recognized as necessary to prepare by June a draft of amendments to the law on the state border so as to bring it in line with the new Constitution. The Foreign Ministry was asked, in the interests of implementing the law, to resolve, as soon as possible, the questions of giving validity under international law to the "borders with CIS-member states, as well as the question of border rules depending on Russia's individual relations with each of these states."
