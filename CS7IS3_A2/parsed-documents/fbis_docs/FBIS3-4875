At the news conference, Chairman Saito expressed a sense of crisis about the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks which resulted in a rupture during the recent Japanese-U.S. summit and said, "I, as a businessman, cannot leave the matter as it is." He stated this was his personal opinion. He said that the Japanese Government "should present numerical targets concerning the macroeconomy" in future negotiations. Moreover, he called for the Japanese Government's positive action, saying that "because the ball is now in Japan's court, Japan has to throw the ball back to the United States." And, he added, "We want to make efforts so that (the Japanese Government) can throw the ball back as soon as possible." The conference was held on 23 and 24 February. Chairman Saito gave a speech on 24 February and stated that antidumping lawsuits by the United States and other countries have created distortions in the market. He then reiterated the need for an early conclusion of the multilateral steel agreement (MSA) which regulates trade conditions among various countries.
