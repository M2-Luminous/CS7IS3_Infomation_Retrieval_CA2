Since late last year, the city's TV channel had surprised Hue residents by relaying the BBC's satellite news service free to anyone with a TV set. Shortly before the broadcasts were cut, Vietnamese exiles in France had said that several monks had stopped eating to protest against their arrest in May 1993 for blocking traffic during a demonstration in which they were demanding greater independence for the Buddhist church.
