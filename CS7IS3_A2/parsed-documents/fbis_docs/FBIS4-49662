In his speech, Lu briefed the Hong Kong people on the questions as how the Chinese Government's policy of "one country, two systems" was formulated and why it shall be implemented in Hong Kong after 1997. He reiterated that the Chinese Government's policy of "one country, two systems" towards the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will remain unchanged for at least 50 years. Lu elaborated on the contents of the policy of "one country, two systems". "By `one country, two systems', we mean that the main body of the country practices socialism, which is the fundamental system of China, while Hong Kong continues to practice capitalism, as a supplement to the socialist state," he said. Therefore, he continued, "when we say there will be no change in the principle of `one country, two systems,' there are actually two aspects: the capitalist system of Hong Kong will remain unchanged, but the fundamental socialist system of the country will also not change." He pointed out that any attempt to turn Hong Kong from an economic city into a political city in order to influence the mainland in the sense of politics is disastrous for Hong Kong. "The value of Hong Kong to China has been and will be its economic value," he said. In the last part of his speech, Lu reassured that the Chinese Government's policy of letting the Hong Kong people rule Hong Kong and allowing Hong Kong to enjoy a high degree Of autonomy shall be adopted in order to put the principle of "one country, two systems" into practice. He expressed his firm belief that Hong Kong will remain prosperous with the practice of the "one country, two systems" policy and the fully implementation of the basic law. The luncheon was jointly held by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, the Federation of Hong Kong Industries and the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. Lu Ping arrived here on May 1 to attend a meeting of the preliminary working committee for the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the first of its kind ever held in Hong Kong.
