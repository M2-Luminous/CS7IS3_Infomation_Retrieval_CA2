Kazakov: "You Can't Substitute Oats for Meat"] [Text] There are strict scientific substantiations to the nutritional norm for aviators. It replenishes the body with what it needs, with what aviators expend while performing their assignments in the sky and servicing equipment, and ensures flight safety and a long flying career. This is why much attention is devoted in all countries of the world to maintaining the health and raising the combat readiness of aviators. In the times before perestroyka this matter was never neglected in the fleet's air units. But recently aviators have started experiencing discomfort in their diet as well. Because economic ties that had existed in the former Union have been disturbed, the thread of fleet food supply has broken. It is becoming increasingly more difficult for rear services of the fleet air forces to ensure the minimum ration necessary for sensible, high quality nutrition for flight crews, engineers and technicians. It's now a long-established practice to substitute one food product for another of far from equal nutritional value when a shortage occurs in a certain assortment of foods. Experience shows that such "transformations" are far from harmless. A certain food service worker joked to me that if you wanted to, you could "translate" the calorie count of even meat into oats, and serve them as food. It might of course go this far if the economy's disintegration continues at the current rate. But I think everyone realizes what the result of all of this could be. "We manage as best we can," said Lieutenant Colonel V. Molchanov, deputy commander of the aviation technical base of the Kacha garrison. "We get the needed food products either on the basis of our enthusiasm and personal time, or through acquaintances and good relations with various executives. We get them from kolkhozes and sovkhozes on credit, on the basis of our word. Only the food specialists know what we've had to do to manage thus far." Well, I'm not about to reveal the secrets of the suppliers. And here is why. A certain article in our newspaper said that because electric power had been shut off from the Kacha garrison, the command found a way to use local electric power sources for the time of the shut-down to keep the dining halls, boiler plants and offices running. On learning this, workers of the rayon electric power network switched off the electric power for 2 days before New Years. The reason they gave was that the garrison had its own electric power sources. Consequently food suppliers wisely refuse to say anything more about how they manage to supply the needed food products to the aviators' dining hall. The whole thing might backfire, you see. The main thing is that the suppliers, who take the experience of the perestroyka years into account, no longer wait for central deliveries, and instead establish direct ties with the producers. This allows them to provide at least the minimum ration to the personnel. But something does need to be said about the numerous instances of disorganization that rear service workers have to deal with in obtaining food for military units. Here are just a few of them, as related by Colonel V. Yankovskiy, commander of the aviation technical base of the Kacha garrison. "We can get meat from Simferopol. But they demand prepayment, and we have no money in the unit. "It's no secret that we've recently been receiving food from Russia. The rail cars travel thousands of kilometers to us. You'd think that it would be simple--just meet the cars, unload them, and truck the supplies to the unit. But it isn't. Customs officials are always on the watch. If you don't draw up a customs declaration within 3 days, which isn't always possible, they take a large percentage for the idle time of the car. And not from just anyone, but from the military units, which don't even have enough money to cover the pay of the servicemen. There are many such discrepancies." However, despite all of these difficulties, which are sometimes created deliberately, rear service workers are fulfilling their tasks successfully. And the persistence of commanders has a lot to do with it. This is evident at least from the following case. Bread for military units of the Kacha garrison comes from far away. Every trip means many liters of precious gasoline. The command of the aviation technical base suggested many times that 2 days' worth of bread should be delivered on Saturday. Then the Sunday trip could be dropped. But its efforts were in vain. It was then that Lieutenant Colonel Molchanov went to the bakery himself. He substantiated all of the pros and cons, and demonstrated that this would be more advantageous both to the supplier and to the consumer. And so the issue was finally resolved. Then things like this happen. Today there are food products in the storage depots, but tomorrow there might not be any. You'd think that there would be nothing simpler than to pick up enough to last a while, and the problem would be solved. But that's not the case. Having become accustomed to centralized, regular and constant deliveries in the "period of stagnation," units didn't create large storage capacities. And now the housekeepers are finding that these capacities are extremely small, and can't satisfy anyone. And so, now they have to run around each day, scrounging food and making deals with the "right" people, so that they could somehow "requisition" some of what the aviators are supposed to get. And there's no end to this. The people are weary of it. They're becoming nervous, and unsure about tomorrow. This is having an effect on mutual relations in the collectives, and it is influencing combat readiness. But we can't go on trying the patience of men in uniform forever. Wouldn't it be simpler to put aside the ethnic strife, to heal the fracture that occurred between Slavic peoples out of someone's stupidity, and restore the economic and social ties that were broken by the ambitious political activity of today's politicians? Divided we fall.
