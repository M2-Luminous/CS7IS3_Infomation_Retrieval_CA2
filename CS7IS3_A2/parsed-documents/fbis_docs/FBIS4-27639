Feisal's birthday falls next month. Minister/State Secretary Murdiono said the decision is contained in a decree signed by the President on May 23. The announcement put to rest one of the major political questions of the year, and one that had been frequently asked since the time Feisal was appointed to the number one post in ABRI in May of last year. There had been speculation that Suharto, who as the commander in chief has the last word on military appointments, was going to replace Feisal with General Wismoyo Arismunandar, currently Army Chief of Staff and two years his junior. This line of reasoning went that Feisal was simply keeping the seat warm for Wismoyo. With the extension of his active service, Feisal is now widely expected to retain his post, according to political observers. In the past, Suharto extended the service of L.B. Murdani and Try Sutrisno, two former ABRI chiefs, to allow both to retain the post. Feisal's immediate predecessor, Edi Sudrajat, only held the post for three months before he turned 55, after which he was whisked away to become Minister of Defense and Security. By law the President can extend the service of any colonel or general by one year at a time. Murdiono said that Feisal was given extended service, which will take effect on July 1, because the President felt that his services are still needed. Feisal, who was born on June 17, 1939, in Tarutung North Sumatera, graduated from the National Military Academy in 1962. He rose to prominence when he was assigned by Suharto to head a military investigation into the bloody incident in East Timor in 1991. The investigation subsequently led to the removal of two top army generals. Feisal carved his military career in Kopassus [Special Forces Command], the army's elite red beret force. His stints included quashing various separatist insurrections in Maluku and Kalimantan.
