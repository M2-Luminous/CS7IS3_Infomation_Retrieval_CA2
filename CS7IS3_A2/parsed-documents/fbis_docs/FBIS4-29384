FBIS4-29384 "dreas117_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-117 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 North Korea ROK Professor's Article on Nation Reviewed ROK Professor's Article on Nation Reviewed SK1706011094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 2253 GMT 16 Jun 94 SK1706011094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The editorial board of the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation got through the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) the political treatise "The Future of the Nation Viewed From Anecdote of Pyongyang" authored by Kim Son-pil, a professor of political science at a university in Seoul, and broadcast it on June 12. He recalled that his friend told him that when a member of the Seoul delegation to the Red Cross talks in Pyongyang, 20 odd years ago, asked a girl who looked to be around 15 years old how much the foundation stones of the statue of President Kim Il-song erected on Mansu Hill weigh, he said "the weight of the foundation stones of our father Marshal Kim Il-song's statue is the same as the total weight of the hearts of the 50 million people in the North and the South." He wrote that what she said reflected the whole of the North, represented the mentality of its people and showed the true appearance of its society and the great potentials of its system. Noting that what the people think about the statue of their leader and its foundation stones is a symbol of the singlehearted unity peculiar to the North, he said: According to my knowledge gained through various channels, the North is the only country in the world that has actualized the political administration based on the unity of the people. In the North the intention of the leader is precisely the intention of the people and what the people think is what the leader thinks. The people say as intended by the leader and the latter shapes politics as desired by the former. The leader's politics is, so to speak, the aspiration and will of the people. The leader takes care of the destiny of the people and shapes good policies for the people and the people remain faithful to the leader, entrusting their destiny to him. The secret of the North's singlehearted unity lies in that all the people have become one in everything. When a journalist who came to Pyongyang from Seoul to cover the North-South dialogue in the 1970s asked an old woman how many members Premier Kim Il-song' family had, he answered "the members of our premier's family number 50 million." When the North-South dialogue was being held in the 1990's, a journalist from Seoul asked an old man where the Chong-il peak was. He answered: "Chong-il peak is in Mt. Paektu. The Koreans must know of Mt. Paektu and Chong-il peak." The remarks of the old man are interpreted as meaning that the Koreans must know of the greatness and extraordinariness of supreme commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Chong-il. In Western countries, supreme commander Kim Chong-il is praised as the greatest hero in the world who has become a bright light in the east predicted by Indian poet Tagor to illumine the universe, and created an oasis in the world as dry as a desert due to the lack of the leadership ability of statesmen in the present times. The loyal heart of the people in the North in upholding and following the leader has become all the warmer while years passed by from the 70s to the 90s, and it has grown in eight now when the numbers of the nation have grown to 70 million than in the period when they totalled 50 million. Such a singlehearted unity is unimaginable in the South. It is a foolish dream to hope for a harmony of the people in the South where there is not a great man. The anecdote of Pyongyang also tells that only a great man enjoys the loyalty of the people. In Pyongyang blessed with two great men there is a philosophy and politics for the nation. The North has an ideological wealth for living its way and by itself. It is the political spirit peculiar to the North in the limelight of the planet to shape independent politics, neither depending on outside forces nor bowing to the pressure of foreign forces nor wavering in the western or eastern wind in the world where the big-power-first logic is forced. In my opinion, the political philosophy and political spirit of the North have been so strong and steadfast that they are lauded by all the people. The North is now overcoming single-handed the pressure and blackmail of the United States and its Western allies not to be reduced again to other's slave and not to be subject to others. This spirit of the North looks far greater than that of the Koyro dynasty, a powerful country which lasted a thousand tears. The singlehearted unity of the North is the greatest wealth of the nation. Such a unity in which all the people are united with the same purpose and obligation and harmonized with each other on the basis of virtues is a product of the extraordinary leadership of secretary Kim Chong-il. With this unity, the North, being a half of a divided small country, demonstrates the might of its political force, making dignified remarks to Western powers when it feels it necessary to do so, and keeping silence like a rock when it should do so. Such prestige and power of the nation which had never been seen in its history spanning [word indistinct] years are feats performed by secretary Kim Chong-il. The leader being great, the history of the nation has been correctly established, the society enjoys abundance and the people have become beautiful in the North. What is most difficult in the world is to make the people beautiful, I dare say. It is not difficult to make a [word indistinct] or build an industrial complex. But all sorts of hard works or a bible or a doctrine are not enough for making the people true human beings. The North is the only earthly paradise on the globe which has resolved this human-historic task. Noting that the human-historic question where lies the future of the nation has already been answered by the Pyongyang anecdote,the author of the treatise says: It is the irresistible trend of the time that the people's mind tends toward the true leader of the nation. The author concludes: Public-minded South Korean people, though they are in the South, have their mind in the North. The mind tending towards the North -- this is the trend among the South Korean people who see through the future of the nation. The political art of President Kim Il-song in his eighties and secretary Kim Chong-il in his fifties are combined together to strike the world with admiration. Think that this is a light illumining the future of the nation. Therefore, the foundation stones of the statue of President Kim Il-song on Mansu hill in Pyongyang weigh as much as the hearts of the 70 million fellow countrymen who follow the two great men, the hearts of all the people who believe in them as in heaven. In other words it is the weight of the universe. The future of the nation lies in the North.
