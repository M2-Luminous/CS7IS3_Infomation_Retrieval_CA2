Why is that? In the opinion of respondents questioned during a republic-wide investigative poll, the most attractive features of the communist regime were as follows: economic stability, guaranteed work, and the absence of nationality-type or ethnic conflicts. That is to say, it concerns what is lacking nowadays (with the partial exception of the last-named factor). Only 8 percent of those polled consider that communism had no positive traits at all. In order to gain a more complete idea of the image of communism which had been formed in the social consciousness, the respondents were also requested to cite its most negative features. It turns out that communism's "greatest sin" is its bureaucracy (so think one-third of the respondents), as well as oppression of the people and corruption. Some 13 percent have remained steadfast and unshaken dreamers about the cloudless serenity of the communist past. Such a distribution of opinions is combined with an overall decrease in the adherents of the communist idea. Their number has been reduced by more than two-thirds and now amounts--according to data drawn from the above-mentioned poll--to approximately 15 percent. Moreover, 11 percent have not yet determined their own political priorities. In contrast, the proportion of communism's opponents has doubled and now amounts to 74 percent. One-third of all the supporters of communist ideas comprise pension-age respondents, whereas only one-tenth of those under the age of 30 maintain such a political orientation. It is noteworthy that among former communists nowadays there are twice as many persons who are indifferent to communist ideas than there are faithful adherents to these ideas (the figures are 60 percent and 30 percent respectively). The logic of those voters who cast their ballots for the communists is roughly as follows: "Since the democrats and the members of the independence movement were incapable of providing us with a better life, I am voting for the communists, that is, for the good old days." However, few of these voters really think that those communists who suceeded in being elected to the office of deputy will carry out their pre-election promises. By the way, the telephone number to call in order to contact the Sotsis-Gallup organization in Kiev is: 28-64-32.
