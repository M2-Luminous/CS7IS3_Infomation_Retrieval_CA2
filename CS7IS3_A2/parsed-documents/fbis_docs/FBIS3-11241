He only noted some minor logistics problems. What I have said confirms these elections have been rightfully termed the elections of the century and will play a key role in consolidating peace, Ramirez Ocampo has said during an interview. Upon noting the civility and democratic culture the Salvadoran people have demonstrated in these general elections, Ramirez Ocampo has said the peace agreements are yielding their fruits, adding the elections are being held with a large voter turnout and amid peace. In addition, President Alfredo Cristiani has said everything is reported normal in several schools where polling sites are located in the capital, while international observers are confirming the Salvadoran people's demonstration of patriotism. President Alfredo Cristiani has said the elections, the first elections held after the signing of peace with guerrillas in 1992, have become a true civic party. The left has reported the presence of soldiers in polling stations in the interior and problems regarding the opening of electoral sites, but, as the right has done, it has highlighted the positive balance of the elections.
