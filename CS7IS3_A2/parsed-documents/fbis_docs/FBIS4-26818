The group enlarged its membership to 130 today by admitting South Africa as a new member. Created on June 15, 1964 by 77 developing countries, the group has played a cardinal role in international economic relations, calling for the establishment of a new international economic order, safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, and working as a major actor in promoting development and international economic cooperation. Presiding over the meeting, Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri, who is chairman of the Group of 77, said the group faced the challenge of further strengthening its role, so that, 30 years after its founding, its common ideals might live on and the complementary interests of all the members might be effectively promoted. The group should maintain its cohesion, broaden its horizon and reaffirm its originality, specificity and independence, he said. UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali praised the group's efforts for developing countries to gain independence and promote development. "Long indeed has been the road traveled by this group toward what is today the underpinning of United Nations action for development," he said. UN General Assembly President S.R. Insanally congratulated the group on its "splendid record of achievement" and said he believed the group, through their collective efforts, would "continue to make progress toward the goal of full development for all peoples." Chinese Premier Li Peng sent a telegram to the special meeting, extending China's warm congratulations to the group and pledging that China stands "ready to work with the Group of 77 for a gradual reform of the international economic order and for the common development and prosperity of developing countries." China's permanent representative to the UN Li Zhaoxing told the meeting that China has decided to contribute 10,000 U.S. dollars to the group. At today's meeting, representatives from the group's member states reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening south-south cooperation, called for renewing the dialogue between the north and the south, and urged developed countries to implement their commitments to international economic cooperation, providing developing countries with financial and technological support. The meeting adopted a ministerial declaration which put forward a new strategy of action of developing countries for the year 2000 and beyond in light of the current world situation, and a ministerial statement on "an agenda for development." It also adopted terms of reference of the joint coordinating committee between the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement, another grouping of developing countries.
