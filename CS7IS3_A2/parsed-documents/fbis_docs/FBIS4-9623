Both of them entered the program directly, not as listeners or viewers, but rather as directors, and for both of them the telephone has been a remote control. The intervention at Radio Sljemen, the electricity cutoff for Youth Television [OTV], and the blocking of an announced Croatian Television [HRT] broadcast during the past 10 days have caused an uproar among the Croatian public. In the first incident, Antun Vrdoljak, by telephone, in the ether--the occasion is completely meaningless--resolved with broadcast director Zvonko Sebo things that are usually resolved in editorial staff meetings. In the second case, OTV's program director, Romano Bolkovic, used the telephone to try to "shut off" Nightmare Stage [in English as published] director Zeljko Malnar, and when he failed, the electricity in the studio was shut off and thus the broadcast was interrupted. In the third case, the elements of the "game" are well-known: the broadcast (Latinica), the director (Denis Latin), and the guests (Mile Dedakovic Jastreb and Tomislav Mercep), while the one who one shut it off is so far unknown. Actually, the names of those who shut it off (the censors) are not even important here--in this case both Vrdoljak and Bolkovic are more interesting as Croatian media cliches than as individuals or personalities. Both of them, in fact, "entered" the program directly, but not private persons, i.e., as "ordinary" listeners and viewers, but rather as directors of the media in question, and both of them used the telephone not as a means of communication, but rather as a remote control. The idea of the media as a means of control and manipulation is as old as the media themselves. In this sense, the harshest critics do not view the media as a "window to the world," but rather as a blind in that window, which the owners raise or lower to the extent that it suits their overall and current interests. That is precisely the thesis on which Zeljko Malnar built his nighttime show on OTV. Nightmare Stage, with its lack of restraint and informality, destroyed the very foundations of television as a means of controlling and manipulating the masses. Malnar did not offer answers and finished opinions, but instead raised questions and forced people to think. Provoking Vanity Malnar's ultimate goal in provoking personal and national vanity ("You Are Ugly and Stupid," or "One Should Love All People Regardless of Their Color, Race, or Religion, Which Is Quite Difficult If You Are a Pure-Blooded Croat") was probably not to insult, but rather to install a "mirror of reality," which would offer a picture the opposite of the one offered by the "big" state media. Even though it then went to the opposite extreme, Malnar's nighttime "nightmare" on OTV can also be interpreted as a sort of group psychotherapy for, generally speaking, the frustrated "populace." Perhaps he did not even "expand horizons," but in any case, by raising the veil from people's eyes, provoking and insulting, he destroyed the embellished, retouched picture of reality for which the "strictly controlled" media were responsible. Without going into how much whiskey Malnar had inside him on the night when his show was cut off (which is also part of destroying the ordinary, "sober" image of television directors), or the extent to which he "crossed the boundaries of good taste"), for which Bolkovic is criticizing him, it seems that that is not the hitch. OTV officials knew, or at least could assume, what they had gotten when they "bought" Malnar. In fact, Malnar crossed the boundary of good taste in the bourgeois interpretation of that concept at the moment when he publicly called his guest or viewer on the telephone line a fool, but he has done that for a long time. Seeking the boundary of that taste in measuring the specific seriousness of the concepts of "fool" or "idiot," as the OTV program director is trying to do, is only a good way to cover up the essential thing. That is that Malnar has considerably overturned a medium, that he used it to show something else, the ugly face of our reality and ourselves, and in order to shove that picture in the faces of everyone who watched Nightmare Stage, thus committing an unforgivable media sin--he did not play up to the vanity of the viewers, but instead, in a way peculiar to himself, activated their critical capability, and forced them to think. Bolkovic formulates it this way: "I am criticizing him because he turned an entertainment broadcast into a political one, because he was not paid to present his political opinions. He is here to entertain people, and not to insult them, and therefore he has to distinguish independence from anarchy." Turning Off the Disobedient Consequently, who is it that will "turn off" the disobedient child of the Croatian media? Is it an institution that is a throwback to the former cat paws of the political power centers, or is it the adult, enlightened viewer (reader) who can do it by pressing the remote control, i.e., ceasing to buy this or that news? In Malnar's case, judging by his show's audience (unusually large for its slot), the viewers are not the ones who pressed the remote control button, the one that brings darkness. It was done by an institution that was least interested in an enlightened, mature public, which can hardly be manipulated. In this case "stopping Malnar" and all the other similar cases in the media world are almost superfluous, unnecessary steps. The Croatian media's influence upon public life is insignificant, and almost nil. For example, we do not remember when any article or radio or television program that provided arguments and documentation in favor of "removing" some forms of public life or individuals from public life has initiated change. In the last few years, the pages of newspapers have been full of examples of violations of the Constitution and positive legal regulations, theft (illegal acquisition of property), war profiteering, the abuse of one's position, crime.... In an insignificant number of cases, the articles have been denied. In most cases, people acted according to the logic that articles live until the last issue, and they counted, not without reason, on their being forgotten. It was rare that they were followed by any official investigation, resignation, or explanation; people rarely were held responsible for the consequences. Role of the Loudspeaker In that sense, the blocking of the scheduled HRT broadcast Latinica, in which the first commander of the Vukovar defense, Mile Dedakovic, and the controversial Mile Mercep were to appear, was completely superfluous. In view of the series of ambiguities and contradictory information about the defense of Vukovar, about the role of individuals in its defense, one can assume what the topic of conversation would have been. It is equally possible to assume that on that occasion a lot of what is colloquially called "dirty laundry" would have been presented, which actually does not mean anything more than facts that mental hygienists claim are not suitable for the average Croatian ear. By "turning off" the above-mentioned guests, the mental hygienists indirectly and probably unconsciously, but very precisely, indicated what kind of media they would like. In any case, they would not like media that would be responsible to the public and for which true, honest journalism would be the foundation and only reason for action, and not even journalism that would "dabble in" awkward topics and write critically, without calculations, because, it seems, this is not the right time or the right moment. Unfortunately, a considerable portion of the media have consented to the role of a loudspeaker, recognizing, in the chain of responsibility, only responsibility upward. In that kind of distorted division of roles, anything is possible. It is thus even possible to turn telephones into remote controls, which at the same time "turn off" journalists and directors, and lower the blind on the "window to the world."
