Experts believed that the vehicle is soon to enter average urban households. Whenever the new red-and-white model is parked somewhere in Tianjin, it draws a crowd. Some say they want to buy one immediately. The small car, 2.3 meters long and 1.3 meters wide, can squeeze through narrow lanes. Its top speed is 70 km per hour, and it sells for about 20,000 yuan. Car experts from the China automobile technology research center refer to the new model as China's "Star of Hope," meaning the car is made for average wage-earners. Making family cars in China has remained a hot topic for many Chinese sociologists and car-makers. Many of them are setting their sights on the cheap mini-car as more expensive models will be out of the reach of most of Chinese urban families. Thus far, more than 30 institutions are conducting studies into mini-car models and four types have emerged for recommendation, according to experts from the Automobile Technology Research Center. Preliminary tests by the research center show that the new model in Tianjin can be used to carry both people and goods and that it is most desirable in terms of its performance, cost and low level of exhaust emission. It is an advanced model of mini-car in China, they say. Huang Jianwu, a senior engineer and head of the Tianjin mini-car research team, said that the new model, something in between the motorcar and motor-tricycle, is cheap and suitable for a family of three and therefore has a bright market potential.
