Interim president, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, insists that the discussion must first of all find out why the civil population continues to carry arms. The opposition disagrees saying the only way to guarantee minimum security for the population is to immediately neutralise armed gangs. The disagreement has automatically stalled efforts to find a lasting solution to the civil strife in the central African country where thousands of people have perished in the blood bath sparked by the killing of President Melchior Ndadaye in a failed coup in October 1993. Some leaders of the ruling Front for Democracy in Burundi (Frodebu), led by Interior Minister Leonard Nyangoma -- who was away from the country for a month at the height of the crisis -- totally oppose disarming of the civil population. For them, the question of surrendering arms to the military does not arise. It is expected that the armed gangs operating in Kamenge (a hot spot in the northern part of Bujumbura) will resist if the military try to disarm them by force. On Saturday [23 April], the Burundi Government issued a 48-hour ultimatum to civilians carrying firearms -- legally or illegally acquired -- to surrender them to administrative authorities in their areas before 6 PM local time (16:00 GMT) on Sunday. The Hutu population (majority ethnic group but a minority in the Armed Forces since the bloody events of 1972 which deprived Hutus of top positions in the government) have been stocking weapons, with the collaboration of the authorities, since the assassination of Ndadaye. To justify this attitude, the Hutus say that the Army, which is dominated by the Tutsi minority ethnic group and responsible for Ndadaye's assassination, cannot be trusted and should be disbanded. As a consequence, armed militias have been set up in the two camps. Hutu youths, most of whom are unemployed, are demanding to be enlisted into the Army and Gendarmerie (mobile police) in the same numbers as their Tutsi counterparts. They threaten to use the type of force witnessed recently in Kamenge if their demands are not met. The Hutu youths receive support from the unregistered Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People (Palipehutu), an extremist movement based in neighbouring Rwanda. In November 1991, it carried out a futile armed attack on military positions in the capital.
