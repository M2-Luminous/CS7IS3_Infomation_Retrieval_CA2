But what does V. Novodvorskaya, the scandalously well-known leader of the RDU [Russian Democratic Union], offer that is new? Well, nothing. That very same unpardonable extremism and the very same frenzied persistence to inflame the situation in society. The expressions themselves are interesting: "troglodytic ideas," "Red cannibals," "enemies of the human race," etc. It is possible, of course, to react in different ways to Zhirinovskiy's party and the Communists and to those results that characterize the elections to the State Duma. But no kind of moral restrictions exist for V. Novodvorskaya. The RDU does not recognize the results of the elections, even if the whole solar system votes for the "red-browns." It is not so much the barefaced malevolence and disregard for the law that puts one on guard. Far more dangerous are the instigating appeals. There is an appeal to the president of the Russian Federation in the leaflet to act with the new parliament just as was done with the Supreme Soviet. Support at the barricades is assured. There is a request "immediately to create a national guard from among his devoted followers and to arm it for the defense of democracy." It turns out that RDU members "are ready to fight to the death for freedom, as in August 1991, and as on the night of 4 October." Come to your senses, Miss Novodvorskaya! We remember those tragedies. They should be a stern lesson for everyone. The revanchist delirium is akin to fascism. Again a summons to confrontation, a thirst for bloody conflicts. It is startling that everything is possible in Russia, and no one is responsible for his provocative appeals and actions. Everyone, as the saying goes, gets away with it unpunished. The leaflet in many ways is directed at B.N. Yeltsin. Lord! Save our president from such advisers and defenders.
