FR940204-1-00005 FR940204-1-00001 The Petroleum Equivalency Factor is determined as follows: E:GRAPHICSEP04FE94.000 where: DPF = driving pattern factor n t = average national electrical transmission efficiency AF = accessory factor E total = total output electricity generation mix (%) I i = input electricity generation of fuel i (%) V i = relative scarcity factor of fuel i Each of these factors is described in further detail below: 1. Driving Pattern Factor Section 503(c)(3)(A)(iv) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act requires that DOE take into account ``the specific driving patterns of electric vehicles as compared with those of petroleum-fueled vehicles.'' The driving pattern factor is the ratio of annual vehicle miles travelled for an electric vehicle to that of a petroleum-fueled vehicle. Since there is an insufficient number of electric vehicles in service for use as a sample, a factor of 100 percent (1.00) will be used until such time DOE has collected sufficient data to show otherwise.
