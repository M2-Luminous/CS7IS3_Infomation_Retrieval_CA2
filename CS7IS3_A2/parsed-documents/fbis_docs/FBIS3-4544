The 600-word MATICHON editorial, on page 2, entitled: "Vang Pao -- A Man in a Wrong Era," says: "The action by the Supreme Command can be regarded as sincerity on the part of the Thai Government in showing the Lao Government that it has not ignored rightist attempts to undermine the Lao Government. Efforts by these rightists to organize the overthrow of the Lao Government amounts to an anachronism. The Cold War, when ideological differences between neighboring countries led to their support of subversive activities against one another, is over." The editorial continues: "The current world is one of cooperation for economic development and prosperity," adding that the situation between Thailand and Laos has developed into an era of cooperation for mutual benefit. "Therefore, Gen. Vang Pao and his followers who continue to cling to building up an army to topple the Lao Government are living in the wrong world. It is odd that Vang Pao has chosen to live in exile in the United States surrounded by modern technology and thinking. Vang Pao was once a political pawn serving the United States. One wonders, however, if he is still serving in the same capacity or simply could not shed his past. "The Thai Government must keep in touch with world developments. If Thailand wants to be the region's economic leader, the Government must show its sincerity in engaging in economic cooperation with its neighbors -- Laos, Burma, or Cambodia. So far, to its credit the Government has shown that it has not gotten involved with rebel groups opposing those governments. This will win their trust and eventually their economic cooperation." The 600-word KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT editorial, on page 2, entitled: "The Stand Must Change With Time," says: "It is strange that the Thai Government did not take action against the Lao rightist generals itself, letting the Supreme Command do it instead. The government has direct responsibility here. It is possible that it does not have enough information, as in case of the arms cache in Chanthaburi Province. "In any event, the action against the Lao rightist generals should have been taken long ago, when the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] Government received the recognition of the international community, including the United Nations. The action was not taken earlier possibly because previous Thai governments nurtured the hope that the rightists would be able to overthrow the LPDR Government and return to power. It knew that the rightists remained active and used Thai territory as a sanctuary for their operations in Laos. At that time the LPDR Government accused Thailand of supporting the Lao rightists. However, the Thai Government ignored the accusation, and thus made the Lao rightists more bold in their subversive activities." The editorial continues: "The publicized action by the Thai military against Vang Pao and his followers is necessary because Thailand has to show its clear stance toward the LPDR as diplomatic and trade contacts with that country become increasingly greater. The Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge will be opened soon, and Thailand cannot afford to be unclear in its stand. Gen. Vang Pao and his followers ought to understand their own position and Thailand's new position and quickly cease subversive activities against the Lao Government."
