During the last round of negotiations, which concluded today at about 2000, the government negotiators and the Alfa Cartel representatives signed a convention that contains, among other things, a number of solutions to the basic problems formulated by the union party. They established, in mutual agreement, new ways to implement Government Decision 13, which refers to that part of salaries for which no additional taxes are to be paid. It was accepted that new efficiency indicators will be recognized other than those established by Government Decision 171 of 1994, such as increases in physical labor productivity, increases in the weight of the income earned from exports in the balance of companies' total income, and others. Referring to the conclusion of the collective labor contracts, the parties agreed that before 22 June 1994 the divergent points between the Alfa Cartel and the employers is to be mediated by Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. They also agreed upon the finalization of certain draft laws with a union connotation and the government pledged to forward them to Parliament in emergency procedure. They found solutions suiting both parties on the observance, in the case of retirees, of the salary grades acquired between 1990-1994, as well as a new mechanism of indexing salaries and minimal salaries throughout the whole economy. According to the convention, minimal salaries are to be increased beginning 1 July 1994 to 65,000 lei per month, and every three months the government, together with the trade unions and the employers, will reestablish its level in accordance with the evolution of macroeconomic indicators and average salaries in each economic branch. The conclusion of the negotiations between the government and the trade unions, with results that both parties termed satisfactory, proves once more the government's readiness to dialogue and its realistic way of approaching the problems raised by the trade union confederations. The idea ought to be reiterated that open dialogue, rather than the pressure of the street, represents the sole way of solving all hardships that emerge in the evolution of society, concludes the communique sent to us via fax by the government spokesman. After the aforementioned convention was elaborated, the union representatives who had attended the negotiations with the government read out the text of that document in Victory Square; it was then approved, point by point, by the persons in that square. At about 2120 the government party and the union delegation signed the convention. According to Alfa Cartel leader Bogdan Hossu, the trucks that have been parked in front of the government headquarters for the past three days are scheduled to leave Victory Square at this time.
