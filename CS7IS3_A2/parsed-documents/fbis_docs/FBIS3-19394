A part of the relations among the Balkan countries is far from today's European reality, burdened with historical motives, frustrations, and striving to be the top state. Because of all that it is necessary to Europeanize the Balkans with a specific European project. By contrast, the threat of the Balkanization of the other European regions is not to be underestimated." A Working Visit With All Official Elements This is what, among other things, President Kiro Gligorov of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] stated in his address to about a hundred politicians, ambassadors, and journalists, at the rally called "Europe-Dialogue" that is being held in Bonn for the third time. The subject of this year's meeting was "The road to Europe -- too many conflicts." Its participants, among whom were President Gligorov and Slovene President Milan Kucan, tried to contribute by explaining their own perspectives, geopolitical positions, and the development of their own states, to find the roads leading to further development of Europe, which has been meandering about in the effort to shape its role, and place, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disappearance of the bloc division. President Kiro Gligorov arrived in Germany last night, at the invitation of the Europe-Dialogue Association, chaired by Madame Rita Suessmuth, president of the German Bundestag. By its nature, the visit is in the category of so-called working visits. However the hosts did their best to give it all the elements of an official state visit. This afternoon President Gligorov had a 45-minute talk with German President Richard von Weizsaecker. For tomorrow morning, meetings and discussions with Minister-President Johannes Rau and Wolfgang Clement, head of the State Office of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, to which Bonn belongs, are planned. On Thursday [17 March], the last day of the visit, President Gligorov will have a meeting with Klaus Kinkel, federal vice chancellor, in charge of all the foreign political activities in this preelection period in Germany, since Chancellor Helmut Kohl is fully engaged in domestic affairs. Aside from these three central meetings, the program for President Gligorov comprises a series of contacts with the leaders of the more important parties in the country, with the Macedonians living and working in Germany, as well as a tour of the sights in Bonn, and so on. Danger of a New European Division The subject of today's rally only seemingly limited the issues under debate. The conflict in Bosnia and the danger of its spreading to the southern Balkans is definitely the most difficult conflict, but not the only one faced by Europe on the eve of the new millennium. Freed from the old balance resulting from the fear generated by the blocs, Europe does not have a clear vision of how to harmonize and neutralize the other conflicts that are erupting or threatening to erupt: the ethnic resurgence and desire for emancipation; the unequal degree to which the new states are developed economically, democratically, and judicially; the incongruous spiritual and cultural values that more or less endanger the civilized achievements of the European Union. Does the European Union have to transform itself and be selective and cautious in opening itself only to the most successful? Do the countries of Central and southern Europe have to organize themselves into a second Europe, and Russia into a third -- para-Europe, because the European Union is closed? In other words, do the old divisions have to be replaced by new ones, and can Europe embark on the new century with three or more gears, without it having an impact on the stabilization and prosperity of the whole continent, including its most developed part? The hosts wanted to hear the opinions of their guests, President Kiro Gligorov and President Milan Kucan, from the south of Europe. The Slovene President hastened to say that Slovenia was not the Balkans, that it was geographically, culturally, and spiritually attached to Central Europe. Therefore, its wish to be integrated in the European Union was legitimate. President Gligorov replied that, "contrary to Slovenia, FYROM is in the Balkans, like Greece, which is already a member of the European Union, and the Balkans is a part of Europe. The geographical position cannot be a criterion for including or leaving a country out of the European integrating movements. There certainly should be criteria, but they should be sought in the degree of true European orientation of each country, in its democratic development, in the promptness with which it applies the principles of civilization acceptable for Europe. In doing so, some countries will certainly enter Europe sooner, but others, like FYROM, will perhaps need 10 to 15 years. Nevertheless it is important to keep the road to Europe open to all countries." How Can Europe Help How can developed Europe, that is the European Union, help in the settlement of conflicts like the war in Bosnia, or the FYROM-Greek dispute, which are direct or indirect threats to its stability and prosperity? "Europe has clear-cut principles in the Helsinki documents, and it will do its best to implement them," President Kiro Gligorov said. "Those principles, for instance the regulation on not changing borders by force, cannot be taken pragmatically, as has been the case with Bosnia, starting from the wrong premise that Bosnia and Herzegovina is an artificial creation. The territories of this republic never belonged to the Serbian or the Croat state. Bosnia existed as a separate entity during the Turkish Empire and also later on, under Austria and Hungary. Only after the promotion of the thesis `all Serbs in one state,' or `all Croats in one state,' did the Muslim population living there turn to a goal it never sought in the past -- to the formation of its own Muslim state. ``The division of Bosnia and Herzegovina will lead nowhere and solve nothing. It will just represent a precedent in which Europe will open up the possibility for the Balkanization of new European regions, that is, for changing borders by force, for new ethnic cleansing and bloodshed. ``Europe can also solve the FYROM-Greek dispute by a consistent implementation of its principles. Thus, it will encourage both sides to implement the same principles in their mutual relations. This means all problems should be brought to the negotiating table and an attempt be made to try and solve them through civilized dialogue. I am convinced we can find solutions for all the questions burdening our relations through dialogue. However, those solutions must come as a result of discussion, of an agreement, of mutual compromises -- without ultimatums and pressures, without previous conditions.''
