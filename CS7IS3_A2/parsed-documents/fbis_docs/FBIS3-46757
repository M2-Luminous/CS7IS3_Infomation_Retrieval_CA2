The Armed Forces (ABRI) spokesman, Brigadier General Syarwan Hamid assured in a written announcement yesterday that ABRI will stick to its commitment to continue to uphold the policy of openness. "There is no reason to step back. If openness recedes, it means that ABRI's dual function is failing," Syarwan Hamid said. He explained that the wave of criticism and demands surging as of late was a logical consequence of the policy of openness. In general, he said, the aspirations expressed are tolerable since they have come from a sincere wish to improve the situation. However, he pointed out that there is a small group of people using methods inappropriate to our political culture, which focus on highly sensitive issues. In such cases, Syarwan said, ABRI will not tolerate their actions. "We know them well enough since it is always a group comprising the same people," he said. Syarwan appealed to the public not to force ABRI to use repressive means. "There is a limit to everything, and at a certain point ABRI cannot turn back." Therefore, he suggested that all parties apply wisdom and conscience in restraining themselves. "But on the whole, ABRI is committed to not stepping back from the openness policy. We are also prepared for any consequences of the policy. We are also committed to our role of tut wuri handayani (following while providing guidance)," he said. In summing up, Syarwan Hamid's statement feels like a fresh breeze -- the kind of relief one might wish for at a desperate moment. From the statement, one not only derives the desired assurance, but feels that the words contain wisdom and sincerity as well. Many of us may remember how a few weeks ago, a statement from Major General Sembiring Meliala caused an uproar when he hinted that ABRI was not happy at taking a back seat role -- tut wuri handayani -- which results from new directives outlined by President Suharto several months ago. Sembiring later explained that his statement was misunderstood. However that may be, many people continued to believe that somehow it reflected the majority feeling in ABRI. Now, with his statement, Syarwan Hamid has indirectly assured the public that this view is untrue. Frankly speaking, there is nothing wrong with ABRI's new role. From any possible point of view, ABRI will remain the backbone of our national stability. In the context of its dual function, apparently the time has come for ABRI to switch its role from that of a stabilizing agent to that of a dynamizing one. And to dynamize the country and the nation, ABRI is to stay at the back and from that position help to push forward the nation's democratization process. And openness is an inherent part of that process. Thus, we heartily welcome Syarwan Hamid's statement. But we must also underline his point that all of us should exercise wisdom and restraint at all times. We have come this far and we surely do not want to go back into the black hole we were in before. Ahead of us we can see a shining bright future. And only if we join hands can we be sure to reach it. As for the "small group" of people Syarwan referred to, such groups can be found in any society. We should deal with them wisely since, after all, they are a part of us and in a way those "angry young men" may serve as vanguards of our conscience. And in this mad, mad world, maintaining and protecting our integrity and our conscience is perhaps the most difficult task of all.
