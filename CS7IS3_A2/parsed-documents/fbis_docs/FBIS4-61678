FBIS4-61678 "drsov089_e_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-089 Daily Report 5 May 1994 UKRAINE International Affairs Kravchuk, Official on Economic Cooperation With U.S. Kravchuk, Official on Economic Cooperation With U.S. LD0505185094 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1629 GMT 5 May 94 LD0505185094 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No 86 (576)] [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk hopes that the Supreme Soviet of a new convocation will ratify the agreements on economic cooperation between the United States and Ukraine signed this January during Kravchuk's visit to the United States. Kravchuk declared about this during his meeting with the head of the U.S. economic delegation Nicholas Burns in Kiev. The delegation of the American experts came to Ukraine to get acquainted with the economic situation in the republic and to determine possibilities to use economic aid to Ukraine totaling 350 million dollars. After this meeting Kravchuk reported to journalists that the United States intends to render assistance to Ukraine in order to re-struct [as received] its economy and to develop cooperation with the republic in the field of trade and investments. In Burns' words, a Ukrainian-American fund in support of entrepreneurs in Ukraine will be created this summer. It will grant credits and loans to Ukrainian private entrepreneurs. Our Interfax correspondent reports from Kiev that at the negotiations with the members of the American economic delegation underway in Kiev the Ukrainian party proposed to use part of the allocated credit as a pledge to receive credit from one of the large foreign banks. According to Ukraine's Economics Minister Roman Shpek, Kiev is not ready "to use 350 million dollars in the near future." Leadership of the Ukrainian cabinet was critical of Washington's position which presented too many provisions in order to grant concrete economic assistance. In particular, as Vice Premier Valentin Landik said, in accordance with the proposals of the American party 95 million dollars in support of private undertaking would be allocated only after refusal from rent as a means of denationalization of property. In the opinion of the American experts, rent can hinder "voucher privatization" which they view as the most efficient method to reform the property. Landik called members of the American delegation to decline the above mentioned provisions and private calls "to start reforms." In Landik's words, diminishing of the inflation to 5.7 percent and beginning of privatization testify to the fact that reforms in Ukraine have been started and they need concrete support. At the negotiations the American party also persisted in introduction of a market exchange rate of the Ukrainian karbovanets with respect to hard currency. For his part, Landik declared that "the state will preserve regulation of the karbovanets rate in the course of the crisis' surmounting." In his interview with Interfax on Thursday Landik declared that the resolution of the Ukrainian government On Urgent Measures to Surmount the Payment Crisis issued on Wednesday called to grant an opportunity to enterprises "to unfold their wings" and to go out of the non-payments' crisis peculiar to all former Soviet states. According to Landik, lowering of tariffs for the value added tax (to 20 percent) and replacement of income tax for profit (since January 1, 1995) should assist in improving financial situation of the Ukrainian enterprises. As Landik noted, introduction of increased rates for customs tariffs for import of alcoholic beverages and tobacco goods is primarily intended to protect a Ukrainian producer. At the same time he pointed out that this measure does not concern import from CIS countries, including Russia. "From now on import tariffs will be revised every week, this will help to quickly react to the market's economic conditions," Landik reported. Commenting the situation on the introduction of state monopoly for production and trade with alcoholic beverages, Landik said that Ukraine's Cabinet of Minister had examined Russia's experience but it would predominantly use Austria's experience.
