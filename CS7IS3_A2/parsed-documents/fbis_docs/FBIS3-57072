Bendinskas, who is a member of the forum, said the matter will be decided by all representatives of the organization in parliament. The forum participated in parliamentary elections on the list of Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDLP]. In Bendinskas' words, the forum currently holds 22 seats. A possibility to form a new faction appeared when the parliament amended its statute and allowed to create faction regardless of affiliation in pre-election lists. Up until now, the ruling LDLP faction had 71 seats and enjoyed an absolute majority. If it loses 22 members, as well several others who intend to leave it during faction reregistration, the ruling faction will become almost equal to the rightist opposition coalition in size. There is a possibility, however, that the ruling majority will remain as unified as earlier when dealing with key issues.
