Sergio Caramana, coordinator of the International Commission of Support and Verification-OAS (CIAV-OEA), confirmed the postponement to ACAN-EFE. Caramana is participating in the talks that will lead to the disarmament of the FN 3-80, which comprises mostly 400 former contra fighters. Recontra leader Jose Angel Talavera, alias "El Chacal" asked that this first direct meeting with the government to be postponed until next week. The meeting will define the disarmament process for the rebels operating in the northern region of the country. According to official sources, "El Chacal" justified his request by indicating that there is still a heavy Army presence in the northern regions bordering Honduras where the recontras focus their operations and where the first negotiation meeting was to be held. The redeployment of Army forces from these areas, where heavy fighting occurred in January, was one of the rebels' demands for talks to begin. The recontra leader also said there were other minor reasons for postponing the talks, including a lack of communication with the rest of the FN 3-80 high command. An official source told ACAN-EFE that Talavera is asking for six more days because he has been unable to contact all of his forces, and therefore they do not know enough about the government's disarmament proposal. The meeting between the government and the recontras was scheduled to take place in Ciudad Antigua, near Honduras, with the presence of a mediating commission composed of representatives from the Catholic Church and the OAS. Caramana said: "We are all working to try and overcome these last minute glitches." He added that despite the postponement it is the express will of the government and the rebels to bring the armed conflict, that continues to harm Nicaragua, to an end. Sandinist Deputy Carlos Gallo, president of the Congressional Human Rights Commission, told ACAN-EFE the rebels have presented last minute demands for their disarmament. According to Gallo, the "recontras" demanded the creation of a safety zone or enclave and the concentration of military forces in 12 northern municipalities to be located in Nueva Segovia, Esteli, Matagalpa, and Jinotega. All of these communities are located along the Honduran border. The rebels also said talks will begin seven days after the military redeployment process is complete. Gallo, speaking with ACAN-EFE, said this new element brings the talks to a standstill. An official source explained that members of the mediation commission were discussing the new conditions with the government and a formal response to the recontra's proposal will be released shortly. The Army and the rebels each called their own cease-fire on 10 February to allow the disarmament negotiations to begin. The recontra problem surfaced in 1990, shortly after President Violeta Chamorro took office. Several thousand of the 22,000 demobilized contras took up their weapons again because the government failed to fulfill the demobilization agreements. According to official sources, approximately 800 rearmed rebels, including recontras, former Sandinist soldiers known as recompas, and common criminals, are operating in the north and central regions of the country.
