Take notice that on September 27, 1994, Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (Algonquin) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, certain revised tariff sheets listed in Appendix A to its ``Motion for Leave to Answer Protest and Answer to Protest'' in this proceeding. Algonquin states that the revised tariff sheets are being filed in order to eliminate the Gas Research Institute (GRI) surcharge for Rate Schedule X&hyph;37. That surcharge was inadvertently included for Rate Schedule X&hyph;37 service on the tariff sheets originally filed to implement the March 1, 1994, Stipulation approved by the Commission's July 8, 1994, Order Approving Settlements in Docket Nos. RP93&hyph;14&hyph;000, et al. 1 Algonquin further states that acceptance of the filing resolves the issue of the collection of a GRI surcharge from New England Power company (NEP) under Rate Schedule X&hyph;37, and renders moot NEP's protest objecting to the GRI surcharge. 1 68 FERC Â¶ 61,039 (1994). Algonquin states that copies of the filing have been served upon all parties on the official service list compiled by the Secretary in this proceeding.

All such protests should be filed on or before October 7, 1994.
