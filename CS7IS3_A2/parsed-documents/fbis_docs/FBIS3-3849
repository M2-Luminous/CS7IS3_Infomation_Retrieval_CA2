Air-traffic control first started in Shanghai in May, 1992, with two sectors opened, one extending to the south and the other to the north. But the sharp rise in the number of flights has far exceeded the ceiling limit in a single regulatory sector, which could be a threat to safety. The new fan-shaped control area stretches to the east to strike a balance of flight numbers.
