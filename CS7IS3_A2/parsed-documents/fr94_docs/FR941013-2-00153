FR941013-2-00153 FR941013-2-00104 Notice of Termination of Sanctions With Respect to Japan Pursuant to Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 AGENCY: Office of the United States Trade Representative. ACTION: Termination of sanctions scheduled to be imposed on Japan pursuant to Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. SUMMARY: On October 4, 1994, the United States Trade Representative determined that sanctions, scheduled to go into effect on Japanese goods and services on September 30, 1994, under Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, should be terminated, effective September 30, 1994, as a result of an agreement between the United States and Japan relating to procurement of telecommunications and medical technology goods and services. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Wendy Silberman, Office of Japan and China Affairs (202&hyph;395&hyph;3900), or Laura B. Sherman, Office of the General Counsel (202&hyph;395&hyph;3150), Office of the United States Trade Representative, 600 Seventeenth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20506. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 31, 1994, the Administration cited Japan under Title VII of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 2515, as amended) as a country that maintains, in government procurement of telecommunications and medical technology goods and services, a significant and persistent pattern or practice discrimination against U.S. products or services that results in identifiable harm to U.S. businesses. Title VII provides that if the identified practices are not satisfactorily addressed during a 60-day consultation period, then the President must formally identify the country and the statutory sanctions take effect on the following day. On October 1, 1994, the Governments of the United States and Japan reached an agreement relating to procurement of telecommunications and medical technology goods and services. The Japanese Government agreed to adopt improved procurement measures. These new measures and an accompanying exchange of letters between the United States and Japan address all the major U.S. concerns in the telecommunications and medical technology sectors. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) concluded that implementation of the improved measures and the accompanying exchange of letters will eliminate the discrimination identified under Title VII. Based on delegation of authority from the President, the USTR terminated sanctions effective September 30, 1994. A copy of the USTR's determination is attached. Frederick L. Montgomery, Chairman, Trade Policy Staff Committee.
