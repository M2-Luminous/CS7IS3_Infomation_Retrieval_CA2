Sources in the city said that the demonstrators, most of whom are clients and depositors of the "Waliyy ol-Asr" loans and savings company, which was established in 1991 by senior clerics, protested against the "disappearance" of some 12 billion riyals they had deposited in the company. Demonstrators chanted slogans, calling for the overthrow of 'Ali Khamene'i, the republic's guide, and President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. It is worth noting that, in the absence of a sound banking system, loans and savings companies thrived rapidly as a result of the interest rates they offer their clients. But most of these companies, which were established with the blessings of clerics, have become bankrupt quickly.
