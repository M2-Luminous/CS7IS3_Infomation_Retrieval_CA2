According to official information, aspects of bilateral relations were discussed, and so was further economic cooperation regarding implementation of the instructions of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on ratification of the START I Treaty. To a question from an UNIAN correspondent, Viktor Stelmakh, press secretary of the president of Ukraine, replied, that "the meeting was of an essentially confidential nature and not a single agreement was signed." The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine refused a request to comment on the results of this conversation, referring to a lack of authority on the part of the embassy's leadership. Anton Buteyko, head of the service of the president of Ukraine on international issues, who was present at the talks, explained that the meeting had been brought about by the telephone conversation between Leonid Kravchuk and [U.S. President] Bill Clinton regarding ratification of the START I Treaty. William Miller and Leonid Kravchuk discussed the course of implementation of accords on the matter of nuclear disarmament and ways of improving economic cooperation and exchanged opinions on a wide range of issues. The U.S. ambassador reported on America's attitude to the ratification of the START I Treaty. The diplomatic circles of the world are noting the equivocal reaction of the American leadership to Ukraine's attitude to nuclear disarmament. In particular, commenting on the talks of U.S. Vice-President Albert Gore in Kyrgyzstan, U.S. information agencies are stressing that Kazakhstan and Belarus recently ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Western commentators are venturing the opinion that [a visit] to Kiev is not envisaged among the planned visits of the U.S. President and Vice-President for the near future namely because Ukraine's stance is different from the Belarusian and Kazakh stance. They have a calmer attitude to this matter at the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One of the employees of the foreign policy department commented, "This is normal diplomatic practice, acceptable in all states. Remember if you will the postponement of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan or the visits of the presidents of Romania and Bulgaria to Ukraine."
