FR940817-1-00046 FR940817-1-00013 The proposed revision to the current regulation would change the 6-month currency requirement to be specified in hours instead of months. The 1,000 hours of experience specified in the proposal approximately equal the current 6-month full-time experience requirement. Sections 66.85, 66.87, 66.89, 66.91 The proposed §§66.85, 66.87, 66.89, and 66.91 are based on current §§65.85, 65.87, 65.89, and 65.91, respectively. These sections refer to the additional privileges of the airframe rating, the powerplant rating, the display of certificates, and the inspection authorization, respectively. There are no substantive difference between these proposed sections for Part 66 and current corresponding sections in Part 65. Section 66.92 The proposed §66.92 prescribes the duration of an inspection authorization. This proposed section is based on §65.92 of the current FAR. There is one substantive difference between the proposed section and the current §65.92. Under the proposal, the expiration date of the inspection authorization would be extended to March 31 of the second year after its issuance. Under the current regulation, the inspection authorization expires on March 31 of each year. Section 66.93 The proposed §66.93 prescribed the renewal procedures for an inspection authorization and is based on current §65.93. The proposed section would extend the inspection authorization renewal requirement to every 2 years so that it would corresponds to the extension of the inspection authorization as proposed in §66.92 above. The proposal would permit the holder of an inspection authorization to use a combination of annual inspections, inspections of major repairs on major alterations, and progressive inspections to satisfy the renewal requirements for the inspection authorization. Participation in current inspection programs recommended by the manufacturer of other inspection programs established by the registered owner or operator under §91.409(f)(3) or (4) now also may be used to satisfy renewal requirements. To better facilitate the combination of these inspections, the proposal would change the currently specified 90-day period to a 3-month period. Under the current regulation, the holder of an inspection authorization may renew the authorization by attending and successfully completing a refresher course of not less than 8 hours, acceptable to the Administrator, during the 12-month period preceding the application for renewal. Because the proposal would change the duration of the inspection authorization to 24 months, the proposal would require that an inspection authorization refresher course or series of course consisting of a total of not less than 16 hours be taken in the 24 months preceding the application for renewal. The proposed rule does not change the total amount of instruction the applicant must complete in the 24-month preceding the application for renewal. The proposed rule also differs from the current regulation in that it only requires successful completion (as opposed to attendance and successful completion) of an inspection authorization refresher course. The proposal recognizes recent developments in instructional techniques and permits instruction methods, acceptable to the Administrator, that may differ from the standard classroom or lecture format. Section 66.95 The proposed §66.95 prescribes the privileges and limitations of an inspection authorization and is based on current §65.95 with no substantive differences. Part 66 Subpart C The structure of part 66, Subpart C, is based upon the current structure of Part 65, Subpart D. Under the proposed rule, the title of Part 66, Subpart C, would become ``Aviation Repair Specialists'' Section 66.101 The proposed §66.101 would prescribe the general eligibility requirements for the aviation repair specialist certificate. This proposed section is based on current §65.101. The proposal would specify the current 18-month experience requirement in hours instead of months. The 3,000 hours of experience specified in the proposal approximately equal the current full-time 18-month experience requirement.
