"They told us that there were no more than four of us, but in fact there are 44 of us," Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli said, referring to the number of seats won by the Christian Democratic Center [CCD]. Together with Pierferdinando Casini and Francesco D'Onofrio, they made their appearance at the Jolly Hotel, the headquarters of Forza Italia's allies; they thanked [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi who, with an act of "great generosity," took them under his wing, and they celebrated their success and at the same time [PPI Secretary] Mino Martinazzoli's sad and lonely defeat. They have won, but they remain obsessed with the PPI and their former party comrades. Casini urged them to consider the results, which "show that D'Onofrio was right to describe the birth of the CCD and the PPI as the birth of twins. At the time we were described as naive. I think that whoever said that must now eat their words; perhaps they alone were naive." The CCD savored the subtle pleasure of being able to say: "Look, we were politically right; the election results have confirmed our option." Casini said: "The DC's [Christian Democratic Party] traditional centrality is over; in a bipolar arrangement, people opted for the pole of freedoms." This assertion was used to justify another blow to the PPI. "When people at PPI headquarters still talk about votes for the National Alliance as votes for the neo-fascists, it means that the leadership has still not realized that those are former DC votes. I hope that the PPI is now reappraising a line that was strongly tilted to the Left, and that was therefore mistaken." This, because, the CCD says, they are the real center -- the liberal Catholics who opted to stand with Berlusconi in order to prevent the likely victory of the Left. An unhealed wound remains from the split over alliances, a rift that has not closed at all, in view of the fact that Casini said: "Tomorrow we will hold a meeting of our leadership to request membership of the Christian Democratic International." The deputy for Bologna gave to understand that he derives the right to do so from the election result -- a right which Helmut Kohl and the other European Christian democratic leaders cannot pretend not to recognize. Someone drew attention to a statement by Formigoni [PPI], who spoke about a reflection, a prompt decision by the PPI on what political position to occupy, and a possible turn toward the moderate Right. Mastella immediately opened the door to a dialogue with the PPI: "I hope that they will be calm and free of any preconceptions. Be that as it may, they must know that it is not impossible to engage in discussions with us, and they must keep it in mind after their initial period of mourning." At the start Clemente Mastella said that he would speak out only now after a lengthy silence. However, his silence did not prevent him from being elected. Now he can say: "We took a gamble, a gamble on a risky venture. We were treated like children that might suffer erosion or the risk of lack of public understanding; but the results confirm that we were something more than a handful of children spread around Italy, and that we enjoy a representativeness that is in some respects equal to that of the Popular Party." Mastella wanted to talk about the future too: "I realize that this country needs to be governed," he said, identifying Berlusconi as the next prime minister: "He has scored a clear victory, and achieved a political miracle. To ignore this," he said, "would be unjust, partly because he, more than anyone else, believed in the building of this pole." However, he leads us to understand that now it is necessary to move on from electoral alliances to political and government alliances. He stressed that there is no longer any "discrimination" against the Right. Hence the need for "much more clearly defined political convergences." This sounded like an appeal to [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi: "If factors of division were to prevail," Mastella said, "the election victory could turn into a political defeat. We have taken on an obligation to the voters, and we must find the way to honor it. I say to the League that it must overcome its anxieties about its allies in the south. Everyone now is agreed that the south no longer needs a welfare policy."
