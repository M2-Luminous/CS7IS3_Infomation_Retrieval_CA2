Most of the business concern belonging to big businessmen and industrialists remained closed. However, small markets and shopping centers generally remained open. Petroleum dealers and transporters did not pay heed to the strike call. Fruit and vegetable markets, restaurants, utility stores, mohallah [petty] shops, and general stores and vendors also continued their normal business activities. Some traders continued their business with their shutters half closed. The stock exchanges of the country also remained open as usual, but trading was poor. The industrial sector responded to the strike call as most of the units suspended their activities. Most of the small traders condemned the strike and said the big businessmen always fleece masses with a big profit margin. They should make some sacrifice for the nation and avoid creating problems for the people. They were of the view that the strike call is politically motivated as these elements wanted to create hurdles for the government which is making efforts to streamline the country's economy in order to provide relief to the common man. [words indistinct] some traders told our representative that they are not in favor of the strike, but kept their premises closed for fear of Chamber's desperadoes. They said the strike is not in the national interest.
