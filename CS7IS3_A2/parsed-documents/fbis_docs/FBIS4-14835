"I counted on a candid conversation about the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis. Such a conversation did take place," Medetkan Sherimkulov, head of the delegation, told ITAR-TASS. Asked about a meeting between Azerbaijanian, Armenian parliamentaries and representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh slated to be held in Bishkek next May, Sherimkulov said, "it is premature to say whether the meeting will differ from other meetings in principle. If it takes place, it will be held at due level, and major interests of all the parties will be taken into account." The delegation flew in Yerevan on the same day to meet with members of the presidium and deputies of the Armenian Supreme Soviet (parliament). According to Parliament Speaker Babken Ararktsyan, "a new constructive approach to the Nagorno-Karabakh problem is beginning to show in Russia's initiatives." One can hardly overvaluate the significance of Russian initiatives, he noted. The involvement of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly will contribute to a peaceful solution of this problem. Ararktsyan confirmed that the Bishkek meeting between the parties involved in the conflict would take place. The delegation is to meet with Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan on Friday night and to leave Yerevan for Stepanakert in the morning on Saturday.
