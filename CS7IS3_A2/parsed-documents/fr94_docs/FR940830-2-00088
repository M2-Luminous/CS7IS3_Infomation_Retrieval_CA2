SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Current OHV use designations for public lands in the area, established in the Little Snake Resource Area Resource Management Plan, 1989, allow motorized vehicle use on and off the roads and trails year round. State and local agencies and neighboring landowners expressed concerns that the new Colorado Division of Wildlife's Grieve Conservation Easement would open the Fly Creek area to motorized traffic (consistent with the current RMP travel management designation) and cause unacceptable impacts to natural resources, especially wildlife and soils. The affected public lands include identified soil erosion hazard and important high quality big game habitat. The public lands are neighbored by private lands and in many places the boundaries are not marked or otherwise identified, thus creating potential trespass situations. The area also contains several grazing allotments which at times require motorized vehicle access by the permittee for maintenance of range facilities. Given due consideration of the concerns expressed by the public and the potential impacts of unrestricted motorized vehicle use, a modification of existing OHV use designations is necessary to adequately protect natural resources on public land, minimize conflicts with other uses, prevent trespass problems, and ensure public safety until the off-highway vehicle management portion of the little Snake Resource Area Resource Management Plan is reviewed and if necessary modified. Provisions will be made to allow for necessary motorized travel on the public lands for administrative purposes and to facilitate non-motorized public access, snowmobiles and travel on designated routes on public lands in the Fly Creek area. Public information, including detailed maps of the restricted area, roads and trails will be posted at the access sites and available in the Resource Area Office and District Office at the addresses shown below. Persons who are exempt from the restrictions contained in this notice include: 1. Any Federal, State, or local officers engaged in fire, emergency and law enforcement activities. 2. BLM employees engaged in official duties. 3. Persons or agencies holding a valid permit or right-of-way on or across the restricted public land for access to private land, for purposes related to the access of private land on said easement only. 4. Persons or agencies holding a special use permit or right-of-way accessing public lands for purposes consistent with the permit. 5. Grazing permittees authorized during the permitted grazing season for grazing related purposes provided such motorized use is limited to existing roads and trails and subject to any additional conditions in the grazing permit. Any motorized use before or after the permitted grazing season necessary for maintenance and operation of range facilities shall require advance approval by the authorized officer specifically authorizing such use and subject to whatever restrictions are deemed necessary. PENALTIES: Violations of this restriction order are punishable by fines not to exceed $1,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months.
