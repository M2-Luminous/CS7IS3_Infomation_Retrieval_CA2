Shakhray explained: "This year is likely to see ethnic tensions and inter-regional conflicts and to become a serious test of the federation's strength. To leave the government now would be an easy solution. I think it is my duty to continue my work of maintaining Russia's unity and integrity, to prevent or at least minimize the dangerous consequences of such conflicts. What is more, I think it would not be proper for me to leave the government when its reform wing is weakened." Shakhray said that he posed two conditions under which he would become the minister: making the ministry report directly to the prime minister and including him as minister into the government presidium. In his words, this was necessary in order to exert influence on regional policy. Shakhray was convinced that ethnic and regional problems had to be handled by a vice premier, "whatever his name is." Shakhray noted that members of his parliamentary group had become chairmen of State Duma regional policy, local self- government, and CIS affairs committees. He also emphasized that the group held "positions to be reckoned with" in the Federation Council, the upper house, where Ramazan Abdulatipov, a co-founder of the party, had been elected deputy chairman of the upper house. "Conditions have been created favoring constructive cooperation of the executive and legislative branches in dealing with regional matters," Shakhray emphasized.
