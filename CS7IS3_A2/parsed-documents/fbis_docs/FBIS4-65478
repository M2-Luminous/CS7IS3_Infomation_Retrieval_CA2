Prominent members like Theodhoros Pangalos and Vaso Papandreou were not elected, while Konstandinos Simitis just made it. The three are considered to be "antileaders." Akis Tsokhatzopoulos' team is considered responsible for the exclusion. Tsokhatzopoulos, who controls the largest group in the Central Committee and has Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's support, was triumphantly reelected secretary. Questions and Explanations Pangalos' and Papandreou's exclusion raises justified questions. This is because: -- The alternate foreign minister was triumphantly present at the recent congress, coming in second in voting after Yeoryios Yennimatas. In his case, PASOK's Central Committee disagreed with the feelings of the party's organized supporters. -- Vaso Papandreou was the big winner of the national elections, ranking first in Athens B District. She also did very well at the congress (she ranked sixth in the Central Committee voting). In her case, the Central Committee disagreed with PASOK's voting and partisan basis. -- Konstandinos Simitis was 12th out of 18 members. The last time, he was at the top of the Executive Bureau. Simitis and Pangalos are considered to be the two that will most probably pursue the party's leadership when Papandreou decides to resign. The outcome of the election the day before yesterday may be explained as follows: -- Pangalos "paid" for his recent, continuous, and "heretical" remarks on various issues. Mainly, however, he paid for his very recent statement that he will pursue the party's leadership. -- Simitis, who nearly did not get elected, "paid" for being against Tsokhatzopoulos at the party congress. Simitis was the only Executive Bureau member who insisted that a vote be taken on the incompatibility of being a secretary and a minister. It is well-known that the congress finally adopted this position. The day before yesterday, Tsokhatzopoulos' team "paid him back." Associates of the party's secretary and other officials blamed the small number of votes received by Simitis on the fact that his side is mainly responsible for the 29 blank votes cast during Tsokhatzopoulos election. -- It seems that Vaso Papandreou "paid" for her antileadership remarks, her accusations about the operation of mechanisms, and her rapid promotion through the mass media. Last night, PASOK members characteristically said that "it was Akis' [Tsokhatzopoulos] revenge" and expressed skepticism about future interparty operations, particularly what could happen when Papandreou leaves the leadership. Initiatives and Relaxation Initiatives are expected to be adopted in the next few days to relax the situation. Yerasimos Arsenis' (he ranked 7th) office mentioned that the defense minister intends to undertake a "joint and balanced" initiative so that future sector secretaries will be mutually accepted in order to end the Tsokhatzopoulos-Simitis dispute. Chamber of Deputies President Apostolos Kaklamanis, who ranked first, expressed similar views. Other impressive points of the election are: -- The failure of Karolos Papoulias and Evangelos Venizelos to get elected in the new Executive Bureau despite Papandreou's wishes. The prime minister appears dissatisfied with this development. Venizelos' failure is again attributed to Tsokhatzopoulos team, given that the government spokesman is the secretary's opponent in Thessaloniki. In the last elections, Venizelos ranked first. Indicatively, the organization's secretary in Thessaloniki, Ioannis Magkriotis, a close associate of Tsokhatzopoulos, was elected to the Executive Bureau. Papoulias' failure is attributed to the fact that he has minimal party involvement so far. -- That Kaklamanis was first. Kaklamanis wants to play the top role in PASOK when Papandreou decides to jump over to the presidency. In any case, the Chamber of Deputies president refrains from referring publicly to this issue and stresses his unifying role, which secured him first place. -- The failure of Yeoryios Papandreou, who did very well at the congress. Khatzimikhalis, a member of the former Executive Bureau, also was not elected. Anastasios Peponis, the deputy minister to the prime minister, who was a member of the former Executive Bureau, was not a candidate, saying he prefers to deal solely with his ministerial duties. -- That second place went to Konstandinos Laliotis who kept saying he is not a part of "groups and mechanisms." [passage omitted] Composition and Reaction Five ministers (Konstandinos Laliotis, Yerasimos Arsenis, Ioannis Souladhakis, Konstandinos Skandhalidhis, Konstandinos Simitis), a deputy minister (Andonios Kotsakas) and a ministry secretary general (Papaioannou) are in the new Executive Bureau. All of them can retain both positions, since the recent congress decision provides that at least nine of the Executive Bureau members should not have a government position. Eleven Executive Bureau members currently meet this requirement. Papandreou now has to name those who will participate in the Executive Bureau's Political Bureau and in the Executive Secretariat. After the outcome of the voting: -- Simitis said blocking mechanisms had operated, thus indirectly accusing Tsokhatzopoulos' side. He wished that the Central Committee "would realize that more unity is necessary." -- Vaso Papandreou noted that the congress had one view and the Central Committee another. In the same spirit, Pangalos said that the organized base of the party thought differently than the Central Committee. -- Oikonomou, who was not elected, spoke about "the aristocracy of mediocrity." Thessaloniki Deputy Kastanidhis noted that some members who are distinguished in society were not elected, while the opposite happened with others. He said this is because "mechanisms of mediocrity" prevail.
