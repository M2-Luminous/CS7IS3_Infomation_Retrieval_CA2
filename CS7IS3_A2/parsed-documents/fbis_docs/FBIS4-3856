The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement proposing the stabilization of order in the UN-declared "safe areas" in Bosnia, the INTERFAX news agency reported. The statement, issued on the eve of a meeting between Russian and U.S. foreign ministers, suggests that Bosnian Serbs and Muslims sign an agreement on a complete cease-fire and the ending of hostilities. A package plan for the political resolution of the Bosnian crisis should be sought, the Foreign Ministry announced. While realistically facilitating the peace process, the international community should lessen its sanctions against Yugoslavia, the ministry said. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev are due to meet on Tuesday in Geneva to discuss the Bosnian crisis.
