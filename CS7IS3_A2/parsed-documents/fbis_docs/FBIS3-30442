Zhirinovskiy said this in talks with Vojislav Seselj, the leader of the Serbian Radical Party, who was his host today at the Federal Assembly. He said that an organization which allows children to die for want of medicines can no longer be called the United Nations Organization. This, according to Zhirinovskiy, is an instrument in the hands of a state that has become an evil empire. I am telling the West from Belgrade today that war games in the Balkans are over and that a new historic epoch is beginning, said the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, which won the highest number of votes in the recent Russian parliamentary elections. Zhirinovskiy reiterated that he sides fully with the Serb people and that he regards Western threats against Serbia as threats against Russia. If the Serb people seek help we shall offer moral, material, and, if need be, also military support, he declared, warning that the Russian Army is still one of the strongest in the world. He informed his host that a meeting of support and solidarity with the Serb people will be held in Moscow on 5 February, and that Serb officers, party officials, and representatives of the Serbian Orthodox Church will be invited to come on 20 February, Russian Army Day. The leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party mentioned a proposal for the unification of Slav nations in an eastern European community. I am putting forward a proposal for the setting up of a Slav parliament in Belgrade or another Slav city which would be a counterpart to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Zhirinovskiy said. He added that in relation to Western Europe, stretching from the English Channel to Vienna, the eastern European community would stretch from Knin to Vladivostok. Zhirinovskiy announced that a congress of Slav nations will be held in Moscow on 2 April. With 1993 the withdrawal of Slavs and the passive attitude of the Orthodox Church ended. In 1994 a new historical era of the renaissance of Slav nations begins, he added. The Slavs are, he said, one nation, and if the German nation united, if the Germans, British, and French are uniting, why should not the Slavs do the same? Zhirinovskiy stressed that his party supports democratic principles which should be respected equally by everyone. We do not support violence and we are not threatening anyone, we are just warning, he added. The Warsaw Pact has been dissolved and we also want NATO to be dissolved, Zhirinovskiy said, adding that the world is tired of hegemony. The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia proposes, as he put it, the regionalization of the world, dividing it into north and south America, eastern and western Europe, the Far East and Japan. In a world divided like this political power would be balanced and that would prevent a major new war. Zhirinovskiy and Seselj said they are satisfied with the similarity of their parties' standpoints. Seselj stressed that the Serb nation is engaged in a great struggle to liberate its western territories. The Serbs differ on many internal policy issues but they are united as far as the defense of national interests is concerned, Seselj pointed out. He said that Croats and Muslims are tools controlled by the West, which wants to break the backbone of the Serb nation. We were alone until you appeared, he declared to Zhirinovskiy. However, we have never stopped believing that the great Russian nation will stand up on its own feet and say no to the West. We are one people, our origins are the same, our languages are similar, and we can survive in the new world only by leaning on each other, Seselj said. He expressed his wish that, as soon as possible, the Liberal Democratic Party becomes the ruling party and Zhirinovskiy the president of Russia.
