The senior party of Hungary's governing coalition won 11.3 percent of the votes cast on party list in the first round of the parliamentary elections on Sunday. (Four years ago the MDF scored 24.73 percent of votes in the first round.) The MDF now trails the opposition Hungarian Socialist Party (33 percent) and the Alliance of Free Democrats (19.76 percent) for third place. Over the past four years, the MDF has accomplished a historic performance by laying down the constitutional foundations of multi-party parliamentary democracy and creating a legal background to transition to a social market economy, Boross said. The PM claimed the MDF had subordinated its interests and popularity to the needs of the country and the nation. In a joint declaration, the MDF National Board warned against the danger of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) winning more than two thirds of seats and thus gaining excessive power, something undesirable in a parliamentary democracy. The Board calls upon all who want to halt this excessive win to support in the second round the 100 MDF candidates still in contention. The MDF hopes to create a political counterweight, to guarantee a controlled, democratic order of parliamentary decision-making. The Board proposed the MDF should start talks with the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) on second-round cooperation. The Board also proposed that the local MDF groups should make electoral deals with the Christian Democrats and the Smallholders, but should not negotiate similar deals with the Free Democrats.
