Hata told the House of Representatives budget committee, "I really hope the budget passes in the current Diet session by any means. I will make most sincere efforts for that." The Diet session is scheduled to end June 29. He apologized for the delay in the budget debate due mainly to the political turmoil over former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's shady personal finances, which forced his resignation last month. "I feel great responsibility. I regret the delay," Hata said. Nearly 80 days have passed since the government submitted the budget to the Diet for deliberations. He was responding to questions by an opposition Liberal Democratic Party legislator Takashi Fukaya. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai denied he is seeking an extension of the term of the current Diet session to ensure the passage of the budget. Hata declined to talk about an extension of the Diet session, saying it is a matter that should be decided by the Diet. Kumagai also promised a formal report on the recent "sexist" remarks by Ichiro Ozawa, top policy strategist in the ruling coalition. Kumagai said he will directly ask Ozawa what he really meant by the remarks and will brief the committee session. He was referring to Ozawa's remarks last month which defended the move among some coalition partners to create a new Diet bloc without the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which led to defection by the angry SDP, the largest coalition component. Comparing the convergence of various political parties to an extramarital affair, Ozawa reportedly told reporters, "it doesn't matter which women you may sleep with." Kumagai said the remarks are "not appropriate if they were really made." LDP's Fukaya also questioned Hata over what he calls a "vague" concept in the government's defense policy. He blasted the coalition's policy platform, which says Japan's constitution adopts "universal security," saying such a concept does not exist in international law or the UN Charter. Hata said universal security is a wide concept that roughly corresponds to the constitution's idea about the nation's security. It is a bit wider concept than the collective security as defined in the UN Charter, but not quite far from it, he added. Concerning the possibility of Japan's military involvements in international crises, Hata reiterated that the government will handle the situation within the framework of the constitution. Fukaya, unsatisfied with the answers, sought a unified view by the government over the security issue.
