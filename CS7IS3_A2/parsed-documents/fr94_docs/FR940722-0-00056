FR940722-0-00056 FR940722-0-00014 1. Each operator shall notify in writing, at least thirty days before blasting, all residents and owners of manmade dwellings or structures located within one mile *␣*␣* of the permit area how to request a preblasting survey. 2. On request to the commission by a resident or owner of a dwelling or structure located within one mile *␣*␣* of any part of the permit area, the operator shall promptly conduct a preblasting survey of the dwelling or structure and promptly submit a report of the survey to the commission and requestor. Any preblasting survey requested more than ten days before blasting must be completed before blasting is initiated. Additions or renovations to a surveyed structure must be surveyed upon request to the commission. In this amendment, North Dakota proposed to increase from one-half mile [0.85 kilometers] to one mile [1.61 kilometers], the distance from the permit area within which dwellings or structures must be situated before the owners or residents of such dwellings and structures are entitled to the notice specified at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;17&hyph;02(1) and can require the operator to conduct a pre-blast survey in accordance with NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;17&hyph;02(2). North Dakota proposed these regulatory revisions in order to implement the statutory changes proposed by the State in ``Amendment XVIII'' (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1, April 21, 1993) pertaining to pre-blast surveys. (For a discussion of the proposed statutory provisions, see the additional final rule Federal Register notice for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) The distance standard in the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.62(a) and (b) regarding pre-blast surveys is one-half mile of the permit area. North Dakota's proposed revisions at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02 (1) and (2) would thus allow a potentially larger group of residents or owners within the vicinity of the mine to require the operator to conduct a preblasting survey than is provided for by the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.62(a) and (b). In accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which no Federal counterpart exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director is approving the revisions proposed by North Dakota at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;17&hyph;02 (1) and (2). 2. NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;01 Through 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08, Small Operator Assistance Program In this amendment, North Dakota proposed several changes to its rules pertaining to its SOAP program in order to implement the statutory revisions the State proposed in a separate amendment. (For a discussion of the proposed statutory SOAP provisions, see the additional final rule notice for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) North Dakota proposed these regulatory revisions in order to implement the statutory changes proposed by the State in ``Amendment XVIII'' (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1, April 21, 1993). a. NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;01(2), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;04(6)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;05(1)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06(2) and 06(4), and 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(b), Small Operator Assistance_Responsibilities of the Commission_Qualified Public and Private Entities North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;01(2) to provide that the Commission will develop and maintain a list of ``qualified public or private entities'' as required by 30 CFR 795.10 and pay them for services rendered. In this amendment, North Dakota proposed to substitute the phrase ``qualified public or private entities'' for the previous reference to ``qualified laboratories.'' North Dakota also proposed to change the term ``laboratory'' (or ``laboratories'') to ``public or private entity'' (or ``entities'') in its rules at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;04(6)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;05(1)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06 (2) and (4), and 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(b). North Dakota's proposed terminology change is not inconsistent with section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA which provides that the activities to be performed under SOAP shall be performed by a ``qualified pubic or private laboratory or such other public or private qualified entity designated by the regulatory authority.'' Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed terminology change at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;01(2), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;04(6)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;05(1)(b), 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06 (2) and (4), and 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;08(1)(b) is not inconsistent with section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA or the Federal regulations regarding SOAP at 30 CFR Part 795, as recently revised (59 FR 28136, May 31, 1994), and the Director is approving the proposed rules. b. NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1) (a) and (b), Small Operator Assistance_Program Services North Dakota proposed to expand its regulatory provisions governing SOAP program services at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1) (a) and (b) in accordance with the statutory changes at North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37 (2) through (5) proposed by the State in ``Amendment XVIII'' (administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1, April 21, 1993). (For a discussion of the proposed statutory provisions, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) Specifically, North Dakota proposed to revise NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1) so that it will provide as follows:
