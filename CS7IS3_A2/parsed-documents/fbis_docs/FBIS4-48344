The Angolan ambassador in Lisbon stated that the United Nations is forgetting that UNITA does not respect UN Security Council resolutions: [Begin recording] [Mingas] I think that the United Nations have long forgotten that there is a member country called Angola-- the Angolan Republic. [Unidentified correspondent] Is this a criticism of the UN participation, rather the reduced UN participation in Angola? [Mingas] No. More specifically, I am talking about the UN Security Council's excessive tolerance toward applying sanctions. You have to consider that the Republic of Angola is the member state of the United Nations and not a group of rebels like UNITA. The United Nations has not been set up to support or have solidarity with a group of rebels, instead, it was set up to preserve peace, promote unity among nations, and support its member countries. We are a UN member state and do not understand why, in practice, it looks more like it is UNITA that is a member state and not our government. [end recording] [Announcer] That was Rui Mingas, Angolan ambassador in Lisbon who despite the criticism believes that, by June, peace will be a reality in Angola.
