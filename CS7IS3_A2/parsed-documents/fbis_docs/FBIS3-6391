"It's impossible to do what is impossible even if U.S. Trade Representative (Mickey) Kantor cries out," the source said. Kantor, speaking before the House Trade Subcommittee on Tuesday, pointed to a need for government guarantees to ensure that the planned steps by the auto industry are effective in boosting purchases of U.S. auto parts. Japanese trade officials dismissed Kantor's remark, saying the government cannot control business activities as doing so runs counter to the government policy of deregulation.
