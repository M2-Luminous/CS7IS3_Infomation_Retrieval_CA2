"I believe all Guatemalans should be pleased with the progress made in the negotiations process," the head of state said on Radio "Sonora." De Leon explained that he cannot express any opinions concerning the agreement because he pledged not to do so during the talks. Only the UN moderator, Frenchman Jean Arnault, can provide details. Nevertheless, he emphasized that "considerable progress has been made" with the signing of the general agreement on human rights which excludes the Truth Commission, which was formed to investigate violations of individual guarantees throughout the 34 years of the armed conflict. The president said that he and the Armed Forces High Command, which he also heads, have been in permanent contact with the National Commission for the Consolidation of Peace (COPAZ) presided over by Hector Rosada, examining each of the points as they were agreed upon. "We have been fully informed, and we ought to be pleased because considerable progress has been made," de Leon stressed.
