This plan is part of a 10-point declaration, which was presented by SPD federal and land experts for financial matters yesterday. A fairer distribution of the contributions must be ensured in the European Union, the SPD's financial program says. Since Germany has fallen from second to seventh place on the European scale of prosperity after unification, in particular the returns from Brussels to the new laender are to be increased. To "prevent" Germany's payments to Brussels "from continuing to skyrocket," strict budget discipline must be ensured in the EU, in the SPD's view. Within the framework of a reform of the EU budget, the SPD also wants to check which fields need to be regulated at the EU level in the first place. With these proposals the SPD financial experts go even beyond the plans by FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union [CSU]), who has also come out in favor of reducing the German net contribution to the EU. Furthermore, the 10-point declaration of the SPD budget experts, which was presented by SPD Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine and North Rhine-Westphalian Finance Minister Heinz Schleusser yesterday, contains harsh criticism of the Federal Government's budget policy. Over the past years the government has decided tax increases of about 115 billion German marks per year. With the SPD there will not be any further increase in the tax quota, the statement says. Lafontaine accused the CSU/CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and the FDP [Free Democratic Party] of planning four tax increases: raising value-added tax, property tax, and petroleum tax, as well as introducing highway tolls. Lafontaine underpinned this by citing statements by top politicians of the coalition, which were however partly denied or retracted.
