This was said by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at a meeting with Ukrainian and foreign journalists today in Kiev. He characterized the actions by Yuriy Meshkov as contradictory to the basic law of our state. At the same time, Leonid Kravchuk reiterated that during his personal meeting with the Crimean president, he proposed to the latter that they hold close contacts and take preliminary steps to sort things out in Crimea. Meshkov, however, claims that the president of Ukraine did not adhere to the agreements, and issued an edict on holding a referendum. By the way, even the autonomous Central Election Commission expressed hope that he would bring the documents in line with Crimean legislation. All responsibility for any possible complications will fall upon Mr. Meshkov, stressed Leonid Kravchuk.
