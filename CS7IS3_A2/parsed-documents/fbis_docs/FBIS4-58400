FBIS4-58400 "drnes086_o_94001" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 SYRIA Press Demands Full Israeli Golan Pullout Press Demands Full Israeli Golan Pullout JN0405093694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 4 May 94 JN0405093694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] In its editorial today, TISHRIN stresses that Syria adheres to the principle of comprehensive and speedy withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the occupied territories as part of a complete solution of all substantive issues that leads to an honorable, genuine, durable, and firmly established peace in the Middle East. TISHRIN says that since the day the U.S. initiative was launched, Syria has declared its rejection of partial, phased settlements. These do not make peace, but only inflame regional tension. TISHRIN says the issue is not just the fact that the Golan is Syrian territory occupied by force in an aggressive, expansionist war. There are also tens of thousands of Golan residents who were forced to leave their homes and who still await their return home. There is also the issue of the city of al-Qunaytirah, which was completely destroyed by the Israeli troops, and which awaits to be rebuilt. Therefore, it is impossible to talk about a peace that does not include full Israeli withdrawal, the return of the evacuees, and the reconstruction of the region. Hence, the formula proposed by Syria: Full peace in return for full withdrawal. Full peace cannot be traded for partial withdrawal. TISHRIN adds: What applies to the Golan also applies to southern Lebanon. There are tens of thousands of displaced people who are anxiously awaiting the withdrawal of the invading Israeli troops in order to return home. TISHRIN believes the Israeli rulers have a unique opportunity to engage in a durable and genuine peace. This would be through responding to the Syrian ideas and the resolutions of international legitimacy. TISHRIN concludes: Israeli rulers fully know that regional peace is impossible without Syria's effective participation, and that Syria's effective participation is impossible without the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan and the return of this Syrian territory to its owners. Commenting on the same subject, AL-BA'TH says: What was published and said about the Israeli proposals on the Golan Heights during the past days, especially during Warren Christopher's regional tour, has proved again that Israel's course has nothing to do with the effort that is being exerted to salvage the peace process. AL-BA'TH adds: Vagueness is the common denominator among recent Israeli officials' statements on the Rabin government's proposals on the Golan. Therefore, their objective is to circumvent the principles set at the Madrid conference. AL-BA'TH says those proposals which were leaked by Israel to coincide with the arrival of the U.S. secretary of state in the region have nothing to do with the issue of a just, comprehensive peace. At their best, just like the Gaza-Jericho settlement, they consolidate Israel's policy of dividing the political settlement and entrenching the occupation in its various existing forms. According to Israeli officials, such settlements achieve the objectives they failed to achieve in all their aggressive wars against the Arabs. AL-BA'TH says Syria works with absolute seriousness to achieve a just, comprehensive peace based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and on the basis of the Madrid formula. Syria, the paper adds, believes Israel's policy on the peace process remains unchanged. Apparently, this policy is unchangeable and unalterable. This policy still rejects commitment to the implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy. AL-BA'TH refers to what leader al-Asad said during his meeting with Christopher, when he stressed the need to tackle basic issues. These issues are the essence of the conflict. Their solution ensures progress in the peace process. Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: More than two and one-half years of talks in Washington, and other diplomatic efforts, have proved that Israel is maneuvering, procrastinating, and evading the implementation of the basic conditions and requirements of peace, chiefly full withdrawal from Arab territories. In fact, what Israel seeks are settlements patterned after the Gaza-Jericho agreement. We reject such settlements. They are not a substitute for the aspired peace. AL-THAWRAH says progress in the peace process is conditional on changing Israeli negotiating tactics and the commitment by Tel Aviv's rulers to the resolutions of international legitimacy and the UN Security Council and acceptance of the Madrid terms of reference as a basis for a just, comprehensive settlement on all fronts and tracks. AL-THAWRAH says: So far, no one can see any substantive change in the negative Israeli position and performance regarding the political process or a single positive indicator of change in that policy in the near future -- a policy of aggressive options and continued occupation of Arab territories and that stubbornly rejects all the bases of peace. AL-THAWRAH adds: Based on what we have noted, Tel Aviv has offered nothing new to facilitate the Christopher mission. Everything it has proposed is only ideas and proposals, which, according to Israeli papers themselves, are vague offers of phased solutions that circumvent UN resolutions and do not constitute a basis for a serious and genuine breakthrough in the peace process. On the other hand, what Christopher heard from President Hafiz al-Asad and the ideas and proposals that he was asked to convey embody the constants of the Syrian position, which proceed from a real desire to establish a just, comprehensive peace. AL-THAWRAH stresses that Washington is required and beseeched to play an effective, impartial role to ensure respect for and compliance with international legitimacy and to forcefully impose their implementation on the obstructive party without any delay and without any bias. Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: It is wrong to believe Syria can accept any solution that does not meet its just demands or ignores an iota of its national and pan-Arab rights and its uncontroversial full sovereignty over the Golan. Piecemeal and phased peace is rejected and unacceptable. Peace is impossible without full Israeli withdrawal.
