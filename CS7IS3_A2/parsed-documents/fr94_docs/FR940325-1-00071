FR940325-1-00071 FR940325-1-00008 Section 4110.4&hyph;2␣Decrease in Land Acreage The proposed rule would amend paragraph (a) by removing the words ``suspend'' and ``suspension.'' As explained above, reductions in authorized use under preference permits or leases would no longer be recognized as suspended use. Subpart 4120_Grazing Management Section 4120.2␣Allotment Management and Resource Activity Plans The proposed rule would amend this section by revising the heading and by adding reference to other activity plans that may prescribe grazing management. It has been the BLM's policy to develop more integrated activity plans for managing resources of an allotment, such as coordinated resource management plans. The BLM strongly favors the development of integrated activity plans over single purpose plans such as allotment management plans (AMPs) because integrated plans allow BLM, permittees or lessees, and other affected persons to take a broader look at all of the management needs of an area while still addressing actions specific to the various uses and resource conditions of the area. The proposed rule would clarify that draft AMPs, or other draft activity plans, may be prepared by other agencies, or permittees or lessees. In addition to the initial proposal in the advance notice, a provision has been made for the preparation of draft allotment management plans by other interested parties. Allotment management plans or other activity plans would not become effective until approved by the authorized officer. Paragraph (a) would be amended by replacing the reference to district grazing advisory boards with multiple resource advisory councils and including State resource management agencies in the activity planning process as explained above. The amendment would also provide that plans shall include standards and guidelines that are not included as terms and conditions of the permit or lease. The amendment would provide that flexibility granted to permittees or lessees under a plan shall be determined on the basis of demonstrated stewardship. The requirement for earning flexibility is an incentive for cooperating grazing operators to manage for the improvement of rangeland conditions. The proposed rule would make the inclusion of other than public lands in an allotment management plan or other activity plan a discretionary action as opposed to a requirement as worded in the existing regulations. Finally, this section would reference the NEPA analysis and related public participation that is required for the planning and revision of allotment or activity plans, and would provide that the decision document following the environmental analysis would serve as the proposed decision for purposes of subpart 4160.
