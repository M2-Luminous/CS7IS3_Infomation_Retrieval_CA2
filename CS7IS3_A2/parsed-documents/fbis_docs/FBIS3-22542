According to Azwar Anas, coordinating minister for the people's welfare who spoke after he was received by President Suharto on 20 January at Istana Merdeka [Freedom Palace], the number of persons suffering from AIDS in Indonesia is 194 at present. Sixty-four persons suffer from AIDS in metropolitan Jakarta, 22 in Bali, 54 in Irian Jaya, 22 in East Java, 14 in Riau, five in West Java, and one each in West Sumatra and West Kalimantan. In this connection the cabinet ministers concerned are actively promoting preventive measures, one of which is teaching the community healthy sexual practices. Minister Azwar Anas added: "We know that AIDS is spread in particular by sexual relations with persons of the same sex, rather than with the opposite sex. The symptoms only appear after one year, and there are positive indications after five years." Azwar Anas said that, previously, protective measures against AIDS were handled only by the minister of tourism, posts, and telecommunications and the minister of health. Now all ministers are working on this matter with the coordinating minister for the people's welfare. In addition to reporting on the AIDS question Minister Azwar Anas also reported on the matter of stocks of iodized salt. In view of the fact that the Indonesian people prefer to use technical or raw salt, it is feared that they will suffer a decline in IQ [Intelligence Quotient]. There are two kinds of salt. There is technical or raw salt which is used, among other things, for fishing purposes and so forth, and there is salt for human consumption. Clearly, the people prefer to use raw or technical salt, the price of which is cheaper at 35 rupiahs per kilogram. However, many people are not aware that their average IQ will decline as a result of using technical or raw salt. In this connection, the president expressed hoped that iodized salt will be used more widely by the people. Minister Azwar Anas said that at the present time the government is making a national survey to be used in preparing a Presidential Instruction on the Most Disadvantaged Villages (IDT). Individual families in the survey will be listed under five classifications: Low Welfare, Welfare 1, Welfare 2, Welfare 3, and Welfare 3+. The classification of "Low Welfare" means a family that lives in a home which is inadequate in four ways: food, shelter, clothing, and health. "Welfare 1" means a family that is adequately provided for in the above four categories, but that is unable to pay for education costs. "Welfare 3+" means a family that is adequately provided for in all of the above categories and whose members are able to help others, such as by contributing goods, giving alms, and so forth. It is hoped that all of this data will have been collected by April 1994, so that action can be taken to improve the situation in the most disadvantaged villages. Minister Azwar Anas also reported to the president on preparations for the Social Development Summit Conference. Indonesia has been designated deputy chairman of the conference by the United Nations to represent the countries of Southeast Asia. The summit conference will be preceded by three meetings at lower levels. There is a possibility that President Suharto will attend the meeting in Copenhagen, that is, when the summit conference is held. The minister also reported on the floods which are currently affecting some areas of Indonesia. The office of the coordinating minister for the people's welfare has 2.0 billion rupiahs available to help victims of the present floods, for example in Flores, West Java, and West Sumatra.
