Jorge Pinto Mazal, Mexican undersecretary of foreign affairs, rejected the idea that the Haitian problem represents a threat to world peace and security, and he considered that the only "acceptable" option is a negotiated solution. The crisis in Haiti has become the most controversial topic discussed by the foreign ministers at the 24th OAS General Assembly that is taking place in Belem, capital of Para State, some 1,650 km north of Brasilia. Speaking during the sixth session of the OAS Ad Hoc Commission, Pinto Mazal, who is also under secretary for Latin America, Cultural Affairs, and International Cooperation at the Mexican Foreign Ministry, proposed "encouraging commitments that will allow for overcoming the deadlock in Haiti." Mexico supports strengthening the international civilian mission, and he hopes to find the adequate political means for supporting the efforts of the democratic sectors of Haitian society in a determined, specific, and solidaristic manner, Pinto Mazal added. Earlier in the day, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu stated that the majority of the OAS country members are opposed to military intervention in Haiti because they consider this would break international law and would affect the security of the hemisphere. "Most OAS members are against an intervention in Haiti to reinstate deposed President Jean Bertrand Aristide in his post," Abreu said during the 24th General Assembly of the organization. The Uruguayan minister also pronounced himself in favor of strengthening the commercial embargo decreed by the United Nations and the OAS and called on all countries to comply with the blockade to get the Haitian military coupist personnel to leave. For his part, Jamaican Foreign Minister Benjamin Clare agreed on the need to find paths for a negotiated solution to the Haitian crisis and said his government will cooperate with the United Nations to strengthen the blockade against this Caribbean nation. The military government headed by General Raoul Cedras is being subjected to an international blockade and strong pressures to bring about a return to constitutional order and respect for the agreements signed at Governors Island, New York, last year. The penalties, which began to be implemented on 21 May, ban commercial flights to and from Haiti and ask governments not to allow the coupists officers, headed by Gen. Cedras, to enter their territories. The Haitian crisis, Cuba's return to the OAS, the Dominican elections, and the call to the Summit of the Americas by the United States are the topics to be studied by the ministers in Belem do Para until next Friday.
