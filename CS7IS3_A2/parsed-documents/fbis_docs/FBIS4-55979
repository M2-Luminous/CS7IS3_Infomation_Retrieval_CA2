Literature Professor Ibrahim Rugova is the popularly elected leader of 2 million Kosovo Albanians. But the Serbian Government in Belgrade refuses to recognize his and his countrymen's desire for independence. The tense situation in Kosovo has not yet erupted into open war. This is due in no small measure to President Rugova's and his supporters' insistence on nonviolent resistance. "If war broke out in Kosovo it would be a catastrophe for us. It would be much worse than in Croatia or Bosnia. We have no police, no military forces, no means of defending ourselves," Ibrahim Rugova said in an interview with DET FRI AKTUELT. The Serbian authorities have been consistent in closing or taking over Albanian institutions, and ethnic Albanians have been fired from their posts in public administration. The Serbs amount to only 10 percent of the population in Kosovo, but today they dominate the apparatus of power. Nevertheless, up to now the resistance to the Serbs has been peaceful. "The Albanian population follows the policy of nonviolence, even though this is not easy when every day you are mistreated, persecuted, and purged." How does one behave as president when one's state and government are not recognized? "It is difficult, of course. But it is we who have the morale and the political organization, while the Serbs only have their military power. That is the difference between them and us. I am president because I agree with my people," Rugova said, explaining how the parliament, which after two years has still not been able to meet, and the government nevertheless are able to function. "The parliament works with different groups and commissions and with the four parties that are represented. We also have a government, part of which is abroad and part in Kosovo itself. We have ministers for education, health, information, and so on. ``We have also organized a system of solidarity which makes sure that money, food, and foodstuffs are distributed to those who are in need." All this works in parallel with the Serbian government machinery. Is there a solution to the whole of the Yugoslav conflict? "What is important in Bosnia is first and foremost to stop the war. And then it is also a question of whether or not Bosnia can survive as a state. If the Serbs get their way in Bosnia they are bound to become even more aggressive. If the Serbs are not halted there they will go further in Kosovo and Macedonia." The Kosovo Albanians want an independent, neutral state between Serbia and Albania. Deep down they dream about becoming a part of Albania, Ibrahim Rugova admitted. But they know very well that this is politically unrealistic. What many Western observers fear is that the Kosovo Albanians' call for independence will have a contagious effect on the situation in Macedonia where there is another large Albanian minority. This would cause further irritation in Greece and the scene would then be set for a large-scale war in the Balkans which would make the present conflict look like a tea party. Ibrahim Rugova is aware of and fears this risk. But how much longer can the Kosovo Albanians' patience last? "I do not know. It does not depend on us Albanians alone. It could happen that some sudden provocation could come from the Serbs. Perhaps they might start doing something in a small way, but in the end everything would just become too much," he said. In Denmark Ibrahim Rugova has been received at prime minister level and has met Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democratic Party) and Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical Liberal Party). "We have met with an understanding of Kosovo's situation. We asked that Denmark, through the EU [European Union], should apply pressure so that something is done that can prevent a conflict from flaring up. A year ago the CSCE mission in Kosovo was expelled. Since then they have been working to return, but have not been given permission. It is the Serbs who have the power and control everything. Rugova wants Kosovo to be placed under international surveillance by the United Nations or the EU. "We have also asked for Kosovo to be included as part of the global problems which have to be solved in the former Yugoslavia. We demand the right to self-determination. And that the way of peace which the Albanians have chosen will become recognized by the international community."
