He admitted in an interview with Interfax today that the refugee question was one of the main issues in finding a settlement to the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. Kondratyev said that during the next six months (the term during which Russian peacekeepers will be staying in the region) the Georgian and Abkhaz leaders would have a chance to make a significant move forward in wide-scale settlement of the conflict. "Servicemen have done what they were expected to do. Now politicians must say their word," he said. Kondratyev returned from the conflict zone on June 27. He announced that the Russian peace-keeping troops had completed all their tasks -- established control and set up monitoring posts. Kondratyev said that inhabitants of both Georgia and Abkhazia had welcomed Russian peacekeepers. He added that the parties were respecting the cease-fire agreement signed in Moscow on May 14. Kondratyev stressed that the peace-keeping operation in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict was carried out under the CIS sign, not only under that of Russia. Kondratyev said he believed that monitors and peacekeepers from other CIS countries would soon appear in the region.
