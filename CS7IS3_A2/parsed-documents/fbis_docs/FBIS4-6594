Ilagan] [Text] Several armed regulars of the New People's Army (NPA) who have availed of the government's amnesty program have questioned the authority of communist leaders Jose Ma. Sison and Luis Jalandoni, both living in exile in the Netherlands, in preventing members of the local communist movement from getting involved in the government's ongoing peace process. This was disclosed yesterday by Sen. Rodolfo Biazon, a member of the government peace panel, who conducted a dialogue with several rebel returnees in Tuguegarao, Cagayan. Biazon said that the NPA leaders who attended the dialogue have criticized Sison and Jalandoni for issuing statements in behalf of the entire communist movement. They stressed that the two had lost the moral authority to lead them because of their prolonged absence in the country. "We are tired of these leaders (Sison and Jalandoni) who always speak for us," Biazon quoted the NPA guerrillas in Tuguegarao as saying. Biazon said the local NPA group from Naguilian, Isabela, and Gattaran, Cagayan, had completely detached themselves from the influence of the Netherlands-based communist leaders. In their previous pronouncements, Sison and Jalandoni have rejected President Ramos' Amnesty Proclamation No. 347 for insurgents as they questioned the government's sincerity in its reconciliatory moves with various rebel groups. Biazon said that a big number of local NPA guerrillas in Cagayan "are very much interested in the peace process but many are still worried about the pending court cases against them." Similar dialogues were conducted between government representatives led by Biazon and NPA surrenderees in Iligan and Davao City during the past few days. Meanwhile, Biazon called for an investigation of the alleged arbitrary arrest of rebel returnee, identified as Domingo Tagade, in Isabela by local police forces. Tagade, who surrendered to the government in 1989 and later applied for amnesty, was charged with rebellion in Isabela. Biazon requested the Philippine National Police (PNP) to submit a formal report regarding the arrest which, he claimed, is not in accordance with the government's peace program with the communists. "Any pending court cases against rebel returnees who came out and surrendered should be suspended pending the outcome of the congressional hearings on the amnesty proclamations," he stressed.
