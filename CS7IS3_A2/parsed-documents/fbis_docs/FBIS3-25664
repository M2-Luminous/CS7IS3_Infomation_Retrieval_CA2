"We are managing to pay salaries at the moment, but the election is a problem," said Nkobi. "We have not reached our target of $17-million (R[rand]58.3-million) in contributions from the international community, and we are afraid to borrow -- because of course we would have to pay for it." The $17-million international fundraising target is believed to be significantly lower than originally planned. Fundraisers on both sides of the Atlantic are locked in a battle with the ANC's chief Washington representative, Lindiwe Mabuza, over large American campaign donations promised to Nelson Mandela, but never received by ANC headquarters. At stake are millions of U.S. dollars. Repeated requests to Mabuza to transfer the funds, raised during Mandela's U.S. trip last July, have fallen on deaf ears, say sources in the U.S. and South Africa. Mabuza refused this week to discuss the issue when telephoned in Washington, saying she was answerable only to the ANC leadership. "I don't want to discuss this in the media," said Mabuza. "I don't even know really how much was transferred or not -- I don't keep the books." The election cash crunch would be eased, say insiders, if Mabuza were to transfer almost $500,000 (R1.7-million) in cash and cheques raised during Nelson Mandela's U.S. trip last July. A further $1.8- million (R6.2-million) in pledges has also failed to materialise, because Mabuza has not followed up on the promises made to Mandela. Mabuza, who has been nominated to a safe position within the top 102 on the ANC's list for the national parliament, is understood to be the sole signatory to the organisation's Washington bank accounts. The $500,000 was deposited after Mandela's fundraising swing last year, which took him to New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and other centres. Asked about his department's difficulties with Mabuza, Nkobi was unspecific, saying "Nelson Mandela brought about $10,000 (34,300) back with him" after the July U.S. trip, and the "most of the rest was pledges which are not being fulfilled". An audit of the ANC's Stockholm office while Mabuza was chief representative in Sweden several years ago apparently revealed a gap of several tens of thousands of Swedish krona between amount paid by local donors to the ANC and expenditure records kept by the office. Confronted over the hole in the till, Mabuza is reported to have burst into tears, saying she knew nothing about accounting. Asked about the audit this week, she denied any knowledge of a cash shortfall, saying: "I am aware there was an audit, but I was not told that figure was missing." An attempt to transfer her to Dar es Salaam as chief representative to Tanzania failed when she successfully lobbied for the Washington D.C. position. She is said to have an "inside track" to foreign affairs chief Thabo Mbeki. But far from winning friends and influencing people in the U.S. capital, Mabuza is reported to have thrown her lot in with some dubious Capitol Hill entrepreneurs and put several important noses out of joint. Sources in the U.S. say she has angered ANC donors and sympathisers by "trying to hog everything for herself" rather than leaving fundraising to the professionals. One American source, who asked to remain anonymous, said she had failed to prevent turf battles between two ANC-aligned fundraising operations, and "funds raised have not found their way back to South Africa". "There is definite incompetence within the Washington office, and it needs better financial controls -- even outside the issue of fundraising. The fault lies with the organisation at large," said a source. A fundraising effort set up to encourage large tax- deductible contributions from corporate donors and chaired by Heinz chief Tony O'Rielly, who recently bought a major stake in South Africa's Argus newspapers, has reportedly been using its clout to raise funds from traditional ANC donors like churches and black groups. Called Safe -- for South Africa Free Elections -- the organisation was set up with Mandela's blessing and the involvement of the ANC in an attempt to mobilise U.S. funding for voter education projects. Pro bono legal services were provided by former Kennedy aide Theodore Sorensen. U.S. law makes makes tax-deductible donations to political parties impossible, and the clear expectation was that Safe would fund voter education projects close to, but not organisationally linked to, the ANC. But aside from minor amounts which have gone to ANC partners within the Patriotic Front, Safe has ended up supporting voter education projects beyond the ANC orbit to the tune of at least $1-million (R3.4-million). Among those receiving support is the Institute for a Democratic Alternative in South Africa (Idasa). Considering the use of Mandela's high profile for Safe's fundraising effort, said one U.S. source, "anger is justified if ANC-related voter education is not getting the funds". Mabuza was also instrumental in brokering a contract between the ANC and former non-voting congressional delegate for Washington D.C. Walter Fauntroy, for "the provision of public policy, political action, public relations, mobilisation and other services to assist the ANC mission to the U.S.". The initial proposal included a draft first year budget of $700,000, (R2.4 million) and requested a three-month start-up planning grant of $230,000 (770,000). Fauntroy was to cover these costs through fundraising in the U.S., but has not remitted a cent to the ANC. Instead, the start-up grant has been lost, putting the ANC more than $230,000 out of pocket. Mabuza has also pushed other associates at the ANC's expense, including one Albert Nellum, who came to South Africa with his wife, ostensibly because there was an "urgent need" to plan fundraising events around a tennis match involving Zina Garrison. Nellum is described as "a very close friend of Lindiwe and the godfather of Zina Garrison". Mabuza was told twice by fax not to approve Nellum's visit, but he came anyway, billing the ANC for his room at the Carlton Hotel and for air fares for himself and his wife, which he insisted on having upgraded to business class. Asked to comment on the goings-on in the Washington D.C. office, an spokesman said: "We don't deal with election fundraising -- that's the treasurer's and the election campaign department's responsibility. We have no cause to be unhappy with our representation in D.C."
