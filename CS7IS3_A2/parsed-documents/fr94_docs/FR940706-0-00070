FR940706-0-00070 FR940706-0-00015 Section 437(a) of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) (20 U.S.C. 1232f) requires that records be retained by recipients of grants for a period of five years. The record retention period specified in sec. XXX .53(b) of the Circular, as established by OMB, however, requires recipients to retain financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to the award for a period of three years. The Secretary has changed this requirement in §74.53(b) of the regulations to require recipients to retain records for five years in accordance with GEPA. Summary of Major Provisions The revised Circular A&hyph;110 as implemented in 34 CFR Parts 74 and 77 of the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) (1) harmonize the regulations with numerous and significant changes in grant administrative practice and legislation since the original Circular was issued in 1976; (2) bring the requirements for institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations closer to those contained for State, local, and tribal governments in OMB Circular A&hyph;102 (implemented by the Department at 34 CFR Part 80) so that the Department's grant administration is more uniform across classes of recipients; (3) reduce regulatory burden on and give greater flexibility to recipients in numerous cases; and (4) strengthen certain provisions in order to protect the Federal interest. The Circular, as implemented in these regulations_ Definitions: Expands or clarifies many of the definitions in the old A&hyph;110 Circular (e.g., suspension); Adds new definitions to 34 CFR Parts 74 and 77 of EDGAR; and amends Part 77 of to reflect the definitions contained in Part 80. Program income: Allows costs incident to the generation of program income to be deducted from gross income to determine program income; requires excess program income to be deducted from total project costs; exempts program income earned after the project period; and clarifies that all program income should be used by recipients before they request additional cash payments. Specifies in §74.27 that certain OMB circulars and Federal Register notices apply to grants and subgrants subject to Part 74. The Secretary adopts the following Circulars and their cost principles as published in the Federal Register on the dates shown: •A&hyph;21_Cost Principles for Educational Institutions_(March 6, 1979 [44 FR 12368]; and August 3, 1982 [47 FR 33658]; and June 9, 1986 [51 FR 20908]; and December 2, 1986 [51 FR 43487]; and October 3, 1991 [56 FR 50224]); •A&hyph;87_Cost Principles for State and Local Governments_(January 28, 1981 [46 FR 9548]); and •A&hyph;122_Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations_(July 8, 1990 [45 FR 46022]; and March 17, 1980 [46 FR 17185]; and April 27, 1984 [49 FR 18260]; and May 8, 1984 [49 FR 19588]). These cost principles would apply except to the extent that program regulations or the regulations in EDGAR require a different outcome. If OMB publishes at a future date revisions to any of these cost principles, the Secretary will publish regulatory amendments adopting the revised circulars.

In-kind contributions: Redefines third party in-kind contributions to mean the value of non-cash contributions from third parties, and provides that all grantee contributions, whether in the form of property or cash, are considered contributions and are subject to applicable cost principles.
