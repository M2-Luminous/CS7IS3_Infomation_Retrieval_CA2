FR940511-2-00177 FR940511-2-00110 The Commission believes that granting PTC temporary approval of its proposal for one year should allow it sufficient time to address the issues raised above. PTC's current CMO margining methodology should help ensure that CMO margins will be established that take into account the unique characteristics of each CMO tranche, and that PTC's reliance on a daily pricing source will provide it with timely price information. The resulting margins will afford PTC protection should it be necessary for PTC to borrow against or liquidate these assets. III. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that PTC's proposal is consistent with section 17A of the Act. It Is Therefore Ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 30 that PTC's proposed rule change (SR&hyph;PTC&hyph;92&hyph;16) be, and hereby is, approved on a temporary basis until April 30, 1995. 30 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaet H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
