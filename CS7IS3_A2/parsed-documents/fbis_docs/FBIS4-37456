But, speaking to reporters at an army camp on the Golan Heights this morning, Rabin called on Damascus to open direct, high-level negotiations with Israel. [Begin recording] [Rabin] The time has arrived that Syria will start to realize that the best way to negotiate peace with Israel is to sit face to face on higher levels than it was done till now, and to talk in a serious way how to reach peace between our two countries. [Unidentified correspondent] When do you expect the peace talks to resume with Syria face to face? [Rabin] As you know, at this stage it is conducted through the visits of the secretary of state. We are ready to continue in the way that the United States serves as go-between, hopefully to create a basis that will bring about meetings on higher levels between Syria and Israel. I cannot see how a real agreement or peace treaty can be reached without a certain stage of meetings on the higher levels than it is today. [Correspondent] Mr. Rabin, Mr. Christopher is not coming to the Middle East at this time. What could bring the sides back to the table? [Rabin] I cannot speak in the name of the secretary of state but I believe that he will come. If it is not going to happen in June, it will happen in July. [end recording]
