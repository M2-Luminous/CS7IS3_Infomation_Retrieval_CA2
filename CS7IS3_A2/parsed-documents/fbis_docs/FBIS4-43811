The new taxation estimate, which is based on a 3.9-percent nominal growth this year and 4.4 percent in 1995, will result in a budget deficit of between 9 and 10 billion German marks [DM] compared to May 1993 estimates. The deficit is primarily the result of the 1993 recession. It must now be included in the 1995 budget and compensated for by revenue from privatization, the continuation of overall spending cuts, savings in expenditure on personnel based on moderate wage settlements in 1994, strict adherence to the expenditure moratorium, as well as the consistent pursuit of a consolidation course. Strong economic growth will not release the federal authorities from the obligation of having to consolidate the budget. As of 1995, the fund for the repayment of inherited debt as well as taking over the debts of the federal and former GDR railroads will present enormous challenges. The liabilities stemming from taking over Trust Agency debts have been taken into account in the budget plans for 1995. Waigel does not envisage any other risks. Expenditure on interest rates and liabilities in the social services field make a strict continuation of the consolidation course imperative. Debt Waigel rejects the constant accusations that he is solely responsible for the debts of DM2 trillion. It is going too far to burden him with the laender and municipal authority debts totaling DM600 billion. The same applies to the DM300 billion debt that already existed in 1982 toward the end of the socialist-liberal coalition and was transferred to Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg. Waigel said: "And I am not ashamed of the DM600 billion of state debt prompted by German unity." To reduce the high level of taxation and state expenditure, it is necessary to keep the increase in the budget below the nominal GDP growth rate. In Waigel's opinion, this goal must be pursued over the entire upcoming parliamentary term. The 1994 federal budget has already resulted in nominal reductions for a whole series of individual budgets. This will continue in a similar form in the 1995 budget. Only a strict consolidation course will result in a reduction in the net borrowing. This is not only necessary to fulfill the Maastricht Treaty criteria, but also in view of interest rate trends on the capital markets. No other expenditure programs would be possible. Waigel said: "If a new expenditure priority appears in one place, then is must be compensated for by financing elsewhere." The government has been successful over the past few years with this principle, and it must continue to adhere to it. The principle also applies in the case of formulating the joint CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] election program. The proviso attached to all the points contained in the program is the availability of finance. After 1995, the highest priority is the use of all possible room for maneuver to reduce taxes and ancillary wage costs. Higher taxation must be accepted over a certain period of time, because of the historic event of unification. However, this should not be some kind of permanent state of affairs, or the growth that has been achieved will be lost. Solidarity Surcharge If the liberals want the solidarity surcharge to be limited to a set period of time, then they are calling for more than is possible in economic terms at the present time. Waigel gave assurances that he wants to do something about income tax rates and then about the solidarity surcharge. He said he was in favor of an annual review of the solidarity surcharge and a reduction as soon as that is possible. However, it would be unrealistic to set a date for canceling the solidarity surcharge, which will be collected as of 1 January 1995. The revenue from the solidarity surcharge will be necessary to service the fund for the repayment of inherited debt to the tune of almost DM40 billion. Waigel warned against reducing the taxation burden at the price of increasing the net borrowing. This would prompt negative reactions from the markets and possibly from the Bundesbank, too. Frankly, if higher interest rates were the result, that would be a disaster. The example of the United States, which lowered taxes in the hope of achieving higher revenues, is instructive. It did indeed lead to an improvement in the economy, but also to an enormous budget deficit at the same time. In any event, Waigel does not underestimate the value of tax cuts as a means of introducing dynamism into the economy. The economy is influenced by medium-term goals and psychology. That is why the fixed period consolidation course undertaken by the coalition was so important. The coalition started pursuing consolidation in the recession and was now accelerating it through the federal consolidation package and the savings, consolidation, and growth package. Waigel pointed out that the capital markets had been relieved of quite a burden as a result of consolidation and the introduction of the solidarity surcharge as of 1995. This has made it easier for the Bundesbank to make decisions and has led to the relatively low interest rates. Medium-term tax cuts are also part of this long-term orientation. In the future, the Bundesbank will also continue to pursue a taxation policy oriented toward growth, performance, the family, and medium-size businesses. Apart from continuing with the tax-free status of the minimum wage within the framework of a system of taxes based on performance and the simplification of taxation, a further focus of attention will be an improvement in the general conditions under which companies operate and thus in the framework conditions for jobs. Waigel includes among these points a reduction in corporate tax, the exemption of the tax on nonrevenue wealth in the new laender beyond 1995, as well as the principle of transferring to the country of origin the levying of value-added tax in the European Union [EU]. The introduction of this principle will mean that deliveries of goods within the community will essentially be treated as domestic deliveries. Taxation Rates The reduction in corporate tax within the framework of the law on safeguarding Germany's future as a center for business as well as lowering the taxation of income from business activity to 47 percent were considerable successes, said Waigel. He conceded that this differentiation of taxation rates was not attractive from the viewpoint of the overall taxation system. However, in view of the reductions in the transfer payments to the eastern laender that were instituted at the same time, it would not have been acceptable for big earners in show business, sports, and politics to pay less tax. The tax relief on savings for medium-size businesses has not been pursued by the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] as Oskar Lafontaine told HANDELSBLATT (the issue of 10-11 June 1994). In fact, during the mediation process on safeguarding Germany's future as a center for business, the SPD did more to prevent the introduction of the tax relief on savings on 1 January 1994. It will not come into force until 1 January 1995. In its taxation and budget policies, the coalition government has always sought to maintain a social balance. The solidarity surcharge will preserve that balance. Until now, the costs of German unity have to a large extent been borne by so-called "better earners." The "better earners" have been wrongly drawn into a discussion that is wrong. Waigel said: "I have not seen any signs of a lack of justice." Waigel pointed to the progressive taxation rates and the increase in the tax on private wealth. If one looks at the solidarity surcharge rates for earners of low, medium, and high incomes, then one can see that a social balance has also been retained in this area. The abolition of the solidarity surcharge called for by the SPD and its replacement by a 10-percent supplementary charge for gross incomes above DM60,000/DM120,000 (single/married) would impose a further burden on self-employed higher earners and would thus be counterproductive. Waigel asked at what level the incomes of better earners really start. If one takes the figures given by Mr. Scharping, namely, an income of DM50,000 for single people, one is already in the average-income bracket. If one considers Scharping's statement to a French newspaper on how the supplementary charge is to provide as much revenue as the solidarity surcharge, it would have to already apply to gross incomes above DM44,000 in the case of single people and DM88,000 in the case of married couples. In net terms, that is, after the deduction of all taxes and dues, it would mean about DM2,300 in the case of single people. If one wanted to excuse 80 percent of taxpayers, then there would be a budget shortfall of about DM7.5 billion. That is why SPD demands for a supplementary charge are lacking sense in fiscal terms. The SPD's fiscal and tax policies have made the party lose credibility and that rebounded on it at the elections last Sunday [12 June]. Waigel pointed out that the solidarity surcharge had been approved with votes from laender governed by the SPD. Valuation Rates On the question of inheritance and wealth taxes, Waigel said he wanted to wait to see what the Federal Constitutional Court's position is on valuation criteria. Essentially, he considers it right to retain a form of revenue-based taxation and not to introduce valuation criteria based on market rates. If the Federal Constitutional Court decides that the 1964 valuation criteria are no longer valid, it might also be possible to achieve a settlement in keeping with the constitution using differentiated surcharges. However, the federal authorities, laender, and municipalities should not attempt to obtain higher revenues through new criteria for the valuation of land holdings. In Waigel's opinion, a carbon dioxide energy tax should impose a further burden on the economy. He said that the conditions for the introduction of a carbon dioxide energy tax were that taxes would not be raised, that there would be competitive neutrality, which means that Germany should not introduce such a tax by itself, and that it could be used to direct a specific ecological course, that is to say, no forms of energy containing carbon dioxide should be exempted. Taxation of Interest Waigel stressed that the harmonization of interest rate taxation in Europe would be a main focus of attention for the German EU presidency, which begins on 1 July of this year. Now that a liberalization of the movement of capital within the EU has been achieved, it must be ensured that no new competitive inequalities arise as a result of the differences in the taxation of revenue from capital assets. Different systems are used within the EU; in some countries there are notification systems and in others taxation at source. Waigel is seeking a settlement based on the principle of subsidiarity, a settlement that would essentially leave each country's national taxation system untouched, but would, at the same time, make it impossible to evade the obligation to pay tax. This does not amount to trying to square a circle, but can easily be achieved. Member states that have a notification system would be able to retain it and place such information at the disposal of member states with a deduction of tax system. On the other hand, countries using a system based on the deduction of tax must ensure that deductions are also made in the case of EU foreigners. Waigel said that he did not think that off-shore places such as the Channel Islands posed a great problem.
