The presidium meeting also solicited opinions from the delegations to the current congress session on the above reports submitted by the provincial people's government. Governor He Zhiqiang delivered a speech in which he stated: The deputies have advanced a host of proposals and views on how improve the work of the provincial people's government. These proposals and views are bound to contribute to the work of the provincial people's government in 1994. We will sort out these proposals and views; handle in a conscientious manner each and every motion tabled by the deputies at the current congress session according to official procedures; fully consider and absorb their opinons on the provincial people's government work report; and submit a revised provincial people's government work report, together with a written explanation to all the presidium executive chairmen for their examination. Governor He Zhiqiang noted: The year 1994 is a crucial one for Yunnan's reform, opening up, and economic construction. In 1994, Yunnan is to unfold a series of major reforms, as well as large- scale, wide-ranging, and extremely difficult economic structural readjustments. We inevitably will encounter some new problems in this process, but we will exert our utmost efforts to make much greater strides forward in building a socialist market economy structure. We will continue to build projects aimed at assisting poverty-stricken areas in accordance with the State Council plan, as well as in light of the realities in Yunnan. We will strengthen agricultural production in a comprehensive way, as it is the foundation of China's national economy. We will further expand our opening up to the outside world and will carry out large-scale, comprehensive agricultural exploitation across the province, with a view to developing a high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture, and to enhancing agriculture as the foundation of China's national economy. Governor He Zhiqiang said: This year, we are going to observe the World Tourism Festival and the China Historical and Cultural Tourism Festival, during which we will strive to open up new vistas for the development of tourism in Yunnan. We also have decided to concentrate human, material, and financial resources on the construction of key projects. In order to push forward reform and opening up, and to safeguard social and political stability, the provincial people's government will take a series of measures, and will try to achieve tangible results in the comprehensive management of social order. While accelerating the pace of inviting foreign capital and advanced foreign technology, we also will try to build several large projects with foreign capital and make new breakthroughs in inviting foreign capital. Governor He Zhiqiang asserted: In 1994, when confronting arduous tasks and new difficulties, the provincial people's government will try to absorb the proposals and views advanced by the people's deputies at the current congress session; will rely on the people of the whole province; will further emancipate our minds; work harder; and score more achievements under the leadership of the provincial party committee, and the support and supervision of the provincial people's congress, as well as the democratic supervision and support of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. We will exert our utmost efforts to live up to the trust placed in us by the people's deputies to the current congress session!
