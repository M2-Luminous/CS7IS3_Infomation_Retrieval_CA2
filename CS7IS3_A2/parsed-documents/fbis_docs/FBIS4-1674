In the past, only state or collectively-owned organizations were allowed to construct and run power plants. This policy hampered the development of Fujian's power resources, which include many rivers with steep drops suitable for hydro-electric power stations. While thermal power plants have very limited output due to the province's lack of coal, less than 22 percent of the hydraulic resources were utilized. As a result, this southeast China's coastal province is left with a shortage of several hundred millions of kwh of electricity per year. Since the mid-1980s, however, Fujian has used 800 million U.S. dollars from overseas investors to build several power plants. The provincial authorities recently announced new policies to encourage foreign investment in construction and management of local power stations. Several projects have been set for tenders, according to relevant departments.
