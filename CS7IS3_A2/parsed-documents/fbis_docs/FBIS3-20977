While two years ago they needed only one common display booth, there are now already 15 exhibitors in Munich. "It required a great effort to gain a foothold on the market" explains marketing manager Ingo Reichel. A little luck played its role too: In 1991, just during the confusion in the aftermath of the turning-point events, the West European manufacturer of GaAs single crystals Wacker closed shop. This did not help the people in Saxony much at first, their enterprise still being held in trust. "Had we been so far advanced then as we are today, we certainly would have been able to take over the customers by following target-oriented marketing procedures" assesses Reichel. As it was, however, the competition in Southeast Asia snatched the customers away from us with lightning speed. "Today we must spare no effort to win these customers back." At the PRODUCTRONICA Exhibition the Elektonikwerkstoffe (Electronic Materials) Ltd in Freiberg displays single-crystal silicon blocks and slices for photovoltaic cells and electronic devices, also GaAs slices for microwave components and for low-power components. This enterprise has developed and made specialty materials for over the past 35 years. As always, in keeping up with developments in electronics, these materials today are silicon and gallium arsenide. Also Lothar Spaeth of Jenoptik Ltd is now in Munich. Evolving from the former Carl Zeiss combine in Jena, this company could have afforded to send a representative to the previous 1991 PRODUCTRONICA Exhibition already. Spaeth wants to enter not only the European market but also the U.S.A. and Southeast Asia. With a staff of 1,250 highly qualified employees, the enterprise is active in many business areas: microelectronics, sensors, heavy-duty optics, and precision mechanics. One strength of Jenoptik is development and production of equipment for the semiconductor industry: electron-beam lighting apparatus, wafer steppers, fine-structure forming apparatus for printed-circuit boards and handling systems, also for measuring and inspection devices. The Jena people are exhibiting in Munich three innovative developments. The DirectPrint 40 is a laser-type direct-lighting apparatus for printed-circuit boards. It facilitates formation of fine structures having an only 40 ï¿½m track width on a printed-circuit board. A minifacility for fabrication under Class 1 clean-room conditions is hidden behind the SMIF Lean Robot SLR 150 AF exhibit. The third novelty is the DefectFinder 2000, a wafer inspecting device with which slicing processes can be automatically monitored. Now, for the first time, the FHR Anlagenbau (Equipment Construction) enterprise, in existence since 1991, represented in the very traditional Apparatus Construction Post Dresden. This enterprise evolved from the Elektromat enterprise. The staff brought with it many years of experience in development and construction of equipment for vacuum and film deposition processes. With this asset, it should be possible to increase the net output from 1.2 million DM in 1992 to 2 million DM in this year already. The enterprise does not only develop equipment and devices but also takes over services from and handles products of prominent European manufactures. Its current principal area of activity is environment-friendly treatment, modification, and cleaning of surfaces by plasma and vacuum processes. A large-surface sputtering apparatus makes it possible to coat most diverse target surfaces of all materials currently in use. A whole selection will be shown in Munich. The Feutron Ltd in Greiz (Vogtland in Thuringia), for over 50 years a specialist in refrigeration, climate, and environment simulation engineering, has already installed about 15,000 climatic test chambers all over Europe. It holds 50 relevant patents. This company will demonstrate in Munich how it reacted to the collapse of ancestral eastern markets by modernizing and shaping up its product line so that now its specialties are: custom-built high-tech equipment for simulation of characteristics of the environment, complete transportable climatic test laboratories, and outdoor measuring stations.
