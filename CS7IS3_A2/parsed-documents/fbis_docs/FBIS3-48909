The newspapers detail the last hours of Zhirinovskiy's visit here. He left for Moscow by a scheduled flight at 14:20 p.m. local time. "The interior minister's order for Zhirinovskiy's expulsion was unnecessary, stupid and leaves open the question about the real motives. It also is indicative of a temper lost," runs a commentary in KONTINENT daily, adding that "talks with Zhirinovskiy should have been held only by force of argument, or no comments should have been made at all -- just the way the president had reacted in the case of U.S. Ambassador William Montgomery's statements," an editorial commentary in 24 CHASA blames the president's advisers for having invited only foreign correspondents and reporters of "selected Bulgarian Mass media" to hear Dr. Zhelev's remarks yesterday. The trade union daily TRUD runs an interview with Svetoslav Stoilov whom Zhirinovskiy proclaimed as the future president of Bulgaria. Asked if he really believed he was going to be the next president of Bulgaria, Stoilov said, "Me, a Bulgarian president? This statement is offending me. I am going to be president of the Balkans (of all countries on the Balkan peninsula). A severe cataclysm is due in Bulgaria. We will throw all the present parties into the Black Sea. The plan is ready." Interviewed for the Socialist Party daily DUMA, the leader of the Bulgarian Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Veselin Koshev says that before leaving Bulgaria Zhirinovskiy had declared he would come back here as president of Russia. Koshev says that the Bulgarian LDP invited Zhirinovskiy to visit Bulgaria again in March or April next year, and a delegation of LDP will visit Moscow in January. [passage omitted]
