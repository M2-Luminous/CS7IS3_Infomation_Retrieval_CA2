FR941206-1-00055 FR941206-1-00007 If a finishing material is thinned with solvent after purchase, the HAP and solids content reported on the CPDS must be adjusted to account for HAP from the thinner and the lower solids content of the thinned material. The HAP content of the thinner must be no more than 10.0 percent by weight. Washcoats, basecoats, and enamels will be deemed compliant if they are formulated at the wood furniture facility with a compliant coating and thinners containing no more than 3.0 percent HAP by weight. The owner or operator of an existing source is in initial and continuous compliance with the proposed standards if the HAP content of each affected stain, sealer, and topcoat is no greater than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied; each thinner used for stains, sealers, topcoats, and premade washcoats, basecoats, and enamels is less than or equal to 10.0 percent HAP by weight; and each washcoat, basecoat, and enamel that is formulated at the facility is formulated with a coating containing no more than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids) and a thinner containing no more than 3.0 percent HAP by weight, or each washcoat, basecoat, and enamel that is purchased premade has a HAP content of no more than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied. The owner or operator of a new source is in initial and continuous compliance with the proposed standards if the HAP content of each stain is no greater than 1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids (1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied; the HAP content of each sealer and topcoat is no greater than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, each thinner used for stains, sealers, and topcoats, and washcoats, basecoats, and enamels that are purchased premade is less than or equal to 10.0 percent HAP by weight; and each washcoat, basecoat, and enamel that is formulated at the facility is formulated with a coating containing no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids) and a thinner containing no more than 3.0 percent HAP by weight, or each one that is purchased premade has a HAP content of no more than 0.8 kg VHAP/kg solids (0.8 lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied. The use of any finishing material or thinner that does not meet the HAP limits specified in the proposed rule during any day constitutes a separate violation of the proposed rule for that day. The proposed standards include special compliance provisions for sources using a compliant coatings approach for meeting the proposed standards and that are applying those coatings using continuous coaters. With continuous coaters, any coating that is not applied to the parts to be finished is recycled to the coating reservoir. Solvent is added to the coating reservoir to ensure the proper mixture of solids and solvent is maintained. In this case, the records may show that the VHAP content of the coating in the reservoir is above the emission limit and a sample of the coating in the reservoir may indicate the coating is compliant. While the records are the more accurate measure of the VHAP content of the coating, they do not reflect that there will be some evaporation of the VHAP from the coating being recycled to the reservoir. In order to account for this evaporation, the EPA examined special compliance provisions for facilities using continuous coaters. Affected sources that are applying coatings using continuous coaters have two options for demonstrating compliance. These are: 1. Using compliant coatings, as determined by the VHAP content of the coating in the reservoir and the VHAP content of the coating as calculated from records; or 2. Using compliant coatings, as determined by the VHAP content of the coating in the reservoir, and maintaining a viscosity of the coating in the reservoir that is no less than the viscosity of the initial coating. The Agency recognizes that records may show the VHAP content of a coating is higher than the emission limitation when the coating is applied with a continuous coater. However, the Agency also recognizes that continuous coaters are potentially more efficient than spray application systems. In order to use option (2), the affected source must demonstrate that there is a relationship between the viscosity of the material and the HAP content of the material. Affected sources may monitor the viscosity of the coating with a viscosity meter or they may measure the viscosity each time solvent is added to the reservoir. If an affected source does not wish to monitor the viscosity then records must demonstrate that the coating is compliant.
