This was disclosed by a source connected with the Japan-U.S. negotiations on 23 January. The details of this voluntary plan include promotion of the "Design-In" Project, according to which American and Japanese auto parts makers will join in the new product development from the stage of designing; and plan to lay groundwork for increasing procurement of U.S.-made auto parts through such measures as promotion of joint ventures to be established by Japanese and U.S. makers. However, it will probably be all the more a tough choice for Japanese makers because they are faced with several difficulties such as sluggish sales on the domestic market and a continuous drop in their share of the U.S. market. The priority has been given to the negotiations on auto and auto parts so that an accord can be reached before the Japan-U.S. summit scheduled for 11 February. The United States demands that Japan should not only increase its target of importing auto parts (in the amount of $19 billion for fiscal 1994), which was worked out by Japan in January 1992 as the auto industrial circles' voluntary plan but also extend this target even after fiscal 1995. In fact, the United States demands that substantial numerical targets be set. In response, Japan has rejected setting targets and sharp confrontations have continued between the two countries. The situation now indicates "no progress even by an inch has been made in negotiations," (as stated by U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten). Maintaining that it is impossible to reach an accord before the February summit, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association, Inc. [JAMAI] have begun to suggest a plan to extend negotiations until the next summit talks. However, the fact remains that export of auto and auto parts accounts for 60 percent of Japan's trade surplus to the United States and that the U.S. market is of the greatest importance to Japanese makers. Therefore, it is necessary to work out a compromise that will satisfy the United States to a certain extent. U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce Garten arrived in Japan last week for a visit and he has asked all the auto makers for their cooperation. Reportedly, he got the impression that "Japanese makers have begun to realize the importance of the U.S. market and to seek ways to break the deadlock," (according to a high-ranking U.S. Government official). Moreover, favorable signs of compromise have begun to appear at long last. For example, JAMAI Chairman Yutaka Kume expressed at a news conference on 20 January positive views about the prospects for setting up joint ventures. It is observed that the study of the voluntary plan is part of such moves. By preparing conditions for increasing the original target of $19 billion, Japan's intention lies in concluding the "theological argument" over the propriety of setting numerical targets so as to proceed to substantial negotiations. However, due to the sluggish situation of the auto industry, "it is difficult to attain the target of $19 billion," (according to a MITI source). Even if the voluntary plan should be worked out, there is a strong possibility that the United States will threaten Japan with sanctions if the situation unfavorable to the United States should continue to exist. Thus, it is expected that drastic confrontations may continue between Japan and the United States over the interpretation of the issue.
