According to INTERFAX sources, Khetagurov told North Ossetian intellectuals that the first round of elections would be unlikely to bring about definite results. He urged the voters to rally around the future president and prevent a social split irrespective of the election results. The Central Electoral Commission informed INTERFAX, meanwhile, that 6 out of the 8 candidates would continue the presidential race. Two candidates, among them former first secretary of the North Ossetian Communist Party Committee Aleksandr Dzasokhov, have withdrawn their candidacies. Dzasokhov stated that he had removed his candidacy "in the interests of social consolidation and victory of the sound forces".
