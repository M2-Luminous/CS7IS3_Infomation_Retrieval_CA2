The autonomy agreement with the Palestinians was under way and now -- so goes the good news from the eternal optimist, Foreign Minister Peres -- one was having one's "heads and hands free to deal with Syria." After all, his boss, Yitzhaq Rabin, had been more and more clearly offering the Syrians a deal on the Golan: "For peace I am ready to clear settlements." On Sunday [1 May], a member of the Israeli delegation in the negotiations even "anonymously" announced the implementation: Damascus was ready to respect Israeli security needs, and that "is encouraging." After all, so far Syria had always insisted that questions of security "can be dealt with only after the complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights." The next day, the icy shower came from Damascus. There, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher conveyed to dictator al-Asad Jerusalem's most recent proposals, the essence of which is: the gradual withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for gradual peace -- according to the time-tested recipe "one piece of land, one piece of peace," which was so successfully tried out by Egypt and Israel with the Camp David Agreement. Yet, hardly had Christopher departed than his Syrian colleague al-Shar' began to attack the trial balloon with a pike: "Never! We will not accept peace in steps." Complete withdrawal first, and only then will peace talks be possible. Just as his boss al-Asad, al-Shar' also knows that the Israelis will not accept such a deal. So why the brutal public rejection? First, because such tactics are a part of any poker game. For months, the Israelis have presented the Syrians as more willing than they really are to build up pressure against the enemy in the form of expectations. And Damascus has as often resorted to cold water to achieve an even better price. And since Damascus has so far fared well with this tactic -- Rabin has continually increased his offer -- the Syrians will not abandon their course unless they have to. Second, in the Middle East nothing is being negotiated in public, let alone being discussed in public, because there are no free media in the Arab region. What is announced hardly ever reflects the real state of negotiations. Third, the Syrians believe that they have time. The Golan is mainly of symbolic value for al-Asad; Syria has existed without it for 27 years, so a few more do not really matter. Still, even this most cunning of all tacticians knows that Jerusalem will not give away one inch of soil without a return service. Whether the Israeli Army controls the attack axis toward Galilee, or, conversely, Syrian cannoneers can directly look down on territory of Israeli settlements is a question of life and death for Israel. Thus, Israel will give way only step by step in order to test Syria's intentions. After all, al-Asad also knows that he is unable to get a better deal than Egypt, Israel's far more dangerous opponent.
