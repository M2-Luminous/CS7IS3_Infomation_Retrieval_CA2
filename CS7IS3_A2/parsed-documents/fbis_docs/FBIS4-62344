Attitude to Russian Troops in Moldova May Change in the Most Unpredictable Way"] [Text] During festivities held in Tiraspol on the occasion of Victory Day, the Dniester Region leaders pointedly distanced themselves from the command of the 14th Army. Igor Smirnov, president of the Dniester Region Moldovan Republic, departed from the city's central square after laying flowers and making a brief address to the veterans, leaving it to General Aleksandr Lebed and his subordinates to take charge of the conduct of the celebration -- something the Russian soldiers did a good job of. This public demonstration of hostility has effectively been precipitated by the general context of relations between the Dniester Region leaders and the 14th Army command, which have recently been described as woefully bad. Judging by some indicators, the Dniester Region leaders, having soberly weighed all the "pros" and "cons" regarding the presence of the Russian troops in the region, are inclined to think that their withdrawal will only be welcome. After recent political breakthroughs toward the final settlement of the Dniester Region crisis, the Tiraspol authorities, who formerly prayed for the 14th Army as their sole guardian, are no longer attaching crucial importance to this function of the Russian troops. Moreover, the republic itself presently has its own armed forces that are fully capable of dealing with the potential adversary -- the Moldovan Army. The decrease in the 14th Army's strategic importance in the view of Dniester Region leaders has brought its political role in the region to the foreground. This role, given the well-known stance of Gen. Aleksandr Lebed, who, as people here believe, has powerful circles in Moscow behind him, does not suit Tiraspol at all. The line pursued by the 14th Army commander during the past 18 months has been aimed at replacing the current ruling elite of the Dniester Region Moldovan Republic with more liberal leaders capable of striking a compromise with Moldova. The peculiarity of the political situation in the Dniester Region is that the 14th Army command is the sole serious opposition to the Tiraspol regime. Its political satellites from among local opposition figures wield little clout and do not pose any independent threat to the authorities. This is why the removal of Gen. Lebed from the Dniester Region is seen by some Tiraspol politicians as a fairly acceptable option. Moreover, the issue is precisely the withdrawal of the army, not just the replacement of its commander, because in the latter case Aleksandr Lebed will be replaced by another general with similar instructions. Suggestions that the 14th Army commander's 18-month revolt might be an independent action have long lost credibility with anyone here. What is interesting in this situation is Chisinau's stance. They are fully aware there that as of today Gen. Lebed is the sole force that can weaken the current orthodox Tiraspol authorities, if not topple them altogether. Upon the withdrawal of the 14th Army from the Dniester Region, the chances of the local opposition will be brought to nil, and the positions of Igor Smirnov and Co. will receive a significant boost. The latter is unlikely to please the Moldovan leaders, particularly on the eve of an extremely difficult and prolonged stage of detailed negotiations on the final settlement of the Dniester Region problem. Therefore, the current political alignment suggests that they in Chisinau are objectively interested in having the 14th Army stay on. That this is not idle talk was proved by the fact that in the recent Moldovan-Dniester Region-Russian talks the question of withdrawing the 14th Army was not even raised.
