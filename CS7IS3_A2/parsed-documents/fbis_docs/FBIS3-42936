Udaltsov, chief editor of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, and V. Zapevalov, correspondent of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA in Bonn; place and date not given: "I Believe in the Strength of Russian Democracy"] [Text] Bonn--Hans-Dietrich Genscher (b. 1927) is the "world champion" foreign minister. He spent 18 years in this difficult office. The cardinal changes in East Europe over the past five years are linked with his name. He retired voluntarily on 17 May 1992 at the height of his political fame. He is honorary chairman of the Free Democratic Party of the FRG. As before, he is among the most, if not the most, popular politician in Germany. He rarely gives interviews, but he responded to LITERATURNAYA GAZETA's request immediately. We met with Genscher in his relatively modest member's office in the Bundestag. Let us say plainly that in conversation "off the record," he spouted jokes, made decisive statements, and was candid. When, however, the conversation was being "taped" for the press, we were faced with a "crafty fox," as journalists rightly call him. But with a close reading of the answers to LITERATURNAYA GAZETA's questions, the reader will, it seems to us, find much material for the most diverse reflection, assessments, and conclusions. [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Herr Genscher, we know you as a most prominent politician of Germany and top foreign policy specialist. We know how much you have dealt with problems of the USSR and Russia. We would like today, therefore, to concentrate on one topic: "Russia from April 1985 through the present through the eyes of Herr Genscher." Let us start at the very beginning: Under what circumstances did you get to know Mikhail Gorbachev, what impression did he make on you at that time, and what, afterward, and how might you evaluate him today? [Genscher] I made the acquaintance of Mr. Gorbachev in 1986, during a visit to Moscow. He made an unforgettable impression on me. I was taken primarily with his call for new thinking. He seemed a self-assured and quite complex conversational partner. But he was prepared to hear another opinion also and to seek mutual understanding on contentious issues. His policy led to the surmounting of East-West contradictions and afforded an opportunity for the unity of all of Europe. For us Germans this meant unity for our people also. His policy of elimination of the East-West confrontation and the fundamental changes in the former Soviet Union are of historic dimensions. [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] The same question concerns Boris Yeltsin. Could you venture a comparison of these two politicians? [Genscher] Comparing these two outstanding personalities would be unfair to both of them. Boris Yeltsin supports a continuation of East-West cooperation, as was emphasized anew recently during the meeting with President Clinton. Even today he has done much for the process of democratization and reforms in Russia. [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] The first free parliamentary elections in Russia did not produce the results anticipated by Russia's democrats or by the democrats of Europe, either. In addition, we obtained the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon." What, in your opinion, were the decisive mistakes of the democrats which made possible such an election outcome? [Genscher] We had hoped for a more favorable result for the democrats in Russia, of course. The question arises, however: Was this possible? After all, in the course of the relatively short space of time that democratization has had, all the problems of the past and the transitional period have become apparent, but there has not as yet been successful reform. I believe in the strength of democracy in Russia and in the will of the great Russian people, who by their culture and historic achievements have made such a great contribution to the formation of Europe's future. There is nothing surprising in the fact that at a time of revolutionary changes and ideological retreat on the question of national self-determination, there has been a stimulation of the activity of nationalist politicians. This does not confirm the soundness of their ideas but, on the contrary, requires even greater explanatory work to show their danger. [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Herr Genscher, you contributed to this extent or the other to the fall of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe and, subsequently, in the republics of the former USSR. A multitude of armed conflicts has arisen in the world, and much blood has been spilled and continues to be spilled in the wake of this. Have you no regrets? Do you believe it might have been possible to move toward democracy by other routes, or are the conflicts and blood inevitable? [Genscher] A great achievement of the peoples of the former Soviet Union is the fact that the path from socialism to democracy, the path from centralism in the USSR to the independence of the republics, happened [as published] without war or the use of force. The present military conflicts and bloodshed are not a consequence of the transition to democracy. The principle contained in the Helsinki Final Act, namely, that all contentious issues should be settled by political means, is being forgotten. This needs to be remembered, remembered by everyone in Europe, what is more. At the end of the 20th century no one should any longer be expatiating on the inevitability of conflicts but speaking of the necessity for the peaceful settlement and surmounting of conflicts. [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Western assistance. Much is being said about this, but the average Russian has not perceived it as yet. Whence the allergy to these words. And the well-known Czech politician Mlynar even counseled in our paper against Western capital being admitted to Russia. What can you say on this score? [Genscher] As far as Western assistance is concerned, Germany has made a substantial contribution, greater, generally, than all the other Western countries put together. This is in keeping with our strong friendly relations with the Russian people and other peoples of the former USSR. That this capital has not had the consequences for the ordinary citizens that we had imagined has been the result of the above-mentioned complex problems of the transitional period. At the same time, on the other hand, no country can manage without foreign capital, be they the Americans, the Germans, the French, the British, or the Russians. The transfer of capital signifies simultaneously financial and economic cooperation and thus a growing interweave of interests. [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] A couple of questions about foreign policy. Do you also, like certain politicians in the FRG, observe imperialist ambitions or trends toward them in Russian foreign policy? How is the concept of a "country's national interests" defined? [Genscher] Of course, each people must themselves define the "national interests" concept. But these interests suffer if they are detrimental to the interests of other countries. Such is the philosophy of our cooperation in the European Union. This is the philosophy of the Helsinki Final Act and the Paris Charter, and this should be the philosophy of the building of the architecture for all of Europe, to which for me all the successors of the former Soviet Union, Russia included, naturally, pertain. [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] You were a most impassioned supporter of a security system that affords equal prospects for all countries. Do the recent NATO decisions correspond to this? If so, why are the East European and Baltic countries not entirely satisfied with the results of the summit in Brussels? [Genscher] I remain a convinced supporter of a policy that affords all countries in Europe equal prospects. It was for this reason that two and a half years ago I supported together with then Secretary of State Baker the creation of the NATO Cooperation Council and an area of stabilization from Vancouver to Vladivostok. For this same reason I have always advocated increasingly close relations among the European Community, the countries of Central and Southeast Europe, and the successors of the former Soviet Union. It is essential to see all the prospects of cooperation, not just the military prospects. The results of the NATO summit correspond to these requirements. This means simultaneously an increase in the role of the European Union in all-European responsibility also. My impression is that the Central and East European countries and the Baltic states are recognizing increasingly what opportunities this concept affords. [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Might Russia become a member of NATO in the future, what are the conditions for this? [Genscher] There are for Russia no prerequisites other than those that face the other members of the NATO Cooperation Council. But Russia occupies a special place even now, maintaining a strategic partnership with the United States. I see this partnership as an expression of the joint responsibility of the two nuclear powers. [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Reproaches have been heard in Bonn and even more loudly in Moscow that Russia and Germany lack a concept for a joint future and that our relations are in a stagnation phase. [Genscher] I cannot share this reproach, inasmuch as there are between Russia and Germany an important joint statement and documents that take account of the special relationship between our countries. This particular feature is based on historical roots. Even the horrifying World War II could not erase from the memory the historical, cultural, and human relations between Germans and Russians. This particular feature is being expressed today also in the fact that the Germans and Russians want to achieve mutual understanding not behind the backs and not to the detriment of other countries. Whoever is in a position correctly to evaluate German-Polish and German-Czech relations will see that our immediate neighbors in the East have no grounds for apprehension. And as for everything else, no one should worry on account of the German-Russian partnership. At the same time close German-Russian relations are a contribution to stability in Europe. The new culture of joint existence demands observance of equality and an equal degree of security for all countries in Europe, for small countries to no less an extent than for larger countries. The relations of these countries imply participation in the building of the all-European infrastructure, which includes all Central and Southeast European countries and all successors of the USSR. A joint system of transport, telecommunications, energy--these are major investments for the future which will link in Europe the creative powers of our peoples and our economic potentials. [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Germany has embarked on a particularly active political year. You have declined to be a candidate for the office of federal president. German astrologers predicted on the threshold of 1994 that you would retire from active politics altogether this year. This is hard to believe. What are your personal plans and goals for the year of 1994? [Genscher] My goal is to contribute to big successes for my party in 1994. This implies an active, not passive, approach.
