Over 65,000 employees have stopped work, the only departments still functioning being those that transport personnel inside the pits and deliver coal to the population. Another warning strike and a rally was announced today by employees of the Targu Jiu [mining equipment] Repair Plant. Similarly, the Lignite Mining Trade Union Confederation, which is affiliated to the union confederation headed by Miron Cosma [union leader of the Jiu Valley miners], requested permission to organize a rally at Rovinari, but the local police and mayor's office refused, suggesting that it should be postponed until after the general strike in the region.
