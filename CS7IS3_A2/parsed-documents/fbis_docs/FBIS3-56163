This document was passed to Interfax by one of his nearest associates, who witnessed the suicide of Georgia's first president. "I have used all legitimate and democratic ways of regaining power. My people, who love me, did not do everything they could to support me. I think my death will unite the people of Georgia. Let it be a symbol of protest for all peoples aspiring to freedom and independence," says Gamsakhurdia's testament. "Russia, you, too, are to blame for my death. You will be repaid a hundredfold for your unworthy deeds. You are as much responsible for my death as my countrymen," says Gamsakhurdia's testament.
