Utilizing the capabilities of personal computer communication networks such as electronic bulletin boards, conferences, and e-mail, an information network will be established. At the same time, questions and demands from the businesses will be considered, and a system for information exchange will be built. Operation will be managed by the Material Manufacturing Center and plans call for start up in April, 1994. This is the first nationwide information network in Japan connecting the government and corporations bi-directionally. Although materials manufacturing in Japan is an important pillar supporting the manufacturing sector, industrial reform is needed because of the protracted bad economy and the rising yen. For this reason, concerns over loan policies, taxation, and aids to fund employment, as well as the establishment of policies and suggestions for improvement have been increasing. However since the opinions are expressed to the government indirectly via the heads of organizations such as area business associations or industrial unions in each prefecture, it is difficult for the owner of a business to raise his voice and to be heard directly. The network system based on personal computer communication establishes a ``Parts and Products Production Salon,'' to which public organizations of material related industries and associations will input necessary information. Electronic bulletin boards, electronic conferences, e-mail, and databases are planned for this network. For example, at an electronic conference, discussion of business concerns can occur. As a concrete plan, multiple corners including ``Opinions to MITI,'' ``Requests to the Material Center,'' and a ``Technical PeopleUs Salon'' will be created. Also, past question and answer sessions will be stored as examples, enabling small business owners to use them as a reference, helping them to prepare detailed steps that they can take for smooth action. Although a personal computer communication network is provided by the ``MPT Online Public Announcement System,'' a bi-directional communication network between government and businesses is a first this time.
