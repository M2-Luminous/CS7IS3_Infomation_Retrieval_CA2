Industrial output in the Czech Republic in December 1993 was 4.0 percent lower than in December 1992. It fell by 5.3 percent in 1993 as a whole compared with 1992. Organizations with 100 or more employees had a decisive influence on the decline. In 1993, the average monthly wage in industrial organizations with 25 or more employees was 5,962 korunas [Kc] and was thus 23.8 percent higher than in 1992. The number of state enterprises declined; on the other hand, the number of business associations and cooperatives increased. Construction output fell at the end of 1993 and, in December, was 20.5 percent lower than in December 1992. The volume of construction output for 1993 as a whole was 7.5 percent lower than in 1992. The average gross monthly wage in organizations with 25 or more employees was Kc6,566 and 28.6 percent higher than in 1992. The volume of goods conveyed by public freight transportation in 1993 was 200.6 million tonnes; it declined by 13.2 percent. Railroad freight transportation declined by 9.4 percent. In view of the increasing exports, however, 14.9 percent more wagons were used to transport cargo abroad. In public road haulage, the percentage of international truck transportation increased. In 1993, the potato harvest increased by 21.7 percent, rape by 25.9 percent, sugar beet by 11.2 percent, fruit by 13.1 percent, and vegetables by 19.1 percent. The cereal harvest declined by 1.5 percent. Compared with 1992, the sale of agricultural products from primary producers was 26.1 percent lower for slaughter poultry, 10.5 percent lower for milk, and 3.1 percent lower for slaughter cattle. The sale of slaughter hogs and eggs increased by 8.6 percent and 22.4 percent, respectively. Foreign trade turnover (excluding the Slovak Republic) in 1993 amounted to Kc599 billion and was 10.6 percent higher than in 1992. Exports rose by 20 percent and imports by 2.7 percent. Exports fell in relation to the countries of the former East bloc. The balance of trade was in the red by Kc3.7 billion. When trade with Slovakia is included (exports of Kc74.6 billion; imports of Kc65 billion), the overall balance was in the black by Kc5.9 billion. The physical volume of retail sales rose by 1.0 percent in 1993, compared with 1992. The number of registered job seekers increased gradually from July and, by 31 December, had reached 185,200 (50,400 more compared with the end of 1992). The unemployment rate at the end of the year was 3.5 percent. The average monthly rate of increase in consumer prices in 1993 was 1.4 percent. Following a more substantial rise in prices in January and February, caused in particular by the introduction of value-added and consumer taxes, the rate of increase in the succeeding months was approximately 0.5 percent. The exception was a higher rise in prices in September and October. This was influenced by increases in the prices of meat, meat products, and communications tariffs. In December 1993, the level of consumer prices was 18.2 percent higher than in December 1992. The prices of services increased fastest (by 25.3 percent), and the prices of food products increased slowest (by 13.2 percent). The rate of inflation, expressed as the annual sliding average of the aggregate consumer price index, was 20.8 percent.
