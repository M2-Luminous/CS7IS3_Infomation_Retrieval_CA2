The French defense minister was visiting a group of French special forces stationed less than 4 km -- as the crow flies -- from the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] positions. Francois Leotard explained that Rwanda must remain a multiethnic country, and preached French neutrality. Christophe Boisbouvier: [Boisbouvier] [passage omitted] There won't be any evacuations, said Francois Leotard, since there is no place where these refugees can be housed, but there will be more and more frequent French missions on the ground. [passage omitted] [Announcer] Francois Leotard stressed the need to pass the baton on to the United Nations soon, and indeed the arrival of French troops in Rwanda has somewhat destablized the work of the UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda [UNAMIR], the UN mission on the ground. The two military forces now have to coordinate their missions: That is what UNAMIR Commander General Dallaire wants, as he said just now in Nairobi, where he presented the UN medal to 100 or so soldiers who had served in Rwanda: [Begin recording] [Dallaire] We are working hard to increase its capacity and to be in a position to deploy more resources to be able to help the humanitarian side and to be there to monitor the cease-fires which I hope we will have some day. [Correspondent Jean Helene] Is it possible to envisage the French, and the coalition, the French Government, deploying in government zones, and UNAMIR reinforcements deploying in rebel zones? [Dallaire] No. The scenario appears to reflect that, but my positions and headquarters could move, and what we are doing is to retire via our logistics base, which is Entebbe, and we are going to spread out throughout the RPF zone and in the government zone. We still have men in Kigali, on the government side, and (?will continue to have them). [Helene] Do you expect to replace the French coalition in the west of the country when you have received your reinforcements? [Dallaire] Well, we -- the commander of the force and I -- are going to hold discussions, to see exactly what its operational plans and its operational aims are, and the procedures will then be determined.
