Six DEP [Democratic Party] deputies have been stripped of parliamentary immunity and imprisoned. The Army has unleashed harsh repressive measures in the Kurdistan region in order to block the offensive which the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] -- the anti-Ankara guerrilla movement -- is expected to launch in the spring. Nizamettin Toguc, DEP deputy for the Batman region, stated: "My six colleagues are risking the death sentence, and are being treated like members of a terrorist group. Their sole crime is having stood up for the Kurds." After being seriously wounded in a terrorist attack last September, Toguc is now in Italy to publicize his people's tragedy. [Olimpio] Is the Turkish Government's hard line inspired by the military? [Toguc] That is correct. The generals have never stopped meddling in politics and have brought a lot of pressure to bear on the authorities. It was the Security Council that drove parliament to deprive the deputies of their immunity. [Olimpio] Is Turkish Prime Minister Mrs. Tansu Ciller again playing the Kurdish trump to offset internal problems? [Toguc] The government is grappling with a profound crisis. The state's coffers are empty, particularly because of the war in Kurdistan. The government is in the difficult position of having to demand further sacrifices from the people, and having to meet the military's requests for more funds. [Olimpio] What do you think of the upcoming local elections? [Toguc] If these had been free elections, we would have supported them wholeheartedly. However, in order to prevent us from taking part in the vote, the state has attacked the DEP. Dozens of activists have been arrested, bombs have been planted in the various parties' headquarters, and candidates have been intimidated. This is why the DEP has decided not to take part in the elections, and has requested the people to abstain. [Toguc ends] An even harder line was adopted by the PKK, which warned candidates not to run in the elections: "Those who do not obey this order, will pay a high price," came the message. The resistance's dictate was accompanied by a diplomatic offensive which led PKK leader Abdullah Farhat's brother Farhat Ocalan to Moscow. According to Lebanese sources, Farhat was received by head of foreign counterintelligence Primakov, who promised to provide support and weapons.
