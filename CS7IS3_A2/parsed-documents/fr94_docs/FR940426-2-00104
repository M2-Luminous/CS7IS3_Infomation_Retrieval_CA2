FR940426-2-00104 FR940426-2-00065 2. Applicants believe that the proposed transaction is structured to protect the interests of Fund shareholders. Of the Fund's fourteen directors, eight directors (who are not ``interested persons,'' as defined in section 2(a)(19), of the Fund) represent institutional shareholders of the Fund. Two additional non-interested directors represent former shareholders of the Fund. All of the non-interested Fund directors are full-time investment professionals who act in such capacity for their respective employers in addition to their service to the Fund. 3. Persons purchasing shares of the Fund in issuer directed offerings must satisfy strict suitability standards. An investor that is a ``company,'' as defined in the Act, must have total assets in excess of $5 million. An investor who is a natural person must be an ``accredited investor'' within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933 (``1933 Act''), with an individual net worth of at least $1 million or an individual income in excess of $200,000 during each of the two most recent years. 4. The Fund proposes to invest in the emerging markets of Eastern Europe by purchasing shares of the New Europe Fund. The New Europe Fund is a closed-end investment company incorporated in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Its investment objective is to seek long-term capital appreciation through investment in companies domiciled in the countries of East Central Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union that are client countries of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation. 5. CIEMF, an investment company organized and operated outside of the United States, also proposes to invest in the New Europe Fund. CIEMF is not subject to the Act because it has not made, and presently does not propose to make, a public offering of its securities in the United States, and because the outstanding securities of CIEMF are beneficially owned by less than 100 United States persons. 6. The Manager, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act''), advises the Fund, the New Europe Fund, and CIEMF. 7. Shares of the New Europe Fund will be offered privately to institutional investors worldwide to be paid for in four tranches. The New Europe Fund has two classes of securities: (i) voting ordinary shares of $10.00 par value per share (``A Shares'') and (ii) voting preferred shares of $10.00 par value per share (``B Shares''), both of which carry the right to one vote per share at all meetings of the company. The A shares will be offered at a subscription price of $5,000 per share, and the B Shares will be offered at a subscription price of $125,000 per share. In general, the New Europe Fund anticipates that substantially all investment in the B Shares will be made by investors who also purchase A Shares and who, for tax or other reasons, are required to limit the amount of voting power they may acquire. Neither the A Shares nor the B Shares will be redeemable, and the New Europe Fund presently does not intend to repurchase either class of shares. Applicants represent that no application currently is being made to list the A Shares or the B Shares. In addition, none of these shares may be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, in the United States or to any United States person except in a transaction which is exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. 8. The Fund proposes to invest U.S. $50 million, approximately 21/2% if its total assets, to acquire approximately 25% of the economic value of the New Europe Fund's securities. Section 12(d)(1) restricts registered investment companies from acquiring more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of another investment company. To comply with this restriction, the Fund will invest in a combination of A Shares and B Shares so that it will hold less than 3% of the total voting power, but approximately 25% of the economic power, of the New Europe Fund. 9. CIEMF proposes to invest approximately 2% of its total assets, equivalent to U.S. $6,100,000, to acquire approximately 3% of the Company's outstanding securities. The Capital Group, Inc., the indirect parent company of the Manager, also plans to invest approximately $2 million to acquire approximately 1% of the New Europe Fund's securities. Both CIEMF and The Capital Group, Inc. will purchase only A Shares. The Capital Group, Inc. and all of its affiliates, including CIEMF, who purchase shares of the New Europe Fund will vote their shares in the New Europe Fund in the same proportion as the votes of all other shareholders in the company. Applicants represent that this minimizes the risk that insiders will use their voting power to advance their interests to the detriment of other shareholders of the company. 10. Under the Investment Advisory and Service Agreement currently in effect between the Fund and the Manager, the Fund pays the Manager a fee at the annual rates of 0.90% of the first U.S. $400 million of aggregate net assets of the Fund, 0.80% of such aggregate net assets in excess of U.S. $400 million, and 0.70% with respect to aggregate net assets in excess of U.S. $1 billion, as determined on the last business day of each week. The Manager has agreed to waiver that portion of its fee that would exceed 0.65% of aggregate net assets in excess of $2 billion. To avoid the possibility that the Manager will receive duplicate fees from the Fund and the New Europe Fund, the Manager will waive its fee, including administrative fees, with respect to the Fund's net assets represented by the Fund's proposed investment in the New Europe Fund. In calculating the fee waiver, the Manager will not take into account the amount of expenses or fees, if any, that were reimbursed to or waived for the Fund in connection with any voluntary or mandatory expense cap limitation or any fee waiver. Currently, the Fund does not have an expense cap arrangement with the Manager, although the Fund is subject to mandatory expense cap limitations imposed by state regulatory authorities. Any applicable expense cap or fee waiver will not limit the Manager's fee waiver with respect to the Fund's investment in the New Europe Fund. 11. The Manager will be entitled to a one-time incentive fee payable if and when the New Europe Fund becomes open-ended or has its shares listed and traded or, failing either, is placed in liquidation. Applicants believe that the incentive fee arrangement complies with the safe harbor of rule 205&hyph;3 of the Advisers Act. In addition, as investment adviser to the New Europe Fund, the Manager will receive an advisory fee at the rate of 2% per annum of the New Europe Fund's total adjusted assets, i.e., total net assets without a deduction for any accrual of the Manager's incentive fee. Applicant's Legal Analysis 1. Section 17(a) generally provides, in part, that it is unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, knowingly to sell or purchase any security or other property to or from such investment company. Section 17(b), however, provides that the SEC may grant an exemption from section 17(a) if the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
