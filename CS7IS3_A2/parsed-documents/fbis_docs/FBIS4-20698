In order to get even a little more nuclear power-related information (data) out to larger numbers of people, the Atomic Power Technology Agency, at the behest of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in September 1990 commenced operation of the Atomic Power Information Service Network (nicknamed Atom Net) to provide information to people via personal computer-based communications systems. During the roughly three years since that time, an average of 40 users have accessed this system daily, significantly exceeding our pre-operation user estimates. In the hopes of getting even more people to use ``Atom Net'' services, I would like to take this opportunity to explain how to use this service and to give an overview of the kinds of data stored in the system. 1. How To Use Atom Net Anybody with a personal computer (or dedicated word processor) equipped with communications software and a modem can utilize Atom Net services. The communication software parameters are the same as those for ordinary PC communications packages. The line settings are as follows: Baud rates: 1200/2400 bps Kanji code: Shift JIS Kanji No. of data bits: 8 bits No. of stop bits: 1 bit Parity: None Flow control: Xon/Xoff Communication protocol: No protocol (However, XMODEM is used for graphics.) To access the system, specify auto-dial on your communications software and dial Atom Net's modem number (03-5470-5511). Once you have connected with the system, the user ID input screen will be displayed. I have given the Tokyo modem number here, but people in outlying regions wishing to use Atom Net services may dial whichever of the 140 access points nationwide is closest to their locations. Access point modem numbers are listed in the Atom Net ``User's Guide,'' or can be obtained by calling the ``Atomic Power Telephone Question Box'' discussed below. Atom Net information provision services are available 24-hours-a-day, which means you can avail yourself of these services whenever you like. When the user ID input screen appears, you will be prompted to ``Please enter 000.'' At this point, enter ``000'' and press RETURN. This will display the prompt ``Please enter return key,'' at which time you should press RETURN once again to display the MAIN MENU. This makes it possible for anyone to use Atom Net services without having to worry about user IDs or registered passwords. And the service is free (you will still be required to pay the telephone charges incurred during use, however). Figure 1. User ID Input Screen For those people with questions concerning the contents of the Atom Net database system, you can call the Atomic Power Technology Agency's ``Atomic Power Telephone Question Box'' at Tel: 0120-119433 and get answers to all your questions and inquiries. The data available via Atom Net consists of bibliographic data as well as graphics such as graphs and the like, the latter of which can be utilized provided your communications software is equipped with XMODEM protocol capabilities and you have the graphics software ``Hanako,'' or any software capable of reading ``Hanako Ver 1.0'' data. 2. Atom Net Special Features We were afraid that if we made the nuclear power information stored in Atom Net available in text form alone, it would just be like other databases and would not hold any particular appeal for users. We therefore decided to equip Atom Net with some special features. The first of these features is the fact that it provides both textual and image data, the latter consisting of graphs and drawings. There is a lot of nuclear power-related information that is difficult to grasp by reading textual data alone, much of which is easier to understand if it is accompanied by visual data such as graphs and drawings. Based on this fact, we constructed the Atom Net so that users with graphics software can call up image data whenever they need it. The second special feature built into Atom Net is its ``News Flash'' capabilities concerning trouble that occurs at nuclear power plants. Whenever trouble breaks out at a nuclear power plant, the press release put together by MITI is input into the system as soon as MITI releases that news to the media, and can be accessed that same day. Therefore, Atom Net trouble reports are available at the same time as, and in some cases, sooner than they reach the newsstands. 3. Contents The data contained in Atom Net is compiled under seven main menus, for a total of 960 data elements (as of the last day of June, 1993). When Atom Net first commenced operation, it started out with just 237 data elements, but today, after being in operation for three years, that figure has quadrupled. In general, data is maintained and updated every Friday afternoon, but announcements of trouble reports from nuclear power plants are input the day they are published. Table 1.

Conclusions Because Atom Net is a specialized database comprised of difficult information, prior to opening the system to the public there was some concern over just how many people would be interested in using such a database. However, since commencing operations, there have been days when Atom Net has been accessed by over 300 users, and it is not unusual to see the really dedicated users accessing the system in the middle of the night. The large numbers of people using Atom Net are indicative of the degree of interest in energy-related issues on the part of ordinary citizens, and the ongoing boom in personal computer usage. We will strive to update and provide increasingly more complete data, and to make it even easier to use Atom Net in future.
