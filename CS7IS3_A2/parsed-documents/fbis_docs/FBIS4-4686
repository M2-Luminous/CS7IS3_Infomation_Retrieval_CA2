FBIS4-4686 "dreas065__a94015" FBIS-EAS-94-065-A Daily Report 3 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Bureaucrats Interviewed on Roles, Policymaking Bureaucrats Interviewed on Roles, Policymaking Division Chiefs Polled OW0404160894 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 3 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0404160894 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] What do elite bureaucrats in "Kasumigaseki" think about public criticism of government officials' practices? From mid-March to 1 April, ASAHI SHIMBUN surveyed division chief-class bureaucrats of the central government through interviews or mailed questionnaires, and obtained 267 responses. Regarding an opinion that "the nation's policymaking authorities are concentrated to bureaucrats rather than politicians," over 60 percent of division chiefs acknowledged such tendencies. This presented great contrast with responses from vice ministers, as 15 out of 21 vice ministers denied "bureaucrat-led policymaking." In mailed questionnaires, we also asked about bureaucrats' post-retirement jobs in the industrial sectors under their control. Over 90 percent of respondents said such practices are "necessary" or "inevitable," and 80 percent said they would "take" such job offers. While vice ministers took prudent attitudes toward our questions, division chiefs showed more straightforward responses. In the questionnaire, we provided two questions about "bureaucrat-led policymaking." In response to a true-or-false question asking if public criticism of bureaucrats is true," 96 chiefs (36 percent) said "true," and 127 (48 percent) said "false." The remaining 44 (16 percent) gave no answer. However, when asked to freely describe opinions on the criticism of "bureaucrat-led policymaking," 167 respondents, or 63 percent, acknowledged such tendencies, or noted "social backgrounds inevitably produces bureaucrat-led policymaking." However, 66 respondents (25 percent) said they "do not think bureaucrats have superior policymaking power." As "background of bureaucrat-led policymaking," many respondents indicated lack of politicians' leadership, political parties' policy staff, and the Hosokawa administration's managing ability. About two-thirds, or 109 out of 167 chiefs who acknowledged "bureaucrat-led policymaking" noted that it is caused by problems among politicians. Some division chiefs showed bureaucrats' high self-esteem by indicating "politicians cannot compete with bureaucrats who are selected from very competitive universities and still face severe competition everyday" (as noted by a Labor Ministry division chief). On the other hand, they expressed complicated feelings by indicating the limitations in bureaucrat-led policymaking. Regarding a public belief that "bureaucrats find post-retirement jobs in the private sector making the most of the government rules and authority," 147 respondents (44 percent) said "true," and 98 (37 percent) said "false." In the "comments" column for the question, 179 out of 212 respondents (92 percent) who returned mailed questionnaires showed positive attitudes toward such post-retirement jobs. Some noted the practice is favorable from a viewpoint of manpower utilization. A National Land Development Agency division chief said: "(Bureaucrats) have experience, managing ability, and wide-ranging relationships. Their abilities must be utilized." Others noted most career bureaucrats are required to retire in their 50's, and "a post-retirement career in the private sector is needed make a living." A Management and Coordination Agency respondent even said "the practice is the only benefit for bureaucrats, and this must be left untouched." Then we asked, "if you are offered a private-sector position after your retirement, would you take it?" In reply, 86 out of 107 respondents (80 percent) "I would," "I would positively think about it," or "I would have to take the job to make a living." The survey was intended for 1,028 division chiefs of all ministries and agencies, including the National Police Agency and the Imperial Household Agency. We conducted interviews for 65 chiefs working with ministerial secretariats, and obtained other responses through the mail. Responses were obtained from 267 chiefs, including 55 from those who were interviewed.
