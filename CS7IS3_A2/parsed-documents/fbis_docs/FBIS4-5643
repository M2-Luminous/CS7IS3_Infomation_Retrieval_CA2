FBIS4-5643 "dreas071_m_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 Thailand NSC Secretary on Closure of Cambodian Border NSC Secretary on Closure of Cambodian Border BK1304020794 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 13 Apr 94 p 6 BK1304020794 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] The Thai-Cambodia border at Aranyaprathet district in Sa Kaeo province has been closed indefinitely in order to protect the safety of Thai citizens, National Security Council [NSC] secretary-general Charan Kunlawanit said yesterday. Gen Charan said the action was taken because of a spate of recent incidents that included the torching of a border market, stray shells landing on the Thai side of the border and armed robberies staged against Thai villagers by Khmer bandits. "These are dangerous incidents and to prevent such threats to our people we have closed the border for an indefinite period of time," Gen Charan said. He did not say when the border, closed since April 5, would be reopened. Commenting on why the Thai authorities are taking action only when such incidents frequently recur, Gen Charan said: "The truth is that the fighting in Cambodia has caused damage and hardship to Thai people. Their livestock have also been killed or wounded by stray Khmer artillery shells. "But we have not complained and the world community does not know how we suffer. And when the Khmer people are in hardship, they run over to take refuge here. We helped them without asking for assistance. Those that are criticising us should look at themselves to see if they are doing the right thing." Gen Charan said that closing the border was an attempt to save Thai lives and reorganise regulations so that officials can better look after the border area and reduce the danger faced by Thai villagers. Commenting on the Cambodian complaint that the border closure was harming them economically, Gen Charan said: "We have been helping Cambodia since 1975. That's 20 years already and we have never asked for anything back. It's normal that the closure of the border would have some effect. Those who used to have it good will start to realise what the situation really is. "We insist that the closure of the border is necessary so that we can reorganise law and order in the area to ensure safety." Commenting on the intentions of Cambodian government leaders who repeatedly accuse Thailand of helping the Khmer Rouge, Gen Charan said that Prime Minister Chuan Likphai had talked to the Cambodian leaders, including the Khmer foreign minister, about discussing problems through existing proper channels. "However, the Cambodian Government has never contacted the Thai Government through these channels when problems arise. Given the good relations between the two countries the Cambodians should not be saying anything to Thailand through a third party -- the international wire agencies." Gen Charan, however, said he did not believe agency reports quoting Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh during his trip to Malaysia that Thailand helped the Khmer Rouge escape government attacks on Pailin. During the interview the prince also called on Malaysia to help persuade Thailand to allegedly give up supporting the genocidal Khmer Rouge. "I am sure the Cambodian leader did not say that and would have kept the promise he made to our prime minister when he officially visited Cambodia on January 12," Gen Charan said. He added: "If the prince really criticised us in Malaysia, our friend would have told us. But this is just news and we honour the Cambodian leader as a gentleman and an intelligent person." Gen Charan said because Thailand had never complained about stray Khmer shells falling in Thailand, the world community appears ready to believe allegations of Thai support for the Khmer Rouge. "Why should Thailand be so stupid as to support the Khmer Rouge since we have always wanted to see peace in Cambodia for the past 20 years? Those saying this are not using their brains before speaking out." He said that when Thailand enquires about reported comments made by the Cambodian Government, Phnom Penh "never says anything". Asked if Cambodia was making Khmer Rouge allegations against Thailand to get international attention and win further aid development, Gen Charan said that he did not want to answer this question. "I think the world community is more interested in peace rather than seeing them kill each other," Gen Charan said. He said the issue of Cambodia's allegations against Thailand may be discussed at the next meeting of the National Security Council.
