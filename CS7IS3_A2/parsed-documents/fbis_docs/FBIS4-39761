According to him, the 40.6 trillion rubles allocated for military spending by the State Duma represents a threat to the national security of the armed forces. "The defense budget will not find support in the upper chamber of parliament, and discussion of this pressing problem will be continued," Major General Vladimir Osadchiy noted. In so doing, he cited public remarks made on this issue by Vladimir Shumeyko and the statement by Petr Shurshov, chairman of the Federation Council security and defense committee, who said the upper chamber would not approve a military budget of less than 55 trillion rubles.
