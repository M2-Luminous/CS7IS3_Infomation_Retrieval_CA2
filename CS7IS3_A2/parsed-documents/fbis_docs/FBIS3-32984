He contends: "The problems are not as serious as they are presented to be." Lula believes that the fuss over the [PT] government program stemmed from the disclosure of a draft program that had not even been assessed by the party's Executive Board. The latter is scheduled to meet on 17 February to approve the government program. The program then will be publicized so party members can debate it at length until the PT national convention on 30 April and 1 May, at which Lula will be officially nominated as candidate for the presidency. Lula wants, at the same time, to debate the program with other parties. With regard to the disagreements with the PT bloc in Congress, Lula said the party's Executive Board has not been so hard on it as is being said. He recalled that the Executive Board authorized the PT bloc to vote on the Social Emergency Fund, which was badly needed by [Finance Minister] Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Lula notes: "The problem is that summary methods are being used for the constitutional revision. There are important issues in which our bloc should participate, but conservatives have created a steamroller to pass everything they wish. There is no way in which our bloc can endorse that, feigning it is democratic."
