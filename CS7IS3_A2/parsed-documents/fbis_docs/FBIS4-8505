General Major Jiri Nekvasil, General Staff commander, answered our questions about topical issues regarding the Army. [Bakovsky] Has our Army ever developed bacteriological weapons? [Nekvasil] Our Army has never developed bacteriological weapons. Our Army has never had carriers of bacteriological weapons, and I do not understand the hysteria that has been launched regarding this matter in certain mass media. In 1992, we declared in the United Nations that we were not violating any treaties on bacteriological weapons. Foreign specialists who conducted control checks here were informed about everything, and they even appreciated the order we have here. It is difficult to understand because we had viruses here for several years, and we wanted to normalize the situation. We knew that we were not violating any international conventions. We did not need them for diagnostic and preventive reasons, so we wanted to get rid of them. After the check was made in all military hospitals, we do not have anything anywhere. [Bakovsky] How does the professionalization of our Army proceed? [Nekvasil] Professionalization does not mean counting the ratio of officers to conscripts. I believe the main goal of professionalization is to install professionals in positions for which it does not pay off to train soldiers who are serving for only 12 months. They are mainly troop commanders, specialists in the artillery troops, and tank commanders. In this way, a new category of soldiers should be established. We want to start with this system in the Fast Deployment Brigade, where we want to have only professionals in the future. [Bakovsky] What is the current progress in establishing the Fast Deployment Brigade? [Nekvasil] This establishment should be completed on 30 June 1994. The situation progressed last year, when we trained our people, commanders mostly. Our principle is to accept the people who want to join the brigade and apply to do so. The main slogan of the brigade--"Our place is where others cannot keep up"--makes service in this unit more attractive. It should be an elite unit that will fulfill tasks on our territory, as well as peacekeeping tasks outside of our territory. We want to transfer the experience we gained during the training of the brigade to another two brigades--that is, the brigade in Kromeriz, which is now being transformed, and the mechanized brigade in Susice. When we compared our training methods, which we plan to use in the Rapid Deployment Brigade, with the training of Dutch soldiers, it became obvious that we were going in the right direction and that, after six months in service, our soldiers proved to be comparable with those professionals. [Bakovsky] What will be the situation in the Air Force after the MiG-23 planes are put out of service? Will the Army have enough planes to bridge the period until the purchase of new ones? [Nekvasil] We have 28 SU-22 planes that are almost new, and their type is not that old. We will try to keep them. They have a long life span and are relatively modern. They have laser-controlled aiming devices. We also have SU-25 planes that are expected to last beyond 2005. They are interceptor-bombers and combat planes. As far as interceptors are concerned, for the time being we will have to stick to recent modifications of the MiG-23 ML planes as long as possible. We have enough MiG-21 MF planes. At present, we do not need supersonic planes. The guidance system and weapon systems are the most important things. It is a difficult thing to reduce the Air Force. Our Air Force must become a good-quality Air Force, above all. We cannot let the pilots fly only 50 hours. This was enough in 1991 and 1992, when the Army was in a difficult period. If we want to have a well-trained Army, our pilots must fly 90, 100, or even more hours. I do not support the idea that our Air Force should only be able to fly. Our Air Force must also be able to fulfill any defensive tasks that are given to it. If we have such an Air Force, we need fewer planes, but well equipped with good guiding systems and weapon systems. With the current ammunition, you need four planes to fulfill a task that could be fulfilled by one plane equipped with such a system. This became evident in the Persian Gulf war. The Air Force should be reduced and its quality improved. We should also have fewer types of planes. We have too many of them. After such a reduction, the Air Force will become more capable of combat. [Bakovsky] The Military Air Force will use five permanent airports. What will be the situation during a possible military threat to the state? [Nekvasil] We will have the airports in Kbely, Pardubice, Namest, Caslav, and Prerov. We are not going to abandon other airports completely. The offer we received for renting the airports contains certain conditions that will allow us to use them during mobilization. In a few countries, the air forces use civilian airports. By reducing the number of airports, we want to accumulate funds for the purchase of equipment, so that pilots, technicians, and service personnel might work in conditions corresponding to European standards. This also applies to guards. [Bakovsky] What is the situation in missile testing? Where will it be conducted? [Nekvasil] After so long, for the first time we will conduct the testing in Poland. This will include Air Force, Air Defense, and short-range missiles, specifically the Neva system. [Bakovsky] Did the deployment of our troops change after the division of the Republic? [Nekvasil] Since 1990, troops have been uniformly deployed over the entire territory. The main goal was to uniformly deploy troops over the territory and to allow the soldiers to serve closer to their places of residence. In that way, the soldiers are less anonymous. The attitude of the public toward the Army has begun to improve. For the time being, transformation has not been completed, and some soldiers from Moravia have to serve in Bohemia. Their number is constantly declining, however. In 1995, the deployment of the troops will allow the soldiers to serve within 100 km of their homes.
