The drugs were discovered in a building at the airport, near the aircraft whose range and speed, according to the PGR, make it ideal for transporting drugs. For this reason, the plane was confiscated and its two crewmen detained. The authorities estimate that, considering price fluctuations and the quality of the drugs seized, the load would have yielded close to 6 million doses and would have had a market value of $50 million. The authorities said an investigation has been opened to determine the exact origin of the drugs and the involved of the plane's crew. The PGR has reported that so far this year approximately 7.5 metric tons of cocaine have been confiscated in various actions throughout the country.
