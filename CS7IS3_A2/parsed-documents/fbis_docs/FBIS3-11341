Called for 1600, the ministers of the Army, Zenildo Lucena; Aeronautics, Lelio Lobo; Navy, Ivan Serpa; EMFA [Armed Forces Staff], Arnaldo Leite Pereira; and nine other ministers met with Franco to discuss the problem created by Congress' rejection of the presidential vetoes of the Salary Equity Law and by the STF's approval of a real 10.9 percent salary increase for employees of the legislative and judicial branches and the Attorney General's Office. The salary increase was obtained through the salary conversion to URV's [Real Value Unit] by using a different base date from that determined by the government provisional measure. "They sent us to the kitchen with the great mass of public employees, while they remained in the living room," a general said in irritation. The military was taken by surprise by the decision by Congress and the STF just when they were beginning to accept the government's refusal to grant the troops a 35 percent wage increase claimed since last November. The military ministers stressed the fact that the pressures for a wage increase come from the bases. And they feel obliged to give an explanation to the troops. Their irritation is so great that they even questioned democratic stability. "When the exercise of democracy is so sensitive to the point of meeting the demands of groups or individuals, democracy is weak," an active-duty military officer said. The military's disgust was sensed by the president of the Republic early on the afternoon of 18 March when he received in his office a manifesto signed by more than 100 military personnel, including retired General Euclides Figueiredo, brother of former President Joao Batista Figueiredo. In the document, the soldiers preach the closure of Congress and the replacement of the STF justices by career judges. A retired officer with influence on the president's office attacked: "If it were up to me, they would all be arrested," he said, meaning the STF justices. Before attending the meeting in Planalto Palace, SAF [Federal Administration Secretary] Romildo Canhim said democracy is not threatened.
