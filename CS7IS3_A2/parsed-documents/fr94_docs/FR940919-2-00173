FR940919-2-00173 FR940919-2-00073 [Public Notice 2078] Shipping Coordinating Committee Subcommittee on Ship Design and Equipment and Associated Bodies; Meeting The Shipping Coordinating Committee (SHC) will conduct an open meeting at 9:30 am on Friday, October 7, 1994, in Room 2415, at U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001. The purpose of the meeting is to finalize preparations for the Thirty-eighth session of the Subcommittee on Ship Design and Equipment (DE 38) and associated bodies of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) which is scheduled for January 23&hyph;27, 1995, at the IMO Headquarters in London. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the papers received and the draft U.S. positions for DE 38. Among other things, the items of particular interest are: a. Safety of passenger submersible craft; b. Development of safety standards for combined pusher tug-barges; c. Guidelines for safe ocean towing; d. Guidelines for the design and operation of passenger ships to the needs of elderly and disabled persons; e. Use of compressed air systems for buoyancy; f. Ventilation of vehicle decks during loading and unloading; g. matters related to the prevention of oil pollution; h. And matters relating to ship structures, including hull stress monitoring devices, corrosion protection for ballast tanks, and access to tank and ballast space structures; i. Structural aspects of the on-board use of composite materials; j. Requirements for ships intended for polar waters; k. Revision of the Code of safety for diving systems; l. Review of existing ships' safety standards; and m. Guidelines on standard calculation methods for anchor positioning systems for MODUs. The IMO Subcommittees work to develop international agreements, guidelines, and standards for the marine industry. In most cases, these international agreements, guidelines, and standards form the basis for national standards/regulations and class society rules. The U.S. Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Working Group supports the U.S. Representative to the IMO Subcommittee in developing the U.S. position on those issues raised at the IMO Subcommittee meetings. Because of the impact on domestic regulations through development of these international guidelines, standards, and regulations, the U.S. SOLAS Working Group serves as an excellent forum for the U.S. maritime industry to express their ideas. All shipping companies, shipyards, design firms, naval architects, marine engineers, and consultants are encouraged to send representatives to participate in the development of U.S. positions on those issues affecting your maritime industry and remain abreast of all activities ongoing within the IMO. Members of the public may attend this meeting up to the seating capacity of the room. Interested persons may seek information by writing: CDR Jim Stamm, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Commandant (G&hyph;MTH), Room 1218, 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001 or by calling: (202) 267&hyph;2206.
