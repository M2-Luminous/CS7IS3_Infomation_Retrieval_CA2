He supported the need to grant the police, prosecutor's offices and the Federal Counterintelligence Service extra powers which would enable them to impose order both in the capital and provinces of Russia as soon as possible. If this does not happen in the near future, Moscow as a subject of the Russian Federation will have to make an independent decision, according to Luzhkov's statement published Thursday. In Luzhkov's opinion, the main reason impeding the ultimate resolution of the issue is entirely obsolete legislation. "Today laws protect criminals and tie the hands of the law-enforcement bodies," the statement runs. In particular, Luzhkov expressed concern over the attempt upon the chairman of board of the joint-stock company LogoVAZ, Boris Berezovsky, on June 7 and other terrorist acts in Moscow this week which lead to the loss of life. Luzhkov said he had instructed the law-enforcement bodies to use the tightest and harshest measures while investigating these crimes. "The chaos on the streets of our city must be stopped," Luzhkov stressed.
