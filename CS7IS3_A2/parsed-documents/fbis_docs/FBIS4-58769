[passage omitted] Prince Al Sa'ud told the participants that after three years of Kuwait's liberation, the Iraqi regime continues to delay implementation of basic elements of the Security Council resolutions pertaining to its aggression on Kuwait. And the Iraqi regime continues to deal selectively with its obligations towards the resolutions of the international legality which constitute a unified package. "At a time when the Iraqi regime concentrates efforts to show some cooperation with the U.N. inspectors of weapons of the mass destruction in an attempt to give an impression of a limited kind of response to some demands of the Security Council resolutions as justification for lifting economic sanctions imposed on it, it is important to recall that the core of the conflict is the Iraqi regime's non-respect for the sovereignty and independence of Kuwait, which constitutes the core of the resolutions of the international legality. Moreover, the Iraqi regime continues to oppose Resolution 833 on the recognition of international borders' demarcation," Prince Al Sa'ud said. Prince Al Sa'ud regretted that the Iraqi regime is still detaining the Kuwaiti prisoners of war and captives of other nationals and refraining from paying legal compensations for damages caused by its aggression. "The only possible and open way to confront the dangers posed by this regime is to bring about full and comprehensive compliance of the resolutions of the Security Council," the Saudi foreign minister said. Prince Al Sa'ud expressed deep anxiety over the sufferings of the brotherly Iraqi people triggered by the oppressive practices of the Iraqi regime and expressed full sympathy with them. He demanded that the Iraqi regime should comply with the Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712 dealing with the humanitarian, food and medicines needs of the Iraqi people and held the Iraqi regime fully responsible for the humanitarian plight sustained by the Iraqi people. Concerning relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran, Prince Al Sa'ud made it clear that the GCC states have a keen interest to maintain peace and stability in the Gulf region and ensure guarantees of navigation in the Gulf. "We are always working for the realisation of cordial and constructive relations with Iran based on good neighbourly ties, mutual respect and non-intervention in the domestic affairs, respect for the sovereignty and independence of all states and their territorial integration. "While, we hear of the statements of the Iranian officials on a similar desire for developing cordial relations with us, yet we hope that such statements would be accompanied with practical policies to harmonize such a desire into reality. And, in this context, we notice with grave deploration the continuation of the conflict between the United Arab Emirates [UAE] and Iran on the three Emirate islands. And it is hoped that the welfare initiative offered by the UAE's President Sheykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al-Nuhayyan for settling the issue of the three islands through direct talks would be [word indistinct] to cut short his visit and return to the kingdom to remain under orders of custodian of the two holy mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al'Aziz and Crown Prince 'Abdallah Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, who are engaged in continuous contacts with their Arab colleagues to save Yemen from the crisis. He called on the Yemeni brothers to come together and resolve their problems with amicable and peaceful means.
