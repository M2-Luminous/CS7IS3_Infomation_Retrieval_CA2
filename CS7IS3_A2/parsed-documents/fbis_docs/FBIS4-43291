FBIS4-43291 "drweu115_b_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-115 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 BENELUX Belgium European Election Results Reviewed European Election Results Reviewed BR1406145194 Brussels LE SOIR in French 14 Jun 94 p 1 BR1406145194 Brussels LE SOIR French BFN [Unattributed article: "The Traditional Parties Face a Tide of Rejection -- Abstainers, Extremists, Blank and Void Ballot Papers: The Party of Those Who Reject `The System' Has a Majority in Wallonia and Brussels"] [Text] Sunday's [12 June] European elections were marked by an indescribable electronic fiasco (which drove [Liberal Reformation Party president] Jean Gol to compare it to a Corsican situation). But the elections broke on most of the traditional parties like a tidal wave in both the north and south of the country. With 10 percent absenteeism, 10 percent blank or invalid ballots, and 10 percent of the votes going to the extreme right, the "rejection party" now has a majority, even, if not above all, in the French-speaking college. This creates a totally new and worrying situation which must be answered by the traditional parties both in the majority and opposition. And nearly all these parties suffered in yesterday's vote. For example in Flanders, the CVP [Christian People's Party] lost 6.8 percent in comparison with the 1989 European elections, but climbed 0.4 percent when compared with the last parliamentary elections. The SP [Dutch-speaking Socialist Party] also fell back (17.7 percent, minus 2.3 percent), but avoided the worst, primarily due to Louis Tobback's good score among the preference votes. However, in Flanders it is the poor performance of the VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] which is the big event. With three seats and 18.4 percent (up 1.3 percent), [VLD president] Guy Verhofstadt's party is very far from the score he dreamed of (30 percent) and which was regularly promised him by the opinion pollsters. They too will have to ask themselves questions. Is the VLD dead before it has lived? In an interview with LE SOIR, Herman De Croo [VLD] distanced himself from the ultraliberal program defended by Verhofstadt. The other big victim in the elections is of course the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party]. Falling to 30.4 percent (minus 8.11 percent) and losing two seats, Busquin's party could nevertheless be tempted to say: That could have been worse. Still, Jose Happart's [head of PS candidates] personal performance and the fact that many PS voters have apparently deserted the party to join the extreme right are two factors which will not make life any easier for the party. Watch out for a split? The PSC [Social Christian Party] is certainly the coalition party which emerged from the ordeal with the least damage, recording a drop of 2.2 percent in comparison with 1989. In Brussels it got its fingers fairly well burnt, as expected after the scandals which implicated Jean-Louis Thys and the Demaret-Vanden Boeynants duo, and the party just lost its position as second biggest party in Wallonia (by 6,000 votes). It consoled itself by taking the first European seat devolved to the German-speakers. Therefore it can claim that it equals, in seats at least, the performance of the PRL-FDF [Liberal Reformation Party-French-speaking Front], which was finally credited with 24.3 percent. A score subject to caution, according to Jean Gol, who was astonished at the "disappearance" of thousands of votes. [PSC president] Gerard Deprez went through every possible mood yesterday. In the morning, in a state of extreme irritation, he could not find words hard enough to berate the colleagues who did not get involved at his side during the campaign. In the afternoon the president's smile returned when he found that he personally had got 97,000 preference votes, or 20,000 more than in 1989. Suddenly he decided to launch his candidacy for a fifth term as president. His most serious challenger will be former minister Raymond Langendries who positions himself as the candidate for renewal. It is a theme repeated at Ecolo, at a time when the Greens are also asking themselves questions about their setback (13 percent, minus 3 percent). Like in Italy? Beyond these minor and major new factors in traditional politics, an essential question remains: How to counter the extreme right which won 10 percent of the votes and a seat in Wallonia and Brussels, due to fear, disgust, rejection of the political system or xenophobia?
