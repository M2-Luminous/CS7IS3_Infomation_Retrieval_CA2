By the end of last year more than three million surplus farmers had found jobs in rural industrial businesses, creating 6.3 billion yuan in profits and taxes. Some found new jobs outside the province with the help of local specially established labor markets, contributing 6.6 billion yuan to the local revenue. Nevertheless, Gansu still has more than two million rural people with not enough to eat and wear, according to local officials. To help more rural residents become well-off, the provincial government designated in 1992 Wuwei and six other counties and cities to experiment with finding new jobs for local farmers, with the purpose of promoting the transfer of surplus labor throughout the province to profitable sectors. The experimental counties and cities have adopted various measures, including developing rural industries to increase job opportunities and organizing rural farmers from remote areas to find jobs in areas outside Gansu through local labor markets. Meanwhile, some cities and counties have also built rural farmers' markets, adjusted the agricultural production structure and expanded eco-agriculture, which have proved to be effective in relocating surplus rural labor. In addition, the provincial government has launched an experimental job-creation project at the provincial level with the aim of tapping rural surplus labor.
