Although he gives an impression of self-denial and modesty, Deputy Mihanovic has always overcome a certain uneasiness just in advance of public speeches in the chamber. As a rule these are not speeches for the general public. They are full of associations, of historical reminiscences, of metaphors, quotations, a teacher's admonitions, and a poet's conceits. We stopped him in a "hit-and-run attack" to check out the stories circulating in the corridors of parliament that he will in fact become the president of the House of Representatives, to the surprise of many. [Crnjakovic] If you are offered the post of president of the parliament, will you accept it? [Mihanovic] I am not giving any thought to that at all. I have seen my name in the papers. I am not a man who craves pomp and power; I want to remain neutral. But if that would help to calm down the entire situation, to prevent a crisis from occurring, I would accept. I look on that position with awe, with great responsibility and to some extent with an inner fear in the face of that challenge. If there is a need for my person to fill a vacuum, I will always accept that burden for Croatia. Trust in Common Sense [Crnjakovic] Is there good reason to fear a possible parliamentary crisis? [Mihanovic] I am convinced that there is not. I always believe in a certain awareness of people who could cause some possible trouble in the parliament. I believe that even Mesic will not accept that, and he is saying that they are sticking to the line of Croatian statehood, that they will not do anything which could harm the Croatian state. Changing leaders is a democratic proceeding. If they have left the party, they cannot obstruct the parliament. I believe that common sense will prevail with them. What must be done will be done according to democratic procedure. [Crnjakovic] What needs to be done? [Mihanovic] To resolve the issue of the presidents of the House of Representatives and the Chamber of Zupanijas, since by the rules of the game the leading party has the right to those posts. [Crnjakovic] What if they do nevertheless remain in the way? [Mihanovic] That would be very harmful for Croatia, since the parliament would not be able to enact laws, elections would have to be called, which means paralysis for at least six to eight months. Croatia would be marking time, it would be stymied, and I believe that is not in anyone's interest. Less money, lower output, a lower standard of living.... [Crnjakovic] Perhaps someone intends just that? [Mihanovic] That would then be sabotage, destroying the foundations of the young state, which is doing everything to get in the flow of Europe and the world, to resolve the issue of its occupied areas, which wants economic progress. Anyone who has such intentions would be working against his own Croatian people. I think that such an outlook will not prevail. I believe in the unity of Croatian consciousness when it comes to the interest of the Croatian state. I cannot understand anyone sitting in the Croatian parliament being against the interest of the Croatian people. Some People in the HDZ Have Sighed With Relief [Crnjakovic] How do you evaluate the events related to establishment of the new party by people from your own ranks? [Mihanovic] I do not think it was on constitutional grounds. Individuals felt that they had not been satisfied in their claims and vanities. They thought that they did not have enough power. Some perhaps thought that it was they who should be conducting the policy of the Croatian state from the positions they held. Why, then, did we elect a head of state?! With the help of the other instruments of power, he is conducting the policy of the state. A parallel policy cannot be conducted. Do you happen to know who is the president of the parliament in Germany? That post is important, but the president of the parliament does not shape the policy of the state. Some people have perhaps overstated the powers which they felt they should have in the positions they held, and then they took action, mistakenly judging that they could cause a breakdown. They thought it was enough for one strong man to leave the HDZ and the party would fall apart. [Crnjakovic] What is the situation in the HDZ? [Mihanovic] Very stable. There are no internal convulsions. Some even sighed with relief that we no longer have the tug-of-war between ultra-left and ultra-right, but are following a middle and moderate line in creating the state of the Croatian people. This is the only realistic program which will not take us into the extreme blocs. [Crnjakovic] What will happen if President Mesic does not want to withdraw voluntarily? [Mihanovic] The democratic procedure called for by the rules will be invoked, no one will be "removed" illegally. I think there will be no skirmish, since this will be done according to procedure. I think that these people will not cause any interference. The parliament will continue its work. Statements Harmful to Croatia [Crnjakovic] Would it be less harmful to leave Mesic in place even though he belongs to another party? [Mihanovic] You never know what kind of propaganda he might deliver from that post as a member of another party, an opposition party. You know that numerous foreign and domestic delegations visit him. A case might arise when he made propaganda harmful to Croatian state policy and harmful to the legally elected government, but to the benefit of his own party. The party which has the majority would not allow that in any country. Let us be clear, I do not preclude the possibility of his behaving correctly, but there are the rules of the game. In addition, his statements of alleged concentration camps and supposedly deliberate murders are harmful to Croatia. I am not saying that this has not occurred, but war brings with it horrible things which you cannot always control. In war prisoners are taken, they have to be put somewhere, but when you say "concentration camp," you automatically think of gas chambers, torture and other horrors. We did not have concentration camps. We did not kill people deliberately, we did not throw them into any Jazovkas. [Crnjakovic] Will the balloting for president of the parliament be open or secret? [Mihanovic] Why should it be secret? That is not necessary. If anyone is against, why should he be afraid of declaring it publicly? No one is going to discredit anyone in that way. I hope that we will preserve the democratic and tolerant spirit in the parliament. [Crnjakovic] Does that exist now? [Mihanovic] Yes. We can be satisfied with that. In this time of war, when passions are additionally intensified, we are behaving well. It is normal for there to be intolerant individuals in all parties, but the parliament as a whole is behaving in a civilized way. Perhaps at some points it might be more constructive and not try to obstruct the government. Mr. Valentic is committing his entire potential, intellectual and otherwise, to improving Croatia as much as possible, and so are his ministers. I was profoundly offended when Vladimir Bebic said of Dr. Granic, deputy prime minister, that he was a war criminal. That is horrible! And to say that of a man who by his title and his spiritual makeup is a humanist! This was said from the speaker's desk completely out of the blue and without evidence! For me that was the most serious incident in the parliament in these past four years. I Have Known Tudjman for a Long Time [Crnjakovic] You are often defending the president of the state. Are you defending him personally, or the dignity of the office he holds? [Mihanovic] It is not a question of any personality cult. I have known the president of the republic for a long time, since back in the 1960's when he worked in the Institute, when we worked together on certain programs. Even then I was surprised at the imaginativeness of the cultural policy he was pursuing. That was very brave. The Croatian line always followed from his conclusions, although it was not simple to pursue the Croatian option at the Institute for the History of the Working Class Movement. That was gratifying to all of us around him in the Institute for Literature, since we all had a Croatian orientation, we did not have a single party member among us. He pursued a wise and moderate policy. Since that time I have respected him as a sensible person, someone who always thinks out his reasons and all the consequences of a particular move. The HDZ Program was one of the clearest, that is why I committed myself to him. I do not believe in the collective consciousness. I believe that one man, if he heads a movement and a program, can accomplish much historically. No one will be able to dispute that Tudjman is the creator of the Croatian state. That is a fact which cannot be denied. Let us be happy that we have created the Croatian state. This is not an illusion, a phantasmagoria, it is here and now. Everyone takes it into account today. What its nature will be is now up to us. Italy has been functioning for 40 years, and you see what has happened there. Taking things all in all, I think that we have achieved the maximum.
