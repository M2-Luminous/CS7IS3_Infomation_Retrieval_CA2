The United Nations was trying to evacuate the wounded guards, said the officials in Zakho near the Turkish border. The Austrians were in a bus taking 22 UN guards from Irbil to Baghdad at the end of their tour of duty. The guards are employed to protect UN personnel and vehicles. UN organisations have been working in the Kurdish-controlled region of northern Iraq since the Kurdish uprising against Baghdad which followed the January-February 1991 Gulf war. Since 1992 UN personnel and offices in the region have been repeatedly attacked. The Kurdish authorities blamed agents of the Iraqi government. Baghdad has warned several times that it will not tolerate foreigners carrying out humanitarian work in the north of the country. There have been 11 attacks this year, nine against the UN, one against a German humanitarian organisation and one against Swedish journalists, the UN's Inter-Agency Relief Coordination Unit reported. It said six people were injured but none killed.
