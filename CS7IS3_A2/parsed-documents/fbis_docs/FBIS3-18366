In the second half of the year Germany, as the president of the EU at the time, will put the extension of the organization on the agenda. Chancellor Kohl considers it a wise decision that Hungary wants to submit its application to the EU already in the first half of the year. Helmut Kohl met the press after having a two-hour discussion with Prime Minister Peter Boross in Bonn. The Hungarian prime minister rules out the possibility of any conflict similar to the one in the former Yugoslavia evolving between Hungary and its neighbors because of the nationalities. Peter Boross pointed out in Bonn that Hungary observed the UN sanctions against Yugoslavia despite the fact that it had so far suffered a loss of 1.5 billion dollars because of them, and it still could not see greater international willingness for compensation.
