FBIS4-36975 "drnes115pr_94003" FBIS-NES-94-115 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 SYRIA U.S. Urged To Be `Full Partner' in Peace Process U.S. Urged To Be `Full Partner' in Peace Process JN1406142494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1230 GMT 14 Jun 94 JN1406142494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Station commentary] [Text] Gentlemen: Yitzhaq Rabin has admitted that there is a big gap between the Syrian and Israeli stands vis-a-vis peace in the Middle East. Meanwhile, he reiterated that Syria will be committing a big mistake if it believes that the United States will exert any pressure on Israel. Rabin wanted to say that Israeli intransigence will continue and that his government will not make any change in its policy rejecting the Security Council resolutions. The Israeli stands, which are hostile to the peace process and to the spirit and bases of the Madrid conference, have not surprised Syria because Israel was established on a policy of aggression, usurpation, and expansion. Syria, however, participated in the peace process and responded to the U.S. initiative, proceeding from definite bases -- namely, exchanging land for peace, implementing the Security Council resolutions, and achieving a just and comprehensive settlement on all fronts of conflict. Syria has worked over the past two and a half years to render the Washington talks a success, saved the peace process more than once from intentional Israeli destruction, and facilitated the task of U.S. envoys in the region. Since the United States has reiterated -- through President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher -- its commitment to go ahead in the peace process in accordance with its bases, Syria has the right to ask the United States keep its promise and play the fair role of full partner. Syria understands that fairness achieves rights and entrenches justice. Syria does not, at all, call on the United States to become biased toward Syria; it wants the United States to be biased toward the Security Council resolutions and the principles of the international laws that ban occupation of land by force, any change in the land's cultural, historical, and demographic features, and the law of jungle. In view of Israel's history, which is full of wars, aggressions, and massacres; in light of the clear maneuvers and procrastination it showed in Washington; and given its rejection of the requirements of the peace process -- particularly full withdrawal from the occupied territory -- Syria will continue to ask the United States to fulfill its guarantees and its commitment to play a fair role. Syria believes there is no way to achieve peace in the Middle East without effective American intervention in the interest of the resolutions of international legitimacy. All the world hopes will not convince Israel to make one single step toward achieving peace if this step is not accompanied by the appropriate pressure. The current situation should prompt the entire international community to make an urgent move to end the present stalemate in the Washington talks. Israel will commit a grave mistake if it believes that Syria will, ultimately, succumb to its blackmailing, twisted methods, partial settlements and relinquish one single inch of the Golan. The Golan has been Syrian land from the beginning of history, and Syria will not relinquish one single inch of its land and will not bargain over its sovereignty. It neither relinquishes Arab rights or bargains over them. If peace is not fair or comprehensive, and if it does not end Israeli occupation of all occupied territory it will remain a temporary deal that will be destroyed by acceleration of events.
