The Lesotho Information Ministry said that the government had no contact with either faction and that it was uncertain of their actions. It is reported that about 150 loyalist soldiers are fighting against eight rebel companies to keep the ruling Basotholand Congress Party in power. Diplomatic sources said the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, and the Commonwealth were trying to mediate a solution. A peace initiative is also being launched by the Frontline States. South African troops are keeping a close watch on the border, but there are no immediate plans to cross into Lesotho. The situation in Maseru remains tense.
