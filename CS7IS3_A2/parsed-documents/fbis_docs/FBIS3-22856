The talks have raised concern in New Delhi that closer relations between Washington and Islamabad could lead to an upset of the regional power equation. A Pakistani Foreign Ministry official said here Thursday that Washington and Islamabad were engaged in "deep dialogue" on the subject of nuclear non-proliferation, a priority of U.S. foreign policy in the region. Neither Pakistan nor traditional rival India, which exploded a nuclear device in 1974, are signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and both suspect the other of developing atomic weapons. The ongoing U.S.-Pakistan talks coincide with reports of the willingness of the U.S. administration to partially lift a ban on military and economic aid to Pakistan which was imposed in October 1990 following fears that Islamabad had embarked on a nuclear weapons program. The ban was implemented under provisions of the Pressler amendment, named after U.S. Senator Larry Pressler, which forbids military aid to Pakistan unless the president could certify Islamabad did not have nuclear weapons and was not trying to develop them. But U.S. officials on Tuesday said Washington may ease the ban to enable the delivery of 71 F-16 jet fighters, which were ordered from General Dynamics but suspended when the ban took effect, in return for a "verifiable" pledge that Pakistan will halt its nuclear program. Islamabad has already paid for 38 of the aircraft. Delivery of the aircraft would boost Pakistan's deteriorating air force, which is equipped with some 100 Mirage jets, about 100 Chinese-made F6 and F7 aircraft and 34 F-16's. (In New Delhi, India's Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul was quoted Friday by The Statesman daily as saying that the "balance of power" in the region would change if Pakistan acquired the aircraft, whose long ranges enable them to carry out deep strike attacks. ("Those machines have been manufactured and are lying there. I have always maintained that they (the United States) will find some way of overcoming the Pressler amendment," the daily quoted him as telling reporters at a news conference in Bombay. (The Indian air force chief did not spell out exactly how the military balance would be upset if Pakistan were to acquire the planes. (He however spoke about India's difficulties in upgrading its Russian-built MiG-21 planes because of Russian reluctance to part with technology information following the breakup of the Soviet Union. (His remarks followed concern expressed by Foreign Minister Dinesh Singh at the U.S. proposal to dispatch the F-16's to Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars since independence in 1947. "Does the United States want to encourage Pakistan to use nuclear weapons against India?" Dinesh Singh said this week. Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, shortly after assuming office in October last year, said that former premier Nawaz Sharif had "capped" the country's nuclear programme and that she had decided to maintain that position. A late Thursday report, quoting sources close to the foreign office, reiterated Islamabad's position and assured the Pakistani public that "any step taken will safeguard the national interest." The report also claimed that the Pressler amendment had failed to achieve its objective of preventing arms proliferation, but had managed to contribute to Pakistan's conventional arms capabilities being "eroded."
