[Biondi] No. I may have been naive, but I hoped to be able to take a short rest. [Varalli] What happened in the exchange with Previti [tipped as justice minister]? [Biondi] It all happened at 0400 hours yesterday. Prime Minister Berlusconi called me and asked whether I was willing. I had already stated my willingness; that seemed to me a professional decision. [Varalli] So had you already told Berlusconi that you preferred Justice to Defense? [Biondi] When he asked if I would be available at the outset, and if so, for what, I told him that I would prefer, if possible, to deal with the things that I have always loved -- justice, defense, domestic affairs, or the environment. And when the prime minister informed me that I would be going to the Defense Ministry, I was very pleased. [Varalli] So was it not a demotion? [Biondi] No. I have been a defender ever since I was born, and to work to ensure that military service is something more than a drudgery seemed to me a fine task. [Varalli] But then... [Biondi] Then when he said, the Justice Ministry, I certainly did not feel as though I had been penalized. [Varalli] Are you not rather afraid of the fact that you will have to deal with the judiciary, people with whom you are well acquainted. [Biondi] Judges must be beyond reproach, by virtue of the profession they have chosen. I have had the great pleasure of knowing many magistrates, whom I trust implicitly, even if their political stances are different from mine. [Varalli] What will be the first thing you do at the ministry? [Biondi] First, this afternoon, I will meet again with my predecessor, Conso. [Varalli] What next? [Biondi] Then I will make a tour of all Italy's prisons. Justice must be fair, and a sentence must be not only a sanction but also a reeducation. [Varalli] In recent weeks there has been some controversy about the method for reelecting the CSM [Higher Magistrates Council] -- a controversy which [President] Scalfaro silenced by setting a date for the next election. What do you think about this? [Biondi] From the procedural viewpoint, I think that the choice of the single-candidate system could provide better guarantees. Be that as it may, the president did very well to call an election, so to speak. If parliament wants to change the law, it can do so. [Varalli] The bribery scandals are another burning issue. [Biondi] Certain investigations should start sooner. Be that as it may, better late than never. Something is rotten in Denmark, and it must be removed. [Varalli] Are you in favor of a "whitewash" or at least of a political solution to the matter? [Biondi] I am an old Liberal in this respect, too. I believe that amnesties and pardons after less than five years are things of the past and to be avoided, because this creates partial justice, and we must be very careful not to create inequality among citizens before the law. It is necessary to think carefully before reaching any decisions. In any case, I think that it is better to follow procedural rather than legislative criteria. [Varalli] Have you already received many calls? [Biondi] I did not know I was so popular throughout Italy. I have received 6,000 telephone calls. [Varalli] I meant calls from magistrates, from Borrelli, for instance. [Biondi] He will call me if he wants. [Varalli] What about Di Pietro? [Biondi] I heard from him about a month ago in connection with a trial. [Varalli] Now the tables are turned. [Biondi] No, because there are no conflicts; only calm assessments.
