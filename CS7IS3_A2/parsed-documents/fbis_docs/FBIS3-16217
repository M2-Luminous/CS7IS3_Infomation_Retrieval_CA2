In an interview with Interfax, the Executive Secretary of the Commonwealth Ivan Korotchenya said that "the meeting which was later joined by the Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich was of a familiarizing character." According to Korotchenya, the new head of the parliament decided to familiarize with representatives of the CIS states in person and to hear their opinion on the activities of the executive secretariat. Kortochenya said that during the meeting Hryb expressed readiness to propose at the next CIS summit the construction of a new building for the Commonwealth headquarters in Minsk. The blue prints have already been designed, and the city authorities have found a suitable construction site. Kebich decided that the building of the former regional committee of the Belarusian Communist Party will be leased by the CIS Executive Secretariat, which currently occupies the building. In the opinion of Korotchenya, the meeting focused on approaches to the preparations and the signing of an agreement between the Belarusian government and the CIS Executive Secretariat which, in his words, regulates "a whole set of problems regarding the location of the CIS headquarters in Minsk and the recognition by Belarus of the executive secretariat as an international organization." "Hryb also expressed the readiness of the Belarusian side to carry out the construction of the administrative building and apartment houses under the condition that there was a coordinated approach by the CIS states to their financing," Korotchenya said. Asked about the funding of the CIS Executive Secretariat, Korotchenya said that "some states delay the remittance of money for maintaining the coordinating structures of the Commonwealth," declining to name them. According to Korotchenya, "the date for the next CIS summit, to be held approximately around April 18-19 in Moscow is being discussed." Interfax learned that Hryb and Korotchenya intend to take part in a conference of the European Interparliamentary Union scheduled for March 21-26 in Paris. According to sources in the Belarusian Supreme Council, a delegation of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly to the Paris conference will be led by head of the Russian Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko. The agenda of the conference will include a discussion of the role and means of the UN in the prevention of international conflicts, environmental protection, as well as general debates on the political, economic and social situation in the world.
