In this connection, speaking at a news conference on 13 January, Vice Minister Kyogoku of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [MAFF] criticized the moves of the United States and European nations, saying: "This is outrageous, and we cannot accept their requests." Regarding trade issues involving the ministry, the United States is calling on Japan to make further concessions to lower a tariff rate for wood products. Vice Minister Kyogoku said "we have already confirmed with the United States that negotiations were concluded," thus reiterating that Japan has no intention of renegotiating the trade issues.
