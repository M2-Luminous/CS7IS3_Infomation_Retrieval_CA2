FBIS3-4680 "dreas040__a94009" FBIS-EAS-94-040-A Document Type:Daily Report 1 March 1994 ANNEX Japan Possible Trade War Discussed OW0103120394 Tokyo AERA in Japanese 28 Feb 94 pp 14-15 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0103120394 Tokyo AERA Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Article by Hiroaki Ito, AERA General Bureau for America: "Japan and the United States Should Cool Themselves"] [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Kantor's stern face, which was reminiscent of a bird of prey, was more reddish than usual: "Please take a look at this chart. The market shares of Japanese and U.S. companies where Motorola Inc. can carry on free competition, in areas of Japan other than Tokyo and Nagoya, are fifty-fifty. However, the same company's share in Tokyo and Nagoya is only 1.17 percent." "This is the result of nine years' negotiations and of three agreements. This is the fact which is most illustrative of why we have adopted new economic framework talks which emphasize results." The two line graphs on the chart clearly illustrated the difference of the shares: one graph showed that the number of users of NTT's [Nippon Telephone and Telegraph's] cellular telephones exceeded 300,000, while the other showed that the number of users of Motorola's cellular telephones did not reach 13,000. Concerning the opening of markets for automobiles and cellular telephones, Trade Representative Kantor stated on 15 February that sanctions would be imposed on Japan on the grounds of violations of an agreement reached between Japan and the United States in 1989. That was four days after the breakdown of the new Japan-U.S. economic negotiations. The yen rate, which was 108 yen to the dollar on 10 February in the Tokyo market before the consecutive holidays, rose to 103 yen to the dollar on the European and U.S. markets on 14 February and to 101 yen to the dollar temporarily on 15 February. The line graph, "which is close to the ground," was shown on television and it disarmed the criticism within the United States that the U.S. Government intends to enforce managed trade on Japan, as Representative Kantor, who delivered a fervent speech, had expected President Clinton repeatedly said at a news conference that "it was a mere accident that Kantor's speech coincided with the summit," but the miraculous timing is not "a mere accident." At the end of last year, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative suddenly moved up consideration of the agreement between the two countries, originally scheduled for March this year, to immediately after the summit. On 10 January and on 13 February, the U.S. Government and Motorola Inc. leveled a new demand with punitive provisions that "unless improved measures are implemented, the license of JMCC [Japan Mobile Communications Company] -- a firm which handles Motorola's cellular telephones along with NTT's cellular telephones -- will be confiscated. Thus they have cut off Japan's retreat, creating a situation in which nothing is left but imposing sanctions. Everything Went as Planned by the U.S. Government At a Japan-U.S. joint news conference held on 11 February, President Clinton twice suggested: "The exchange rate may be used as an index of objective criteria." The dealers twice received "a signal leading to a higher yen," and it was natural for the yen to rise. Huge uproars, which lasted for several days following the breakdown of the talks, were merely the results of a series of explosions of time bombs carefully planted by the U.S. Government up to that time. Everything went as planned by the U.S. Government. There are more "gambits" in store for shaking Japan. U.S. Trade Representative Kantor said: "We will make a list of sanctions reaching the scale of several hundreds of million dollars and will announce the list. The targets of sanctions will not be confined to the field of telecommunications." There is a strong possibility that a wide variety of items will become targets, in addition to automobiles and auto parts. If a list of sanctions is actually announced, it is inevitable that the industries thus designated will scream. The United States expects the displeasure of Japan's industrial community and the Japanese public to be vented on the bureaucrats of the Finance Ministry who formulated a comprehensive package of economic measures -- which was criticized sharply by Vice President Gore as "disappointing" -- and on the bureaucrats of the International Trade and Industry Ministry who "were prepared for a breakdown in the negotiations." The Super 301 clause, which is soon to be reinstated by executive order, is "very effective" as a tool for shaking Japan. In principle, on the basis of reports which are compiled by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative at the end of March every year, countries and sectors engaging in unfair trade practices will be specified, and if negotiations break down, sanctions will be imposed. Under Article 301 of the Trade Act, investigations can be initiated following a complaint of the business community, but under the Super 301 clause, the government can periodically investigate and expose unfair trade practices. Therefore, it is easy to make political use of Super 301. First of all, the mere fact that Super 301 "has been revived" is a threat to Japan. In addition, by setting specific deadlines for trade partners or practices prior to the next Japan-U.S. summit in July, pressure can be brought to bear on new economic conferences. Toward the end of March, the shares of foreign products in the Japanese market for 1993 will be determined on the basis of the Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement. It is certain that the share for 1993 will drop below the 20 percent figure for 1992; this situation can also trigger sanctions according to the intention of the United States. The Interest of the U.S. Public Is Not in the Trade Deficits Richard Gephardt, a Democratic floor leader in the House of Representatives who takes a hard-line attitude toward Japan, is exerting pressure by saying, "We are preparing a law affecting Japan, under which sanctions can be imposed on the basis of the market share of foreign products." A banking law, which is aimed at imposing sanctions against Japan, is expected to pass Congress soon. However, Director Kurobushi [name as published] from the Asian Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation looks at the situation in this way: "Such an upsurge is confined to part of the government and Congress and has rather lost the support of the whole." Because of an economic recovery, the interest of the U.S. public is not in the trade deficits. Compared to the times when radio-cassette recorders produced by Japanese companies were destroyed, "pressure on the government and Congress is almost nil." The imposition of sanctions will inevitably affect related industries in the United States. It is necessary to show in detail at public hearings how to reach an estimate of damages due to unfair trade practices, or how to tell what effects the imposition of sanctions will have on domestic industries. Further appreciation of the yen will dampen the Japanese economy. This appreciation is capable of thwarting the Clinton administration, which is attempting to increase employment and maintain economic growth through the promotion of exports. Furthermore, if Japan's current account surplus, which is a matter of great concern, increases due to a decrease in imports, which in turn is a result of recession, there will be more difficulties. Threats are not effective unless they are seen as serious. Elaborately planted time bombs and a host of laws providing for sanctions will have no effect unless they are seen as serious.
