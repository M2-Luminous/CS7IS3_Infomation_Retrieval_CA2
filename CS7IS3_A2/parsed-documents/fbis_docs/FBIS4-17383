Shumeyko sent a draft law "on military duty and military service" to the State Duma chairman on Saturday. "There is a shortage of warrant officer specialists in the Russian Armed Forces," Shumeyko explained. At present, warrant officers retire at the age of 45. After retirement from the army, many of them start looking for a job in the civilian sector whose employees themselves are facing redundancy claims. Extended military service up to 55 years for warrant officers could help partially ease the problem, provided they want to stay in the army, Shumeyko said.
