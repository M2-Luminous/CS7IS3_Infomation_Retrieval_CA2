Lysychansk, Siverskodonetsk, and Rubizhne, which constitute the notorious chemical ``Bermuda Triangle,'' also suffer the ``morning after the night before'' syndrome. However, it is precisely here that there is particularly large amount of brine [culinary brine is believed to bring relief after heavy drinking]. But this brine is also a consequence of the same ecological disaster. Possibly everyone in Ukraine has heard about Lysychansk, Siverskodonetsk, or Rubizhne. No wonder, because these are towns of great chemistry. What harm has that chemistry done there? It turns out that not only has it poisoned the air, rivers, and soil, but even permeated the ground down to hundreds of meters or even kilometers! The consequences may be extremely serious, to the extent that these places may become totally deserted. The triangle expands not only horizontally, but vertically downward -- this is its horrifying characteristic. During the times of Brezhnev, various commissions came to Lysychansk, among them a USSR governmental commission headed by [prime minister] A. Kosygin's deputy. Especially to find out about the specific qualities of the brine produced in large quantities by the local soda plant. Of course, the commissions did not do anything specific, but they came. Now they have stopped coming. Maybe they know there is not enough money to implement potential projects? Thus, since prerevolutionary times, production waste -- calcium chloride solutions -- has been discharged by the Lysychansk Soda Plant. Savchenko: These solutions don't appear to be so terrible. In their composition, they resemble seawater. However, there are huge amounts of them. They are stored in pits, the walls of which are not impermeable. They percolate into the soil and spread through aquifers. Besides that, overfilled reservoirs may break unreliable dams and there could be a catastrophe. Kobelnyuk: Is it possible to neutralize such production waste? Savchenko: Nobody in Europe knows how to do this. Such enterprises are located in coastal areas. The waste, as it is, is discharged into the water. Kobelnyuk: Is it at least possible to somehow use the chlorides? Savchenko: Prior to the disintegration of the USSR, the soda producers received some assistance from the Northern Fleet. The chlorides were used to prevent the icing over of ships. As a result, reservoirs were gradually emptied. Today, Russians in the north can do without Lysychansk. Kobelnyuk: What is being done now? Savchenko: Research work is under way. There are specific proposals, in particular from the Kharkiv Scientific Research Institute ``Karbonat.'' However, in addition to good ideas, there must also be good money. Lyudmyla Senchynok, associate at the state geological enterprise ``Luhanskheolohiya'' department in charge of accounting and utilizing subsurface water reserves and of studying their status, does not see any reassuring prospects either. Senchynok: The reservoirs are overfilled, that is why the plant's operations are on the verge of being halted. Besides, the first reservoir was built back in 1898. The plant owner poured the brine into what was then a huge pit. The second storage pit was dug during the first five-year plan period. The two have already been buried under soil. Currently, there are dachas there. The third storage pit was built in 1969. Although it is better than its predecessors, it is far from being brine-proof. When, in 1976, the fourth storage pit was built, our requirements for adhering to norms were taken into account, but.... The dams of the existing storage pits could collapse any minute, because they were built with God knows what. Besides, karst structures have been revealed in those places. The solution reaches marl soils, a reaction takes place, and carbon dioxide forms as a result. This creates an additional hazard. The storage pits are overfilled, there are no new ones, and new construction areas are not being prepared. Kobelnyuk: Besides, there is a time bomb beneath those dachas? Senchynok: Yes, even though there have been no explosions yet. Subsurface waters constantly wash sites of waste accumulation. We suggested that the waste be processed and dumped on the right bank of the Siverskyy Donets River, where aquifers are weak. However, even in the past there was no money for this, not to mention the situation now. Kobelnyuk: What can be done with the brine? Senchynok: The solid substance within its composition could be used for manufacturing medicines. There are some not very pleasant tasting calcium chloride tablets. This substance could also be used as a filler in the production of cement. However, it must be solid. It is too expensive to form briquets and that is not acceptable anyway. There was also a plan to carry the brine to Sivash Lake. However, it was realized that the pipes would soon turn into salt planks. Kobelnyuk: Therefore, we can only wait and see what happens? Senchynok: As a matter of fact, yes. The brine spill around the storage pits of the plant has spread to 30 square meters over the drinking water horizon. We monitor the water composition with the help of boreholes. There were times when the spill grew very quickly, but now the situation is changing gradually.... People within the ``triangle'' are already used to the ``reactive'' -- saturated with various reagents -- air and look almost without care at the small clouds that are all the colors of the rainbow. People get used to anything. When the brine gets out of control, drinking water will disappear over scores of square kilometers. It will be impossible to get used to that: People will either have to turn into fish or pack their belongings.
