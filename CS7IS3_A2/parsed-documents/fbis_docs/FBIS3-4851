But top government spokesman Masayoshi Takemura denied the TOKYO SHIMBUN report, saying, "It is not true that the government is weighing the possibility of sending Self-Defense Forces (SDF) units to the Golan Heights." In the frontpage story in its Wednesday morning edition, the TOKYO SHIMBUN reported Japan may dispatch around 50 members of the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) to the Golan Heights, an area occupied by Israel since it seized the territory from Syria in 1967. A total of 1,120 troops of the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) monitor the cease-fire between Israel and Syria in an area determined by a May 1974 agreement on disengagement. The report, quoting government sources, said the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is seeking another destination for Japanese peacekeepers after the current mission in Mozambique finishes its duties following July elections there. Takemura told a morning news conference that Tokyo has received no request from the United Nations to join peacekeeping operations in the Middle East. The report quoted the sources as saying Japan is eyeing the Middle East for its third peacekeeping mission, following SDF dispatches to Cambodia and Mozambique. Japan joined UN peacekeeping operations for the first time in 1992 when it sent an engineer corps to Cambodia to help build roads and bridges. It was the first time for Japanese troops to go abroad for such duties since World War II. The sources also favored the Middle East in light of criticism of Japan's decision not to put its own citizens at risk in the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf, the daily said. At the time, Japan made a 13 billion dollar financial contribution to the U.S.-led multinational forces arrayed against Iraq and also to three affected states of Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, but after heated domestic debate decided against sending military personnel. The daily suggested that Japanese peacekeepers could be sent to the Golan Heights to replace some of the logistics personnel from Canada, but this would require arrangements with the UN and Canada. The UNDOF, which includes troops from Austria and Poland, and logistics personnel from Canada, has seen 31 fatalities but there have been virtually no cease-fire violations since 1977.
