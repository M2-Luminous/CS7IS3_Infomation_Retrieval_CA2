This seems to be the end (unless there is an unexpected turn of events) of an attempt to reform the Constitution, which, at the end of last year and after many changes, had received the support of all the political spectrum. At that time a poorly supported proposal seemed to be struggling toward a reform of the electoral system and relations between the three branches of government. When electoral interests later began to take precedence over everything else--the reform should have been ready for the forthcoming November elections--a stalemate was reached. This logical and predictable state of affairs culminated in the aforementioned vote on 14 April. In all likelihood we will have no constitutional reform unless either of the mechanisms mentioned above are implemented, or some sectorial interest obtains constitutional protection (as was the case with old-age pensioners in 1989). We are not very concerned about this since we have already voiced our skepticism in previous editorials about the timeliness of such reform (it was obvious that citizens were a little carried away by this initiative, moreover it was too close to the elections for it to materialize) and its purpose (to modifying the electoral system) lost importance as new sectors became involved. What seemed to be an important reform of the system of proportional representation and greater freedom for voters became merely a set of limited proposals that sought to reform practically nothing of substance within the Constitution. It is obvious that we need a true constitutional reform to eliminate many of the superfluous or harmful articles and chapters of our Magna Carta. For the time being, we should trim the excess fat off the Constitution, reducing it to no more than 150 articles. A concise part describing the principles of our system of government and the inalienable rights of individuals, with another part establishing the organization of the branches of government and their interrelation would suffice for our Constitution. There are too many provisions granting rights which nobody can claim in court (right to health, to a decent home, etc.), which results from a way of thinking that deemed that the law could allegedly confer happiness and prosperity on all the inhabitants of the Republic. All provisions pertaining to autonomous bodies and government-owned enterprises are also unnecessary in the Constitution, as they should be regulated by law. The same holds true for the provisions that deal with elections, which are totally out of place in a constitutional text. A concise, concrete, and terse Constitution is the best guarantee of citizens' rights and of the proper functioning of our institutions. And yet, we must not become obsessed with the idea that amending the Constitution and the electoral system is of paramount importance because it would be of no avail unless a matching change occurs in the behavior of political leaders. We need only look at the recent elections in Italy--following the change in the electoral system, when a total reorganization of political parties ensued. The vices that this change sought to weed out continue unabated and the task of forming a government is today as elusive as it was in the past, if not more so. Constitutions are not valid substitutes for leaders who serve their country rather than their party interests. This constitutional reform rests in peace. Our country continues to await a true reform. A change in its rulers and citizens' mentality and behavior is even more necessary. Or, as Walt Whitman [1819-1892] said, we need people like those who wrote the U.S. Constitution, as they could make any constitution work. In other words, texts are less important than the people who translate them into reality.
