FR940405-1-00075 FR940405-1-00013 Ideally, data on the incidence of the diseases of interest in the U.S. population were needed to estimate the number of cases of disease in employed nonsmokers. Since nationwide incidence data were not available for nonsmokers, several survey sources were used to estimate the mortality rates for heart disease (Framingham Community Study) [Ex. 4&hyph;108], and lung cancer (Cancer Prevention Survey conducted by the American Cancer Society) [Ex. 4&hyph;7]. Data on the U.S. workforce were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics [Ex. 4&hyph;39]. Based on the 1993 annual averages, as estimated by the Household Survey, BLS reports that the U.S. workforce for sectors covered by this standard is estimated to be 101,631,300 (men: 54.36%, women: 45.64%). Information on the proportion of employed adults who smoke was obtained from the National Health Interview Survey and is found in Table IV&hyph;7 [Ex. 4&hyph;235]. It is estimated that 74,201,000 adults (73.01% of the U.S. labor force), employed in sectors covered by this standard, are nonsmokers. [Editorial note: No Table IV&hyph;6 is included in this preamble.] Table IV&hyph; 7._ Percent Estimates of Adults Employed in the United States by Smoking Status 1 1␣ 1Smoker 1Nonsmoker Currently employed 26.99 73.01 Unemployed 40.38 59.62 Not in labor force 21.50 78.50 1National Health Interview Survey [Ex. 235]. In an effort to characterize prevalence of occupational exposure, OSHA considered several sources. To determine the prevalence of smoking among U.S. adults during 1991, the National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NHIS&hyph;HPDP) supplement collected self-reported information on smoking exposure at work from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population greater than 18 years of age [Ex. 4&hyph;51]. In particular, employed individuals were asked whether, during the past two weeks, anyone had smoked in their immediate work area. Based on results adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to reflect national estimates, 18.81 percent of nonsmokers reported exposure to smoke in their immediate work area as shown in Table IV&hyph;8. OSHA believes that 18.81 percent may be an underestimate of frequency of exposure in the workplace because it is based solely on self-reported information and the question was not very specific in defining immediate work area. Table IV&hyph; 8._ Percent Estimates of Responses to Question 6 a in the NHIS by Smoking Status 1 1␣ 1Smoker 1Nonsmoker Yes 37.58 18.81 No 60.81 79.79 Unknown 1.61 1.39 1Question 6a was: ``During the past 2 weeks, has anyone smoked in your immediate work area?'' Another source considered by OSHA for defining nonsmoker ETS exposure in the workplace was the work published by Cummings et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;67]. A recent re-analysis of the data file showed that among the nonsmoking, currently employed subjects, 48.67 percent (165 out of 339) reported exposure to ETS at work and not at home (Table IV&hyph;9) [Ex. 4&hyph;69]. Based on the data sources mentioned above, OSHA assumes that the percent of nonsmoking workers who are potentially exposed to ETS at their worksite ranges between 18.81 and 48.67.
