Advisers from various circles expressed views on Hong Kong's current political and economic situation and future development. They pointed out that accelerating various preparatory work for the latter part of the transition period is a task which brooks no delay. During the forum, advisers believed that China's sustained deepening reform and vigorous economic development are a reliable basis for Hong Kong to maintain prosperity and stability. How to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and how to effect a smooth hand-over of political power present the most important tasks facing the people of Hong Kong. In this connection, they offered many suggestions which may be used for reference; under the circumstances of there being no "through train [zhi tong che 4160 6639 6508]," they placed great hopes on the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Regional Government, which enjoys popular trust and represents many circles. During the forum, Hong Kong Branch Deputy Director Zhang Junsheng stated: The Chinese Government absolutely will not refuse to abide by the principles which are already in existence due to the breakdown of Sino-British talks. In the future, it will still strictly implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration and handle the Hong Kong issue according to the provisions of the Basic Law and the agreements reached between China and Britain. Nearly 40 advisers separately participated in discussion meetings on the special topics of politics and economy.
