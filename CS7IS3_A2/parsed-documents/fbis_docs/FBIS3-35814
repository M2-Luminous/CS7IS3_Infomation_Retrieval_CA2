On that occasion Vladimir Volfovich openly called for "a war to be provoked between mountain tribes..." The author of these lines witnessed the blood-curdling "revelations." It turned out that the "Bersenevskaya [after Bersenevskaya Embankment, location of the Estrada Theater] calls" of Russia's chief liberal were not the least in bringing a lawsuit against Zhirinovskiy. So, your correspondent met with Viktor Kruglov, prosecutor of the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office Administration for the Enforcement of National Security and Interethnic Relations Laws. [Kaverin] Viktor Alekseyevich, how did the "Zhirinovskiy case" came about? [Kruglov] Our administration and I personally have been dealing with aspects of Zhirinovskiy's political activity that are of interest to us. We have focused on four main incidents: the well-known ruling by the Third Party Information Court of 10 December 1993; second, an article in your newspaper; third, the incident involving Zhirinovskiy and Gdlyan, which took place on the night of 12 and 13 December at the Kremlin Palace of Congresses. The last incident is the book "The Last Dash to the South," published by Zhirinovskiy. We have considered all the facts together. The lawsuit was brought under Article 71 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code -- "propaganda of war." The decision on bringing a lawsuit was made at the level of the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office leadership. [Kaverin] But was is done at your initiative? [Kruglov] Let us clarify: On the basis of our investigatory materials. [Kaverin] What steps will be taken against Zhirinovskiy upon his return from abroad? [Kruglov] First, the Russian general prosecutor should determine who will investigate the criminal case. Once he makes up his mind on that, the division that will be tasked with the investigation will resolve all the matters -- of course, according to the law. The mechanism of such an investigation is well known: Subpoenas, interrogations. The investigation will be carried out in full as any investigation of an ordinary criminal case. [Kaverin] How will the investigation square with the immunity Zhirinovskiy enjoys as a deputy? [Kruglov] According to the new Russian Federation Constitution, the status of a Russian Federation State Duma deputy is not an obstacle to bringing a lawsuit and investigating the case. The Constitution stipulates completely clearly and unequivocally that State Duma approval is required for arresting a deputy, searching his or her place, or detaining him or her. Let me repeat: Arrest, search, and detention. That is to say, a criminal lawsuit against a deputy may be brought and the case may be investigated according to general rules, and only later, depending on the results of the investigation -- if reasons for a search, detention, or arrest emerge -- will the general prosecutor make a petition to the State Duma requesting that this or that deputy be stripped of his immunity on the basis of the presented investigation results. Let me recall that in accordance with the constitution in force at the time, the Supreme Soviet had to be petitioned so as to bring a criminal lawsuit itself against the deputy. [Kaverin] Still, Viktor Alekseyevich, let us try to simulate the situation: What if, say, Zhirinovskiy does not show up under the subpoena. What will he be threatened with in this event? [Kruglov] Let us begin by stating that he is obliged to show up in the first place. Because until charges are brought against him he is technically considered a witness. And he will be subpoenaed for questioning precisely in that capacity. If he still does not come, the investigator will have to react. [Kaverin] How? What measures are provided for in the law for this situation? [Kruglov] An ordinary citizen risks being forcibly brought before the court if he does not have good reasons for his failure to appear. This is enforced by the militia. But this action has an element of enforcement to it, so it can effectively be interpreted as a detention -- one of the three (!) instances where deputies enjoy immunity. [Kaverin] Then what we have is a closed circle: in order to arrest or detain a guilty deputy one needs weighty reasons and the State Duma's "OK." But in order to give this "OK" the Duma needs facts that the investigation is unable to obtain from the deputy... [Kruglov] This is correct, to a certain extent. But you should take into account that any criminal case is based not only on testimony of the person under investigation. There should be some other ideas, materials, documents, witnesses' testimonies, evidence produced by expert appraisals. In short, we need an objective record. This is why even though a deputy may evade giving testimony as a witness, this does not mean that a sufficient amount of evidence would not be collected to press charges against him. I would like to repeat that all said above is only theoretical in nature, but specifically these questions concerning the suspect will be decided upon by an investigator. The investigator who, under the law, inquires into the case and makes all decisions independently. [Kaverin] What is your opinion -- how long will the investigation last? [Kruglov] I do not know, this is a complex matter. It depends on a huge number of circumstances.
