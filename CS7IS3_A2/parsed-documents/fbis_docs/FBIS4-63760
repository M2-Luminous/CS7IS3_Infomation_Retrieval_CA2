This was clearly shown by the latest military parade in Groznyy, where military units were presented with banners and demonstrated their own uniforms. Two years ago when the rebellious general announced universal mobilization, many people, including people in Chechnya itself, viewed it as a children's game, forgetting that the Chechen president had excellent military training. Today Dudayev, apart from his National Guard, has several regiments, including an air squadron. Chechen cadre officers who have returned to the republic after being demobilized from Russian and CIS Armed Forces are being utilized in the Army. Despite the critical lack of cash in Chechnya and the lack of its' own currency, Dudayev nevertheless does not begrudge money for the Army or its weaponry. As the president himself said at a recent news conference, the world is too cruel and recognizes only strength. To all appearances he shares the dream of creating a strong Chechen state with its' own army. In one way or another the existence of the Chechen Armed Forces is already a fact. This fact will almost certainly be used by Dudayev at the possible coming talks with Russia. [video shows military parade in progress]
