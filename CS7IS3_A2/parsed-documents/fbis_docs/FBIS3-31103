This is what Churkin told reporters after his talks with Gligorov. Churkin cautioned that any kind of escalation of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina would have consequences for the entire Yugoslav area and that the conflict might even spread beyond the borders of the former Yugoslavia. The special envoy of the Russian president, who is on a one-day visit to Skopje, said that Russia was the first to demand an end to the siege of Sarajevo but that Moscow continues to maintain that action ought to be confined to the legal framework of the UN Security Council, where clear and precise stands could be adopted and then implemented by the parties to the conflict. The means envisaged by UN documents should be used in order to secure the implementation of the UN Security Council's decisions, Churkin said. The situation in Sarajevo is such that the demilitarization of the city is needed as well as the lifting of the siege. If the demilitarization and the lifting of the blockade are not implemented, air strikes will follow, but that will also mean an escalation of conflicts with unforeseeable consequences, the special envoy pointed out.
