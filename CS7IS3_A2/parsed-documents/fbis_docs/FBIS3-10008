He denied that national issues such as democracy and modification of constitutional Article 27, which deals with agrarian laws, have delayed the negotiations for peace. [Begin Ruiz recording] There are 34 commitments. Two of these commitments are not binding. They have to do with democracy. From the beginning it was a known fact that they do not form part of an agreement, strictly speaking, but that they are an opinion made known to the national community. It is expected that this opinion should have an impact on this community. [end recording] Ruiz said that some 10 or 12 points are yet to be negotiated before an agreement is reached. Of these points, four or five are of secondary importance. [Begin Ruiz recording] The others have a certain level of importance but because of linguistic difficulties they are still being discussed. They are not fundamental for reaching an agreement. We could say that a significant agreement has been reached already. [end recording] More than 72 hours after the doors of the peace cathedral were closed -- something that spawned speculation that the peace talks had been blocked -- Bishop Samuel Ruiz said that neither the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas nor the Zapatist National Liberation Army have been intransigent. [Begin Ruiz recording] So far there has been intransigence neither in the discussions of the agreements that are to be approved nor in the position of either side. [end recording] This information was provided during a news conference that Bishop Samuel Ruiz held alone with reporters. He explained that the final text of the agreements could me made known either Tuesday [1 March] evening or Wednesday [2 March] morning.
