Zakharov, Disaster Modeling and Prediction Association; UDC 539.63:523.6+533.95] [Abstract] Although a number of planetary bodies in the solar system are riddled with meteorite craters, current notions of the processes of formation that are associated with impact craters are quite varied. Questions associated with the impact of solids and with crater formation are also important in planetology for studying planetary-surface structure and the cosmogony of the solar system in general. That is why the study of impact phenomena with physical and mathematical modeling makes such an important contribution to our understanding of the nature of craters and to the solution of problems involving the danger meteorites present to spacecraft. The researchers here examine high-velocity impact on homogenous surfaces, as well as on layered surfaces, with a broad range of equations of state for matter surrounding solid, liquid, and gases phases. Aspects of the laboratory modeling of such impacts with laser pulses are also studied. Figures 5, references 7 (Russian).
