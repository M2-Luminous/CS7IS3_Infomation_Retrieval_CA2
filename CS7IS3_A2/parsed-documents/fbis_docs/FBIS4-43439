CD group chairman Peter Duetoft has made that clear. Like the Christian People's Party, the CD, which is a member of the government, now refuse to give Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (SDP) a free ticket to continue as head of the government after the next Folketing election. The CD have already decided two things: - The party will not support a Rasmussen government without participating itself: "We flatly reject both a minority Social Democratic government and an SR government because that would give us no control over the direction they take," said CD group chairman Duetoft, who will continue to make every effort to keep the Socialist People's Party (SF) from gaining influence. - And if the CD does participate in a Rasmussen government again the price will be higher than it was when the last government was formed. Duetoft said that the CD ``will definitely make more demands. ``And we want cooperation toward the right side of the Folketing and not the left,'' said Duetoft, pointing directly at the Conservative Party as a desirable partner for a Rasmussen government. The new statements from the CD have further increased the pressure on Prime Minister Rasmussen. The other small government party, the Christian People's Party, has long refused to guarantee continued loyalty. Duetoft has announced that the CD will spend the summer deciding who the party will support after the coming Folketing election.
