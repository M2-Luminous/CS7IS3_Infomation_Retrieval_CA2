This is the first time since the implementation of the bankrupcy law for a Sichuan court to hand down a bankruptcy order involving such a large sum of debts. The dyeing factory went into operation in Neijiang city in 1987 and it suffered losses because of poor management, unsuitable equipment, low grade of products, high costs and a continuously weak market for textiles. Not a single improvement was seen even though the factory received various kinds of help and it was forced to stop production in December, 1992. The 1,040-strong staff received a minimum monthly wage to meet their living expense. The factory saw accumulated losses of RMB 47,829 million while its fixed assets was put at RMB 56.987 million with gross liabilities of RMB 104.81 million. The factory applied to the court on January 25 this year for bankruptcy. The court ruled that the factory was unable to service the due debt and a bank loan for the factory was stopped. A deferred settlement was considered more damaging to the state while the factory met the requirements set out in the bankruptcy law. The court finally handed down a bankruptcy order to the factory and a clearance team was set up to deal with the debt servicing matter. The local labour and employment departments have worked out certain measures to settle the situation regarding the workers of the defunct factory. They will be entitled to employment in the factory after re-organization, to seek jobs in other business entities or undertake other kinds of career by tendering their resignation from the factory.
