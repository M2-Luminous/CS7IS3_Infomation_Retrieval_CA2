We are contacting you regarding a vital issue! For the first time in its history, the Association of Csallokoz [Velky Zitny Ostrov] Towns and Villages is calling a national, grand meeting of all elected representatives, mayors, and parliamentary representatives of southern Slovakia. Just why did we decide to call a national grand meeting? We did so to express our unanimous view: The government of this country is ruining us. It inhibits our development potential because it deprives us of the possibility to exercise rights to which individuals and communities in every constitutional state are entitled, and because it withholds some of the funds our municipalities are entitled to receive. It limits the exercise of our autonomous rights, and the evolution of autonomous local governments. The government is planning to implement a state administrative and regional reorganization over our heads, one that is akin to the one we have already experienced in the era of centralized state administration and autocracy. This would violate the principle of self-governance, and from our standpoint, would mean another deprivation of rights. The political leadership of the country is spreading propaganda of a kind that creates social unrest, and incites coexisting Slovaks and Hungarians against each other. It makes Hungarians appear as enemies of Slovakia. It endeavors to turn against each other the Hungarian people of southern Slovakia and their parliamentary representatives elected through democratic processes. Danger signals, which characterize our social, political, and economic situation, prompt us to call a national, grand meeting of the elected Hungarian representatives of this large region, who share our interests. We are aware of the fact that, according to every indication, the highest degree of mutual tolerance exists in this large region spanning from Pozsony [Bratislava] to the Ukrainian border, where a mass of about 600,000 Hungarians lives. This is in contrast to the prevailing atmosphere in other parts of the country. There are mutual, good relations between the Hungarian and Slovak people who live here; they are bonded by historical roots and have established productive social relations and the basic conditions for an economy capable of evolving. We must reap the benefits of this valuable situation by acting on the basis of our common will, and this is why we jointly state: Based on Recommendation No. 1201 of the Council of Europe, the establishment of a province with special legal status, with its own local government and administration, is needed in areas where significant numbers of Hungarians reside. An area having such status would preserve and enrich European values that, in the course of the past several decades, have gradually withered in this region. With that, we also want to state our firm demand to settle the legal status of the Hungarian national community in Slovakia, in a manner consistent with the proposed draft constitution prepared by the parliamentary representatives of the Hungarian coalition. At the same time, let us also declare that as a result of this settlement, the rights of Slovak people residing in the same area, but in a minority compared to us, must not be infringed upon in any respect. Let us elect from among the participants of the grand meeting a 100-member committee charged with the implementation of resolutions adopted by the meeting. We recognize the special mission of this historic meeting in the fact that by virtue of its positions it would unite the politically divided Hungarian people of Slovakia. Our jointly agreed-upon concepts concerning our fate would not become prey to partisan struggles. For this reason we are calling upon all mayors, local government representatives, and parliamentary representatives in southern Slovakia, irrespective of their political and ideological commitments, to take part in the national grand meeting to be held on 8 January 1994 in Komarom [Komarno]! Council of the Association ofllokoz Towns and Villages Komarom, 6 December 1994 Supporting Statement A resolution was passed at the 7 December 1993 conference designed to streamline the leadership policies of the Coexistence Movement and the MKDM [Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement] to the effect that the two organizations would join forces in supporting the announcement of the Association of Csallokoz Towns and Villages, calling upon every Hungarian elected representative and mayor, as well as parliamentary representative in southern Slovakia, irrespective of party affiliation or ideological orientation, to take part in the Komarom national grand meeting to be held on 8 January 1994. The two organizations agree with the contents of the call publicized by the Association of Csallokoz Towns and Villages, and have agreed that they would participate in the political preparatory work to organize the meeting in order to ensure the success of this national action. On behalf of the Coexistence Movement: Miklos Duray, Istvan Harna, Miklos Feher. On behalf of the MKDM: Bela Bugar, Pal Farkas, Pal Csaky.
