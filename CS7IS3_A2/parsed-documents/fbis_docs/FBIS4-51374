Over 200 entrepreneurs and bankers were invited to attend the two gatherings to hear about Hubei's economic and technological cooperation projects. In the city of Saarlouis, while systematically expounding on the various methods taken to absorb foreign capital, Comrade Guan Guangfu said: China's reform and opening up to the outside world is irreversible, like the earth revolving round the sun, and its determination to link its economy with the world economy is unshakable. China's economy is moving into the orbit of sustained, steady, and healthy growth. China is both the world's largest construction site and market. Although Hubei is not the largest province in China, it is one of the provinces with the greatest potential for development. Those who are the first to go and invest in China and Hubei will be the first to reap benefits. After the news briefing, which was held in the city of Saarlouis, Guan Guangfu and other comrades attended the signing ceremony for the $80-million agreements concluded by our province with three German companies and one French company. In the city of Ludwigsburg, Wuhan Vice Mayor (Wu Houfu) briefed seminar participants on Wuhan City's investment environment and development plan and reviewed the close ties between Wuhan and Ludwigsburg. Stressing the role of Wuhan, one of the exceptionally big cities in China, as a dragon head in the Chang Jiang Economic Belt and Hubei Province, he said: Wuhan City is the center of China's inland market. Our delegation brings along close to 200 economic and technological cooperation projects requiring a total investment of approximately $1.5 billion. After the seminar, German bankers and entrepreneurs held discussions with the Wuhan delegation on the specific ways of cooperation and signed 19 letters of intent involving a total investment of about $200 million.
