"The reason for stopping the withdrawal of artillery pieces is that the U.N. peacekeepers (UNPROFOR) are unable to secure efficient control of the Moslem infantry, which is envisaged by an agreement reached by the Moslem and Serb sides and UNPROFOR," General Milovanovic told a press conference after meeting with Chief of the UNPROFOR Command for Bosnia Angus Ramsey. General Milovanovic and Ramsey met at Pale, the political centre of the Bosnian Serb Republic, to discuss Sarajevo's demilitarization and control of the agreed ceasefire which took effect at noon on Thursday. The Bosnian Serb army has proposed that its artillery be controlled on its present positions with simultaneous control of the Moslem infantry because the Serb heavy weapons are a balance to the more numerous Moslem infantry, General Milovanovic said. As UNPROFOR has failed to secure the control of the Moslem infantry Milovanovic said he did not allow the Serb artillery to be withdrawn. The relevant documents, including NATO's ultimatum, do not insist categorically on a withdrawal of the artillery because they use the terms "withdrawal" and "placing under UNPROFOR control," he said. "We have fulfilled our obligation by accepting to put our artillery under control on condition that the same is done with the Moslem infantry," General Milovanovic said. Asked whether he took NATO threats seriously, he replied that, as a soldier, he did. "I don't know what NATO will do but I know what we'll do - we'll defend ourselves," he said. The North Atlantic Council on Wednesday gave ten days to the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons 20 kilometres from the centre of Sarajevo or to place them under UNPROFOR control, or their positions would be bombed. NATO also demanded from the Moslem side to place its heavy arms under UNPROFOR control.
