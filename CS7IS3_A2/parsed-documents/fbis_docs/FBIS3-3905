Also attending the meeting were: Tomur Dawamat, vice chairman of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee; Ismail Amat, State Councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission; and comrades in charge of the Ministry of Finance, the State Planning Commission, and the State General Administration of Taxation. Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: Since reform and opening to the outside world, the autonomous region has made greater progress in its economic construction; however, when compared with its fraternal provinces and regions, the gap between Xinjiang and these provinces and regions is widening. To narrow the gap in a short time and achieve more rapid economic development in Xinjiang, we must turn our attention to both the international and domestic markets; seize such opportunities as the state's adoption of policies in favor of industry, the inauguration of the second Eurasian Continental Bridge, and the grand oil exploration; take advantage of resources and geographical features; and carry out the development strategy to convert advantageous resources. He said: In the meantime, we should seize five tasks firmly and achieve breakthroughs in four areas. The five tasks are: the development of agriculture and the rural economy; the construction of infrastructural facilities and basic industries; the exploitation of mineral resources such as oil, natural gas, and nonferrous metals; the restructuring of enterprises; and reinvigorating economic development on the county level. To achieve breakthroughs in four areas is to make the development of state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises a major task and to transform enterprises' operating mechanisms so as to achieve new breakthroughs in restructuring traditional industries; to make the development of large-scale agriculture a major task and to put great efforts into the development of secondary and tertiary industries in rural areas, centering on village and town enterprises, so as to achieve new breakthroughs in economic development on the county level; to open up in an all-round manner and to diversify markets, so as to achieve new breakthroughs in foreign trade; and to move forward with the exploitation of oil and nonferrous metals, so as to achieve new breakthroughs in promoting local economic development.
