FR941128-1-00031 FR941128-1-00005 h. For refined modeling applications in complex terrain, multiple level (typically three or more) measurements of wind speed and direction, temperature and turbulence (wind fluctuation statistics) are required. Such measurements should be obtained up to the representative plume height(s) of interest (i.e., the plume height(s) under those conditions important to the determination of the design concentration). The representative plume height(s) of interest should be determined using an appropriate complex terrain screening procedure (e.g., CTSCREEN) and should be documented in the monitoring/modeling protocol. The necessary meteorological measurements should be obtained from an appropriately sited meteorological tower augmented by SODAR if the representative plume height(s) of interest exceed 100m. The meteorological tower need not exceed the lesser of the representative plume height of interest (the highest plume height if there is more than one plume height of interest) or 100m. i. Specifications for wind measuring instruments and systems are contained in the ``On-Site Meteorological Program Guidance for Regulatory Modeling Applications''.66 j. Stability Categories. The (P&hyph;G) stability categories, as originally defined, couple near-surface measurements of wind speed with subjectively determined insolation assessments based on hourly cloud cover and ceiling height observations. The wind speed measurements are made at or near 10m. The insolation rate is typically assessed using observations of cloud cover and ceiling height based on criteria outlined by Turner.50 In the absence of site specific observations of cloud cover and ceiling height, it is recommended that the P&hyph;G stability category be estimated using the solar radiation/delta-T (SRDT) method described in section 6.4.4.2 of reference 66. This method requires measurements of total solar radiation during the daytime and temperature difference ( D ) at night (see Temperature Difference Measurements), coupled with average wind speed at 10m above ground level. This technique is modified slightly from that published by Bowen et al. (1983),136 has been evaluated with three on-site data bases,137 and allows practical and reasonable implementation of the preferred Turner method.55
