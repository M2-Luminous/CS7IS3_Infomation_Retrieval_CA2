According to a communique broadcast on state television Saturday night, the justice minister has asked government prosecutors in trial courts to "implement the 17 November 1980 decree which punishes criminals and accomplices of those who organize secret trips abroad." There has been a clear increase over the past two weeks in the number of Haitian "boat people" [preceding two words in English] intercepted and turned back by U.S. Coast Guard cutters while trying to reach the Florida coastline in flimsy boats. According to Haitian sources, this increase is due to deteriorating living conditions among the poor population following UN sanctions, fueled by the hope of getting close enough to the Florida coastline not to be turned back, which was recently the case for 500 Haitians, as well as the new procedures established by U.S. President Bill Clinton in favor of Haitian "boat people." These procedures, which are not yet in effect, include a preliminary interview for requesters of political asylum before a decision on expulsion is made. To this end, the United States has chartered two Ukrainian vessels and has begun discussions with the UK on installing the refugees in camps on Turks and Caicos Islands, a British crown colony north of Haiti.
