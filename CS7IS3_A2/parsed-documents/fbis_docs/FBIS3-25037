FBIS3-25037 "drafr025_d_94018" FBIS-AFR-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Namibia North Korean Embassy Closes Following `Irregularities' MB0502142294 Windhoek DIE REPUBLIKEIN in Afrikaans 31 Jan 94 pp 1-2 MB0502142294 Windhoek DIE REPUBLIKEIN Language: Afrikaans Article Type:BFN [Report by Chris Vermaak] [Excerpts] The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), one of SWAPO's [South-West African People's Organization] biggest former ideological allies in the propaganda and armed struggle, has closed its embassy and trade mission in Windhoek virtually overnight, sold its assets, left behind an unpaid telephone account, and left the country like a "thief in the night." The Korean diplomats left the country under a cloud of alleged financial and other irregularities after they allegedly said in diplomatic circles that Namibia is not "productive enough for business." There are unanswered questions concerning the manner in which the North Koreans allegedly tried to convert huge amounts of Namibian dollars to U.S. dollars before leaving the country. A spokesman for the government says that he can confirm, unofficially, that the embassy is closed and that personnel, including the ambassador, have already returned to North Korea. "They left the country like thieves in the night." He said that it is not acceptable protocol to expect the government to announce that a diplomatic mission is about to close. "It is their prerogative to make such an announcement." No one would comment on future trade ties between the two countries. Earlier, personnel of the North Korean Embassy were under suspicion following a transaction concerning two luxury Toyota vehicles which they allegedly tried to export to Angola. Two diplomats were subsequently asked to return to North Korea. [passage omitted] Sources revealed to DIE REPUBLIKEIN that the North Koreans had been leaving the country one by one since December last year. The ambassador, Kim Pyong-ki, left the country quietly on 18 January without greeting anyone. [passage omitted] It came to light last week that the trade mission had not paid its telephone bill of approximately 1,800 rands. Sources say that the North Koreans tried to convert large amounts of Namibian dollars at a bank in the city for U.S. dollars. They could, however, not convert all the money after the bank questioned the source of the money and informed the Central Bank. One of the senior members of the embassy apparently left the country on 7 January with an unidentified box. It was tightly wrapped in paper and officially sealed. At the airport he apparently refused to allow the box to be inspected, citing diplomatic immunity. It was apparently not subjected to a check. The Embassy of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) said, upon inquiry, that it has no intention of leaving the country.
