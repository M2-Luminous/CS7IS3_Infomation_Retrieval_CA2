FR940728-2-00124 FR940728-2-00086 NATIONAL INDIAN GAMING COMMISSION Notice of Approval of Class III Tribal Gaming Ordinances AGENCY: National Indian Gaming Commission. ACTION: Notice of approval of class III gaming ordinances. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of class III gaming ordinances approved by the Chairman of the National Indian Gaming Commission. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan Carletta at (202) 632&hyph;7003 ext. 34, or by facsimile at (202) 632&hyph;7066 (not toll-free numbers). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) 25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq., was signed into law on October 17, 1988. The IGRA established the National Indian Gaming Commission (the Commission). Section 2710 of the IGRA authorizes the Commission to approve class II and class III tribal gaming ordinances. Section 2710(d)(2)(B) of the IGRA as implemented by 25 CFR 522.8 (58 FR 5811 (January 22, 1993)), requires the Commission to publish, in the Federal Register , approved class III gaming ordinances. The IGRA requires all tribal gaming ordinances to contain the same requirements concerning ownership of the gaming activity, use of net revenues, annual audits, health and safety, background investigations and licensing of key employees. The Commission, therefore, believes that publication of each ordinance in the Federal Register would be redundant and result in an unnecessary cost to the Commission. The Commission believes that publishing a notice of approval of each class III gaming ordinance is sufficient to meet the requirements of 25 U.S.C. 2710(d)(2)(B). Also, the Commission will make copies of approved class III ordinances available to the public upon request. Requests can be made in writing to: National Indian Gaming Commission, 1850 M St., N.W., suite 250, Washington, D.C. 20036. The Chairman has approved tribal gaming ordinances authorizing class III gaming for the following Indian tribes: Campo Band of Mission Indians Colusa Band of Wintun Indians Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa/Chippewa Indians Kootenai Tribe of Idaho Pueblo of Pojoaque Santa Rosa Band of Tachi Indians Squaxin Island Tribe Tyme Maidu Tribe of the Berry Creek Rancheria Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma Anthony J.
