He said that the political part of the summit will involve eight countries. As to the economic part of the summit, countries will act according to the formula "seven plus one". Obviously, the G-7 will consider behind closed doors the macro-economic situation in the world, for example, the currency and financial relations. At the meeting in line with the formula "seven plus one" the delegates will consider the pace of cooperation in support of the Russian reforms, he said. "We need concrete deeds and further shifts to materialize the understandings which were reached in the past years. I do not think we need more aid packages or graphic figures. Now it is a matter of the quality of cooperation, or what could be described as non-discrimination, open markets, the lifting of artificial obstacles on the road of Russia goods, services and capital." Lavrov believes that one should not change the official name for the Group of Seven. The economic part is the basis for the group's activities. The "political eight" is a reality and the term used during the preparations for the summit, as well as during the correspondence between Russian President Yeltsin and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev with their counterparts, he said. The deputy foreign minister is confident that joining the G-7 in political terms would enhance Russia's ability to exert influence on world political processes. "Russia influences world politics regardless of its membership in one organization or another," Lavrov said. He referred to the foreign ministers' conference on Bosnia held in Geneva recently as an example. "This kind of qualitatively new partnership, when the leading powers work out a common attitude and seek to pursue it through different organizations -- the U.N., the CSCE, and the like -- reflects our influence as well as our and our partners' readiness to take each other's interests into account and act jointly. This is the essence of what we call the political G-8 and multilateral strategic partnership." "Considering the fast development of events on the world scene, it's hard to say what will be the essence of political statement to be issued by the summit in Naples on behalf of its chairman, the Italian Prime Minister," said Interfax's interviewee. "But the general topics are already evident -- the situation in Bosnia, conflicts in Central America and in Africa, the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula, human rights...," he said. "Russia maintains a full-scale political dialogue, turning or already turned into partnership, with each of the G-7 countries," Lavrov pointed out. "Such relations have their own specificities, of course, but this does not prevent us from finding common approaches to international problems. There are no fundamental differences or substantial disparities in the approaches to international affairs -- to, say, non-proliferation problems, peace-keeping, the efforts to strengthen and raise the effectiveness of the U.N., regional conflicts and crises," he said.
