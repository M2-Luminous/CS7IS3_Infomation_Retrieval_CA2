Ruhani was quoted as saying that those who depend on the United States to liberate Iraq will be disappointed because the United States wants to control Iraq. Ruhani also held talks with the 10 Palestinian factions that oppose the Gaza-Jericho accord. He also held talks in Damascus with representatives of the Hizballah and the Islamic resistance in Lebanon. Following his meeting with those representatives, Ruhani stressed the importance of a united Islamic resistance stand, reiterating Iran's readiness to continue to support Islamic resistance against Israeli schemes. In a statement to Monte Carlo, Palestinian sources denied any Iranian financial siege on Hizballah and the Islamic Jihad. They stressed that the delay in Iranian financial aid in October 1993 was caused by a financial crisis in the Bank of Iran. This was communicated to them by the Iranian leadership in a written letter. The Palestinian sources said this temporary delay completely ended by December 1993.
