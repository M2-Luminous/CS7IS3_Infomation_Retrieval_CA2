FBIS4-38833 "drsov107_a_94014" FBIS-SOV-94-107 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Gas Agreement Signed Gas Agreement Signed SK0306051494 Seoul YONHAP in English 0247 GMT 3 Jun 94 SK0306051494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Moscow, June 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia agreed Thursday to jointly develop a natural gas field in Yakutia Autonomous Republic in eastern Siberia to supply gas through a pipeline to Seoul. President Kim Yong-sam, visiting Moscow until Saturday, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed to invest 10 million U.S. dollars apiece in a year-long feasibility study of the project at their expanded summit meeting, a senior member of Kim's entourage said. The project, costing 15-20 billion dollars in total, will include development of gas fields and construction of a pipeline connecting Yakutsk, Khabarovsk and Wonsan in North Korea to Seoul -- and further to Japan if things go well, he said. The two governments signed an agreement to develop the Yakut gas field in 1992, but could not narrow their differences on the project's details. "But President Yeltsin proposed that each country invest 10 million dollars this time, so the agreement could be reached," he said. He added, "It may take one or two years to decide if the field is worth developing, and if it is worth it, the two countries will have to further study the field's feasibility more closely for another two years." If all goes well, he added, the two nations will be able to start the project in 1998. Eleven South Korean companies including Korea Petroleum Development Corp., Daewoo, Samsung and Yukong Ltd. have already formed a consortium, while Russia and Yakutia have set up their own consortiums. "In addition to promoting the economies of the two countries, the project may contribute to forming a basis for unification of the two Koreas since the pipeline goes through North Korea to the South," he said. Seoul and Moscow plan to discuss securing the development rights to the gas field, whose estimated deposits come to 590 million tons, and consult with North Korea on construction of the pipeline. Meanwhile, Kim and Yeltsin also agreed to push for other projects that help promote South Korean investment in Russia such as construction of a trade center in Moscow, designation of a wharf for exclusive use by South Korean ships, construction of a bonded factory and preparation of an industrial complex for South Korean businesses. The two countries inaugurated three research and development centers in Moscow to promote bilateral technological cooperation and commemorate President Kim's visit to the Russian capital.
