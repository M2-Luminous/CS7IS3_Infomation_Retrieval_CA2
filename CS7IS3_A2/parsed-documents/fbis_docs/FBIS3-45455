"We welcome French enterprises to compete in China on a fair footing," Tong Jiemin, deputy director general for European affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, told Business Weekly. Tong pointed to the "vast potential" of bilateral collaboration in such fields as nuclear power, transportation, telecommunications, chemicals and agriculture. He added that prospects are good for joint development between medium- and small-sized enterprises in both countries. Tong's remarks followed last week's Sino-French joint communique restoring traditionally friendly relations on the basis of the principles guiding the establishment of diplomatic relations. "Our two economies complement each other very well and their cooperation had its heyday in the late 1980s," Tong said. But such ties suffered a severe setback when France decided to sell weapons to Taiwan. Now the French Government has vowed "not to authorize any French enterprises to participate in arming Taiwan." Last week's joint communique said French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur will visit China soon. Tong said France became China's fourth largest trading partner in the European Union (European Community) last year, when bilateral trade in the first 11 months increased to $2.47 billion. At the same time China's trade with Western Europe hit $24.1 billion, up 50.5 percent over 1992. China imported $13.9 billion worth of goods, up 46.2 percent, suffering a deficit of more than $3 billion. Tong said Western Europe, in the wide sense of including the five Nordic countries, Austria and Switzerland, had surpassed the United States as China's third largest overseas trading partner, behind Hong Kong (and Macao) and Japan. Germany, Italy, Britain and France rank among China's top 10 trading partners. Germany took the lead as its trade with China from January to November last year soared 64.3 percent to $8.3 billion. China's imports grew 63 percent to $5 billion and exports surged 66.3 percent to $3.3 billion. Germany's lead in trade with China was cemented last year when Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited China and clinched export contracts worth several billion deutchmarks, including contracts for the Guangzhou Subway Project. "Western Europe, as a whole, is a big and well-integrated market, which has a sound prospect for cooperating with China," Tong said. From 1978 to June 1993 Western European countries committed $5.7 billion to 2,146 projects in China. About $2.25 billion of the pledged investment has been used. During the past 15 years, Western Europe has promised to provide China with $11.7 billion in loans, or more than one-third of the $31.4 billion foreign governments have loaned to China. Tong said $10.9 billion had been promised in contracts by Western European companies, of which $10 billion has been used.
