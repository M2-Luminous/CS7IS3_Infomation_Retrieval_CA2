FR941019-2-00008 FR941019-2-00007 COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION Chicago Mercantile Exchange Proposed Transfer of Spot for Futures Rule Amendments AGENCY: Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ACTION: Notice of proposed rule amendments of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to restrict the transfer of spot commodities for futures contracts for the Eurodollar futures contract. SUMMARY: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (``CME'') has submitted proposed rule amendments and other materials which would limit the permissibility of the transfer of spot commodities for futures contracts, also known as exchange for physical transactions, for the Eurodollar futures contract. 1 Acting pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, the Division of Trading and Markets has determined to publish the CME proposal for public comment. The Division believes that publication of the CME proposal is in the public interest and will assist the Commission in considering the views of interested persons. 1 The CME proposal includes proposed amendments to existing Rules 538 and 3904. DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John C. Lawton, Associate Director, or Clarence Sanders, Attorney, Division of Trading and Markets, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW, Washington, DC 20581. Telephone: (202) 254&hyph;8955. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Description of Proposed Rules and Rule Amendments By a letter dated September 12, 1994, the CME submitted proposed rule amendments pursuant to Section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act'') and Commission Regulation 1.41(b). The proposed amendments would limit the permissibility of exchange for physical (``EFP'') transactions for the Eurodollar futures contract. Under the proposal, EFP transactions would no longer be permitted for any contract month beyond the second listed quarterly month in the March quarterly cycle. 2 Such EFP transactions would continue to be permitted for those months not extending beyond the second listed quarterly month in the March quarterly cycle. 2 For the Eurodollar futures contract the CME currently lists contract months extending ten years. Pursuant to the proposal's implementation plan, the amendments would be made effective for all applicable contract months. Thus, under the proposal, the rule amendments would be implemented to apply to existing as well as newly listed contract months. According to the CME, the proposal is intended to support liquidity and price-discovery in deferred months of the Eurodollar futures contract. In this respect, it appears that the proposal at least partially represents a response to efforts to develop a new method for trading U.S. Treasury securities versus Eurodollar futures contracts (i.e., ``TED spreads''). This approach involves acquiring both legs of the spread position in a single transaction. II. Request for Comments The Commission requests comments on any aspect of the CME's proposed rule amendments that members of the public believe may raise issues under the Act or Commission regulations. Copies of the proposed rule amendments and related materials are available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies also may be obtained through the Office of the Secretariat at the above address or by telephoning (202) 254&hyph;6314. Some materials may be subject to confidential treatment pursuant to 17 CFR 145.5 or 145.9. Any person interested in submitting written data, views, or arguments on the proposed rule amendments should send such comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581, by the specified date. Issued in Washington, DC, on October 13, 1994. Alan L. Seifert, Deputy Director.
