"Only through indomitable will and fortitude of the fraternal peoples and a desire to live together, we shall be able to attain the cherished goal or we shall get lost one by one," the statement said. Rutskoy believes that over the past three years "the reality itself proved that the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) is non-viable" and that "the people have come to realise in full the price of the irresponsible and light-minded decision to dismantle the Soviet Union". At the same time the former vice-president is convinced it is impossible to prevent the country "from slipping down into an abyss through meetings, demonstrations and irresponsible statements that border on a political provocation". Rutskoy considers it necessary to comprehend this and look for more effective forms for rapprochement and cooperation in an atmosphere of an intensifying disintegration, economic, social and political crisis. He did not specify what forms he had in mind.
