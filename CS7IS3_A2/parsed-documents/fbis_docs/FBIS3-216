It aims to provide a platform for what it calls the silent majority who want peace. The ACDP says its image, unlike those of other parties, is not scarred by the past. The party's president-elect, Reverend Kenneth Meshoe, says he had a message from God to form a party which will represent Christians. The party's main policy will be to bring about peace through the word of God. [Begin Meshoe recording] We are meeting a need that nobody at the moment is meeting. Most South Africans do believe in God. That is why when you talk of bringing God back into government, they are comfortable with that. [end recording] Reverend Meshoe says unlike other parties they will be consistent in carrying over the message of peace. [Begin Meshoe recording] As everybody wants a good economy, everybody wants jobs, everybody wants investment in the country, we say for investments to come to the country must be stable, and for stability to be there, there must be peace, and for peace to be there people must be reconciled one to the other. [end recording] The ACDP believes in an open market economy. It favors a federal government with maximum constitutional powers at the lowest level. The party will contest all nine regions and claims to have strong support countrywide.
