FBIS4-21047 "jptdd015__l94008" JPRS-TDD-94-015-L JPRS Narcotics 5 April 1994 LATIN AMERICA BOLIVIA MIR Leader Cajias Claims U.S. `Plotting' To Destroy Social MIR Leader Cajias Claims U.S. `Plotting' To Destroy Social Democracy PY0504220094 La Paz Radio Fides Network in Spanish 1700 GMT 5 Apr 94 PY0504220094 La Paz Radio Fides Network Spanish BFN [Text] Fernando Cajias, a leader of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, MIR, has accused the U.S. Government of plotting to destroy social democracy--not just in Bolivia, but in the whole world. [Begin Cajias recording] The point is that now the cold war is over and communism has fallen to pieces, social democracy is the only rival for the liberals. I believe there is an international plan to eliminate social democracy worldwide. [end recording] As far as Bolivia is concerned, Cajias claimed the anti-MIR campaign linking his party to drug traffickers--which is being orchestrated by the current Bolivian Administration and the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia--has succeeded in removing from [former President] Jaime Paz Zamora his status as a national leader. [Begin recording] [Cajias] As you probably know, a survey was done at the end of last year. It showed that Jaime Paz Zamora was regaining popularity. Thus, it was the right time to take advantage of circumstances and prevent this from happening. We are perfectly aware mistakes have been made, as the president of the party personally acknowledged. These mistakes have cost us dearly but we will not give up politics. [Unidentified reporter] Will the MIR survive as it is or will it have to be reborn? [Cajias] I believe this has thwarted many hopes, many people have ceased to believe in us, and even our militants are greatly demoralized. It would be worse, however, to abandon all our hopes. [end recording] Asked about drug trafficker Isaac Chavarria's latest disclosures, Cajias answered that the next stage of the investigation--during which those he has accused will testify--will show who were actually involved in trafficking.
