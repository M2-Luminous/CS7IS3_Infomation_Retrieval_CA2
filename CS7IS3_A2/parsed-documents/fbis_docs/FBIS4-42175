Instead, for six weeks, Labour will be the focus of media attention. In most of the past 15 years, such close scrutiny of the Opposition would most probably have ended in political disaster. Whether this leadership campaign can be conducted in a spirit of constructive argument will be a sign of whether Labour has indeed matured into a party fit to be considered for government. To hasten the procedure was wise. Already Labour is likely to suffer in the European elections from not having filled the gap left by John Smith's death. To have left the leadership unresolved through the summer would have been to invite a long campaign from which the contestants would have emerged stale, exhausted and possibly embittered. Margaret Beckett has not only saved the party money by conceding a contest for deputy leader on the same day; she has also prevented the risk of the second placed candidate in July deciding to challenge her for deputy leader in the autumn. Some in the party are still keen that a Blair and Beckett "dream ticket" should be adopted by acclaim without a contest. Others are hoping that Gordon Brown will refrain from standing so as not to muddy the modernising message of Tony Blair. Both are misguided. The Labour Party would do far better to hold an open contest with as many contenders as want to compete. The transferable voting system that the NEC [National Executive Committee] has chosen means that there is little danger of Mr Blair and Mr Brown splitting the modernisers vote and letting John Prescott in. If the two men are united on policy, then it is right that they should each set out their personal visions of the future of the Labour Party so that their electorate can decide which articulates them better. As long as the contestants avoid attacking each other, this debate will be good for Labour. For six weeks, senior shadow Cabinet members will have a free run in the media, unopposed by their Conservative counterparts. The more contestants there are, the more talents will be on show to the voters. This is a chance too to define a new Labour Party. However successful Mr Smith was at uniting the party and attacking the Tories, his was still a holding operation. He had not spelled out his philosophy; and the lacuna was allowed to continue while feuding Conservatives captured the news. The only pledge he made in his leadership campaign was to introduce one-member-one-vote into party elections. The contenders in this much more closely fought campaign will not have the luxury of silence. Yet their arguments need not be divisive. Neil Kinnock and Mr Smith encouraged Labour to shed its old nostrums. There is now a thirst for the new. Mr Blair, in particular, seems ready to quench it with his talk of a new compact between the individual and the community. After more than a decade of successfully promoting the individual over the collective, voters are starting to think further ahead. Many fer moral breakdown and yearn for a politics that talks of duties as well as rights, responsibilities as well as entitlements. Senior Conservatives, led by Michael Portillo and Michael Howard, have entered this ground. But so can Labour. Mr Blair called on Tuesday for "a modern notion of citizenship," where rights and duties go hand in hand. Under the spotlight of a leadership contest, he and his colleagues can spell out more precisely what these notions mean to them.
