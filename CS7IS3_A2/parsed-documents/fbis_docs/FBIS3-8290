[Cimoszewicz] Yes. If we are to survive in politics, we have to accept the coalition. But show me a government in recent years that did not have any internal conflicts. There is nothing unusual about the fact that, after several months in office, there is a need to reexamine various issues, which we do at meetings of the so-called directorate--in other words, an informal gathering of coalition representatives. We do not mind the fact that PSL and SLD politicians hold various views, including on the subject of forming a government and the kind of information policy it should pursue. [WPROST] Can one describe this government as Pawlak's "own" government? [Cimoszewicz] According to the Constitution, the prime minister has the power to reach the kind of decisions he has just reached in relation to the deputy prime minister [Pawlak fired him]. On the other hand, the present government is based on two parties and that determines its method of functioning. Unfortunately, the Constitution does not envisage such a thing as a Government Presidium. Providing the government leadership with prestige is quite another matter. [WPROST] But an absence of detailed regulations make it easier to mollify coalition members and turn the entire coalition into an illusory body. [Cimoszewicz] That depends on the way one interprets events. I think it is too soon to say that the coalition is illusory. Our coalition requires a consolidation of its structures. We want certain political provisions to be set in writing so that we might know who is responsible for what. Only if we prove incapable of creating proper mechanisms for the functioning of the coalition will there be a danger that the coalition is incapable of functioning efficiently. [WPROST] A danger for whom? [Cimoszewicz] If the coalition experienced problems with trying to survive, the SLD would be in a difficult situation because, on its own, it might not be able to act effectively and implement its preelection pledges. [passage omitted] [WPROST] Is Poland a democratic country, as the Constitution says it is? [Cimoszewicz] It is trying to become one. We will succeed in turning it into a democratic country, but the day that happens is a very long way off. This involves not so much legislation as social consciousness and the attitudes of politicians. The law is still regarded as a means to an end. Even in recent years, violations of the law have been excused on grounds of so-called necessity. The civic ombudsman says that, in 1993, there were more violations of civic rights than before. [passage omitted] [WPROST] Do you agree that the establishment of a law-governed state will be very difficult without a new constitution? [Cimoszewicz] Unfortunately, even the present parliament might have problems with it, and even if it satisfies the formal requirements. If Lech Walesa were to put into practice some of the things members of the Presidential Chancellery have been saying, he would be playing a destructive role. Nothing can justify using the Constitution for the purpose of pursuing a political contest. I would be happier if the government concentrated on social and economic policy this year because that is the main source of conflict. [passage omitted] [WPROST] Either we have a law-governed country or one ruled by the fist of stronger groups who win privileges for themselves at society's expense. [Cimoszewicz] I am very upset about what I would describe as an anarchistic, unimaginative approach toward the affairs of one's own country. We are observing increasing egoism among professional groups that are convinced that they have to reap maximum benefits for the state. Frequently, we encounter the snowball effect--one group stages a demonstration for the sake of some benefit or concession and another sees this demonstration and follows suit. At the same time, we as a society fail to see that actions like this are suicidal for the state. We should consider which is better--a disintegration of what little resources we have, or the creation of a chance for the future. [WPROST] How about a few examples? [Cimoszewicz] Several years ago, a law on compensation for Stalinist persecution was passed. The lawmakers assumed that all affected persons would behave honorably and not make undue demands on the state's finances. But this year alone, 1.5 trillion zlotys has had to be allocated for compensation. It is the same with reprivatization. It costs trillions of zlotys just to restore property that was misappropriated in pursuance of the previous legislation. Every single claim involves material or legal interests. But the sum total of these interests is ruining the state.
