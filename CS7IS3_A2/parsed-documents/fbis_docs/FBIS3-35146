The assembly asked the UN secretary general to (?withdraw) the report immediately because it brought into disrepute the faith of the Islamic nation. It was a flagrant challenge to all divine religions and human values and destructive to human rights and international charters. In a report on this matter, the Assembly called on all parliaments in Arab and Islamic states and others which respect human rights and values to decisively reject this defamation. Meanwhile, Mr. 'Abd-al-Aziz Shiddu, justice minister and attorney general, stressed that Gaspar Biro's report is clearly a conspiracy against [words indistinct] the West's design to destroy Islam and all other divine religions. He said the report had a secular base which called for the separation of religion and the state and used the United Nations as a tool to achieve this.
