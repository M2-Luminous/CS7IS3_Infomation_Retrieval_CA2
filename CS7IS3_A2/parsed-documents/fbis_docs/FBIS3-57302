Upon returning to Kazan, Mintimer Shaymiyev gave an exclusive interview to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. [Batyrshin] What can be considered the meeting's main result? [Shaymiyev] We agreed to speed up the negotiating process as much as possible, because on 13 March new elections to the Federal Assembly will take place in Tatarstan. We believe that Tatarstan should be represented in the Federal Assembly. But in order for the population to turn out actively for the elections, we need to sign a bilateral treaty. Without determining a formula of our relationship, however, expecting the voters to be active would be simply naive. [Batyrshin] Does the Russian president object in principle regarding the bilateral treaty's text? [Shaymiyev] The work on the treaty is still going on, which is why we did not consider separate articles of the document, and we agreed that the final version of the text would be considered no later than by the first third of February. [Batyrshin] What problems exist today in the negotiating process between Moscow and Kazan? [Shaymiyev] There are no big problems in the work on the treaty text. The main, albeit entirely surmountable, difficulties have emerged in the process of preparing five intergovernmental agreements -- on banking activity, the budget, the coordination of the law-enforcement agencies' efforts, on defense matters, and on foreign economic activity. The treaty will not be concluded without these agreements. I think that within 10 days we will be able to complete the work on these agreements and get around to concluding the treaty. [Batyrshin] Does this mean that Moscow currently recognizes Tatarstan's status as "a sovereign state, a subject of international law, associated with the Russian Federation on the basis of the Treaty between the State Authorities of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan on the Mutual Delegation of Powers and Terms of Reference" (a phrasing from the Tatarstan Constitution)? [Shaymiyev] We are trying to arrive at a formula of a relationship within the framework of the two constitutions that would be a fruit of a compromise. [Batyrshin] Could you, please, expand on that? [Shaymiyev] No, because presently the working groups under Tatarstan Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev and Russian Federation Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov are working on it every day, from early morning till midnight. The definitive consideration within the dates I have mentioned will bring about complete clarity. [Batyrshin] Do the agreements call for the law-enforcement agencies to be brought under Tatarstan jurisdiction or the other way around? [Shaymiyev] There will be subjects of joint jurisdiction and subjects under Tatarstan jurisdiction. As the consultations have shown, we can easily reach agreement. As with regard to other problems, the republic's independence does not rule out coordination in our work. Presently, a major part of the republic's law- enforcement agencies is under Tatarstan's jurisdiction, but this does not hamper collaboration with the federal authorities. Or why should we have the Internal Affairs Ministry's army units performing federal missions in our subordination? [Batyrshin] Is Moscow going to accept a one-channel taxation system that has long been favored by Kazan? [Shaymiyev] Tax relations involve politics, too. For Tatarstan citizens have Russian Federation citizenship and must feel through taxes that they belong to Russia. Earlier, we did not take this matter into account; it is impeccable in legal terms. It is another matter that there are many questions related to the financing of our specific programs, the more so because our republic does not belong to those that receive subsidies. [Batyrshin] The latest full-scale negotiations between Russia and Tatarstan took place last May. At the time, you were certain that the treaty would be signed by August at the latest. Aren't you afraid that presently the period of accelerated work on the treaty will be followed by nine months of stagnation? [Shaymiyev] No, because I do not think that Russia is in for last year's upheavals. The sociopolitical situation inside the country is currently favorable for concluding the treaty. In addition, the president and the Russian Government are decisively intent on launching a new regional policy. Decentralization is inevitable. It has been two years since they have refused to give Tatarstan powers, but we took them on our own. Is Tatarstan worse off because of that or not? No one can deny that the situation inside the republic has improved. So, what do we have to be afraid of? I am convinced that Tatarstan's stance paves a way toward the Russian Federation's democratization. We will come to a democratic federation, even now, when many politicians think that Russia is a unitary state.
