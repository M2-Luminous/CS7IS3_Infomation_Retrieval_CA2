According to Dr. Malek Afzali, the deputy minister for health, as of the month of Aban [23 October-21 November] this year, 219 people have been affected by the AIDS virus in Iran. Of these, 85 have contracted the disease, and 62 have died. The National Committee for Combating AIDS warns that if serious preventive measures are not instituted by the officials and the people in general, this disease could appear on a more extensive scale in the country. At present, one can state: The best treatment for AIDS and one of the most important means of controlling this destructive disease--as recommended by the World Health Organization [WHO]--is adherence to religion and family values and familiarizing people with the ways the virus is transmitted and measures to prevent it. Doctors, experts, specialists, and officials at the Blood Transfusion Center and the Health Ministry believe that in order to combat AIDS and its spread on a national level, necessary and adequate training about AIDS and other infectious diseases should be imparted to the people by means of various organizations, such as the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, Ministry of Education and Training, Ministry of Culture and Higher Education, the mass media, and the Friday imams. Special clinics to provide medical services to those who have already been infected by the AIDS virus should be established.
