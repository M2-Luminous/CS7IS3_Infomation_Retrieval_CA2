The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command [CCRI-CG] of the EZLN issued a communique dated 7 April, which includes five basic points. The first point states that in recent days EZLN members have learned that 21 civilians are being held at Cerro Hueco Penitentiary and are wrongfully accused of being EZLN members. The second point states that following the release of the EZLN fighters, who are under arrest in Chihuahua, the EZLN has no other guerrillas in government prisons. The third point states that the EZLN General Command has carefully reviewed its lists of combatants and that the names of those who are being wrongfully detained at Cerro Hueco Penitentiary are not on those lists. In the fourth point, the EZLN denounces government plans to arbitrarily cover up the indiscriminate arrest of civilians during the conflict by accusing them without proof of belonging to to the EZLN. In the fifth point, which is a warning to the authorities, the EZLN warns that if these 21 prisoners continue to be held, the detentions will be an obstacle to continuing the dialogue process, because the EZLN cannot speak of peace if the government speaks of war with its actions. It also notes that the CCRI-CG communique is signed by Subcommander Marcos.
