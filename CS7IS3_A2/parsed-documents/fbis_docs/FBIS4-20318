We call this segment of the Chinese economy the "propertied class" and propose to identify its components. The first component consists of home-grown individual households. Starting with next to nothing, a large number of self-employed individuals in China have prospered in recent years. As the unemployed or people waiting for employment, they were the objects of pity of the salaried society in the early 1980's, only to become the first batch of beneficiaries of reform thanks to a historic opportunity. Formerly "speculators" and "profiteers" who transported goods long distances for sale, they gradually accumulated enough capital to open a restaurant or a clothing store, or to go into business retailing textiles made of chemical fibers. Women who once sold eggs now sit right next to the counter to keep an eye on video game machines nearby. After making a fortune doing business in a small way, a number of individual households became more ambitious as their wallets expanded and set their sights on television sets, recorders, electric fans, refrigerators, even computers. In the city where I live, all five electrical appliance stores that opened for business in 1992 are run by individual households. More recently, encouraged by the speeches made by Deng Xiaoping as he toured the south, individual households began flexing their economic muscle almost overnight. Individual households from Wenzhou head north to the Sino-Russian border and south to where China abuts Myammar and Vietnam to participate in border trade. Their counterparts from Jiangsu and Zhejiang march into Sichuan and line the roads there with gas stations, sinking tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of yuan into the business. The area is so heavily dotted with gas stations that the eye cannot take them all in. According to the latest survey by the State Statistics Bureau, about 20 percent of urban and rural households are high-income households earning over 10,000 yuan a year, including 5.30 million households who make more than 50,000 yuan annually. Perhaps man is a born economic animal. These people, previously referred to by political economists as the "lumpen-proletariat" (in Marx's words), are reinvesting the enormous wealth they have accumulated instead of spending it to build houses to live in. That way they steered clear of the possibility of becoming mere big-time consumers and instead turned themselves into owners of capital goods. No doubt the moment an individual householder who used to do everything himself opens a store, hires help, and is addressed as "boss" by his employees, he crosses the threshold into the "propertied class." The second component consists of township and town enterprise shareholders. The township enterprise is a form of enterprise unique to China. Most of these enterprises are built with funds raised by peasants and manned by peasants hired to do the job. Typically a township enterprise has only a few major shareholders, three to five perhaps. The ownership of a major stake in the enterprise distinguishes the major shareholders from the ordinary peasants whose investment can be anywhere from 100 yuan to 1,000 yuan and even more from the larger number of peasants who are paid for their labor. They hold managerial and distribution power and own the capital goods. As such they belong in the "propertied class." The third component consists of capital owners from overseas. After reform went under way and the open policy was introduced, China in reality is no longer an unadulterated socialist economy, with all forms of capital from overseas penetrating into the mainland economy. Whether they are involved in Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures, or wholly foreign-funded enterprises, these overseas investors must be considered card-carrying members of the capitalist class, something that absolutely nobody would disagree with. This is so even though some of them are red capitalists and even though their capital does not take the form of funds but technology and intellectual property rights. They hold overseas passports but are part of the propertied class in the mainland's society and economy. The fourth component consists of shareholders of state enterprises other than the state. As state enterprises adopted the shareholding system and as the state issued shares on a large scale, reserving only enough to maintain its controlling shareholder status, more and more state enterprise shares find their way into the hands of private individuals. Assuming that the state needs to own just 25 percent of the stock of an enterprise to be the controlling shareholder, as some economists estimate, then 75 percent of the shares are in the ownership of non-state shareholders. This proportion represents a substantial amount of money. Should the state decide to sell off a number of small enterprises and declare some mismanaged enterprises bankrupt and auction them off, then the state will own an even smaller percentage of the stock. Taking up the slack is foreign capital, as noted above. In addition, most of the shares will become the capital of private enterprises and township and town enterprises and the incomes and, subsequently, the capital of individual households and the salaried class. The owners of private enterprises and township and town enterprises, individual households, and wage-earning employees who own a substantial number of shares have also joined the ranks of the propertied class by virtue of their ownership of a large number of shares. It must be made clear in passing that there is a point at which a difference in degree becomes a difference in kind. It would be absurd to lump together with the propertied class a salaried worker who has purchased 100 or even 1,000 yuan worth of shares. If, on the other hand, the income he derives from the shares he owns exceeds his wage, it is clear where he belongs. The fifth component consists of idle profiteers. There is gradually emerging in China a class of jobless idlers who do nothing decent all day but are kept alive by deposits and bonds worth more than tens of thousands of yuan, reaping a bonanza of interest and dividends. Although these assets are not on the surface direct capital-goods capital, they benefit from the redistribution of production profits in the form of short-term loans. Accordingly these assets are no longer ordinary wealth but financial capital. This class of profiteers who live off assets should rightly be included in the propertied class. The sixth component consists of celebrities in the movie, television, cultural, and sports communities who have parlayed their fame into capital. As an intangible asset, fame has made some individuals enormously wealthy. Already there are dozens of singers who command 10,000 yuan per concert appearance at home. Every Olympic gold medalist is a millionaire. A leading actor has now accumulated a fortune exceeding billions of yuan, rivaling that of some rich women in Hollywood. True to form, such wealth is promptly converted into capital. Some goes into advertising to finance the expanded reproduction of fame. Some is directly invested in industrial and commercial real estate to earn production profits. Typical of this group are such celebrities as Li Ning [2621 1337], Liu Xiaoqing [0491 2556 1987] and Zhan Rong [3277 1369]. They too are members of the propertied class. The seventh component comprises scientific and technical [S&T] workers who transform knowledge into productive forces. By patenting their inventions and innovations and selling them to the highest bidders, or by entering into cooperative schemes directly with a production unit to turn their inventions and innovations into commodities, S&T workers have reaped a windfall. Because of the government's drive to develop primary productive forces, the ranks of S&T personnel who successfully marry knowledge with commercialization will only continue to swell. The realization of wealth drives home the actualization of value and also motivates them to pursue even more wealth. The most successful among them have been elevated into the propertied class. The eighth component is made up of administrative officials who abuse their office for personal gains. Although discipline inspection, supervision, and oversight by public opinion have kept administrative departments as honest as possible, there are still some administrative officials, particularly leading cadres, who have amassed considerable properties by abusing their office. Insiders say that some leaders stand to receive thousands of yuan, even 10,000 yuan, in cash in bribes, gifts, and bonuses at year end. After being ensconced in top jobs for years, some as long as a dozen years, a number of bureaucrats have stashed away a fortune made up of all sorts of dubious incomes. They too are members of the propertied class, their passport to that club being their official positions. [passage omitted]
