U.S. President Bill Clinton's latest threats to invade Haiti to dislodge the military somewhat contradict the modern dictum of respect for others. The Haitian military continues to control power and prevent constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide from returning home. The events in Iraq, then Panama, and now Haiti clearly demonstrate the United States has become the international police force that tightens the reins of anyone who steps out of line. The case of Panama was very denigrating and offensive to the dignity of the Latin American nations. The invasion of Panama City by forces stationed in the Canal Zone destroyed the humble buildings of many poor neighborhoods and ended the lives of many Panamanians. The wounded and disabled survivors, who still suffer the traumas of the massive attacks by U.S. gunships, continue their plight from door to door demanding a modest compensation that would allow them to continue surviving and rebuild their poor huts, which U.S. artillery flattened. The same could occur in Haiti; this is very disturbing, because thousands of Haitians will lose their lives, huts, and belongings if an invasion of the island does in fact occur. We do not know, however, what kind of reaction to expect from an angered people as patriotic as the Haitians. We believe a U.S. invasion of Haiti would not be the picnic Panama was. The Haitians will set a high price to their defeat. It will undoubtedly be a massacre that will in no way benefit the image of the powerful nation of the north. That does not matter. Clinton has already said: The Haitian military can vary this situation today if they wish; otherwise, they must face the consequences. The Haitian military must understand the grave nature of this decision and try and find a negotiated way out, while saving face and avoiding any signs of surrender. The Haitian people do not deserve to be massacred. They have already suffered so much that there are no more tears left to cry; this means nothing to Clinton. He wants to restore democracy by fire and force, because they are the world's policemen, and they say God gave them that power. Meanwhile, all the other Latin American Nations, in their roles as observers, have simply said go right ahead.
