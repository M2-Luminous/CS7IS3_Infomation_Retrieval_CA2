But already there are signs that to deal with "hostile forces" in Hong Kong, Communist China is going to establish the "right to hold perpetrators accountable for past acts" to "justify" a crack down on dissidents when sovereignty is safely in its hands. Red-Headlined Documents and Qian Qichen's Instructions On 1 July 1997, a day which marks the 76th anniversary of the founding of the CPC, Communist China will restore its sovereignty over Hong Kong. As this day approaches, when there will be a change of "national flags," some people are proud and feel avenged, some feel helpless, and of course there are some who feel it is the end of the world.... But whatever the attitude toward the return of Hong Kong in 1997, most agree that day will not be a happy or bright one. "What kind of problems will there be during the transfer of sovereignty?" Like a large unwelcome cloud, this question looms above the high levels of the CPC as an increasing worry. A report relayed in early April by the State Council's General Office, "On problems that may appear during Hong Kong's transition, the transfer of sovereignty, and the early days of the Special Administrative Region [SAR] government," drafted by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Research Office, highlighted this worry. The report was issued as a red-headlined document to the party committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and cities, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and party committees of the relevant military regions, obviously to get the whole party and Army mentally prepared. From what Qian Qichen, State Council vice premier and director of the Preliminary Work Committee, wrote on the document, we can see that without the cooperation of British Hong Kong, Communist China's hands are tied in the latter phase of Hong Kong's transition. Qian Qichen said in his remarks: We must fully assess changes in the Hong Kong situation, be fully prepared, and properly handle and solve problems and be ready with solutions to them in order to maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability. Under its requirement for "full assessment" and "full preparation," the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office report listed 15 possible serious problems that may occur during Hong Kong's transition, its transfer of sovereignty, and the early days of the SAR government. These problems are excerpted as follows: "British Hong Kong Pushes Executive Council to the Forefront of Confrontation With the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office" 1. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to agitate and sow dissension among high-ranking civil servants. 2. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to pick, promote, and groom a group of pro-British and anti-Chinese elements and install them in the Hong Kong Government and elite positions in professional circles. 3. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities appoint pro-British and anti-Chinese elements to the Executive Council and push it to the forefront of confrontation with the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. 4. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to rely on U.S. influence and internationalize the Hong Kong problem. 5. To win over public opinion, Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities institute a social welfare system like those pursued in northern Europe which puts an excessive burden on the SAR government. Reference to Trump Card Held by British Hong Kong That Could Throw Hong Kong Into Chaos 6. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities abet and make use of Hong Kong's anti-Chinese and extreme rightist forces and hostile forces overseas to turn Hong Kong into a virtually semi-independent polity or political entity. 7. Britain, together with the United States, Japan, and their western allies, withdraw all of their capital from Hong Kong, paralyzing its finances. 8. British capital, led by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Chartered Bank [Standard Chartered Bank] abruptly announce the end of their domicile in Hong Kong, causing great confusion in Hong Kong. 9. Britain and the United States grant passports to anti-Chinese political figures in Hong Kong in support of their activities to oppose China and create chaos in Hong Kong to keep it in turmoil. 10. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities abet and support anti-Chinese political forces in Hong Kong in collusion with Taiwan's anti-communist forces and "Taiwan Independence" forces to pursue activities opposing China and creating chaos in Hong Kong. Reference to Possibility That British Hong Kong Would Deprive SAR Government of Functioning Government Bureaucracy 11. Abetted and controlled by Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities, a large number of civil servants resign or retire early in order to deprive the SAR government of a functioning government bureaucracy. 12. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities manufacture political incidents. Such incidents will be fronted by anti-Chinese hostile forces, which will encourage Hong Kong citizens to go on strike and close up shop so that there is turmoil during the transfer of political power. 13. Britain supports or plans for hostile forces in Hong Kong to engineer violence and conduct assassinations and sabotage with a view to creating chaos in Hong Kong during the transfer of sovereignty, causing foreign capital to leave and the industrial and commercial sectors to divert their funds. 14. During the transition, Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities use their executive and judicial prerogatives to purge, persecute, or threaten patriotic and Hong Kong-loving industrialists and businessmen, middle and high-ranking civil servants, and former or incumbent legislative and executive councillors who do not agree with Britain's violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements between the two countries. 15. During the transition and the transfer of sovereignty, Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to monopolize Hong Kong's finances and rob it of its money under the cover of construction projects, franchises, and contract awards to maintain Britain's economic and financial privileges in Hong Kong for a long time after its withdrawal. Hong Kong Policy Doubted and Questioned by the Military It is surprising that the scenarios "conceived" by the report about Hong Kong's prospects are so horrific and apocalyptic. Communist China has always said that it has the ability to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. However, after Zhongnanhai has played all of its trump cards, the initiative is now in the hands of British Hong Kong. The report stressed specifically that some of the 15 scenarios had occurred during the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, some are continuing, some are being planned, and some are very likely to occur during the transfer of political power. For Communist China, a "small move" by the other side would be enough to dim the luster of the pearl of the Orient. The Hong Kong policy has been severely challenged within the CPC. At first, Communist China adopted a "high-handed" approach, as if once Chris Patten tabled his political reform package to the Legislative Council, the People's Liberation Army [PLA] would immediately "liberate" Hong Kong. However, when Chris Patten's package was tabled to the council, Communist China could not move further.... To deal with inner-party dissatisfaction, especially within the Army, during this two-year period, Qian Qichen attended sessions at the invitation of the PLA deputy group to answer questions. The question put by the PLA deputy group was very candid: "What specific measures does our government's have given Britain's confrontational and noncooperative stance?" Qian Qichen Puts Forward Five Options for Taking Back Hong Kong Qian Qichen was very clever in fielding the question. Unlike previous times when he gave clear-cut answers, he put forward five options, without saying who had the right to decide on which option or providing the basis of the options. Qian Qichen's five options were: 1. Before 1997 or in early 1995, form a SAR government according to the Basic Law and begin work on the changeover -- this is an option for reduced disruption and confrontation with Britain. 2. If the situation changes, the schedule must be advanced to have a basic framework for the SAR government in place by mid-1996, and by then preparations for the SAR should be coming to an end. 3. If the present situation continues and Britain persists in undermining the Sino-British Joint Declaration and negating the agreements between the two governments, the Chinese Government will, at the right time, inform the British Government of the end of its rule in Hong Kong. 4. In case of violent political turmoil and prolonged political strife during the transition or the appearance of an "international political city," "political entity," or "semi-independence" masterminded by British Hong Kong, take action to recover Hong Kong immediately. 5. The National People's Congress Standing Committee has the right to order or authorize necessary measures. Begin Drafting the "Right To Hold Perpetrators Accountable for Past Acts" To Deal With Hong Kong Dissidents There is still more than three years for Communist China to "decide" on a way to take back Hong Kong. There is still time. But already there are signs that to deal with "hostile forces" in Hong Kong, Communist China is going to establish a "right to hold perpetrators accountable for past acts" to "justify" a crackdown on dissidents when sovereignty is safely in its hands. At a seminar held at the Jingxi Guesthouse on 26 March, which was attended by persons-in-charge of the military, armed police, public security, and the militias, the public security and military suggested applying the right to hold perpetrators accountable for their past acts in Hong Kong and Macao. There would be three "retroactive periods:" 1. The period after the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration; 2. After the promulgation of the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law; 3. After Britain unilaterally stopped cooperating in the transition, forcing China to publicize diplomatic documents. Xu Huizi [Central Committee member and deputy chief of PLA General Staff] stressed specifically that the PLA supported and assisted public security and the armed police in maintaining public order in the country and cracking down on hostile forces and elements, including hostile forces and elements based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong and Macao and aimed at overthrowing the Central People's government and the CPC-led socialist system. This is an alarming move. No wonder some mainland people are discussing this matter, saying that the first thing Communist China will do after recovering Hong Kong is to crack down on counterrevolutionaries! Will the tragic "Movement To Suppress Counterrevolutionaries" in the mainland of those years be replayed in Hong Kong?
