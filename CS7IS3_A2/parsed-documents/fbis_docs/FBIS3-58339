The cofounders of the German Communist Party (KPD) were killed by volunteer corps officers in Berlin on 15 January 1919. The demonstrators are marching presently in close rows past the stone monument, inscribed with the words "The dead remind us," and past the graves and placing flowers there. One of the first demonstrators, despite receiving a murder threat at the beginning of the week, was Gregor Gysi, head of the Party of Democratic Socialism's [PDS] Bundestag group. He is accompanied by the PDS Chairman Lothar Bisky and the party's honorary chairman, Hans Modrow. The demonstration was called by Berlin Peace Coordination, a loose association of leftwing parties and organizations as well as environmental and peace groups. Last year around 40,000 people took part in the event. [passage omitted]
