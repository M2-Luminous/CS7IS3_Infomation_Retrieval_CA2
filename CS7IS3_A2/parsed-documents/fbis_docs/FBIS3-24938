He said he could not pre-empt any detailed announcement, but it sufficed to say it was very good news. "It is the type of situation every finance minister dreams of, when all the figures are running in the right direction," he said. Mr Keys was one of a number of ministers and senior party members selected to address the congress on the party's new election manifesto. He said there were three basic differences between the NP and its main opponent, the African National Congress [ANC], on economic policy. Firstly, the NP's policy was for everyone, and not seeking economic growth and advancement of any sector at the expense of another. Secondly, the NP trusted all the economic players -- labour, the farmers, businessmen and entrepreneurs. "We are proud of them," he said. The NP did not want to take away their capital, monitor them or constantly watch to see they were not doing something wrong. Thirdly, he said, the NP government consulted widely and timeously [as received] -- as with the National Economic Forum and other bodies -- before formulating policy or taking action. "These three things represent transparency," he said.
