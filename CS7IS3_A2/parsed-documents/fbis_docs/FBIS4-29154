The chambers of commerce in these countries have been established for nearly a hundred years. Therefore, we need to exchange management and organizational experiences with our colleagues in those countries. We also went there to look for import-export and trading counterparts. [Correspondent] "Despite being very far away from us, the government and people of these Western European countries have sympathized with and lent great material and spiritual support to Vietnam. What is their current understanding and evaluation of the renovation undertaking in Vietnam? Is there anything new in their assistance to Vietnam?" [Doan Duy Thanh] It is possible to say that these countries highly evaluate the Vietnamese renovation. They always say that Vietnam can become a country with a strong economy. They also say that the direction taken by Vietnam is correct. In particular, they highly evaluate our political stability because an economy cannot succeed without political stability. These four countries have enjoyed time-honoured relations with our country. They all want to help us. For example, England is the first country to sponsor their importers and exporters in doing business with Vietnam. France has helped Vietnam a lot in dealing with the Paris Club and the IMF. However, the businessmen in these four countries do not thoroughly understand Vietnam's economic situation. On our trip, we tried to help them with their misgivings by clearly presenting Vietnam's difficulties, problems, and favorable conditions for business. [Correspondent] "Dear comrade, the UK, France, Belgium, and Italy all are developed countries. According to you, what can Vietnam learn from these countries?" [Doan Duy Thanh] Those countries have a lot of experience in business management. They also possess a high level of technology in many areas. They can help us and we can learn from them in the fields of the capital market, business consultancy, the introduction of a share holding system, banking services, auditing, computing, tourism, port and airport management, and so forth. [Correspondent] Could you brief us on the commercial cooperation between Vietnam and those countries and the prospects for that cooperation in the future? [Doan Duy Thanh] Our development has been very good in recent years. Regarding trading, it is possible to say that our goods have penetrated all markets. We spotted Vietnamese goods in France, Italy, Belgium, and the UK. With new favorable conditions, I think Vietnamese goods will definitely do better in the Western European and European Common markets. [Correspondent] "Thank you, comrade."
