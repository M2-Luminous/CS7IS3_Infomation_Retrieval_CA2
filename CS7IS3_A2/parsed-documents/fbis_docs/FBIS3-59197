The announcement was intended to get the stalled wage negotiations moving again, deputy chairman Walter Riester told journalists in Bonn today. He accused employers of "sabotaging" the pay talks. The assumption is not unjustified that some employers want to start a large-scale dispute all over the republic. The legal moratorium on industrial action in the west German metal and electrical industry ends on Friday.
