FR940407-1-00023 FR940407-1-00010 In today's action, the EPA is proposing final approval of the Louisiana emission statement program SIP submittal and invites public comment on the action. The analysis of the Louisiana regulation shows that it adequately addresses all components of an emission statement program. In addition, the State has agreed to provide the EPA with emission statement data for the EPA AIRS through the State's grants commitments and to provide quarterly status reports. The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the Federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 CAAA of November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economical, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Process Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds ( Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S. Ct. 1976; 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). Executive Order 12866 This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table Two and Table Three SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section three of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table Two and Table Three SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on the EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
