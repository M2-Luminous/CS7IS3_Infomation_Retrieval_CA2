He referred to the Israeli arms shipment to the rebels which was recently discovered, which confirms the imperialist double-dealing played by America to delegate one of its allies to play its role. Lt. Gen. al-Bashir told the media and press leaderships at his weekly press briefing session this afternoon, that the rebel movement had lost its credibility as a so-called national movement, as it had become a tool for foreign powers. He put foreign interference as the major obstacle to peace in Sudan. He affirmed that Sudan is still committed to the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development [IGADD] initiative. He also praised the accord among the Somali factions [as heard], expressing Sudan's continued appeals to solve the problem by Somalis, condemning foreign intervention, which had escalated the conflict. Although the Sudanese National Salvation Revolution elements are clean and honest, yet the attorney general had directed immediate action to be taken on any corruption complaint. Lt. Gen. al-Bashir warned the rumormongers of the negative impacts of their foul deeds.
