"I appeal to you in the name of the employees of the military hospital," writes trade-union member Yaroslav Mykhaylovych Salabay. "The approach of paydays in the last few months has caused discontent, nervousness and various types of discussions and gossip among people. That is because no one knows whether they will be paid the proper wages on time or not. "Whereas the pay used to be delayed only a few days, in September we were paid on the 18th of the month instead of the 5th or 6th. The same thing happened in October. More than half of it went by, and the pay had still not been issued. And that is while the latest price increases were occurring. People were left without money, without the means of existence. "The hospital employees have a natural question for the finance workers: How much longer will this go on? This is a mockery of the people. Matters have gotten so bad that the patients are not getting food, since the hospital has nothing with which to pay the stores..." Letters with similar content, as you know, are being sent to other places besides the central publishing organ of the Ministry if Defense. Many of them have arrived directly at the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, so the editors of NARODNA ARMIYA appealed directly to the Chief of the Finance Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Major-General Ivan Shtopenko, with the request to comment on the situation that has taken shape lately with the payment of monetary sustenance to the servicemen, as well as wages to the employees, of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The profound socio-economic crisis that has struck the state has hit first and foremost the least well-protected segments of the population; among whom, notwithstanding the host of legislation that has been passed, are the servicemen and the members of their families. The Ministry of Defense, owing to the insufficient receipts to the state treasury, is being financed only allowing for the available resources of the state budget. The financial status of the Armed Forces of Ukraine remains extraordinarily difficult and critical under those conditions. The troops were financed in 13 increments in November alone. But even these crumbs actually arrived at the recipients through the banks only after delays of up to two weeks. The National Bank made the decision back in July to strengthen monitoring of the trustworthiness of bank documents. Wire receipts of monetary sums (and that is how we send them to the troops for the sake of speed) were to be confirmed by the payer bank therein, and the funds transferred to the military units only after the receipt of the appropriate confirmation. There are cases where there have been good profits from dishonest transactions. All of this has led to the fact that the servicemen and employees of the armed forces were paid late at some garrisons for October--November. And it will be even harder to provide people with the money they are due for December with this sort of financing for the armed forces. This is intolerable. The servicemen and employees should receive everything due to them on time and in full. I do not want to be less than straightforward. There are no funds to pay for food, fuels and lubricants, or municipal and other services, owing to which a number of military compounds have been cut off from sources of everyday support. The employees of the military repair enterprises, whom we are unable to pay for repairs performed on hardware and military property, are at the brink of a social explosion along with the military units. The command of the military districts and branches of the armed forces, the chiefs of garrisons, units commanders and certain subunits, entirely naturally, are also appealing personally to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and to the Finance Directorate to rectify the situation as soon as possible, and provide temporary financial assistance in this truly hopeless situation. It must be stated that both the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and the Finance Directorate are well aware of the situation that has resulted. Everything possible is being done to eliminate the tensions in the military collectives, and to instill order in monetary support for the servicemen and employees of the armed forces. The Minister of Defense of Ukraine has personally met with the highest leaders of the state several times, and appeals have been sent over his signature to the President of Ukraine, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, the acting Prime Minister of Ukraine and the chairman of the board of the National Bank of Ukraine setting forth the situation that has taken shape with financing for the armed forces, and warning of the rise in social tensions among the military and civilian collectives. The commanders of units, the socio-psychological service and the finance bodies are exerting a great deal of effort to explain to servicemen that this is a temporary difficulty, but the measures that are being implemented are not finding understanding among the personnel, since the situation is repeated every month. Many servicemen are filing requests for discharge from the armed forces, since they cannot provide for their families. Not to mention those without apartments, who are unable to pay for their temporary spots. As bitter as it may be to read these telegrams, what can you do--they are the truth. I repeat once again that the Ministry of Defense is doing everything possible to ease the situation with the financing for the troops. It must be frankly stated that the ministry has no money. Everything that is received from the State Budget is sent to its recipients immediately. The president and government of Ukraine, despite the difficult economic situation in the country, have made a very important and vitally necessary decision pertaining to the social protection of servicemen and the members of their families--to provide food rations for the servicemen of the armed forces and their military formations created in accordance with legislation, starting on 1 October of this year. And that is good support for the families of servicemen in today's difficult situation. The pay for servicemen has been tripled overall starting 1 December. That is now the fourth increase this year. There is thus no reason to lose faith in improvements in the situation, both in Ukraine as a whole and in the armed forces in particular. We are relying on the fact that the state will not leave its defenders without assistance in this difficult time for all the people, the more so as we are receiving proper support on most issues from the president, the government and the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine.
