The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 800-word editorial entitled "Lessons Two Years After the North-South Agreement." The editorial reports "it is natural that the government has set the exchange of special envoys as a precondition for U.S.-North Korean talks," referring to the government's decision to announce the conditional suspension of the Team Spirit exercise when the exchange, as well as International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections, are made. The editorial suggests that North Korea may use the exchange of special envoys to approach the United States. The editorial notes that North Korea was not interested in implementing the 4 July North-South joint statement and the 19 December North-South basic agreement. Noting North Korea's insincere and capricious attitude toward South Korea, the editorial indicates "it is regrettable that the government assumes an ambiguous position toward North Korea's nuclear issue." The editorial concludes that "the government must make North Korea aware that the Team Spirit exercise will be suspended and that the third U.S.-North Korean talks may be possible only if practical dialogues -- such as the discussion of simultaneous inspection of the North and South, the holding of summit talks, and exchange and cooperation between the North and South -- are held through the exchange of special envoys." The moderate Seoul KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Where Is the Spirit of Agreement?" Referring to the significance and background of the North-South agreement and to the government's effort to implement it, the editorial reports that the South has allowed Yi In-mo to reunite with his family in the North and that it has proposed to the North side to establish a location in Panmunjom where separated family members can meet. The editorial adds that North Korea should respond to the North- South dialogue and the exchange of special envoys if it decides to accept the nuclear inspections. The left-leaning Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 an 1,000-word editorial entitled "The Government Must Exercise its Right to Participate in Resolving the Nuclear Issue." The editorial notes that "in a meeting of unification-related ministries on 17 February, the government decided to respond to North Korea's acceptance of IAEA nuclear inspections." The editorial reports this decision eased the people's worry about the North Korean nuclear issue. The editorial stresses that the government is very interested in realizing the exchange of special envoys, referring to President Kim Yong-sam's letter to U.S. President Clinton emphasizing the importance of progress in the North-South dialogue for the complete settlement of the nuclear issue. Noting the possibility of North Korea's active participation in the future North-South dialogue to realize the third U.S.-North Korean talks, the editorial reports that "the government should exercise its right to participate in an issue related to the fate of the nation, such as the North Korean nuclear issue." The independent moderate Seoul MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "The Government's Ability To Deal With the Korean Peninsula Issue." The editorial notes that the government should properly formulate a reunification policy in view of the recent changes in the international community and the complicated situation surrounding the Korean peninsula. Noting the people's attention to the government's reunification policy, the editorial reports that the North and South are the parties concerned in the reunification issue, even though they need cooperation from the United States and Japan. The editorial concludes that economic cooperation will hasten national reunification and points out the need to make plans for economic cooperation.
