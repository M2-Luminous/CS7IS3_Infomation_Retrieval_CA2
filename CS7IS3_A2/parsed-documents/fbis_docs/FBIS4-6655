JCCI Chairman Kosaku Inaba told reporters that the economic condition is neither improving nor worsening. Inaba said the prolonged political uncertainties, recent hikes in public utility rates and the yen's appreciation against the dollar could affect an economic recovery. He expressed concern over a delay in the selection of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's successor and called for urgent efforts to form a new cabinet and expedite Diet approval of the government budget for fiscal 1994, which started April 1.
