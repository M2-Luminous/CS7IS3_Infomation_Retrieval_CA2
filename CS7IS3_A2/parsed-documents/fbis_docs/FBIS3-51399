Thus said Francisco Duran Harvey, member of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] national secretariat, in a speech at a meeting with Granma Province's main union cadres on the possible measures to be implemented in order to streamline Cuba's internal finances. Duran stressed that this is a process of great importance and political significance that requires us to close ranks without first requiring all workers to think the same way; and it is necessary for union cadres to be prepared with convincing arguments and views. [Begin Duran recording] Therefore, this is not just one more battle. At the National Assembly, Fidel insisted strongly that we had to get the measures implemented once we got the workers to understand. He said we could not win that battle without the workers. He said it clearly, very clearly. Therefore, all of us have to engage in this battle, and we have to work intelligently to win it. Because even after applying the measures, we will not have solved the problems. The measures are just a one path toward the solution. And it was said very clearly here that the problems of efficiency and fulfillment of our basic economic objectives play a decisive role. And, like people say, we must encourage people to make suggestions, encourage people to make recommendations. At the assembly the other day in La Corona, there were workers who stated that work discipline has deteriorated but that one cannot speak of a generalized deterioration as there was no deterioration of discipline in repairing the mills, because the people made an extraordinary effort. We have a great tendency to generalize concepts. We must talk about whether there is deterioration in work discipline, but we cannot talk about this in a general manner. We must get down to particulars. And when I am in a work group, I have to speak, express myself graphically, and then there will be no problems. [end recording] You have just heard Francisco Duran Harvey, member of the CTC national secretariat, who made these statements in the city of Bayamo regarding the assembly process entitled Parliament in Our Work Place, which is aimed at having the workers reflect on implementing measures to streamline our internal finances.
