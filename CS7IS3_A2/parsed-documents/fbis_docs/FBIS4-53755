We notice an improvement, particularly after the person (Andrew Neil, editor of THE SUNDAY TIMES) who started such reports, had been transferred, he said Sunday. We will see whether his transfer will bring about a drastic difference in the (British media) reports, he told reporters at the airport after welcoming back Malaysia's badminton team which participated in the Thomas Cup tournament in Jakarta. Malaysia lost 0-3 to Indonesia. Neil, 44, has been seconded to New York from next month to launch a current affairs programme of the Fox Television Network. He will be the executive editor of the new programme for seven months. Replying to a question, Dr. Mahathir said the government would wait a while before deciding whether to offer contracts again to British firms because it wanted to ensure that the British media truly stopped its allegations against Malaysia.
