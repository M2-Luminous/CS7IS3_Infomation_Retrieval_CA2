Previously President Yeltsin sent a note to Vladimir Shumeyko, which expressed hope that the Federation Council would manage to prepare the text of the treaty for signing. Yeltsin appealed to "the wisdom of deputies and their understanding of common responsibility before Russian citizens." Academician Boris Topornin, official representative of the Russian president and co-chairman of the public chamber, told the deputies that the draft treaty was the result of collective work and was approved by the majority of members of the working group, which prepared it. "The provisions, that contradict each other, were not included in the text, because it is going to be a document of concord," he explained. Topornin stressed that the country cannot overcome the economic crisis without political stability. Authors of the draft treaty wanted it to be "neither a party, or group document, but a document reflecting common interests." The treaty will neither amend nor replace the Constitution and other legal acts. According to Topornin, the item on responsibility for the non- fulfilment of the treaty was removed from the draft document, because "it cannot be based on enforcement and sanctions... Public control and the attitude of the population to it are the most reliable guarantee of its fulfilment," Topornin said.
