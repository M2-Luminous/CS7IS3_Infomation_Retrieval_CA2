FR940222-1-00026 FR940222-1-00007 (2) The cost of all of the services furnished nationwide as a result of the particular NCD represents at least 0.1 percent of the USPCC multiplied by the total number of Medicare beneficiaries nationwide for the applicable calendar year. (We would actuarially determine the significant cost of an NCD and include that information in the formal notice of the decison). In section IV, below, we discuss our reasoning for proposing these thresholds for significant cost. B. Range of Services Furnished by HMOs and CMPs In §417.414 Qualifying condition: Range of services, we would redesignate paragraph (b)(4), concerning selection of practitioners, as paragraph (b)(3) of §417.416 (which deals with furnishing of services and is thus a more appropriate location than ``Range of services''), and add to §417.414 a new paragraph (b)(4) to specify that a risk HMO or CMP is not required to furnish an NCD service until the contract year beginning after the next per capita rate announcement if all of the following conditions apply: •HCFA has determined and announced that the NCD service meets the definition of ``significant cost.'' •The cost of that service was not included in the determination of the per capita rate of payment that HCFA pays the HMO or CMP. •The NCD that established coverage of the service was issued on or after the date of the announcement of the per capita rate of payment for that contract year. Starting with the beginning of the next contract year, the HMO or CMP would be responsible for furnishing or paying for the NCD service. We considered that these proposed revisions could have an adverse effect on the ability of the risk HMO or CMP to manage the enrollee's health care, but believe the changes are required by the wording of the statute. C. Deductible and Coinsurance Amounts We would amend §417.452, which deals with Medicare enrollees' liability for Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts_ •To clarify that the HMO or CMP may reduce these charges under the ``additional benefits'' provision in §417.440(b)(4)(i); and •To provide exemption from deductibles for ``significant cost'' NCD services that the risk HMO or CMP is not required to furnish, regardless of whether the service is furnished by the HMO or CMP or obtained by the enrollee from another source.
