ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland. This revision revises definitions and provisions to Maryland's air pollution emergency episode plan requirements. The intended effect of this action is to incorporate by reference into the federally-enforceable SIP revised State regulations which meet current Federal requirements. This action is being taken under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. DATES: This final rule will become effective June 13, 1994 unless notice is received on or before May 16, 1994 that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Thomas J. Maslany, Director, Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107; Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and the Maryland Department of the Environment, 2500 Broening Highway, Baltimore Maryland 21224. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Harold A. Frankford, (215) 597- 1325. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 7, 1990, the State of Maryland submitted a formal revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP). The SIP revision consists of amendments to Code of Maryland Administrative Regulations (COMAR) 26.11.05 governing air pollution episode emergency plans. The amended provisions, which are applicable Statewide, are summarized below: 1. COMAR 26.11.05.01A.&hyph;Definition of ``Air Stagnation Advisory (ASA)'' (added) 2. COMAR 26.11.05.01B.&hyph;Definition of ``Atmospheric stagnation'' (modified) 3. COMAR 26.11.05.01H.&hyph;Definition of ``Pollutant Standards Index (PSI)'' (added) 4. COMAR 26.11.05.01J.&hyph;Definition of ``Special Dispersion Statement (SDS)'' (added) 5. Deletion of the definition of ``Coefficient of haze.'' 6. COMAR 26.11.05.02B.,.02C.&hyph;Administrative changes making clear that the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) Secretary's designee is empowered to declare conditions of air pollution designated as Standby Watch, Health Advisory, Alert, Warning, or Emergency. 7. COMAR 26.11.05.03A.,B, D.&hyph;Air Pollution Episode Criteria Administrative changes similar to those made in COMAR 26.11.05.02B. and C. Replacement of forecast stage with a standby watch stage and a health advisory stage. 8. COMAR 26.11.05.05A.&hyph;Control Requirements and Standby Orders. Administrative changes. Replacement of forecast stage with a standby watch stage and a health advisory stage. 9. COMAR 26.11.05.05B. through D.&hyph;administrative changes to broaden the definition of ``incineration'' in that so that the specific term ``refuse'' is deleted. The current SIP requires activation of episode plans either: (1) When air stagnations are forecasted; or (2) air pollutant concentrations reach Alert Stage levels. However, revisions are necessitated to correct situations where the applicable regulations did not require air pollution emergency episode plans to be activated, despite the fact that violations of the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) had been recorded, but neither of the above conditions were met. To correct this situation, Maryland has instituted a revised system for activating air pollution episode plans before air quality actually becomes unhealthful. The Forecast Stage has been replaced: (1) A Standby Watch Stage which will be triggered when the PSI reaches a level of 83 (i.e., monitored air quality concentrations reach 83 percent of the applicable National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS); and (2) a Health Advisory Stage which will be treated whenever the PSI reaches a level of 100 (i.e., there is a monitored violation of the NAAQS). Maryland may also issue an SDS for situations where forecasted atmospheric stagnations are expected to last between 12 and 36 hours. Maryland may also issue an ASA where atmospheric stagnations are expected to last more than 36 hours, and is required to make a public announcement within two hours of such declaration. (COMAR 26.11.05.03B.(1)(c).) The revisions to COMAR 26.11.05 have a limited impact on the attainment and maintenance of standards. The purpose of emergency episode plans is to ensure that in the event of unhealthy air quality, there are SIP-enforceable provisions which can be activated so as to minimize the exacerbation of unhealthy air quality levels (i.e., air quality levels in excess of the NAAQS) through the activation of emergency control measures. The removal of the term ``refuse'' in the context of incineration is consistent with requirements prescribed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix L regarding the curtailment of incinerator use when invoking air pollution emergency episode plans. The prescribed requirements in appendix L call for curtailment of all incinerator use regardless of the type of material being burned. The revised requirements which replace the Forecast Stage still conform with the triggering levels and lengths of air stagnation episodes prescribed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix L. In addition, the revised threshold levels for NO 2 , PM 10 , and ozone also conform with those prescribed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix L. Similarly, the removal of the COH threshold levels is also consistent with EPA's view that COH measurements do not reflect the best means of measuring combined SO 2 and PM 10 levels. Currently, there is no requirement in either 40 CFR part 51, subpart H or 40 CFR part 51, appendix L which requires States to have COH threshold levels in their respective air pollution emergency episode plans. EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective June 13, 1994 unless, by May 16, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on June 13, 1994. Final Action EPA is approving the amendments to COMAR 26.11.05 described above as a revision to the Maryland SIP. The Agency has also reviewed this SIP revision request for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 amendments enacted on November 15, 1990, and has determined that this action conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by [Insert date 60 days from date of publication]. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action regarding EPA's approval of revisions to Maryland's air pollution emerency episode requirements (COMAR 26.11.05) may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.
