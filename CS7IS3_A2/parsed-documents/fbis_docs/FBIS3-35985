They believe that it is the wrong moment in time to pay attention to this unstable Transcaucasian state. Experts believe that signing a treaty between Russia and Georgia in the situation when problems of the North Caucasus have not been resolved may provoke a conflict between the executive and the lawmakers in Russia. Most deputies of the lower chamber will vote down the ratification of such a treaty.
