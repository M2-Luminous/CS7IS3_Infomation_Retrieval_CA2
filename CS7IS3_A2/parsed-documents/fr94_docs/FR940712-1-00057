FR940712-1-00057 FR940712-1-00012 3. Rent for cable television will be based on total basic subscribers as reported by the holder. 4. Rent for rebroadcast devices will be based on the U.S. census population of the principal community identified in the FCC license that is served by the transmitter. The following examples are provided to illustrate how the base rent for a broadcast use would be calculated. A television facility in Clark County, Nevada, principally serving the communities of Las Vegas (pop. 258,259), North Las Vegas (pop. 47,707), Henderson (pop. 64,942), and Boulder City (pop. 12,567) would pay a proposed annual rental of $16,000 per year. This is based on total population of the principal communities of 370,908. An FM radio facility in Imperial County, California, principally serves El Centro (pop. 31,384), Yuma, Arizona (pop. 106,895), and San Luis Rio Colorado, Mexico (pop. 76,684). The annual rent would be calculated based on the total population of the communities. The proposed annual rent would be $4,000 per year, based on the population of its principal communities of 214,983. The rent for nonbroadcast uses_commercial mobile radio service, private mobile communication, cellular telephone, common carrier microwave, private microwave, facility manager and miscellaneous uses_will be assessed on a different basis. Rent will be based on county population where the transmitter is located or the population of an adjacent or nearby county served by the transmitter, whichever is greater. The following examples are provided to illustrate how the base rent for nonbroadcast uses would be calculated. The proposed rent for a right-of-way holder owning a facility in Pershing County, Nevada, (pop. 4,436) primarily used for common carrier microwave would be assessed $1,500. A commercial mobile radio service facility in Madison County, Idaho (23,674), serving the Idaho Falls community in Bonneville County, Idaho (72,207), would be assessed a proposed rent of $1,500. Since the transmitter serves a trade area that is predominately in the adjacent county, the Bonneville County population would be used to determine the rental payment. A holder owning a commercial mobile radio service facility used primarily to provide mobile radio service in the San Diego County (pop. 2,498,016) market would pay a proposed rent of $12,000.
