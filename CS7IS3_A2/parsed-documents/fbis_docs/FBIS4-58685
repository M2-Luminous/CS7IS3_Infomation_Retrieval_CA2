These are false rumors. The responsible source described this report as not only completely devoid of truth, but as coming within the framework of the psychological war launched by the media circus of the bloody gang of al-Ahmar family against the sons of our people and their valiant armed forces. The source confirmed that units of the martyr Ba Suhayb Brigade are still waging heroic battles with all their valour and daring. They are confronting with sheer bravery the multitudes of the forces of conspiracy, treachery, and treason. The source concluded his statement, saying: If there is talk about surrender or flight, then this is occurring on the side of the forces that lie under the control of the Sanaa adventurist, secessionist clique, and in the interest [as heard] of the forces of unity, democracy, and (?refinement).
