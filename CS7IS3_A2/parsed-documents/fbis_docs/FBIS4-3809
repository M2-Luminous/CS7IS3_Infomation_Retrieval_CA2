Speaking on the Television France 1 this evening, Balladur stressed that China is a country with which "good relations should be maintained." However, he added that before his visit to China earlier this month, relations between France and China "had not been very good." But political dialogues with the Chinese leaders were resumed during his visit, he said, adding that his visit was thus "a success from this point of view." He expressed indignation at certain French journalists who gave a distorting picture of his visit. The French prime minister visited China from April 7 to 11.
