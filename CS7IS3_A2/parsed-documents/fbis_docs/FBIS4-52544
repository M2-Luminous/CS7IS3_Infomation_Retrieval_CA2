FBIS4-52544 "dreas091_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 North Korea Repatriation of Korean War POW's Urged Repatriation of Korean War POW's Urged SK1005112394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1041 GMT 10 May 94 SK1005112394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- Kang Yong-hun, president of the South Korean puppet Red Cross, in his "Address on the World Red Cross Day" on May 9 turned down again the North's demand for the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, alleging that "they are not prisoners of war to be repatriated", a radio report from Seoul said. This is an unreasonable attitude casting a chill on the public opinion at home and abroad calling for their repatriation. They were taken prisoners by a bewligerent party during the Korean war, while serving the People's Army and the guerrilla unit. So, they should have been sent back to the North when POWs were exchanged right after the ceasefire. Kang Yong-hun's remarks are a far-fetched argument and a wanton violation of international law. Still more serious is that he brought forward the issue of the return of the crew of the ship "Tongjin" who were captured when they infiltrated into the waters of the North for espionage. The issue has nothing to do with the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se- hwan. Their repatriation is an issue on POWs. So, the two issues are quite different from each other. The South Korean puppet clique are obliged to immediately send ohem back to the North both from the view of the international law and humanitarianism. The Kim Yong-sam group must immediately send them back to the North where their families and relatives are living, as required by international law and public opinion at home and abroad, instead of blocking their repatriation by raising unjustifiable conditions.
