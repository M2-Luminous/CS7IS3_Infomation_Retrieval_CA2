This was confirmed by last week's explosion in Snezhinsk nuclear center in the Urals [on 13 May] that injured two of the center's workers. In the opinion of the center's leadership, the incident was caused by the unstable psychological state of the creators of Russia's nuclear weapons. This is occurring because of the extremely tense situation that has arisen in the sector. The state's debts to the Urals' nuclear workers are now approaching 30 billion rubles. This has virtually caused nuclear research to come to a halt. The leaders of the federal nuclear center have again called on the country's government to change their attitude to the nuclear complex.
