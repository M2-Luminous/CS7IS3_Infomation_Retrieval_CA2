He also said there is an urgent need to democratize labor unions.

The debate will take place at Federal Electoral Institute Headquarters. PRD leader Porfirio Munoz Ledo said: "Del Villar has a knowledge of the issues -- legal as well as technical knowledge -- and, therefore, we hope he can demonstrate what is evident: the fact that enormous errors exist in the electoral register."
