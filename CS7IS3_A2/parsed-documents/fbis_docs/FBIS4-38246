A black cloud drifted over Aden from the burning refinery 18 kilometers (11 miles) to the west. Journalists could not reach it because the road has been cut by fighting, but could see the fire from here. A southern military spokesman said the refinery was attacked by two northern warplanes, while hospital officials said eight civilians were killed and 41 wounded in air raids and shelling of northern suburbs and other districts. Buildings trembled from the pounding of artillery fire. Oil storage tanks at the refinery were set ablaze three weeks ago after a northern raid, officials here said. Northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih have been trying to capture the refinery since they entered the western suburbs for the first time on Saturday, cutting off the road to the refinery. Northern troops were also in control of Bir Nasr', 15 kilometres (nine miles) from Aden, where the city's only water pumping station is sited. Aden residents have suffered severe water and gasoline shortages since the north's advance into the city's suburbs. [passage omitted]
