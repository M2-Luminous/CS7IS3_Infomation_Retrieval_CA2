The workers are for Medicins Sans Frontiers, Concern, and the International Red Cross. The government now says at least 200 people have been killed in Cuito in the past five days. UNITA had told news agencies it would declare a unilateral truce in the area. There has been no confirmation whether one is in force. Peace talks in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, which were adjourned last week to allow participants to attend the funeral of the late Ivorian leader Felix Houphouet-Boigny are expected to resume shortly. Both sides have said they do not expect the latest outbreak of fighting to have any effect on the negotiations.
