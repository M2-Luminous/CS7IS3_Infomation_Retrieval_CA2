FR940405-1-00109 FR940405-1-00013 OSHA assumed that the labor costs for the trainer and preparation time are approximately equal to 25 percent of the trainee's wage cost during the session. OSHA also assumed that 50 percent of the workers will require such training. The cost equation for maintenance workers training is as follows: C t =N m ×P m ×W m ×T m where C t =the cost of training of maintenance workers N m =the number of maintenance workers 10 10 The number of maintenance workers is based on BLS's Occupational Employment Statistics survey of 1992 and includes all maintenance workers who perform work involving two or more maintenance skills to keep machines, mechanical equipment, or structure of an establishment in repair. P m =the percentage of existing compliance as estimated by OSHA (50 percent) W m =the hourly compensation wage rate for maintenance workers ($10.95) T m =one-half hour of maintenance worker time plus 7.5 minutes for trainer cost (37.5 minutes) The total cost of training is estimated at $6.84 per maintenance worker for a half hour program. Table VI&hyph;11, presents OSHA's estimate for the number of maintenance workers needing training and the associated costs. The annualized first year cost is estimated at $0.5 million. It was assumed that job changes within establishments or buildings will require retraining. The annual new hire cost is estimated at $0.8 million, based upon industry turnover rates. Thus OSHA estimated annualized cost training to be $1.3 million. The proposed standard requires employers to inform all employees of the contents of the standard and its appendices. This could be accomplished by posting the proposed standard at a bulletin board; therefore, OSHA did not include a cost for this provision. (d) Compliance with Related Standards. The proposed standard requires employees performing work on HVAC systems to comply with several existing OSHA standards and therefore any costs associated with compliance with this provision have already been considered. This requirement is necessary to protect employees from exposure to indoor air pollutants and exposure to noise. This provision is considered to have a de minimus effect on all industries and OSHA believes that establishments are in full compliance with this requirement. (e) Air Contaminant-Environmental Tobacco Smoke. The primary objective of the tobacco smoke provision is to eliminate the nonsmoker's exposure to ETS. Under the proposed rule, firms will have the option of either banning smoking of tobacco products or permitting smoking only in designated areas. OSHA recognizes that not all establishments will make available designated smoking areas as there may be physical constraints on the option of providing separate ventilation. Such constraints are imposed by the building's design, the building's mechanical ventilation system's capabilities, by costs involved in providing adequate ventilation, by the occupant use of the building. In some cases, establishments located in severe climate zones may find it necessary to protect their smoking employees from weather exposure by providing designated smoking areas.
