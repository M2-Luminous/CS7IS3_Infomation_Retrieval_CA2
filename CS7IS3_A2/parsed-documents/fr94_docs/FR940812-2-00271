FR940812-2-00271 FR940812-2-00101 Trade Policy Staff Committee; Generalized System of Preferences (GSP); Review of GSP Benefits Lost by Thailand in 1989 AGENCY: Office of the United States Trade Representative. ACTION: Notice and solicitation of public comment. SUMMARY: In 1989, Thailand lost some GSP benefits following a determination that Thailand does not provide adequate and effective intellectual property right protection. The purpose of this notice is: (1) to announce the initiation of a review process to consider whether any of the GSP benefits that were lost by Thailand should be restored; and (2) to solicit public comments on the restoration of such benefits. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: GSP Subcommittee, Office of the United States Trade Representative, 600 17th Street, NW., room 517, Washington, DC 20506. The telephone number is (202) 395&hyph;6971. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On January 19, 1989, President Reagan determined, pursuant to sections 502 and 504 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2462 and 2464), that Thailand does not fully provide adequate and effective means to secure, exercise and enforce exclusive rights in intellectual property (54 Federal Register 3573). Accordingly, the President: (1) denied a competitive need limit waiver; (2) revoked four competitive need limit waivers; (3) imposed reduced competitive need limits to certain specified articles; and (4) established a policy that future requests for competitive need limit waivers for Thai products would not be considered until Thailand provides adequate and effective intellectual property right (IPR) protection. As a result of the 1989 determination, Thailand became ineligible for GSP treatment on articles in the following subheadings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS): HTS subheading 0713.31.40␣mung beans HTS subheading 1102.30.00␣rice flour HTS subheading 1103.14.00␣rice meal HTS subheading 6702.90.65␣artificial flowers HTS subheading 6908.10.20␣ceramic tile HTS subheading 7113.11.20␣jewelry HTS subheading 7113.11.50␣jewelry HTS subheading 7113.19.50␣jewelry HTS subheading 7113.20.50␣jewelry HTS subheading 9401.40.00␣seats HTS subheading 9401.61.60␣seats HTS subheading 9401.69.80␣seats HTS subheading 9403.30.80␣wooden office furniture HTS subheading 9403.40.90␣wooden kitchen furniture HTS subheading 9403.50.90␣wooden bedroom furniture HTS subheading 9403.60.80␣other wooden furniture II. GSP Review for Thailand On July 20, 1994, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor announced that USTR would initiate a review process to determine whether any of the GSP benefits that Thailand lost in 1989 should be restored because of progress by the Government of Thailand on IPR protection. This notice formally announces the initiation of a review process to determine whether Thailand's eligibility for GSP treatment for the products in these HTS subheadings should be restored. The decision on whether to restore any GSP benefits to Thailand will be based on the requirements of the GSP law, Title V of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2461 et seq. ), and on Thai progress on IPR protection, including the final passage of a copyright act that is consistent with international standards, the creation of an IPR court and the rapid implementation of Thai obligations under the Uruguay Round intellectual property agreements (TRIPs). III. Public Comments Interested parties are invited to submit comments regarding the restoration of the GSP benefits for Thailand that are described above. Comments must be submitted in 14 copies, in English, to the Chairman of the GSP Subcommittee, Trade Policy Staff Committee, 600 17th Street, NW., room 517, Washington, DC 20506.

Information and comments submitted regarding Thailand's lost GSP benefits will be subject to public inspection by appointment with the staff of the USTR Public Reading Room, except for information granted ``business confidential'' status pursuant to 15 CFR 2003.6 and 2007.7.
