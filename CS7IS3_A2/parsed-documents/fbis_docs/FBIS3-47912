According to a report, the South Korean puppets, on the premise that a missing military secret document might be handed over to the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon] through South Korean students studying in Japan, launched an investigation. Timed to coincide with this, the Japanese reactionaries loudly talk about the export of a spectrum analyzer that can be converted to military use, including upgrading the precision of hitting targets and the possibility of using it in our missiles. They also spread a rumor through the media that the Japanese Police Department suspects that a Kanagawa Prefecture-based trading company, specializing in deals between Tokyo and Pyongyang, exported the spectrum analyzer. This is another premeditated and intentional fabrication of the South Korean puppets and Japanese reactionaries, who are experts in smear campaigns and who say black is white and report what is not existent as existent. Claiming that a military secret document that was sent to a national assemblyman of the United People's Party disappeared, the puppets launched an investigation of relevant figures. During a press interview, however, this assemblyman said that he did not know that such a document was sent from the Ministry of National Defense [MND] nor was he aware of a request to return the document. He noted that when the Defense Security Command requested his signature on the document of conclusion of investigation, he refused to sign because there was no reason for this. He added that the MND's hasty announcement of the incident is suspicious. Assuming that the lost document might be handed over to Chongnyon, the puppets preposterously attempted to link this with us. This fact alone shows how foolish and ugly this smear campaign is. That the Japanese reactionaries slandered us and Chongnyon by talking about the export of a spectrum analyzer and a possibility of its use is indeed ridiculous. The fact illustrates that the South Korean puppets and Japanese reactionaries, just as they frantically ran amok with anti-Republic commotions on the pretext of our fictitious so-called nuclear problem, conspired the current smear campaign in collusion. Then, why did the South Korean puppets and Japanese reactionaries spread a new rumor on suspicion, which can convince no one, by slandering us and Chongnyonm who have nothing to do with this? As is known to all, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique and Japanese reactionaries have persistently maneuvered to block the progress in the DPRK-U.S. talks by spreading a rumor on suspicion of our fictitious nuclear weapons development. On the pretext of suspicion of our nuclear development, they also pursue an aim to accelerate their own nuclear armament. Our peaceful nuclear policy has been proven to be innocent as time passes, while the criminal nature of their anticommunist smear campaign has been more clearly revealed. In particular, in the DPRK-U.S. contact held in New York at the end of 1993, the two sides agreed to hold the third round of talks and to settle in a package [ilgwal tagyol] the issues for essential solution of the nuclear issue. As a result, a breakthrough was opened for progress in the talks that were deadlocked. Embarrassed by this, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique and Japanese reactionaries are attempting to block the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost by bringing forward a nuclear and missile threat and by fabricating a rumor on a new suspicion. In addition, they are pursuing a sinister purpose of alienating Chongnyon from us and of working out a new pretext for repression of Chongnyon. Such a foolish fabrication drama cannot convince anyone. Rather, this will only reveal their ugly nature more clearly. The rascals can gain nothing from an anti-Republic smear campaign. The South Korean puppets and Japanese reactionaries should abandon sinister aims and immediately stop this anti-Republic smear campaign.
