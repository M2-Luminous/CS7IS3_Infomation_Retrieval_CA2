During the interview, Panov stated that in recent phone talks (held on 13 June), both the U.S. and Russian Presidents shared the view that the holding of an international conference of both North and South Korea, the United States, Russia, China, Japan, and others "could be the last chance" for riding out the current crisis. His remarks indicate the Russian Government has great confidence in being able to realize the international meeting, amid the unusual situation in which North Korea announced withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Touching on the UN Security Council resolution expected to be adopted soon, Panov stated: "The holding of an international meeting and sanctions against the DPRK would be incorporated into the resolution as equal (options)." He also said both Presidents share the common view that "the implementation of sanctions are inevitable" if the international meeting does not take place due to North Korea's refusal or other reasons. In considering North Korea's menacing remark in its statement of withdrawal from the IAEA that it will view the exercise of United Nations' sanctions "as a declaration of war," Panov stated: "The possibility cannot be ruled out" that North Korean special forces "will go into sporadic armed conflict and acts of provocation" against nations participating sanctions, including the United States, South Korea, as well as Japan. On the other hand, he indicated that North Korea does not have the capability to perform full-fledged advance operations to break through the well-defended demilitarized zone (DMZ), in view of the country's economic difficulties and the actual situation regarding its military equipment.
