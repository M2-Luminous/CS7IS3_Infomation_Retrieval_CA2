During a 15-minute meeting, Kakizawa told Tang that the Japanese Government would work hard for the development of Sino-Japanese relations, while reflecting on and atoning for Japan's past atrocities. He referred to the resignation of Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano who publicly denied last month that the former Imperial Japanese Army committed the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in which many Chinese were killed. Tang said the Chinese Government appreciated the "wise attitude" adopted by the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata over its perception of the past. Hata criticized Nagano for making the remarks and said Japan "inflicted unbearable pain and suffering on many people" in Asia during the war. The visiting Chinese delegation headed by Tang is here for the 13rd round of regular consultations between the Foreign Ministries of the two countries. On Wednesday [1 June], Tang and his Japanese counterpart Hiroshi Fukuda, who is leading the Japanese team, at a working level meeting discussed the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and other international affairs.
