If Only We Knew What It Will Entail..."] [Text] According to KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA's information, Boris Yeltsin intends to sign within the next few days a decision on a further increase in the salaries of servicemen in the Russian Armed Forces -- by 50 percent, so it is supposed. One could only congratulate officers and generals in this connection, if it were not for one "but." This is not the first time the president has demonstrated his concern for the Army. But, by a strange coincidence, similar decisions have hitherto been adopted on the eve of a possible exacerbation of the political situation in the country. For example, before the referendum of April 1993, when the troops were paid "arrears" of pay and more than 150 generalships were conferred on top officers. The situation was repeated shortly before the president's "strategic fall offensive," when the Ministry of Finance suddenly and "unexpectedly" paid servicemen the salaries for July-September, which had been delayed, with a coefficient of 1.8. At the time, comments appeared in newspapers in this connection, and there was talk of a special plan to influence the Army and a desire to boost its loyalty to the authorities on the eve of important political events.
