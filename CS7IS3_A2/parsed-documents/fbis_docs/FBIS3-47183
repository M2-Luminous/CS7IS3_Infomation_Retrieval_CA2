We cannot have a Japan-U.S. summit that is satisfactory to us unless the Hosokawa administration works not only on the political reform but also on the economic issues as well." It is the first time for a senior White House official to explain severe prospects of the summit talks, which will be held about one month later. Clearly denying the establishment of target figures in the microeconomy, against which Japan is keeping guard at the comprehensive trade talks, Cutter criticized Japan's negotiation stance, saying: "There is no such thing as target figures. The United States is asking for introduction of a standard which will be used to evaluate (expansion of market access)." Regarding reduction of Japan's trade surplus, on the other hand, Cutter pointed out: "Japan should aim to reduce it to a little less than 2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP). We do not understand why it does not disclose its guideline." In this way, he explained his view that the Hosokawa administration should voluntarily disclose its trade surplus reduction plan. His comments indirectly explained his intention to produce some results at the framework talks by striking an agreement in the area of macro economy to find a way out of discussions, which are coming to a deadlock in the area of macro economy. Regarding Japan's additional economic measures, Cutter said that "income tax reduction is the only way." At the same time, he doubted the effect of a package plan designed to reduce income tax and increase the consumption tax rate at the same time. He called for a large-scale tax reduction, saying that it should be reduced at "a scale that is large enough to promote economic growth." On construction talks, he said: "There is a possibility of imposing sanctions against Japan. However, it is not desirable to do that." Regarding the issue of foreign semiconductor makers' market share in Japan, which dropped to below 20 percent, Cutter criticized Japan which refuses to accept the USTR's call for holding emergency consultative talks.
