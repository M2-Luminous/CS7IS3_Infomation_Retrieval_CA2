You have to be well aware of what's going on. You have to look at the design, operation, people involved and maintenance of the reactor'. `In India. there is a well knit group with a lot of morale, which has worked together for long, has good experience an advantage over other countries', he said. `In developing countries, the equipment may not be the latest but if you can adapt the machine to the given conditions, it is good enough. It is very easy to take a camera into people's homes and point out the dirt', he added. Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, Dr R Chidambaram described the American television news programme as malicious, mischievous and a deliberate mis-representation of facts'. The report purports to expose ill-effects of radiation due to our reactors by focusing on some village ten miles away from the power plant. It seems a deliberate campaign to misrepresent our nuclear programme " he said. Th operational radiological exposure to workers in our reactors is within specified limits, our main objective is to reduce the collective dose, he added. The CBS show had criticised the functioning of Indian nuclear reactors by suggesting that safety guidelines were being violated in their working. Pakistan was conspicuous by its absence at this meeting which was expected to bring together technical experts of the six member states which operate PHWR's, namely Argentina, Canada, India, Pakistan, Romania and South Korea for an exchange of information on safety standards.
