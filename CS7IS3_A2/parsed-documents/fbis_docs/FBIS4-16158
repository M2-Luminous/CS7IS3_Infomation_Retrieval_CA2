"The latest steps by Kiev hinder the fulfilment by the Crimean Security Department its constitutional duties and infringe moral losses to its personnel," the statement said. On Monday, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov dismissed Kiev's appointee Major-General Ivan Kolymtsev from the post of the local security chief and replaced him by his own protege, Retired Major-General Vladimir Lepikhov. Security bosses in Kiev responded instantly with an angry message signed by Yevgueny Marchuk, head of the republican Security Service. The message commanded Kolymtsev to ignore Meshkov's decree and continue to run the office and qualified Meshkov's decree as unconstitutional. The UKRINFORM report did not specify which of the two generals exactly runs the department today, but at least "all scheduled operations to safeguard security and civil accord on the Peninsula are being conducted normally", the press service stated.
