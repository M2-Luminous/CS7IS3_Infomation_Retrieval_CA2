In the interview, the Chinese official in charge of patent affairs said Beijing intends to attract more foreign businesses by revamping its current patent system to further develop China's economy. Following is a summary of the interview. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How does China view moves to coordinate the world patent system? [GAO] In order for the world economy to develop, it is necessary to make technology invented by certain nations freely transferable across borders. If terms for the acquisition of patents and the method of their protection differ from country to country, this situation would cause international disputes such as patent infringement. It is indispensable to create a world patent system to avert such international disputes. The United States is the only nation which maintains the principle of first invention, but China intends to ask that country for an early shift to the principle of first patent application in the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and other international organizations. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The world sees China as a highly potential market. How does China plan to attract foreign capital and technology? [GAO] Japanese and other foreign enterprises see China as a market that will grow in the future. China is willing to introduce technologies held by foreign firms which can serve to develop China's economy. In order for the enterprises of many nations to easily make business inroads into China with their own technologies and gain access to the Chinese market, China needs to protect their intellectual property rights effectively and correctly. To that end, China intends to simplify the current procedural process in a bid to shorten the period of patent examination for the acquisition of patent rights and work to strengthen the examination system to protect property rights correctly. Specifically, in order for technologies of foreign firms and inventors to be properly protected, China intends to work towards improving the management of the patent system by promoting both an exchange of experts with foreign nations and an exchange of views with officials in charge of patent affairs in the firms of industrialized nations. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Would you explain how China is working to revamp its patent system and how it will work to do in the future? [GAO] China first introduced the patent system in 1985, nine years ago. The history of China's patent system is short compared with that of Japan, Europe, and the United States. It can be said China was able to introduce a modern patent system on the model of patent systems in industrialized nations. China sweepingly amended the Patent Law in March 1993, and now the law gives the same protection to patent rights as those of industrialized nations. China aims to join GATT as a member nation. China has taken steps to protect its manufacturing technology and to adopt a patent system on materials in line with the contents of the Intellectual Property Right Accord hammered out last December at the Uruguay Round. In the future, China seeks to join the Budapest Convention on the international consignment of microorganisms.
