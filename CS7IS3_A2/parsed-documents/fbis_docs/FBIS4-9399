Laketic: "Even Parties on Bank Balance Sheets"] [Text] Pristina, 5 Apr -- In the opinion of Pristina bankers, the losses in Beogradska Bank, Pristinska, a joint-stock company, which POLITIKA has written about, occurred because of a lack of discipline on the part of certain executives who had never performed banking operations before coming to that institution. So, that bank, which never formed an oversight committee although it has been in existence since 1990 and should have done so under the Law on Banks (Articles 41, 46-48, SLUZBENI LIST, No. 32, 1993) and also under the bank charter, has been operating according to the lights of the general director and a few of his associates, who have changed frequently. Instead of an oversight committee, Director Dimitrije Ljiljak formed a farm committee and a committee for science and technology, each of which had 15 members, constituting a "voluntary" advisory body. The members of these committees, among them Dr. Zoran Gruic; Dr. Zoran Gligorijevic; Zoran Vasiljevic, director of Famipa in Prizren; Bosko Kotorcevic, director of the welded pipe factory in Urosevac; Boban Boskovic, director of Plastika in Pristina; and so on, have been receiving a monthly appanage incomparably greater than the salaries of those employed in the bank. Expenditures of this kind were indicated in the Report on Business Operations under the items of "intellectual services" and "other nonproduction services." Judging by that report, most of the expenditures were made, or costs incurred, by the bank's branch in Urosevac. Thus, that branch allocated for firewood alone several hundred-fold more money than in Pristina, while the Gnjilane, Pec, Prizren, and Zvecani banks had minimal expenditures of this kind. That same branch in Urosevac last year had several hundred-fold higher PTT [post, telephone, telegraph] costs than all the branches and main headquarters, taken together. That branch also had the highest appropriation to pay net personal incomes arising from royalties. However, the personnel in that bank say that the situation is altogether different. They say that expenditures of other branches and the main headquarters were entered on the books of this branch, and those expenditures even included all kinds of parties, and last spring's celebration of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS] is mentioned as a curiosity. That is, the SRS celebrated its election victory in the Narcis Hotel on Brezovica. The bank was the general sponsor of the celebration, since, let us not forget, Director Dimitrije Ljiljak was a people's deputy in the Serbian Assembly as a member of the SRS. Another oddity referred to is the example of the purchase of Misa Kalajdzic's doctoral dissertation "Revitalization of Sar Mountain." That is, before the sale of that doctoral paper Kalajdzic was that bank's executive director, and now he is director of the commercial firm Kosmet, which was established by that bank. The lawyer of the Pristinska Bank, we have learned, opposed this unique purchase of a doctoral dissertation at the time, arguing that this work could be obtained without payment in any Kosmet library. The personnel of the Pristinska Bank, among them Zaga Pavlovic, wrote a report on all of this for all the government agencies, including the president of the republic. Its petition referred to the collaboration between Director Ljiljak and a certain Milorad Dobric of Belgrade, owner of the magazine SELO, with the entire benefit going to this private publisher. The deal, our informant says, was that the magazine would write as much as possible about Director Ljiljak and then "there would be no problem about money for printing." The bank's executives do not for the moment want to go public. The only statement was from Dr. Branko Vasiljevic, member of the bank's managing board, who said, "It actually could have been worse."
