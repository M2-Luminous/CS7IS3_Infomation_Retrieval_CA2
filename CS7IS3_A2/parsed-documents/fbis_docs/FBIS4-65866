Depending on that assessment, the Netherlands will decide whether it will resume its support to the Surinamese balance of payments and whether it will provide funds for the creation of an industry fund. This was stated by Surinamese President R. Venetiaan last Sunday [22 May] at a news conference in Amsterdam, during a short stay in the Netherlands. The disagreement between both countries concerned the question whether the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would be granted permission to "report" to the Netherlands about the reorganisation plans for the Surinamese economy. Cooperation Development Minister Pronk had requested the IMF to express such an independent opinion. The disagreement on the meaning of the IMF report was not due to "childish stubborness on the part of Suriname," Venetiaan stated, but was a matter of "honor and national sovereignty." The compromise, which was reached after almost half a year of negotiations, holds that Suriname will admit observers from the IMF, but that it will not officially submit the reports and recommendations to the Netherlands. The Netherlands will, however, get the reports from the IMF later on, informally. Last March, Minister Pronk had already agreed with his Surinamese colleague on the way in which the IMF would supervise the changes to the Surinamese economy. It had been agreed that the organization would draw up quarterly reports, with suggestions to gear the economy to the existing recovery plans. Later on, there was political disagreement on this issue in Suriname. The country objects to the IMF's formal role, because it refuses to comply with the organization's recommendations, which are expected to be strict. According to Venetiaan, Minister Pronk hinted last Saturday that "compromises" about the IMF approach could lead to the recovery of Dutch support to the balance of payments. The Surinamese president was in the Netherlands after visits to Indonesia, Malaysia, and China, but he refused to elaborate on the results of this trip. In Indonesia, there were talks about the large-scale tree felling projects, for which Indonesian businessmen were given a license. According to several environmental groups, the relevant developers have a bad reputation. They fear that the Surinamese rain forest might be developed in the same way as parts of East Kalimantan in Indonesia. In spite of the strict forest legislation, the jungle has been irreparably damaged there in many places, because the control of the development failed due to corruption. Venetiaan said that he found no evidence of irresponsible lumbering in Indonesia. Indonesia did promise Suriname's support for the training of forest rangers. The Netherlands has also provided money for that purpose.
