FR940902-2-00116 FR940902-2-00053 The Fiduciary states that once it had made the foregoing determinations, it directed the Committee and the Trustee to take the following steps: (1) Immediately sell 38,000 shares of Common Stock on the NASDAQ system for $7.00 per share, which was the net price per share prevailing on the NASDAQ on March 4, 1993, the day the instructions were received; (2) Apply the sales proceeds and the cash matching contributions to exercise the Basic Privilege with respect to all Rights issued to the Plan at a cost of $324,629.25; and (3) If possible, borrow $60,000 (the Loan) and apply the Loan proceeds to exercise the Oversubscription Privilege for an additional 12,500 shares of Common Stock, subject to the following conditions: (a) The Loan was not to be outstanding for more than 30 days; (b) To the extent some or all of the 12,500 shares did not become available pursuant to the Oversubscription Privilege, the remaining Loan proceeds were to be applied to repay the unused portion of the Loan. According to the Fiduciary's instructions, the Trustee and the Committee executed the sale of 38,000 shares of Common Stock and purchased 68,343 shares of Common Stock at the Exercise Price by exercising the Basic Privilege on behalf of the Plan. However, because an unrelated lender could not be located to make the Loan to the Plan, the Fiduciary directed the Trustee and the Committee not to exercise the Oversubscription Privilege. 6. The applicant represents that as a result of participating in the Offering as directed by the Fiduciary, the Plan realized a net gain of $182,027.70. Prior to the Offering, the Plan held 122,042 shares of Common Stock and was scheduled to receive cash matching contributions of $61,293.76 before the end of the Offering. The applicant explains that the Plan's normal practice would have been to invest the cash matching contributions in Common Stock through a dividend reinvestment program on the 10th day of the month following the date on which the contribution was received. If the Plan had not participated in the Offering and instead had followed its normal practice, the Plan would have held 128,700 shares of Common Stock, plus $12,261.05 in cash, at the end of the Offering on March 15, 1993. BMJ states that these assets would have had a fair market value on that date of $1,039,717.05. By participating in the Offering as directed by the Fiduciary, the Plan instead held 153,385 shares of Common Stock, plus $2,664.51 in cash, at the end of the Offering on March 15, 1993, resulting in total Plan assets with a fair market value of $1,221,744.75. 7. The applicant states that the issuance of the Rights to the Plan resulted from unilateral, independent actions of BMJ, and that the Plan, as an owner of Common Stock, received the Rights on the same basis as all other Common Stock owners. The applicant explains that the purpose of the Offering was to generate necessary capital for BMJ and that the inevitable effect of issuing new shares of Common Stock was the dilution of the proportionate interest in the corporation represented by all previously-issued shares. Accordingly, Common Stock owners who failed to exercise the Rights could be expected to experience a diminution in their proportionate interest in BMJ and a decrease in the value of their Common Stock shares. Common Stock owners who exercised their Rights could avoid such reductions of interest and value, and could potentially experience a net gain. The applicant notes that the Fiduciary determined that the most prudent course of action for the Plan with respect to the Offering was to participate by exercising the Rights to the maximum extent possible. 8. In summary, the applicant represents that the transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (a) The Plan's receipt of the Rights through the Offering resulted from unilateral, independent actions of BMJ with the sole intent of generating necessary additional capital; (b) The Plan received the Rights, and was accorded treatment under the Offering, on the same basis as all other owners of Common Stock as of the Record Date of the Offering; (c) The interests of the Plan with respect to the Rights and the Offering were represented independently of BMJ, by the Fiduciary, who had sole responsibility with respect to the Plan's actions regarding the Rights; and (d) The Fiduciary determined that the most prudent course of action on behalf of the Plan with respect to the Offering was the exercise of the Rights to the maximum extent possible.
