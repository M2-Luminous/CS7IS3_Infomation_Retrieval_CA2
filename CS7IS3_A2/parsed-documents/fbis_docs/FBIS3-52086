Samaniego, retired, the vice minister of defense, said yesterday that the arrival of U.S. troops will be senseless if the Paraguayan Armed Forces do not take part in the "Strong Roads 1994-South" exercises. Samaniego said that if the Paraguayan troops do not take part in this military exercise, the Armed Forces will ask the legislators not to approve the presence of 600 U.S. troops who will be in charge of building eight schools, one health center, roads and wells in the San Pedro department area. The vice minister said: "We must take part in the training exercise. Otherwise the presence of the U.S. military will be senseless because the Paraguayan Armed Forces will be mere spectators while they train." After stating that the number of U.S. troops (600) that will take part in the "Strong Roads 1994-South" exercise may raise suspicion, Samaniego said that the main objective of the U.S. troops "is not to build schools but to conduct deployment exercises." The retired general warned that "if the Paraguayan Armed Forces are not directly involved in the operation we will have no control over the U.S. force." Samaniego stated that this possibility must be taken into consideration by the legislators who must approve the entrance of U.S. troops into Paraguayan territory. He added: "I believe that the legislators will support our position. This is why I do not believe they will approve the presence of U.S. troops on those terms." Samaniego said that the Armed Forces position is to negotiate Paraguayan participation in the exercises. He added that if the U.S. Government rejects this proposal, they will ask the legislators to reject the presence of U.S. troops. During the interview, General Samaniego repeatedly insisted on the need for Paraguayan officers to participate in the military exercise. He stated: "This should be one of our prerquisites to allow the entrance of U.S. troops in our country. We should negotiate so that the Paraguayan Armed Forces can participate in an integrated manner in the exercise." Samaniego said that a possible confirmation of the U.S. refusal to allow the Paraguayan Armed Forces participation in the task of building schools, roads, etc. will help to increase the existing mistrust about the true objective of the 600 U.S. troops that will arrive in the country. Moreover, Samaniego explained that the U.S. military will spend more money in the mobilization and transportation of its troops than in builidng schools and roads. He added: "Of the $12 million that the operation will demand, construction constitutes but a small percentage."
