This is stated in a previously secret report from Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup (Social Democrat) who, in this way, has set the stage for a political battle during the final stages of the election campaign. The planned cuts consist of two items. In the future, expenditures on UN actions -- including the new international brigade of 4,500 men -- will be included in the normal defense budget. For next year, this figure is 390 million kroner. Until now, these costs have been covered, by way of an exception, by the Finance Ministry. In addition, the defense minister wants to make a one-time saving of 300 million kroner. Haekkerup has been so secretive so far that not even the spokesmen on defense matters from the three other coalition parties knew the plans in detail. But CD [Democratic Center] chairman Svend Aage Jensen said, "Significant savings in the defense budget is not our cup of tea. We do not believe the time is right to cut back. But I will see if these figures can be verified." The present defense agreement was reached in November 1992 and it runs out at the end of 1994. It was signed by six parties, other than SF [Socialist People's Party] and the Progress Party. Now Conservative leader and former Defense Minister Hans Engell believes that the government is setting the stage for "great uncertainty in the area of defense." "We cannot go along. It is totally unreasonable to create uncertainty over the military's ability to plan for the future by suddenly pulling the rug from under it completely in an economic sense," Engell said. His fellow party member, spokesman on defense issues Helge Adam Moller, is also attacking the defense minister for breach of agreement. He said that, according to Haekkerup, a so-called earned net interest of 107 million kroner would not be released in 1994, as expected, but would be carried over to 1995. "This is totally unacceptable and will poison future negotiations toward a defense agreement." "It will be totally impossible to maintain the combat capabilities of the military if there are cuts of 700 million. At the same time, this is in clear violation of a law passed in December on the purpose and mission of the military. This is a slap in the face to the parties that signed the agreement," Moller said. The political battle will continue when a long-expected report from the so-called Advice and Analysis Group of the Defense Ministry is published today. BERLINGSKE TIDENDE has tried unsuccessfully to obtain any comments from Defense Minister Haekkerup.
