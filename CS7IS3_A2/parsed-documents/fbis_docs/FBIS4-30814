The inflation rate in May was 0.3 per cent down from April, Mirjana Rankovic, deputy general manager of the Federal Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. This has primarily resulted from a further decline of retail prices of manufactured goods. Prices of agricultural produce have increased 20.5 per cent and those of services 1.8 per cent, she said. In the past month most of the prices have been stable or have slightly declined, but the statistics has, nevertheless, registered an increase in prices of some products. There has been a record-high increase of the price of carrots -- 88 per cent -- and apples -- 69 per cent. This is a seasonal price increase and its stabilization is expected with a better supply of these goods in markets in the weeks to come, Rankovic said. The retail prices dropped 6.7 per cent in May and 0.4 per cent in April. The living costs were 0.9 per cent down on April, although the food costs, which largely influence them, increased 3.6 per cent. However, this was counterbalanced by a 4.2 per cent decline in the prices of clothes and manufactured goods. Rankovic did not want to make any estimates regarding the inflation rate in the months to come, but she confirmed that the weekly monitoring of prices showed that food prices are stabilizing and that there is a further decline in the prices of manufactured goods. In late January, when the record-high inflation rate of 313 per cent per month was registered, the Yugoslav Government began the implementation of the programme of monetary reconstruction and economic recovery. The new economic measures have curbed the growth of price and recovered production, which was on the verge of a breakdown because of the international sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia in late May 1992.
