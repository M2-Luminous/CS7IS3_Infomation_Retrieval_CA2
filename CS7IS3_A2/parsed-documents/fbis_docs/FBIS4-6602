Energy Undersecretary Rufino Bomasang said President Ramos was informed yesterday of the latest find in West Linapacan, the country's biggest oil field. The find was made as the West Linapacan consortium was drilling a sidetrack well dubbed as A-5 to stop water seepage in the original well. Water encroachment in the Linapacan wells cut their production level from a high of 18,000 barrels a day (BOPD) early last year to 5,000 BOPD in December 1993. Consortium representatives told DOE officials last Friday that the A-5 well encountered continuous very good oil shows in the limestone up to a depth of 8,020 feet. The operators said the oil-water contact in the A-5 well is lower than that in the A-3 well, giving an additional 400 feet of oil column. An energy department source said the discovery of a new oil section may boost the production of crude from West Linapacan. The consortium also reported that the A-5 well may have combination gas and water drive which would enhance oil recovery. Three drill stem tests (DST) are to be conducted in A-5 this week after which the well will be completed for production and hooked up the storage tanker. [sentence as published] Alcorn (Production) Phils., Inc., the operator of the field, has a 23.4 percent stake in Linapacan. Its partners are Oriental Petroleum & Minerals Corp. (36.6 percent); Basic Petroleum (11 percent); Alcorn Petroleum and Minerals (7.4 percent); Alcorn Phils. Inc. (5.6 percent); Petrofields (5 percent); Philodrill (4 percent); Seafront (4 percent); Unioil (2 percent); and Balabac Oil (1 percent). Still on the oil sector, Shell Philippines Exploration Corp. (SPEX) and Occidental Petroleum are eyeing two of the world's biggest oil exploration firms as partners in the $2 billion worth development of the Camago-Malampaya field in Northwest Palawan, the largest gas find in the country. An industry source said that Atlantic Richfield Co. (Arco), one of the top ten oil exploration firms in the United States, and Total Corp., a French oil company, are negotiating separately with Shell and Oxy. Arco recently won the geophysical and seismic exploration contract (GSEC) covering the Sulu Sea. The source said that SPEX and Oxy, operators of the Camago-Malampaya field, are willing to offer up to 15 percent each to a foreign partner. Shell and Oxy each have a 50 percent stake in Camago-Malampaya. Shell and Oxy have started inviting foreign oil companies to join the Camago-Malampaya development last February. Shell and Oxy has shortlisted some five companies as possible partners which include Arco and Total. Shell and Oxy are willing to accept investors who would be able to carry their share of a $2-billion project. A 1 percent participating interest in Camago-Malampaya may be worth some $20 million. Earlier, sources said that the two oil exploration companies were not inclined to dilute the ownership of the field. Last February, Shell and Oxy started the drilling of two wells. Two more wells are expected to be drilled to confirm reserves of three to five trillion cubic feet (TCF) of natural gas and a minimum of 100 million barrels. Bomasang earlier said the Camago-Malampaya field could supply Luzon at least 600 million cubic feet of gas per day through an undersea pipeline. The amount will be enough to sustain the fuel requirements of a 3,000-megawatt (Mw) power plant by the year 2000. According to Bomasang, an early production system will produce oil at 20,000 to 50,000 barrels per day by 1996 and if the reserves are adequate, a final production system of 10,000 to 20,000 BOPD would be set up by 1999.
