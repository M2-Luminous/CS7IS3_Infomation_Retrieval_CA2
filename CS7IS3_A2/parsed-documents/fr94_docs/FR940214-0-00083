FR940214-0-00083 FR940214-0-00012 In response to specific comments and further analysis of the regulatory text, NHTSA has made some minor changes to the proposed test procedures applicable to air-applied, mechanically held brake systems. For instance, in response to criticisms by Midland-Grau of terminology that it believed was ambiguous, NHTSA has deleted reference to ``certain level'' of failure as proposed in S5.6(b). In addition, as explained below, the agency has modified the terminology related to the concept of parking brake ``release.'' Nevertheless, NHTSA has decided to retain the following terms that Midland-Grau criticized: ``Increasing or decreasing,'' ``threshold level of diaphragm leakage,'' ``threshold maximum reservoir leakage associated with that level of failure,'' and ``threshold of allowable leakage.'' With respect to finding the leakage rate at which the parking brake system becomes unreleasable, the agency believes it is necessary for the test evaluator to find the appropriate threshold level with ``progressively increasing or decreasing levels'' of failure because each brake configuration is different. While this procedure will require some searching for the leakage rate at which the system becomes unreleasable, the agency believes the appropriate level of failure can be ascertained without too much difficulty by using metering valves. NHTSA notes that in VRTC's testing to develop this rule's requirements and procedures, the agency installed an adjustable metering valve in the brake chamber housing to simulate a leak in the brake chamber diaphragm. The ``threshold level of common diaphragm leakage type failure'' at which the parking brakes become unreleasable was determined by increasing the leakage rate, by ``opening'' the metering valve, from one test to the next in relatively large increments until the parking brakes would not release. Then, the metering valve was ``closed,'' to decrease the leakage rate, in smaller increments until the parking brakes would release. The leakage rate was then increased by even smaller increments until the parking brakes were again unreleasable. The precision with which the final determination of the ``threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure'' at which the parking brakes become unreleasable is determined by the number of times the direction of leakage rate change, e.g., from increasing to decreasing and vice versa, and the magnitude of the increments by which the leakage rate is increased or decreased. With respect to various references to the concept of the ``threshold,'' the agency has modified these provisions slightly to use just two terms: ``Threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure'' in S5.6.7.1.1 and S5.6.7.2.1 and the ``threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate'' in S5.6.7.1.2 and S5.6.7.2.2. NHTSA, nevertheless, disagrees with Midland-Grau's more general concern that the term ``threshold'' is ambiguous. The agency notes that the dictionary defines ``threshold'' to mean ``a level, point, or value above which something is true or will take place and below which it is not or will not.'' 2 Applying this definition to the parking brake test for systems with common diaphragms, the agency believes that ``threshold level of common diaphragm leakage-type failure'' is an objective term that means the initial level at which the parking brake can no longer be released. Similarly, the meaning of the phrase ``threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate'' was discussed in the NPRM and means the rate of reservoir air pressure decrease that results at that threshold level of leakage. 2 Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, 1986. With respect to the concept of ``release,'' NHTSA has decided to clarify the term so that it covers brake applications that involve a vehicle being parked on a grade or a drawbar pull test. NHTSA notes that in addressing a similar issue in an earlier rulemaking about what was meant by ``release,'' the agency stated that ``NHTSA considers a brake to be released at the point where it no longer exerts any torque.'' (37 FR 12495, June 24, 1972). The agency believes that this discussion of release is pertinent to the procedure set forth in S5.6(b). Accordingly, in the final rule, the agency has specified that the relevant consideration is when the parking brakes ``become unreleasable.'' Since the final rule specifies the criteria in terms of ``becom(ing) unreleasable,'' Midland-Grau's concerns about when the released condition exists or about the status of a partial release are no longer relevant.
