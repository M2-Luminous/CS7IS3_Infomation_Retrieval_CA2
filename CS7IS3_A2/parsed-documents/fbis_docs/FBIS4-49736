Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 10 (CNA) -- The second round of tariff reduction consultations between Taiwan and the United States will help facilitate Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said Tuesday [10 May]. "We hope the United States can better understand Taiwan's efforts in pushing for free and fair trade," he noted. Sheu made the remarks prior to his departure for Washington, D.C., where Sheu and his 30-member delegation will meet with their American counterparts on both tariff and non-tariff issues Thursday and Friday. Major topics during the two-day talks include farm trade, opening of service markets, the special exchange agreement, the government procurement [words indistinct], trade-related intellectual property protection, Tokyo round codes, and non-tariff trade barriers, he said. The United States first asked Taiwan to cut tariffs on 8,048 products last November, including tariffs on industrial goods to below 10 percent and farm goods to less than 20 percent. It also demanded that Taiwan immediately slash tariff rates on 699 items by up to 50 percent. The two sides failed to reach agreement during the first round of tariff talks held in Taipei in February. After the talks, Sheu and his delegation will proceed to Geneva May 14 to attend the fifth meeting of the GATT working party on Taiwan's membership scheduled for May 17-19. During the working party meeting, Sheu will hold bilateral tariff consultations with Canada, Switzerland, and South Korea. So far, Taiwan has held tariff reduction negotiations with the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Turkey, South Africa, Hungary, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan among 21 countries, which have asked for such talks with Taiwan. Bilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties are considered vital to Taiwan's smooth entry into the Geneva-based world trade regulating body. Taiwan was accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.
