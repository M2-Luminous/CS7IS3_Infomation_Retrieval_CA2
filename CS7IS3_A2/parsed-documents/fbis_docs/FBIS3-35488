History is not unipolar, but is based on a number of contradictions, such as the contradiction between dream and reality. Every current reality was once a dream, and no matter how satisfactory the current reality is, it also has its dream that it wants to fulfill. The logic of history is that it is in a constant state of evolution. So despite ups and downs in human progress, the final outcome is this inevitable evolution. There is also a conflict of interests between classes, nations, generations, and between the new technologies and their acquired values on the one hand, and the prevailing inherited values on the other. Any strong blow to a new world order will come from a conflict of interests, cultures, beliefs, and ambitions between North and South and East and West. Overlooking these facts will make the "New World Order" a mere assumption, a proposal, or an aspiration. Even in one family, which consists of only a few individuals, it is very difficult to devise a way to reconcile the separate aims, conflicting desires, and different concerns of its members, let alone a situation on a worldwide level. Mankind with all its diversities and vast areas is too big to contain in any crucible, and to melt and mould on any fire. The problem with the United States is that it is formulating its policies in isolation of history, because it is a nation without history. The gangster system, which is prevalent in the underworld of U.S. cities, in making money, and attaining high position -- including even the presidency -- has left its imprint on U.S. policy, where might is right. This feeling of power has eliminated the bipolar world order. To the United States, the world now is a hand-mill turning around one pivot, which is the United States of course. There has always been ignorance of time, conflict between opposite sides, and of other party or parties. There has always been the feeling that using force or threatening to use force is sufficient to make the United States assume the role of a deity in Greek mythology. Force of arms can hammer out a new world, where all people are slaves and where the United States rules supreme on its throne forever. The UN Security Council, with its big and small states, is that world, and a knock from its chairman's mallet is sufficient to make things happen. But no one seems to think that compared to the world, the Security Council is just a tiny drop in an ocean. How many billions on our global earth are suffering, dreaming, or fed up with their lives? They all seek freedom, food, and honor, and they all believe that these aspirations are their legitimate right and that it is their duty to work hard in order to attain them. How can we combine the casinos of Las Vegas and Monte Carlo, the cafes of the Champs-Elysees, and the winter resorts of Switzerland with the camps of the Palestinians, the villages of India, the alleys of Manila, the famine areas of Somalia, the mine that exploded from the bag of history in Yugoslavia, the internecine fighting in Afghanistan, and the search for potato roots in the debris of the Soviet Union? Indeed, how can we combine all of these in one context or formula? Can they, in their "New World Order," cancel the conflict of interests between the United States and Japan; or between Britain and Germany; or between them and the sharks of the EC states? Can they solve ethnic, religious, and racial problems and the border problems existing since World War I? Can they feed all the hungry, or make all people equal in hunger and poverty? They cannot. So how will this world order look? Let us assume that they can do all that. But this would mean that they have defeated the purpose of establishing the New World Order, which is to place their interests above the interests of all the other states. There remains power. The United States, with all its air and naval fleets, ground forces, armies, missiles, security organs, media, the additional strength of its allies and agents, its funds, and the funds of its oil-rich allies, could not make the people of Iraq -- a country small in area and population -- budge an inch from its position. So what was the use of this power? Iraq remained as it wanted, not as they wanted it to be. The same thing happened in Lebanon and is happening in Somalia, although at a much-reduced level. The world's garment is tattered and its body is exposed to the winds and sun. No system is big enough to handle the tragedies of the universe or to stem their natural flow. Shaping world destinies in closed chambers means creating delusions.
