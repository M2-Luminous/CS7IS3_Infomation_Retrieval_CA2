We are building an open society in which all human rights will be respected. Each citizen can voice his/her opinion, but when a majority takes a decision, a minority should follow." Niyazov expressed regret that until now Western countries continue to accuse Turkmenia of violating human rights and the lack of democracy. "I am convinced that there is no more democratic state than ours nowadays," he stated. According to the president, there is not a single political prisoner in the republic, anybody can organize a party, "if its has regulations, program, supporters and if it acts within the framework of the constitution and the law." Speaking about priorities in the foreign policy, Niyazov again stressed that Turkmenia will cooperate with Russia on an equal basis "whatever the power in Moscow." In the president's opinion, "it is necessary to choose five-six states for having close relations with them." Among these Niyazov named all countries neighboring Turkmenistan. "The break-off in relations with them will lead to damage for each side." Niyazov also said that every CIS meeting passes "hard" for him and that he feels "pressing." Particularly, when proposals come in on Turkmenia's more active role in the Tajik and Abkhaz issues and on the entry in military or economic unions. In his opinion, today many states on the territory of the former Soviet Union facing problems after gaining independence cannot cope and start to support the ideas of creating some coordinating centers and structures. "Turkmenia will pursue its policy without entering any alliances," Niyazov pointed out. The president urged diplomats to clearly see the goals of the state and to trust the government policy and be able to explain to representatives of other countries. In conclusion, Niyazov approved a resolution on the ministry and its top officials. In the resolution he excluded only articles "on the organizational and methodical control by the Foreign Ministry over foreign economic activites of ministries and departments" and "on the obligatory implementation of Foreign Ministry's resolutions on foreign policy by ministries and departments."
