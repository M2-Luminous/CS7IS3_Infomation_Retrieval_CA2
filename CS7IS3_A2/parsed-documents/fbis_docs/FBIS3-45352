Mr. Lu also said the door to further talks on the territory's political future was still open. For the details, here's Joseph Tsang: [Begin Tsang recording] According to a spokesman for a delegation of young Fukienese businessmen from Hong Kong visiting Beijing, Mr. Lu failed to see why the reserves could not injected into the airport projects, because he believed the economy of Hong Kong should yield more than HK$100,000 million [Hong Kong dollars] in reserves by 1997. He reportedly said Beijing had submitted several airport financing proposals to the British side, but there had been no response. And he was said to have accused the British side of failing to stick to the Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport when making financing proposals for the projects. Mr. Lu also said Beijing had informed Britain through diplomatic channels that it sincerely wanted to hold further talks on the territory's political future, but China was dissatisfied with the tabling of a partial electoral bill in Legco [Legislative Council] on the governor's political proposal during such negotiations. He says such a move was not worthy of a gentleman, and was that of a vile character. [end recording]
