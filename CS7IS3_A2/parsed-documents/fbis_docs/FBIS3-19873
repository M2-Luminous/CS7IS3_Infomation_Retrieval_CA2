The Foreign Office said they were aware of the reports but had no independent confirmation. A spokesman said: "The embassy in Ankara is in touch with the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs." The group, investigating alleged abuse of human rights, was seized by Turkish military officials in the village of Malabadi, some 20 miles from Diyarbakir, main town in Turkey's Kurdish region. They are part of a 24-strong delegation headed by Lord Avebury, chairman of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group. A colleague in one of the three other groups elsewhere in Turkey said the seven were travelling by car from Diyarbakir when seized at Malabadi at around 8am London time yesterday. Nothing further had been heard from them by 8.30pm. They are human rights campaigner Miranda Watson from Peterborough, barrister Joy Hankins from London, and an interpreter known only as Mr Diyviren, thought to be from Sheffield. Also in the team are Margaret Ward, Kevin MacDermot and Felan McMahon, all from Ireland and New Zealander Peter Grant. The group is the latest of several observer teams to go to south-east Turkey to investigate allegations of massacres, arrests and burning of villages by security forces in response to a campaign by Kurdish separatists. Other British human rights investigators on a similar mission were arrested in the same area last November and released after 26 hours.
