Consultation-Related Expenses -- ¥265.525 million 1. Consultation Expenses -- ¥134.331 million These are expenses for the general assembly, which comprehensively coordinates activities from a standpoint that covers all areas of scientific fields; the steering council; the seven sectional meetings; and the regular and special committees that reply to government inquiries and advise the government about important problems in the promotion of S&T based on Sections 4 and 5 of the Science Council of Japan Act. 2. Research Liaison -- ¥131.194 million The SCJ sets up research liaison committees for each specialized field. These committees, which are the central bodies for research contacts both within and outside of Japan, consist of members who represent each specialty field. They function as the Japanese committees of international scientific groups and serve as a means of mutual contact with scientific groups and organizations in Japan and abroad. These are expenses needed for the committees to carry out those functions. B. International Scientific Exchange Expenses -- ¥221.254 million 1. International Contributions -- ¥74.722 million As an organization that represents Japan's scientists at home and abroad in matters involving joint research with international scientific groups, the establishment of research systems, and the exchange of research information, the SCJ is a member of 46 international scientific groups, one of which is the International Scientific Federation. These funds are for the costs of membership in those groups. 2. Domestic Conferences -- ¥73.543 million In order to contribute to the world's scientific advancement and to raise the level of science within Japan, the SCJ holds international science conferences in cooperation with Japanese scientific research groups. In FY93 these funds are for the costs of holding the following FY93 conferences and preparing for the following FY94 conferences. (1) FY93 Conferences 10th General Meeting of the Asian Society Science Research Conference Federation (5 - 11 Sep 1993, Kawasaki) 15th International Plant Science Conference (23 Aug - 3 Sep 1993, Yokohama) 7th Pacific Science Intermediate Conference (27 Jun - 3 Jul 1993, Ginowan) 24th General Meeting of the International Radio Science Federation (23 Aug - 3 Sep 1993, Kyoto) 21st General Meeting of the International Pure and Applied Physics Federation (20 - 25 Sep 1993, Nara) 6th Science Conference of the International Meteorology and Atmospheric Science Association and 4th Joint Session of the International Hydrology Association (11 - 23 Jul 1993, Yokohama) (2) Preparation for FY94 Conferences 8th Meeting of the International Nerve and Muscle Society (10 - 15 Jul 1994, Kyoto) 24th Meeting of the International Horticultural Society (21 - 27 Aug 1994, Kyoto) 30th International Conference on Chemistry of Complexes (24 - 29 Jul 1994, Kyoto) 21st World Electrocardiography Conference (4 - 7 Jul 1994, Kyoto) 47th Conference of the International Information Documentation Federation (2 - 9 Oct 1994, Tokyo) 2nd International Conference of the Illness Physiology Society (19 - 24 Nov 1994, Kyoto) 3. Dispatching Representatives -- ¥44.006 million These funds are for sending suitable people to the scientific conferences held abroad every year that are sponsored by international scientific groups corresponding to the SCJ, or to conferences that the SCJ is obligated to attend. 4. Bilateral Exchange with Other Countries -- ¥6.823 million These funds are for systematically sending representative groups that cover all fields of science to other countries to coordinate conferences with the scientific organizations of specific countries, i.e., discussing basic items relating to the exchange of scientific information and researchers, and to establish orderly scientific exchange systems. 5. Asia Scientific Conference (provisional name) -- ¥22.160 million Based on the recognition that scientific research helps to overcome environmental and other such problems and contributes to the peace and prosperity of humankind, these funds are for meetings between the scientists of Japan and Asian countries with which Japan has geographical and deep cultural ties so that they will exchange ideas on the current state of scientific research in each country and opinions on the ideal form of cooperation in Asia. C. Expenses for Council Member Recommendations -- ¥19.574 million These funds are for the necessary expenses of the Recommendation Management Group, whose purpose is to select SCJ members, register scientific research groups, and to deliberate related matters.
