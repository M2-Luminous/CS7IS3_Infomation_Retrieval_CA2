What procedures should the Secretary provide for schools to review the information provided by the guaranty agencies to the Secretary for use in determining cohort default rates prior to calculation of the final rates? The Secretary received 54 comments in response to the request for comments. Many of the comments are reflected in these rules. The Secretary's response to the suggestions made by the commenters that were not accepted is provided after the following discussion of the procedures established by these rules. Appeals Based on Allegations of Improper Loan Servicing Public Law 103&hyph;208 added section 435(a)(3) to the HEA to specifically provide certain institutions with an opportunity to appeal the calculation of their cohort default rates on the basis of allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. In particular, this opportunity will be available to institutions that: (1) Are subject to loss of eligibility for the FFEL Program under section 435(a)(2) of the HEA; (2) are subject to loss of eligibility for the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Program under section 428A(a)(2) of the HEA; or (3) have cohort default rates that equal or exceed 20 percent for the most recent year for which data are available. The statute requires the Secretary to take steps to ensure that these institutions have access to a representative sample of relevant loan servicing and collection records for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 calendar days. Upon completion of the appeal, the Secretary will reduce an institution's cohort default rate to reflect the percentage of defaulted loans in the sample that are required to be excluded under section 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA. Public Law 103&hyph;208 also amended section 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA to clearly provide that the Secretary would consider allegations of improper loan servicing or collection only in considering appeals of cohort default rate determinations filed by institutions. This change was made in response to certain court rulings which suggested that the Secretary was required to determine whether loans were properly serviced prior to making initial determinations of and releasing cohort default rates. Section 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA now provides that, in considering appeals of cohort default rates under section 435(a)(3) of the HEA, the Secretary should exclude any loans which, due to improper servicing or collection, would, as demonstrated by the evidence submitted in support of the institution's timely appeal to the Secretary, result in an inaccurate or incomplete calculation of the cohort default rate. These regulations establish the procedures for implementing the appeal process provided by sections 435(a)(3) and 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA. The regulations specify that an institution which is subject to the loss of participation in the FFEL program because of default rates equal to or in excess of 25 percent for the three most recent years for which rates are calculated or which has a cohort default rate which equals or exceeds 20 percent may appeal the calculation of the rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. These regulations do not specifically include institutions that are subject to the loss of participation in the Federal SLS Program because that program has been repealed by Congress effective July 1, 1994. See Public Law 103&hyph;66, section 4047(b) and (d). These regulations replace the former regulatory provision which related to the loss of SLS participation because that subsection becomes moot on the elimination of the SLS program. However, an institution that is currently subject to a loss of participation in the SLS program will have the opportunity to pursue an appeal under these procedures. Under these regulations, once an institution receives notice from the Secretary that its cohort default rate or rates exceed the levels specified in section 435(a)(3) of the HEA, the institution will have 10 working days to initiate an appeal of the rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection. The Secretary's default rate notification to the institution will include a list of all borrowers included in the calculation of the cohort default rate. To initiate an appeal, the institution must include the list of borrowers in its notification to the guaranty agencies that it is appealing the calculation of the cohort default rate based on allegations of improper loan servicing or collection.
