Excellencies, presidents, prime minister, our honored guests, special envoys, ladies, and gentlemen: I have pleasure in welcoming our distinguished guests, the heads of states and government, and their delegations to New Delhi on the occasion of the fourth summit of the Group of 15 for South-South consultation and cooperation. Though your visit this time may be short, I hope you will be comfortable and have an opportunity to see something of this historic city. This summit represents an opportunity to see how best the creative energy of our group can be released to serve our common objectives of peace and development through cooperation and engagement in a rapidly changing world. Excellencies, we are a young group, but our concerns are age-old. We are compact, but our vision extends across continents. To realize our unique potential as a group, we must emphasize our transregional personality. Our activities must draw sustenance from and in equal measure contribute to our cohesion as a group. They should be comprehensive and imaginative enough to lead to the willing and positive participation of countries from different continents, such as we are geographically distant yet compact, in close cooperation and close in purpose. These are not easy tasks when urgent and varied domestic and regional developments demand our attention. However, equally compelling is the longer-term imperative of steering our countries toward a balanced and synergy of national, regional, and global interests. I am convinced that this is extremely important. At this G-15 summit we hope to demonstrate that our absorption in the tasks of today will not come in the way of our seriously addressing the emerging and transcendent issues of tomorrow. Excellencies, the pace of change in the last few years has been rapid. The end of the Cold War, the intensified globalization of national economies and the technological revolution are just a few elements of this change. Yet the transcendent issues to which I refer are still with us. We saw the promise of peace, but it has been far from realized. Forces of conflict manifest themselves primarily as attempts to undermine the nation-state system on which the international order rests. They have assumed dangerous proportions and diverse forms -- terrorism, separatism, and fundamentalism. I believe we in the G-15 have the capacity and the conviction to mobilize world opinion against such destructive forces as we represent the quest for peace, security, and stability. We are fully convinced of the need to introduce reforms in the UN system and expansion of the Security Council so as to give representation to the developing world in the council's permanent membership. These issues are engaging our attention constantly in the relevant forums. The importance of strengthening economic and development cooperation in our interdependent world is recognized around the globe. Such cooperation alone can deal with the problems of systemic inequalities, macroeconomic imbalances, ecological sustainability, stagnation, and widespread poverty. Protectionist barriers against developing country exports and discriminatory and restrictive regimes governing the flow of technology must be lowered. There should be adequate appreciation of our capacity and potential to not only develop rapidly, but in the process to act as effective catalyst for the regeneration of the world economy. We shall exemplify the intrinsic symbiosis between the interests of the industrialized countries and those of ours. Our determination to build up intrinsic capacities to expand cooperation among ourselves is firm. Extraneous efforts of developing countries, not least those of the members of this group, to transform and liberalize our economies and to integrate them with the global economy is aimed at charting a new trajectory of growth. This factor, as well as the substantial progress achieved by some of us, have created the basis for meaningful and functional networks of relationships -- commercial and technological -- between and among ourselves and with the rest of the world. Cooperation between developing countries on a regional and transregional basis has assumed an urgent dimension for us to extend the frontiers of growth. As we grow in collective strength, so too will our individual and joint capacities for development, to enable us to contribute to the establishment of a more equitable, balanced, and prosperous world order. Our attempts to intensify our interaction with regional free trade and economic cooperation arrangements could affirm the value of open regionalism and of becoming viable growth centers for the free flow of trade, investment, and technology across national and regional borders. Cooperation in the G-15 is tethered to the concrete programs and projects. Over these four years, the projects we have undertaken are in various stages of implementation. We have already made some progress in establishing databases and information networks on complementarities and opportunities for mutually beneficial trade, investment, and technology. Some of our projects operate within the matrices of critical need, natural advantage, and environmental sustainability. Some other projects seek to establish and strengthen the much-needed infrastructural links among our countries, and yet others are intended to stimulate intra-industry trade and cooperation in key sectors, such as petrochemicals. The G-15 Business Forum, which meets regularly along with the summits, is another concrete expression of cooperation where political purpose is translated into practical business opportunities. We are conscience of the constraints -- infrastructural and attitudinal -- that have so far circumscribed the full potential of intra-G-15 trade and economic cooperation. This must change. We also admit that our cooperative projects need to be better targeted and more effectively implemented if they are to make an impact. The program itself being a pioneering task, such initial shortcomings are to be expected. Yet a good beginning has been made and it is my earnest wish that this summit come up with new ideas on achieving improvements. Excellencies, I have continued the practice initiated by His Excellency President Diouf of Senegal and communicated our views to the chairman of the G-7 in July 1993. I am heartened by the response. I am convinced the time is right for carrying such constructive consultations further. Excellencies, the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations have concluded. We hope that it will, as promised, bring about further liberalization and expansion of the world trade to the benefit of all countries, especially the less developed trading partners. We also expect that the norms and institutions that we have established in the context of the World Trade Organization will in their actual operation uphold the rule of law in the realm of international trade and that the rights and interests of weaker trading partners will be protected. They must also take care to ensure that the barriers to trade that the Uruguay Round is to lower are not replaced by new barriers against developing-country exports in the guise of noneconomic concerns. We already have reason to be concerned about attempts to undermine multilateralism and agreed frameworks for the liberalization of trade. These manifest themselves in their resort to unilateral actions, demands for concessions beyond those agreed to in the round, and attempts to introduce new protectionist agendas. All of our countries recognize the importance of increased investments in our productive and technological capacities for accelerated growth and development. At the same time, official development assistance retains its importance. Concessional funding from multilateral financial institutions -- particularly in the context of low-income countries, which are striving to build basic social infrastructure and alleviate poverty -- is an imperative. The burden of external debt is a key resource constraint for indebted developing countries. The forging of innovative growth-oriented solutions as well as non-discriminatory trade and financial policies are needed to contribute to increasing the earnings of developing countries. Our commitment to environmental sustainability is total and through appropriate policies and measures, we will strive to implement our commitments under Agenda 21. On this matter of global concern [passage indistinct] may even human survival, we in turn expect our partners in industrialized countries to give effect to their commitment to make available new and additional resources as well as environmentally sound technologies on favorable and preferential terms. Excellencies, we are like the pilgrims that our poet-philosopher Rabindernath Tagore described in the following terms: Yet they are coming the pilgrims one and all; coming to their true inheritance of the world; they are ever broadening their consciousness, ever seeking the higher and higher unity, even approaching nearer to the one central truth which is all comprehensive. The fact that we have gathered here from three continents of the earth marks a realization of our true inheritance of this earth. Our actions in the coming years must confirm that our group is larger than the some of its parts and it is worthy of this inheritance. Thank you. [applause]
