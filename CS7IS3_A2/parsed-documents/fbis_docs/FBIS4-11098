FBIS4-11098 "drlat078_b_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 Haiti `Clean Sweep' Seen as `Breach of Democracy' `Clean Sweep' Seen as `Breach of Democracy' FL2104222794 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole in French 1045 GMT 21 Apr 94 FL2104222794 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole French BFN [Excerpts] The news today, as it has been all week, is about a series of meetings held by the office of the Chamber of Deputies in an effort to solve the political deadlock. A second meeting is planned for today between the office of the Chamber of Deputies and the General Staff of the Haitian Armed Forces. The meeting will relate to the political crisis and current deadlock. On Tuesday, 19 April, the military authorities received a delegation of deputies to hear the various scenarios for a solution to the crisis. Within the scope of this initiative, the deputies met on 20 April with representatives of the Episcopal Conference and with the Vatican's ambassador to Port-au-Prince. Edner Jean filed a report: [Begin Jean recording] As the consultations move forward, the solution to the crisis is moving farther and farther away from Article 149 of the Constitution, at least so far as the Chamber of Deputies is concerned. The last meeting with the Army only reinforced the position held by the majority of deputies and expressed a thousand times -- the inapplicability of Article 149 of the Constitution at the current juncture. If the military did not totally disregard that option, neither are they willing to support the legislators favoring such an approach. The Army would rather seek a concerted solution, confessed Deputy Pierre Simon Georges, president of the Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion], who participated in this meeting at Army Headquarters. The deputy from Camp-Perin who was the first, on 8 October 1991, to vote for Article 149, today believes that this constitutional provision has seen its day and that the Clean Sweep solution would be a breach of democracy. Deputy Pierre Simon Georges, who never hid his affinity with the Army, invites the military to analyze the grave socioeconomic consequences that could lead to a total blockade of the country. [passage omitted] From a generally reliable source, we have learned that the deputies are due to meet with the Army General Staff again on Thursday. Meanwhile, the president of the lower chamber is tirelessly pursuing his consultations. Objective: to collect the maximum amount of data before taking any new action to fill the governmental vacuum. Frantz Robert Monde has the moral support of the Chamber of Deputies. However, some legislators regret the fact that the preliminary results of those meetings were covered in camera. [passage omitted]. It should be pointed out that this series of meetings is due to close with a phone conference with President Aristide in Washington. [end recording]
