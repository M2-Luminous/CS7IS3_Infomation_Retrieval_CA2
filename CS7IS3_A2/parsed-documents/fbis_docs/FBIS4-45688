The signatories were Slovak Environment Minister Juraj Hrasko and Austrian Health Minister Christa Krammer. "Slovakia is the first country with which we will connect systems warning against radiation," Krammer said at a press conference today. She added that talks are under way also with the Czech Republic and Slovenia, and Hungary and Germany are also under consideration. The Austrian Government paid 3.5 million schillings for the system. The move is an important step on Slovakia's path towards joining international cooperation in the area. The Austrian monitoring system is composed of 336 automated measuring stations, while Slovakia has only 26. The need to connect both systems resulted from a visit of a Slovak Government delegation to Austria in May last year.
