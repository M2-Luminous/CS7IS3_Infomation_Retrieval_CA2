Deputy Defence Minister 'Abd-al-Rahman Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz, quoted by SPA, told naval officers in al-Dammam on Wednesday that his country wanted submarines which could adapt to the Red Sea and the more shallow waters of the Gulf. Prince 'Abd-al-Rahman did not disclose if negotiations had opened for buying the vessels. Iran, across the oil-rich Gulf from the Saudi kingdom, bought three submarines from Russia in 1992, raising concern among its Arab neighbours and their Western allies which have a naval presence in the strategic waterway. SPA also reported that the national guard on Wednesday wound up a week of exercises on the Gulf coast of eastern Saudi Arabia.
