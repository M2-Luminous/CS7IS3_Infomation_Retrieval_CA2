The prisoners, whose sentences ranged from 10 to 15 years, are to be released unconditionally and immediately, he told reporters. There are some 350 Thais in In Sein, most of them fishermen and loggers caught in Burmese territory, according to the Thai Ambassador to Rangoon, Wirasak Futrakun. Chettha was close-mouthed on progress on other issues during the Thailand-Burma Regional Border Committee meeting, which finished in Bangkok yesterday. But he said Burmese officials showed a "good attitude towards solving border disputes through official channels and that prisoners of both countries would be treated humanely." Chettha added that Major General Khet Sein, who is heading the Burmese delegation to Bangkok, also agreed to look into the case of nine Thai fishing trawlers which went missing recently in the Andaman Sea and showed up later in Rangoon.
