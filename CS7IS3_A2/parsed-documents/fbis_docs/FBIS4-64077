We asked Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, for the details. Here's what he told us by telephone. [Begin Kostikov recording] Unfortunately, the point has to be made that the State Duma is taking steps to set up its own radio and television service, and, what is particularly annoying, with a compulsory system of daily broadcasting on the state television channels and primarily on the channels of Russia TV. So the new legislative body is, in effect, reviving the practice of the earlier Supreme Soviet's encroachments on the free airwaves. Boris Nikolayevich had a serious conversation on the subject today. He is very concerned at these new tendencies in the work of the Duma. He thinks that the renewal of attempts at an information diktat may lead to a fall in the prestige of the State Duma. This worries him because the State Duma is one of the participants in the process of public accord, and the discrediting of that important state body will damage the strengthening of public accord in Russia. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that neither the president nor the government nor the Federation Council has its own broadcasting. They interact with the public on the principles, universally adopted in world practice, of the free flow of information. The tactic of compulsorily reserving and grabbing its own radio and television time must be seen as an attempt by a state body to create information privileges for itself. That is, of course, impermissible. In the information field, all participants in a discussion -- sometimes there are several of them in a political struggle -- must nevertheless, in a democratic state, have equal opportunities, and the constitution must provide such opportunities. But that seems too little for the State Duma -- not the whole of the State Duma, of course, but some of it, some groups which think that they must have some special rights to the information space. Politically, this can only be seen as the desire of one branch of power to violate the division of powers which has taken shape and is enshrined in the constitution. We have already experienced such a practice and know the ruinous consequences. They are well known. This tactic by the Supreme Soviet led, in part, to the October events. And it is extremely dangerous to public calm to return once more to those plans for forcibly foisting one's own viewpoints on to the public. In this connection, by making his statement, the president is urging the deputies of the State Duma to display wisdom that is characteristic of many groups and many deputies, and political tact, and, above all, to take account of the lessons of very recent history. The statement must certainly not be seen as some kind of confrontation. It is a calm warning from the president to deputies, so that they should not make mistakes that will rebound on them, above all. I think that deputies must be concerned about their own image if they want the State Duma to be a popular body among the people.
