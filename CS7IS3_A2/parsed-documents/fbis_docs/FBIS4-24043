From Abuja, State House correspondent Ojie Ogbonaya Ojie reports: [Begin recording] [Ojie] Declaring the meeting open, Gen. Abacha said it was part of his administration's consultation with various interest groups and certain segments of society on the state of the nation. [Abacha] As you are aware of, many thought that the events of the past two weeks were going to impact so adversely on our peaceful progress towards the democratic transition. In any way they were right, in that some attempts were indeed made to derail progress in the process, and bring the nation back to the [words indistinct] from which we pulled it on 13th November last year. The (?vigilance) and firm measures taken by security and law enforcement agencies, and the refusal of our citizenry to be made the cannon fodder for the fulfillment of the individual personal ambitions, have combined to foil the plans of those who wish to disrupt our national peace and harmony. [Ojie] Gen. Abacha said it was ironical for all and sundry to hold the military responsible for everything in the society. He said as much, as it was not his intention to respond to the charges and counter accusations being leveled against the military and the process of governance in the country. It was on record, he added, that some of the critics were those who invited his administration to power. [Abacha] The truth of the matter is that some of you here present today, and many who are now pretending otherwise, appealed to us to intervene and arrest the drifting of the (?dark day). Even the representatives of some foreign governments made [words indistinct] appeals to us to save the nation from imminent collapse and disintegration. We have responded patriotically and in consonance with our professional calling. We believe that we have achieved the first major objective of our intervention, that of maintaining the corporate existence of our country as one and indivisible nation, and creating the atmosphere of peace and security in which our people can pursue their legitimate businesses without fear of what tomorrow may bring. [Ojie] Gen. Abacha emphasized the importance of (?private) participation in the constitutional conference, and reaffirmed the commitment and determination of his administration to the restoration of democracy in the country within the shortest possible time. [Abacha] We are now concentrating on (?certain) major objectives of our intervention -- the restoration of democracy in our beloved country. Let none confuse issues or mislead our foreign friends and well-wishers by bringing the (?impression) of the nation in disharmony as far as commitment to democracy is concerned. Civilians or military, politicians or other professionals, we are all as a people yearning for democracy. We are all yearning for the rule of law, a free press, and fundamental human rights. The (?labor) for democracy is nobody's monopoly. It is the wealth of the nation. [Ojie] On the economy, the head of state said that the government was prepared to monitor and review the economic policies and adopt corrective measures where necessary. He blamed the problems facing the implementation of economic policies on greed and exploitation by some businessmen. Gen. Abacha then gave the assurance that the welfare of the people will henceforth remain the main focus of the economic policies of his administration. Top prominent leaders were drawn from each state of the Federation. Some of them include the former vice president, Dr. Alex Ekwueme. [end recording]
