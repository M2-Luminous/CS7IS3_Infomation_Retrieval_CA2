The official said that Washington continues to impose a maritime blockade on the Jordanian port of al-'Aqabah, and it is exerting efforts to keep Jordan in a state of Arab isolation and working to deny the Kingdom U.S. and European financial aid. He pointed out that the U.S. Administration "stepped up its pressure" on Amman after Palestinian-Israeli negotiations faltered following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron, with a view to "reactivating the peace process through the Jordanian-Israeli track." The official warned that these pressures "will have an adverse impact on the negotiations with Israel and weaken the chances of achieving progress on the Jordanian track." A high-level Jordanian authority has said that the United States continues to impose the blockade on the port of al-'Aqabah through the search operations conducted by its warships in the Gulf of Aqaba, despite the U.S. Administration's promises to lift the blockade and secure alternatives to guarantee implementation of the economic embargo imposed on Iraq. He pointed out that Washington "has since the eruption of the Gulf crisis imposed strict surveillance on Jordanian imports and exports to Iraq, without taking any real measures to watch trade exchange between Iran and each of Turkey, Iran, and Syria..., with a view to punishing Jordan for its position during the crisis, using surveillance as an excuse for continuing the pressure on it in the context of the peace process." He pointed out that Washington "completely ignored" the stipulations of the economic embargo resolution, namely the need to compensate the other states harmed by the embargo. He went on to say that the continuing economic pressure on the Kingdom and efforts aimed at keeping Jordan "without any Arab option and pushing it toward Israel will not serve the peace issue in the Middle East." He stressed that "it is no longer a secret that Washington is not satisfied with the rapprochement and coordination between Amman and Damascus in the framework of the peace negotiations" with Israel. Meanwhile, Jordanian liberal deputy 'Abd-al-Karim al-Kabariti has said that Washington insists on keeping Jordan "either on its knees or on the tips of its toes" to ensure that it will implement requirements for the peace process' success "in accordance with the Israeli-U.S. conditions." He stressed that the U.S. pressures, "which include media accusations of Jordan's involvement in providing military aid to Jordan during the Gulf crisis, will not change the principles and constants to which we adhered." He said that these "pressures will fail, just as the pressures exerted on us to participated in the Camp David negotiations failed." He added that the United States, which "used to be a support for Jordan, has now become a burden on it, and it is no longer easy to defend U.S. policy in the region." He defended the Jordanian-Syrian relationship, saying: "The time has come to establish a distinct relationship with Syria in the framework of balanced relations with the Arab states, without establishing one at the expense of another." He pointed out that in current conditions Jordan "needs an essential Arab rear, despite the attempts to keep it isolated from its brothers."
