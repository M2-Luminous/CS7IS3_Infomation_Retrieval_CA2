FR941128-2-00004 FR941128-2-00003 Forest Service Emigrant Wilderness Management Direction, Stanislaus National Forest, Tuolumne County, California AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice; intent to prepare environmental impact statement (EIS). SUMMARY: The Forest Service will prepare an EIS for a proposal to revise current management direction for the 113,000-acre Emigrant Wilderness on the Summit Ranger District, Stanislaus National Forest, Tuolumne County, California DATES: To be most helpful in the preparation of the Draft EIS, comments should be received in writing by April 1, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments and suggestions to Karen Caldwell, District Ranger, Summit Ranger District, # 1 Pinecrest Lake Road, Pinecrest, CA, 95364, (209) 965&hyph;3434. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Cindy Diaz, Team Leader, (209) 965&hyph;3434. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This EIS will evaluate alternatives, including standards and guidelines to assure an enduring resource of Wilderness as described in the 1964 Wilderness Act (U.S.C. 16 1131&hyph;1136). The resulting decision will be utilized to amend the 1991 Stanislaus National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) for Management Area 1, Wilderness. This EIS will include all areas within the Emigrant Wilderness boundary and will not consider Wilderness additions. Preliminary scoping, which was initiated with notification in the Stanislaus National Forest quarterly NEPA summary in spring of 1993, press releases and direct mailings during August of 1993 and a public meeting October 2 of 1993, has resulted in the identification of nine key issues: Ecosystems, Heritage Resources, Fisheries, Economic and Regional Considerations, Social, Range, Wilderness Opportunities, Recreation, and Access. The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. Project mailing list participants from the preliminary scoping efforts receive periodic updates on the planning process along with notifications of public meetings. Glenn Gottschall, acting Stanislaus National Forest Supervisor, is the responsible official, 19777 Greenley Road, Sonora, CA, 95370, (209) 532&hyph;3671. The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public review by October of 1995. The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's Notice of availability appears in the Federal Register. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at that time. To be the most helpful, comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed (see The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3). In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewers' position and contentions. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement. City of Angoon v. Hodel, (9th Circuit, 1986) and Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). The reason for this is to ensure that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final. Dated: November 8, 1994. Glenn Gottschall, Acting Forest Supervisor. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29138 Filed 11&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;11&hyph;M
