In his address, his majesty the king has underscored the grave responsibilities Jordan has been shouldering with all manliness and honor toward all pan-Arab causes, foremost among which is the Palestine question. In this address, His Majesty King Husayn has addressed various historical junctures, and explained in detail the circumstances surrounding these junctures, as well as the historical facts regarding these junctures. He has also spoken of the valuable lessons learned from these junctures. We would like to dwell upon the last one addressed by the king, namely, the ongoing peace process. His majesty the king has explained the peace process thoroughly, provided us with an insight into its future prospects, and underscored the urgent requirements of this phase. The first requirement of this phase in the peace process, which was heralded by a joint Jordanian-Palestinian endeavor, and indeed, by a single political umbrella, is to promote bilateral coordination to the degree that reflects the current state of affairs between two fraternal peoples, who share common aspirations as well as common national woes, not to mention blood relations, history, geography, and joint pan-Arab interests. Courtesy over this vital issue is no longer useful. The brothers are required to meet as soon as possible to address urgent priority issues, and reach a clear agreement that would delineate duties and responsibilities in all clarity and accuracy. This is necessary if Jordan, this steadfast Arab bastion, is to continue to extend its utmost support and assistance to the Palestinian brothers in observance of its strong national and pan-Arab commitments. We are duty bound to say here that the Jordanian-Palestinian coordination lacks the required credibility. It is necessary to shun traditional courtesy to proceed together toward a proper handling of urgent issues, and explore all possible eventualities, particularly since the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli declaration of principles is bound to affect, one way or another, Jordan's present and future. Given all this, it is an inescapable duty to put bilateral coordination in its proper context, and promote it within a firm institutionalized framework that is capable of protecting the interests of Jordanians and Palestinians alike and averting any crises that could burden the strong and firm Jordanian-Palestinian relations at present or in the future in any way whatsoever. The Jordanians and Palestinians, who are brothers, have lived and suffered together. They do not have any doubts about the strenuous efforts Husayn has made throughout the past years to defend this chaste soil. Likewise, they are aware that the Hashemite leadership has made relentless and indefatigable efforts to ensure that the rights are returned to their rightful owners, and avert imminent dangers threatening this nation. The Jordanians and Palestinians will not hesitate to continue the march they have started along the path of unity, which reflects strongly cherished sentiments within the hearts of all of them.
