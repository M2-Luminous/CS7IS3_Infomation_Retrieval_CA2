FR940304-1-00025 FR940304-1-00006 The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: Boeing: Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;212&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 747 series airplanes, having line numbers 201 through 230 inclusive; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent rapid decompression of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Prior to the accumulation of 15,000 total flight cycles or within 1,000 flight cycles after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, perform an external high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection to detect cracking of the skin at the upper row of countersunk fasteners in the longitudinal lap joints of Stringer (S&hyph;)12L and S&hyph;12R from station 520 to station 741.1, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2366, dated August 6, 1992. (1) If no cracking is found, repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 4,000 flight cycles until the replacement of fasteners required by paragraph (b) of this AD is accomplished. (2) If any cracking is found, prior to further flight, repair in accordance with the 747 Structural Repair Manual. After repair, repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 4,000 flight cycles until the replacement of fasteners required by paragraph (b) of this AD is accomplished. (b) Prior to the accumulation of 20,000 total flight cycles or within 4 years after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, replace the countersunk fasteners in the upper row of the longitudinal lap joints of S&hyph;12L and S&hyph;12R from station 520 to station 741.1 with protruding head fasteners in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2366, dated August 6, 1992. Replacement of these fasteners constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspections required by paragraph (a) of this AD. (c) Prior to the accumulation of 10,000 total flight cycles after replacement of the countersunk fasteners required by paragraph (b) of this AD, perform an external HFEC inspection to detect cracking of the skin at the upper row of protruding head fasteners in the longitudinal lap joints of S&hyph;12L and S&hyph;12R from station 520 to station 741.1 in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2366, dated August 6, 1992. (1) If no cracking is found, repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight cycles. (2) If any cracking is found, prior to further flight, repair in accordance with the 747 Structural Repair Manual. After repair, repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight cycles. (d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO. (e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on February 28, 1994. Darrell M. Pederson, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
