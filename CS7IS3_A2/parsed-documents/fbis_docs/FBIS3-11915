Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia were there in a clear expression of the Group of Three's [G-3] firm intention to expand its sphere of commercial influence to the Caribbean. The Caribbean Common Market, Caricom, sponsor of the idea, presided over the meeting of experts and drafted the AEC charter, which is scheduled to be signed by heads of state and government in Barbados next July. Cuba and the Dominican Republic, which have long been trying to join Caricom, sent high-level delegations headed by deputy ministers and expressed their special interest in expediting their integration with the English-speaking Antillean states and the rest of the Caribbean Basin member countries. In addition, the disparity between the insular Caribbean states and the so-called Latin American intermediate powers, represented by the G-3, the powerful members in the future AEC, could only be offset by maintaining indefinitely the current protective approach by these powers in their relationship with the Antilleans. The Jamaica meeting defined terms such as categories of participation, membership, goals, main bodies, decisionmaking bodies, and financing, all key elements in starting the organization, which will include some 38 territories. One of the most intensely debated points was the degree of participation in AEC, where relatively developed countries share membership with countries barely out of metropolitan tutelage, a few of which still are colonial possessions. Apart from the structural differences among the members, there persists a consensus on the need to create the AEC as soon as possible as a general protection measure against the difficult times ahead that will result from large economic and commercial blocs. Cuba's participation in AEC, something to which the United States objects, was supported by a tacit consensus among the participating experts at the Jamaica meeting. Caricom and G-3 leaders, however, had already made a political decision about Cuba's participation as early as 1992. Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Ramon Sanchez Parodi said in Kingston: "Cuba believes it has the duty and obligation to fully support the efforts to create the AEC in light of Cuba's cultural, geographic, historic, and economic ties with the area countries." In addition, Mexico, through its delegate Ambassador Luis Ortiz Monasterio, said it intends to support this effort and to strive to eliminate any obstacles that could hinder the creation of the AEC. In the opinion of the experts drafting the document to create the AEC, another meeting might be necessary before the proposal is approved at the ministerial level. Once that stage is complete, the presidents of the member countries will officially create the AEC during the 15th Caricom summit in Barbados in July. This organization, devoted to stimulating cooperation and commercial, cultural, economic, educational, and environmental exchange, as well as political consensus among its member countries, will for the first time begin to paint the dissimilar faces of the countries looking toward the coasts of this sea or immersed in its waters with the emerald shade of the Caribbean.
