FR940617-0-00122 FR940617-0-00026 A. Applicability The regulations of today's action apply to all new nonroad CI engines at or above 37 kW with certain exemptions and exclusions. Hereafter the engines included in this rule will be referred to as ``large nonroad CI engines.'' The vast majority of large nonroad CI engines currently being used and manufactured are diesel-fueled engines. The use of alternative fuels by nonroad engines will not be necessary to meet the emission standards. However, these regulations apply to large nonroad CI engines regardless of the fuel that is used (for example, diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), rapeseed, methanol, ethanol, and blends). Provisions have been included which allow manufacturers to apply for Administrator approval of alternative test procedures if fuel other than diesel is to be used. B. Standards EPA is adopting the proposed NO X emission and smoke standards for all large nonroad CI engines at or above 37 kW produced on or after the implementation dates presented below. Furthermore, EPA is adopting standards for HC, CO, and PM emissions for engines at or above 130 kW, consistent with those standards adopted by California in sections 2420&hyph;2427, chapter 11, title 13 of the California Code of Regulations, ``California Regulation for New 1996 and Later Heavy-duty Off-road Diesel Cycle Engines.'' All standards and units have been converted to metric in the final rule (discussed in more detail in section VI.A.). For ease of use, the tables below and in section V.C. show the English units parenthetically. The metric units, however, are the units used in the regulations and thus all affected parties must follow these units in complying with the standards promulgated today. ␣ 1Net Power kW(Hp) 1HC g/kW-hr (g/bH p-hr) 1CO g/kW-hr (g/bH p-hr) 1NO X g/kW-hr (g/bH p-hr) 1PM g/kW-hr (g/bH p-hr) 1Smoke A/L/P1 (Percent) ≥130 (≥175) 1.3 11.4 9.2 0.54 20/15/50 ␣ (1.0) (8.5) (6.9) (0.4) ≥75 to =130 (≥100 to <175) 9.2 20/15/50 ␣ ␣ ␣ (6.9) ≥37 to <75 (≥50 to <100) 9.2 20/15/50 ␣ ␣ ␣ (6.9) 1Smoke Opacity Standards are reported in terms of percent opacity during an acceleration mode, a lug mode and the peak opacity on either the acceleration or lug modes. In addition, EPA is prepared to propose and adopt additional standards for HC, CO, and PM emissions for engines from 37 kW to less than 130 kW consistent with those to be adopted by the European Community (EEC) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) as soon as these groups finalize their requirements for HC, CO, and PM emissions. The European standards are currently projected to be as follows:
