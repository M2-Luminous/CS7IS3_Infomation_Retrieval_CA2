The conference relayed the guidelines of the national united front work conference and made requirements for strengthening the united front's role in reform and strengthening the party's leadership over the united front work. Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee, made a speech at the conference. He said: The united front work department has the key functions for promoting unity, carrying forward socialist democracy, safeguarding social stability, narrowing the contacts between the party and the masses, strengthening the construction of the state political power, and promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland. So, the united front work department is the key to building the socialist theory and engaging in socialist practice. The united front work, which is related to the overall situation, must merely be developed but not be suspended. The party should only strengthen but not weaken the leadership over the united front work. Sun Weiben stressed: According to the situation and the tasks ahead of the united front in the new historical age, we know that strengthening and improving the leadership of the party should mainly be reflected by ideological guidance, organizational leadership, policy guidance, collective consultation, and the attention of the whole party. That is, we should persistently use Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to guide the united front work and to provide the united front work with a favorable organizational guarantee. We should be good at using policy means to carry out the united front work, persist in and be good at perfecting the political consultation and democratic supervision system, and further rely on the forces of the whole party and the whole society to achieve the united front work. At the conference, Shan Rongfan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered a report entitled "Clearly Understand the New Situation And Blaze New Trails."
