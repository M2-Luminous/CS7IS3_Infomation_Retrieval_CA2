FR941107-2-00044 FR941107-2-00011 [A&hyph;405&hyph;071] Viscose Rayon Staple Fiber From Finland; Termination of Administrative Review and Revocation of Antidumping Finding AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of termination of Administrative Review and Revocation of Antidumping Finding. SUMMARY: In accordance with the decision of the United States Court of International Trade (the Court), in Kemira Fibres Oy v. United States , 18 CIT XXXX , Slip Op. 94&hyph;139 (September 8, 1994), the Department of Commerce (the Department) is now revoking the antidumping finding on viscose rayon staple fiber (the fiber) from Finland, terminating the 1993&hyph;94 antidumping duty administrative review of the finding, and ending the suspension of liquidation of entries of all imports of the fiber. The Department is taking these actions, rather than suspend liquidation of the subject merchandise during the pendency of appeal, because the instant decision was issued pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1581(i), the Court's residual jurisdictional authority, rather than pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1516a, the Court's general jurisdictional authority. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 7, 1994. FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Matthew Blaskovich or Zev Primor, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;5831/4114. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 21, 1979, the United States Treasury Department published in the Federal Register the antidumping finding on the fiber from Finland (44 FR 17156). The Department conducted administrative reviews of the fiber until 1988. However, no reviews of the fiber were conducted for the next five consecutive years ( i.e ., for the period March 1988 through February 1993) because no interested party requested an administrative review. On June 3, 1993, the Department published in the Federal Register a notice of intent to revoke the finding. See Rayon Staple Fiber from Finland; Intent to Revoke Antidumping Finding (58 FR 31504). On June 28, 1993, two U.S. domestic producers of the fiber objected to the proposed revocation within the time specified in the foregoing Federal Register notice. On March 4, 1994, the Department published in the Federal Register a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' for the period March 1, 1993 through February 28, 1994 (59 FR 10368). On March 29, 1994, two domestic producers requested that the Department conduct an administrative review of Kemira Fibres Oy (Kemira). On July 13, 1994, Kemira filed an action to enjoin the Department from conducting the review, claiming that the Department was required to revoke the finding as of April 1, 1993, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii), because the Department did not publish in the Federal Register a notice of ``Intent to Revoke Finding'' by March 1, 1993, the first day of the fifth consecutive anniversary month in which no administrative reviews were requested and no interested party objected to revocation or requested an administrative review by the last day of the fifth consecutive anniversary month.
