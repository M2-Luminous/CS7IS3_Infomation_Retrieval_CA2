Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee and Mayor Li Qiyan gave important speeches. Recently, some citizens have noticed the rise in the prices of grains and cereal oil and some grain shops have failed to guarantee normal supply. The municipal party committee and government have paid great attention to this and have promptly adopted measures and devised plans. In a speech, Li Qiyan pointed out: Pricing is a major issue, affecting the immediate interests of the masses and the smooth progress of reform, which we must give great attention. The grain and pricing departments and all districts must conscientiously implement the central guidelines and immediately adopt economic and necessary administrative means to stabilize the prices of grains, cereal oil, vegetables, meat, and eggs. It will be good for the overall situation and stability when prices are stable. The grain departments should have a sense of the overall situation, do their work well on their own initiative, and should not only consider the interests of their own departments and trades. At present, some state grain shops have taken the lead in raising grain prices. This is a very serious problem that must be checked. He stressed: To develop the socialist market economy, the government grain and cereal oil management departments and state enterprises should have something to do. They must conduct macroeconomic regulation and control and give play to their role as the main channels. Some comrades are confused about this, so they must seek unity in ideology and understanding. All departments and various districts and counties should make concerted efforts, adopt practical measures, effectively stabilize the commodity prices, keep abreast of the market information and grass-roots situation in a timely manner, and guarantee that the masses will have a happy new year and Spring Festival. Executive Vice Mayor Wang Baosen also gave a speech in which he noted: At present, there is an ample supply of grains, cereal oil, and other commodities across the municipality and the market supply will be guaranteed. State-run grain and cereal oil departments should give play to their role as the main channels. Meanwhile, the municipal authorities will adopt resolute measures; implement strict measures to set the prices of grains, cereal oil, vegetables, meat, and eggs, which are essential for residents; and will sell some major variety of vegetables at a fixed price. The marketing unit must strictly implement these measures and the relevant departments must strengthen inspection and strictly investigate, handle, and expose those units that recklessly raise prices. In his speech, Chen Xitong stressed: The socialist market economy must have a sound macroeconomic regulation and control system. We must seek unity in the understanding of this. Leaders at all levels and all departments must conscientiously study the decisions of the central authorities on some issues concerning the establishment of the socialist market economic system and never forget their own functions in macroeconomic regulation and control. These arbitrary price increases in some units are absolutely man-made. Now that the grain reserves are abundant, the production is fine, and the purchasing situation is good, what makes them increase prices? This is caused by their abnormal market prediction psychology. Some grain departments failed to promptly adopt measures to keep the prices stable and misunderstood the meaning of market economy. They believed that decontrolling the grain prices means not interfering with the prices regardless of the consequences and that market regulation and control means following the beaten track. All these understandings are wrong. The socialist market economy is not a nongovernment economy, but one with macroeconomic regulation and control. This practice is a good chance for study. We should learn how to successfully conduct macroeconomic regulation and control in the course of developing the socialist market economy. Chen Xitong pointed out: We should combine reform with stability; give simultaneous attention to reform, development, and stability; and guard against one-sidedness. Arbitrary price hikes will affect other sectors, the stable situation, and the good environment. Beijing is the capital. All departments, districts, and counties should have the sense of the capital, consider the overall situation, make concerted efforts, adopt effective measures, stabilize the prices of grains and cereal oil; and let the common people enjoy an ease of mind in buying and have a happy new year and Spring Festival. This is a good thing we can do for the masses. Municipal leaders, including Zhang Baifa, Duan Bingren, Meng Xuenong, Duan Qiang, and Fan Yuanmou also attended the meeting.
