Many large banks reacted immediately by hiking their prime rate to which most private adjustable interest rate loans are linked. While the markets on Wall Street celebrated the interest rate raise as the last parity change for the time being with a strong rise in stock prices, the dollar remained surprisingly weak. Voices warning about a return to growing unemployment are getting louder. Indeed, there are hardly any statistics that justify a hike in interest rates in the United States at a time when they are dropping in other countries, especially Germany. Neither prices nor wages are rising unduly, the overheated growth of the fourth quarter is already cooling off perceptibly, and tight industrial capacities are still not in sight. Rather, only Wall Street and the Federal Reserve heard dissonant inflation melodies, which completely upset their elegant interest rate and course tango of recent years. As the markets see it, the Federal Reserve at first moved too soon with its interest steps, and then not fast enough. It appears that with the latest move, the Fed and security markets are again in step, at least temporarily. The consequences for the economy, however, cannot yet be foreseen. In the last months, the rates for long-term fixed mortgages rose by two full percentage points. The prime rate, officially the standard interest rate for short-term loans to major businesses, which today is of much greater importance as the computation basis for adjustable interest loans, climbed from 6 to 7.25 percent. The number of refinancings of old mortgages recently dropped steeply, and new real estate loans became so expensive that tens of thousands of home buyers were forced out of the market. The predictions for construction of new homes this year have already been corrected downward, and there are long faces among furniture and home appliance manufacturers. How long the Fed will be able to pursue its course, shifted from "stimulative" to "economy-neutral," depends on various factors. About four-fifths of economic activities in the United States are private, the rest are governmental. In view of the fact that the government share, which strongly expanded in the 1980's, has been shrinking since 1991, economic development more than ever depends on private enterprise, and hence especially on private households. These already suffer from the continued downsizing in many companies, and are now additionally facing higher loan interest rates. At the moment, nobody knows how this will further dampen employment. Also uncomfortable is the weak reaction of the foreign exchange markets which assessed the value of the dollar lower, despite the opposite interest rate moves in Germany and the United States. The threat from this side, which might force the Fed into further interest rate hikes, has not yet been averted.
