Transportation livestock means livestock used as pack and saddle stock for travel on National Forest System lands and other lands under Forest Service control. Unauthorized use means livestock use on National Forest System lands or other lands under Forest Service control that is not authorized by a grazing permit, or an amendment or modification thereto. ยง222.3 Framework for rangeland planning and decisions. (a) Forest plan direction. Planning for management of rangelands is accomplished through the land and resource management planning process set out in 36 CFR part 219. Forest plans establish programmatic direction including goals, objectives, standards, and guidelines for rangeland management and identify National Forest System lands suitable for livestock grazing. A suitability determination is not a decision to authorize grazing. (b) Rangeland project decisions. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a rangeland project decision is required when site-specific activities designed to accomplish a specific, on-the-ground purpose or result are proposed which implements the programmatic management direction in the forest plan. (1) Examples of rangeland project decisions include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) Maintenance or modification of specific plant communities or riparian, aquatic, soil, or other resource conditions needed to promote the achievement of goals and objectives of the forest plan. (ii) Rangeland improvements needed to promote the achievement of goals and objectives of the forest plan. (iii) Authorization of livestock grazing where grazing is suitable and appropriate. A rangeland project decision authorizing livestock grazing must specify the maximum permissible amount of grazing use, the timing and duration of such use, and other appropriate livestock management requirements or measures needed to promote the achievement of goals and objectives of the forest plan. (2) Rangeland project decisions must be consistent with applicable forest plan standards and guidelines. (3) Rangeland project decisions are decision points subject to NEPA procedures. Where a rangeland project decision authorizes livestock grazing, timely issuance of the grazing permit based on the rangeland project decision is an administrative act and not a separate decision. (c) Transitional procedures for authorizing grazing use. In the absence of a rangeland project decision that addresses livestock grazing use, the authorized officer may issue a grazing permit in accordance with the following transitional procedures: (1) The authorized officer may issue a new term permit for up to ten years where there is a current allotment management plan adopted prior to [180 days from date of publication of the final rule] and the analysis and disclosure of environmental effects are still current. (2) On those allotments for which there is no current allotment management plan but which are meeting, or moving toward achievement of, forest plan goals and objectives, the authorized officer may issue a new term permit for up to ten years based on the forest plan, provided that the plan contains applicable standards and guidelines that can be incorporated as terms and conditions of the permit and that the environmental effects of applying the standards and guidelines on the land are analyzed and disclosed pursuant to NEPA procedures. (3) On those allotments for which there is no allotment management plan or current NEPA disclosure and the allotments are meeting, or moving toward achievement of, forest plan goals and objectives, but the forest plan does not contain applicable standards and guidelines that can be incorporated into the permit, the authorized officer shall issue a term permit not exceeding three years in duration to authorize the continuation of grazing. This interim period will permit the agency to gather information and conduct necessary analysis to determine if grazing should be authorized or a different permit term should be established. In such cases, the environmental effects of continuing grazing under a 1&hyph;3 year term permit must be analyzed and disclosed pursuant to NEPA procedures prior to issuance of the permit. (4) On those allotments for which there is no allotment management plan or current NEPA disclosure, and the allotments are not meeting or moving toward achievement of forest plan goals and objectives, the authorized officer may not issue a term permit of more than three years in duration until a rangeland project decision and disclosure of environmental effects is accomplished. In the interim, the authorized officer may issue a term permit of up to three years in duration provided that the terms and conditions of the permit include existing or amended forest plan standards and guidelines or other measures necessary to move management of the allotment toward achievement of forest plan goals and objectives. In such case, the environmental effects of continuing grazing under the 1&hyph;3 year term permit must be analyzed and disclosed pursuant to NEPA procedures prior to issuance of the permit. (5) Where authorization of livestock grazing is made pursuant to paragraphs (c) (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, the authorized officer shall develop and maintain a schedule for completing rangeland project decisions and site specific disclosure of environmental effects on affected allotments pursuant to NEPA procedures. The authorized officer shall develop this schedule in consultation with the grazing permittees and other interested parties. Priority for scheduling the completion of rangeland project decisions shall be given to those areas with significant resource concerns such as protection of threatened and endangered species, riparian and aquatic habitats, and water quality. (6) Where grazing permits are issued under the transitional procedures of paragraphs (c) (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, the timely issuance of a grazing permit is an administrative act and not a separate decision.
