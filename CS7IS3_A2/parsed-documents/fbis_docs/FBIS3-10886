As happened during the time of Jorge Serrano's Official Commission, the URNG General Command did not fully cooperate to enable the signing of the agreements. When one wishes to analyze the causes of the new failure to advance in bringing peace to the country, it stands out that the hard line represented by Commanders Rolando Moran of the EGP [Poor People's Guerrilla Army] and Pablo Monsanto of the FAR [Rebel Armed Forces] is not in tune with "politicians" Carlos Gonzalez (PGT) [Guatemala Labor Party] and Gaspar Ilom [Rodrigo Asturias Amado] (ORPA) [Revolutionary Organization of the People in Arms], whose public statements are different. The URNG leadership failed to realize that at the bargaining table they are being gratuitously offered more than they have been able to achieve militarily in the past three decades of armed struggle. At the very least, they had and have within their grasp the signing of a human rights agreement which would benefit all the people who are ultimately the ones bearing the cost of the war. It is as if the Guatemalan insurgents were not taking into consideration that with these talks they are assured a greater active role, similar to one they would have attained had they reached a tie with the Guatemalan Army, as happened in El Salvador. It would seem the Guatemalan insurgents fail to realize that at this point in the 1990's internal strife is totally trivial and that our country could continue adrift or with a well-defined course with its dramas and tragedies, triumphs, joys, and comedies, even if the rebels continue their activities. The guerrilla leaders should also keep in mind that a unique characteristic of Guatemala's social structure is that approximately 70 percent of the population is less than 30 years old and that most of the people live immersed in their daily problems influenced by the dizzying evolution of the world and are far from caring about knowing the roots of the ideological conflict that emerged in the 1960's. More important than that is to realize that although the government is giving the URNG a deal similar to the one the Salvadoran Government accorded the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], the conditions prevailing in each case are radically different. For example, El Salvador had a war economy. The U.S. subsidy that maintained the conflict between the Army and the rebels was large; infrastructure was 90 percent destroyed; the need for financial resources for reconstruction following the war was and is more than enormous; elections were sabotaged by over 80 percent; the correlation of forces between the Army and rebels was evident; over 90 percent of local governments in the strife-torn areas were dissolved; a military balance existed; the rebels controlled liberated zones; the rebels had a force comparable in many cases with the Army; they had sophisticated weaponry with a large-scale capacity for offensive operations that they took to San Salvador, even to [Salvadoran President] Cristiani's home; and among other things they had the clear support and acceptance of the people. In making a comparative analysis and drawing parallels between the neighboring country's situation and ours, it is easy to see the differences are marked and substantial. To conclude, the shortsighted guerrillas and the government give the impression that they have forgotten that more important than signing a peace accord and the absence of an armed confrontation, it is essential to hasten a solution to the problems of poverty that hurt over eight out of every 10 Guatemalans. As this century draws to an end, it is basic to create an equal opportunity framework for all Guatemalans that ensures each citizen has the same starting point when he begins his dramatic struggle for a more dignified life.
