According to PPS press spokesman Andrzej Ziemski the congress marked the final stage in the unification of the independent PPS, the reborn PPS and Jan Mulak's PPS. Leaders of all the fractions were elected to the party leadership. The PPS led by Piotr Ikonowicz which has 3 parliamentary deputies was not represented at the congress. Miroslaw Krajewski who was elected chairman of the central executive committee hoped that Ikonowicz's PPS and the "Freedom, Equality, Independence" group would unite with the unified PPS during the second round of the congress in autumn. The PPS supports the reform of the hitherto existing system in Poland wanting a far-reaching economic transformation. It does not accept that this has to be accompanied by growing poverty and stark social inequalities. "If we do not work out a democratic method of social agreement for solving the most difficult problems we are threatened with the danger of anarchy or authoritarian government," the party programme states. Krajewski blamed the government coalition for the current strikes. Guest at the congress, OPZZ Union Federation leader Ewa Spychalska said that Solidarity and the OPZZ had the same matters to sort out but Solidarity's methods (i.e. widespread strikes) were unacceptable. Another guest at the congress, former OPZZ leader, now leader of the Movement of Working People (RLP), Alfred Miodowicz, stressed that the left had no character and that it apologised too much. Krajewski, who is a Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) parliamentary deputy, said that various colourful and well-defined groupings needed to be formed within the SLD if it was not to fall apart. On Monday Mulak had stressed that the 30th congress was a continuation of the tradition of struggle for independence and socialism (the first PPS congress was held in 1892).
