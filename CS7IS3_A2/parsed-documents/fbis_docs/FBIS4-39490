He refused to qualify the situation with Crimea as a "conflict," a "dispute," or a "constitutional crisis," but only as a situation that has arisen because of the nonconformity of Ukraine's legislation with that of the autonomous republic. Volodymyr Butkevych gave assurances that there no particular claims and demands were made by either side during the talks. Difficulties only arose because both sides have a different interpretation of the same articles of the law. In his words, the results of the working group's stay in Crimea are set out in a document which contains a provision on the nonconformity of some legislative acts of the Supreme Council of Crimea with Ukrainian legislation. The working commissions of both parliaments should, within two weeks (by 15 June), submit proposals with regard to this for consideration by the two Supreme Councils. The joint working group asked the parliaments of Ukraine and Crimea to refrain from actions that could influence the commission's work, and also asked president Meshkov of Crimea to contribute to the commission's work. In the words of Volodymyr Butkevych, the working group, headed by Volodymyr Stretovych, chairman of the Supreme Council Commission for Issues of Legal Policy and Judicial and Legal Reform, left today for Crimea in order to continue coordinating the work. In reply to a question whether Volodymyr Butkevych could foresee the possibility of a referendum in Crimea on its secession from Ukraine, he said that, according to international law, a change in the public power in Crimea is the prerogative of the entire Ukrainian people. A plebiscite of the whole Ukrainian population and not a referendum of just the Crimean population should be held on this. Speaking about the possibility of recognizing the Majles of the Crimean Tatar people as a body of higher authority in Crimea, Volodymyr Butkevych noted that even the UN [United Nations] does not have a common viewpoint on whether an indigenous population has a right to self-determination on its historical homeland. Opponents of such a viewpoint argue that almost all conflicts in the world have erupted on these grounds. Volodymyr Butkevych noted that in Crimea this issue has not been discussed at an official level. Replying to a question from UNIAN on the expediency of suspending Crimea's economic laws, which were passed by its parliament after 19 May, and also on a request to forecast the actions of Crimea's parliament after the end of the period of elaborating proposals with regard to making the legislation conform, Volodymyr Butkevych said that the Crimean MP's confess that the laws which they have adopted have not yet been implemented. He also stressed that the Supreme Council of Ukraine and not the Supreme Council of Crimea would have the last word after the end of the agreement period (15 June). However, he is convinced that every ground exists for consent to be reached between the parliaments. The only thing which could be an obstacle is the short time available (two weeks), during which proposals should be prepared. But he is convinced that in that case, there could be discussion on extending the period. Volodymyr Butkevych said that during the talks, the Crimean side expressed the wish to form another commission, with the participation of Ukrainian economists Volodymyr Lanovyy and Viktor Pynzenyk, which would study economic relations between Ukraine and Crimea.
