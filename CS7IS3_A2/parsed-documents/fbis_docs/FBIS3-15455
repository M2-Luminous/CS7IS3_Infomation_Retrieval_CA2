The voice sounded calm and seemed not to have changed at all. Vice President [as published] Aleksandr Rutskoy said that he would not grant an interview to journalists for a month, but he did not refuse to speak to IZVESTIYA's correspondent. [Ivanidze] What do you intend to do? [Rutskoy] I want to see how the land lies. I want to understand what is happening around me now. In my view, the picture is rather dismal. They have been quite unable to abandon police methods. Everything remains as in former times. My telephone is tapped, believe me. External observation is hardly concealed. Not that all this is so terrible.... But what happened last October.... I believe that time will judge us. [Rutskoy ends] When he started speaking of the October events, I admit I was prepared to hear the usual accusatory words in such situations. We are the good guys, and they are the bad guys. The vice president must be given his due. This did not happen. At a certain moment it even seemed to me that Rutskoy was tormented not so much by the bitterness of political defeat as by the deaths of the people who took his side. "The most terrible thing is that people died. They were not a rabble, as is being written. They were normal young people of very diverse professions.... It could all have been different," Aleksandr Vladimirovich said. It is interesting that throughout the conversation he did not once mention his court actions against IZVESTIYA. Even when I asked him about the court and the millions of rubles in compensation, he did not at once understand what I was talking about. "ARGUMENTY I FAKTY telephoned me and asked me to drop the case. But I cannot do that. I could not reply to anyone when I was held in Lefortovo, when all these `documents' were published.... I don't want money. I want apologies." Does the vice president understand that after the elections to the State Duma he has become the most dangerous person for everyone? That the "spiritual" opposition, having secured seats in the Duma, now sees him as a serious rival to its leaders in the next presidential election? The amnesty puts Rutskoy in the position of someone on a gallows who could have the stool kicked from under his feet at any moment. When I told Rutskoy that even the communist PRAVDA speaks of him as a general sent by Yeltsin into the opposition in order to split it, Rutskoy took a deep breath and said with irritation: "You know, I lost faith in all sorts of `-isms' even before people started handing in their party cards."
