FR940621-0-00004 FR940621-0-00002 Currently, the regulations require that dark sweet cherries such as Bing cherries, the predominant variety grown in the production area, meet certain grade, size, pack and container requirements. Such cherries are also required to be inspected. Light sweet cherries, including the Rainier variety, are currently exempt from these requirements. The Rainier variety was developed at Washington State University's Irrigated Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Prosser, Washington, and was first released to the Northwest cherry industry in 1960. Rainiers were initially used primarily as canning cherries. However, since the 1980s, production of the Rainier variety for the fresh market has increased substantially. Less than 600 tons were marketed fresh in 1987, but that increased to 1,543 tons in 1989 and 1,937 tons in 1992. A record crop of 2,427 tons was marketed in 1993, about 5 percent of Washington's total sweet cherry crop. As the Rainier variety gained in importance as a fresh market cherry, the Washington cherry industry began to consider the need to establish minimum standards of size and quality for the variety. At its December 15, 1993, meeting, the committee made its first recommendation to regulate Rainier cherries. Specifically, the committee recommended that a minimum size requirement be established at 101/2 row size (1 inch in diameter) for fresh market shipments of Rainier variety cherries. No minimum maturity requirement was recommended at that time, although concerns were expressed about ensuring that only ripe cherries be marketed. Subsequent to the December meeting, the Department received correspondence from 19 cherry producers, packers, and marketers concerning the committee's recommended regulation. The majority (13 of 19) were in favor of the recommendation, and 6 were in opposition to regulating the Rainier variety. Comments supporting the proposed minimum size requirement stated that such a regulation would be in the best interests of producers. Growing Rainier cherries is more labor intensive and costly than producing other varieties. Producers need to offer a quality product in order to recoup these higher production costs. The sale of small, immature cherries results in buyer dissatisfaction, which reduces repeat purchases and damages the market for all cherries. Good cultural practices (e.g., proper pruning) will result in acceptable sizes. Fruit quality and maturity are enhanced by fruit size. Those opposed to the recommendation stated that it would reduce the volume of Rainier cherries permitted to be marketed fresh, thus reducing returns on the crop. Further, they stated that taste and appearance are more important to cherry buyers than size. Those in opposition also claimed that a minimum size requirement would be detrimental to producers who farm at higher elevations, where fruit tends to be smaller, but may be sweeter. Given the lack of industry consensus on this issue, the Department asked the committee to reconsider the need to regulate Rainier variety cherries, particularly in light of the concerns raised in the above-mentioned letters. The committee met again on March 15, 1994, and rescinded its earlier recommendation. The committee recommended a lower size requirement_at least 11 row size (61/64 inch in diameter)_coupled with a minimum maturity requirement of 17 percent soluble solids. The vote on this recommendation was 13 to 1, with the dissenting voter in favor of a smaller minimum size of 111/2 row (57/64 inch in diameter). The Rainier cherry is distinct from other cherry varieties marketed by the Washington cherry industry. It is a yellow-colored cherry, with some rosy blush. It is considered a specialty item, compared with the darker colored varieties. The committee reports the costs of producing and handling Rainier cherries are higher than those associated with other cherry varieties. Rainier cherry trees need to be pruned more heavily than other cherry trees to ensure acceptable sized fruit. Rainier cherry trees are picked several times during a season, reflecting the fact that not all the fruit matures at the same time and that the cherries will not ripen after harvest. Rainier cherries are also fragile and susceptible to damage during handling. Thus, most Rainier cherries are sorted and packed by hand. Rainier cherries are typically marketed from mid-June through July. AMS Market News data show that prices are highest for the earliest offerings of these cherries, and that such prices decline as the season progresses. In 1992, for example, the opening f.o.b. price on June 18 was $35.00 per carton. This declined to $25.00 to $28.00 per carton a week later, and f.o.b. prices were $22.00 to $28.00 per carton at season's end. This price trend serves as an incentive for producers to harvest early, which has resulted in immature, sour Rainier cherries being marketed. The committee reports that cherry size and quality are important to buyers. Consistency and dependability are equally important. Shipments of immature, low quality, under-sized Rainier cherries in recent seasons have resulted in disappointment by buyers and consumers. This reduces repeat purchases, and results in declines in prices and overall sales volumes. The general consensus of the industry is that some mandatory quality standards are needed to ensure buyer confidence. Voluntary standards have been unsuccessful. Cherry size is related to maturity and other quality factors. That is, larger sized cherries tend to be sweeter and of higher overall quality. This is supported by prices received for different sizes of Bing cherries. Market News data show that f.o.b. prices for 12 row sized Bings (54/64 inch diameter) averaged about $15.00 per carton in mid-June 1992. At the same time, 101/2 row sized (1 inch diameter) Bings were selling for about $25.00 per carton. This price relationship held steady throughout the season. Further, the committee has conducted research that shows that larger sizes correlate with higher maturity levels, and that larger sizes are preferred by cherry consumers. While research results and prices by size specifically for Rainier variety cherries are currently unavailable, industry consensus is that the same relationships are true for Rainier cherries. The Washington cherry industry promotes the sale of Rainier variety cherries through the Washington State Fruit Commission (WSFC), a State research and promotion program funded by industry assessments. The WSFC publicizes the current voluntary 1-inch minimum size standard for Rainier variety cherries in its promotion efforts. The WSFC has reported that it receives buyer complaints when such standards are not upheld. For example, three large retail chains cancelled all of their in-store promotions of Rainier variety cherries planned for the 1993 season due to the receipt of small, immature Rainier cherries early in the season. Thus, the industry believes it needs to establish minimum size and maturity standards to protect its investment in promoting the crop.
