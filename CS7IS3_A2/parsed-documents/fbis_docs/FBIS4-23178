From May 10, when President Nelson Mandela was inaugurated, administration of provincial and homeland laws reverted to central government. Until the president gives these powers, and several other functions the provinces are entitled to under the constitution, they are unable to govern. Every function, from filling vacancies in schools to buying equipment, now requires the approval of the government. "The whole system is as clear as mud at the moment. Premiers and executive councils cannot take a decision with any binding effect," one provincial official said this week. "We want our powers. We are under enormous pressure to show our constituencies that we are effective governments and can deliver on the promises of the reconstruction and development programme," Eastern Transvaal Premier Mathews Phosa said. KwaZulu Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose said the delay was causing serious problems. "The civil service is continuing but the direction that should be given by the ministers is hampered. Ministers are not really ministers without the powers that should be given to them," he said. [Orange] Free State Premier Patrick "Terror" Lekota said it was impacting on his government. "Some questions coming from the ground -- I can't deal with them. People may want salary adjustment, or promotions," he said. The provinces had to apply within 14 days of the election of their premiers for their powers and this was complied with. However, at a meeting of the premiers with representatives from government in Cape Town on Wednesday, they were told there was a mass of red tape to unwind before they could receive any powers. There appear to be two problems. The first is that the government has to decide which functions will be performed by itself and which by the provinces. Existing legislation needs to be deciphered and rationalised. The second is that the provinces must have the structures to administer these laws. Crucial to this is the establishment of provincial treasury departments to control expenditure. But there will first have to be a rationalisation of the central government, provincial and homeland civil services. Sources at the meeting said the premiers were united in demanding their powers. They said that North West Premier Popo Molefe was "living" while PWV premier Tokyo Sexwale was frustrated. They said Mr Sexwale told Public Service and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya: "I left my legislature in the belief that I would receive the powers we need to show people that there is government in place that can attend to the needs of the communities. And here I am being told that more work needs to be done and am being sent back empty-handed." A special commission on provincial government to assist in transferring powers was appointed on Friday. Mr Phosa said he was governing in terms of the common law until the power were transferred. "I am acting on the principle that the president would have behaved in the same way were he faced with the same problem," he said. Mr Lekota said that while his government was being hampered by the lack of executive power, this was only a "passing phase". He said a public service act, enabling the provinces to appoint staff and set up administrations, would be passed soon. However, KwaZulu Natal MEC [Member of Executive Council] for Local Government and Housing, Mr Peter Miller, was less sanguine. "The executive councils of all nine provinces have no power on any issue which is scheduled by the constitution to be in their competence. This is leading to a total paralysis in government. "There isn't a clear understanding in certain areas that provinces are big government business and cannot be left in a vacuum," he said. Western Cape Housing Minister Gerald Morkel said it appeared the transfer would be delayed until all the provinces had the necessary infrastructure. "We are unhappy about his ... we can't afford to be tied down because of the incapacity of other provinces to handle functions," he said. A provincial official said that the government would be holding meetings with the provinces during the next two weeks. A plenary session with the premiers will be held on June 9.
