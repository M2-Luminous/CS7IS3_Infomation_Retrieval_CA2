Saying it is only too natural that at a time when figures of various strata are visiting Pyongyang from other countries, concerned over the acute situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula, the president of a South Korean opposition party wants to visit Pyongyang to meet with fellow countrymen, Yang Hyong-sop said: Taking note of the fact that president Yi Ki-taek, who had expressed the hope for a visit to Pyongyang more than once from the beginning of the year, expressed again his intention to visit Pyongyang as "a special envoy," I view this as an expression of the spirit national independence for averting the danger of war facing the nation and ushering in a bright future of the nation through dialogue and negotiation by pooling wisdom and strength of leading politicians of the North and the South. So, I think that he may visit Pyongyang as the president of the Democratic Party or as "a special envoy." We will heartily welcome his visit. Convinced that if he visited Pyongyang, we could seek a fair and good way of radically improving North-South relations in an atmosphere of mutual understanding and respect as fellow countrymen, I express the hope for his early visit to Pyongyang. Anyone who is concerned over the destiny of the fellow countrymen, if but a little must not bar his visit aimed at overcoming the grave difficulties facing the nation and opening a new phase of reconciliation and unity of the fellow countrymen but offer all the necessary conditions and conveniences.
