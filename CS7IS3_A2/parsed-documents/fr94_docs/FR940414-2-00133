FR940414-2-00133 FR940414-2-00083 The FHWA notes that the State requires that CMVs subject to its program, and inspected prior to January 1, 1994, be inspected on or before the expiration of the current State inspection certificate or decal but no later than December 31, 1994. Therefore, CMVs that have Texas inspection certificates or decals issued prior to January 1, 1994, may use the alternative means provided by ยง396.17 until the pre-1994 inspection certificate or decal expires, but no later than December 31, 1994. It should also be noted that in accepting the State's PI program, the FHWA also accepts the recordkeeping requirements associated with the inspection program. Texas issues inspection decals for CMVs which pass the State inspection. The State inspection decal is considered by the FHWA as satisfying the Federal requirement for proof of inspection on the CMV. States With Equivalent Periodic Inspection Programs The following is a complete list of States with inspection programs the FHWA has determined are comparable to, or as effective as, the Federal PI requirements. Alabama (LPG Board) Arkansas California District of Columbia Hawaii Illinois Louisiana Maine Maryland Michigan Minnesota New Hampshire New Jersey New York Oklahoma Pennsylvania Rhode Island Texas Utah Vermont Virginia West Virginia Wisconsin In addition to the States listed above, the FHWA has determined that the inspection programs of the 9 Canadian Provinces and the Yukon Territory are comparable to, or as effective as, the Federal PI requirements. All other States either have no PI programs for CMVs or their PI programs have not been determined by the FHWA to be comparable to, or as effective as, the Federal PI requirements. Should any of these States wish to establish a program or modify their programs in order to make them comparable to the Federal requirements, the State should contact the appropriate FHWA regional office listed in 49 CFR 390.
