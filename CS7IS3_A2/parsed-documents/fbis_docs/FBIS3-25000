According to this communique published in Niamey today by the weekly LE REPUBLICAIN (close to the Tuareg community), the next meeting, the date for which was not specified, is expected to take place in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, the very place where a series of negotiations ended in failure last November. In an interview with AFP, government spokesman Moctar Diallo confirmed the authorities' "readiness" in participating in such a meeting. He hoped that "facilitating" countries (France, Algeria, and Burkina Faso) would intervene again to help fix the date. In its communique, the CRA stressed its willingness to once again "prove its good faith" but warned that it does not envisage "signing a new truce" during this meeting. It criticizes the Niger Government for "not being able to take advantage" of the truce observed from February 1993 to January this year "to create the necessary conditions for frank and sincere dialogue leading to peace." In the opinion of the CRA, the Ouagadougou meeting "should allow for the designation of a mediating country, draw up a timetable and the places of meetings for possible political negotiations." The communique specifies that these decisions were made "at a meeting held from 25 January to 2 February in the Tenere" (desert of northern Niger) in the presence of leaders of the four movements -- Front for the Liberation of Air and Azaouak (FLAA); Revolutionary Army for the Liberation of Northern Niger (ARLN); Front for the Liberation of Tamoust (FLT), and the Patriotic Front for the Liberation of the Sahara (FPLS). At the end of meeting, participants set up an executive bureau, the "supreme organ" of the resistance, composed of the following: president, Mano Dayak (FLT leader); vice presidents, Rissa Ag Boula (FLAA leader) and Mohammed Abdoulmoumine (ARLN leader); spokesman Aoutcheki Kriska; secretary general, Idil Ag-Ayaha; social affairs, Assadek Gagidan; and finance, Mohammed Ewanghe. The Tuareg community of Niger is estimated at 750,000 -- 10 percent of the country's population. Their rebellion, which was launched in November 1991, has left 99 persons dead, according to official toll.
