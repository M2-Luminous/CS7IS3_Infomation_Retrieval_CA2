The missile fell in a densely populated residential neighborhood. Rescue teams are still searching for survivors believed to be buried under the rubble of the four houses that were leveled. Numerous houses across a wide radius around the bombing site also suffered substantial damage. The missile, which hit one of the poorer districts of Sanaa, was the 23d to target the capital since the war was triggered by al-Bid and his separatist coterie. This is in addition to those that were launched on other civilian installations and the population in Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, al-Makha, and the Rahidah Hospital. The source indicated that the horrific and murderous action killed or wounded newborns and caused miscarriages. The victims included a physician whose fingers on his right hand were blown off while on duty at a nearby hospital. The security source condemned the action as a treacherous, gruesome crime. He also condemned the traitor al-Bid's threat at a news conference of further Scud missile attacks at innocents and civilian establishments in Sanaa and other Yemeni cities. This kind of threat, the source said, shows that al-Bid and his secessionist band are consumed with such hate that they will not hesitate to perpetrate the most gruesome of crimes against defenseless innocents comparable to their atrocities against the homeland and its unity.
