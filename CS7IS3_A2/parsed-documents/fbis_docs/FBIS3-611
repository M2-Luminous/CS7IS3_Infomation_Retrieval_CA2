Speaking at a news conference, Afonso Dhlakama said 82,000 meticals had been initially earmarked for the soldiers. He said 35,000 meticals for each demobilized soldier is a contemptible amount. Dhlakama added: I regret that Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] soldiers to be demobilized could be at a disadvantage, but that is due to a lack of morals by the government for which they fought. Dhlakama said Renamo soldiers could begin to be demobilized at Inhambane Province's Neves assembly point as of 16 March.
