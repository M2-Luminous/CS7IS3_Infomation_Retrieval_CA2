The committee, to be made up of government officials and private businessmen, is a follow-up measure discussed at the summit between President Kim Yong-sam and Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Seattle last November. The committee will be formally launched in late March when President Kim pays an official visit to China. Under the committee, the two countries will set up a subcommittee on automobile, electronic telephone switching system and aircraft industries, officials said. In this connection, officials from the Economic Planning Board, Foreign, Trade, Industry and Resources and Communications Ministries will convene a meeting soon to select South Korean members of the committee. The Korean-side chairman of the committee is expected to be a vice or assistant minister. With the establishment of the committee, the two countries will be able to form a systematic framework for medium- and long-term cooperation for the expansion of bilateral trade, one senior Foreign Ministry official said.
