The five-page concept gives the notion of "an all-Russian political party", specifies conditions of party formation and registration, enumerates party rights and control over party activities. The majority of party representatives opposed an idea to describe a party as all-Russian only in case of "its support by over five per cent of voters in the state Duma elections" and a strength of no less than 5,000 members. The commission suggested to consider all- Russian only the parties represented in the parliament although many of them won the elections within larger electoral coalitions. The idea was most severely criticized by parties that did not gain the five per cent of votes at the recent elections -- the Constitutional-Democratic Party, the Conservative Party, the Party of Consolidation, the Socialist Party of Working People, the National-Republican Party and others. Deputy Russian Labor Minister Vladimir Varov said the document is "a worst concept of draft laws discussed by the former Supreme Soviet". In his opinion, the body registering a party should proceed from party deeds and not its rules or other documents which may be written in a way to meet all the criteria. "Otherwise, we will soon have dozens of paramilitary organizations named `parties'," he stressed. Leader of the Association of Russian Independent Professionals Pyotr Filippov called for "application of tougher norms to political parties". In his opinion, all parties -- including those which exceeded the five per cent limit and those which did not -- should constantly confirm their right to existence. He said regular re-registration of party members is necessary.
