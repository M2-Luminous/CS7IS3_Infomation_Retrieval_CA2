Fines of up to 1,500 pesos and the confiscation of supplies and products were established by articles of Decree No. 186, which went into effect on 22 March. Under Article 2 of this decree, anyone performing an activity not legally authorized will be fined 1,500 pesos, and the supplies and products involved will be confiscated. Similarly, anyone who is performing an authorized activity but doing so without a license, will be fined 1,200 pesos.
