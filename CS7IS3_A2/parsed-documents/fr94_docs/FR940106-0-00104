If there is no bargaining representative for nurses at the facility, when the facility submits and attestation to ETA, and each time the facility files an H&hyph;1A visa petition with INS, the facility shall post a written notice at the facility (and, in addition, at the worksite facility, if at a different location, such as in the case of nursing contractors), stating that the attestation and/or visa petition(s) have been filed and are available at the facility (explaining how these documents can be inspected or obtained) and at the national office of ETA for review by interested parties. In order for the facility to remain in compliance with this paragraph (i)(2), all such notices shall remain posted during the validity period of the attestation and the attestations and petitions shall be available for examination at the facility throughout this period of time. The notice of posting shall provide information concerning the availability of these documents for examination at the facility and at the national office of ETA, and shall include the following statement: ``Complaints alleging misrepresentation of material facts in the attestation or failure to comply with the terms of the attestation may be filed with any office the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor.'' Such posted notices shall be clearly visible and unobstructed while posted, shall be posted in conspicuous places, where the facility's U.S. nurses readily can read the posted notice on the way to or from their duties. Appropriate locations for posting such notices include locations in the immediate proximity of mandatory Fair Labor Standards Act wage and hour notices and Occupational Safety and Health Act occupational safety and health notices. (j) Special provisions for nursing contractors. A nursing contractor submitting an attestation for filing as a facility shall attest, in addition to the first through sixth attestation elements, that it will refer H&hyph;1A nurses only to facilities that (with the exception of private households which themselves do not employ H&hyph;1A nurses) have valid attestations on file with ETA. The nursing contractor shall obtain from each such worksite facility a copy of that facility's Form ETA 9029, accepted for filing by ETA and then currently on file with ETA. The nursing contractor shall maintain a copy of such worksite facility's accepted attestation on file at the nursing contractor's principal office during the validity period of the nursing contractor's attestation or the period of time that any H&hyph;1A nurse in its employ is providing nursing services at the worksite facility, whichever is longer.
