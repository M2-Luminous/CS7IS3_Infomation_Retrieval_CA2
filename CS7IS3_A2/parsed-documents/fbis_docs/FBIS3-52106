They are a mighty people, they are a mighty people, yes, they are a mighty people. When these bullets were fired to announce a rebirth of this people, they were telling the Zionist and imperialist plot that it could not remove this people from the annals of history as international Zionism and imperialism had tried to do, as the Zionists and imperialists had tried to do. They had tried to erase this people from the annals of history. Let us remember what the Zionists and imperialists said: A land without people [Palestine] for a people without a homeland [the Jews]. [Passage omitted] O my brothers, my beloved, we are now in the midst of a political battle of negotiations. It is ruthless, ruthless. However, at the same time it crowns the blessed intifadah, which is still burning over our Palestinian land. I am telling you that together we will confront all these attempts and all these plots. Let Rabin and Peres be aware that no one among the Palestinian people will kneel down or submit. They may be able to continue occupying this land but no one can humiliate or dishonor the Palestinian people; they are a great people, a great people. Therefore, brothers, the pledge remains the same. Honorable martyrs, the pledge remains the same and the oath remains the same. We will continue on this path until the Palestinian flag is hoisted; until the Palestinian flag is hoisted by our new generals, the children of the stones, over the walls of Jerusalem, the mosques of Jerusalem, and the churches of Jerusalem. They see it as distant but we see it as close. We are sincere. [passage omitted] O brothers, beloved, beloved, O beloved martyrs, O martyrs who are more honorable than us, the pledge, yet again, the pledge, the pledge remains the same and the oath lremains the same. Together and side by side until we reach Palestine [repeats], until we reach Jerusalem [repeats four time]. Together until victory, victory, victory.
