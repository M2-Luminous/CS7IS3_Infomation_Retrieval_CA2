The city's gross domestic product (GDP) -- the value of goods and services produced -- amounted to 41.35 billion yuan last year, up 30 percent over 1992 and 17 percentage points higher than the nation's average, a city government official said. The official said that per-capita GDP in Shenzhen was 15,000 yuan, up 33.5 percent and six times the nation's average. Special and flexible policies are being pursued in Shenzhen to attract investors from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas. Shenzhen's industrial output value shot up nearly 35 percent in 1993 to 48 billion yuan, the official said. The growth of collectively-owned manufacturers is the most impressive, he said. These manufacturers scored a near 90 percent rise in total output value last year, much higher than both state- owned and foreign-funded manufacturers. Meanwhile, economic returns of manufacturers of various types have improved markedly, he said. For example, the comprehensive economic returns index for local manufacturers stood at 129.7 during the first 11 months of 1993, up 28.16 points. The official said that Shenzhen achieved a substantial increase in investment in fixed assets in 1993 -- estimated at 19.5 billion yuan, a 38 percent increase over 1992. Shenzhen spent a quarter of the investment building roads, bridges, a power plant and a waterworks, he said. Expanded production and higher economic returns have enabled Shenzhen residents to enjoy higher living standards, he said. The earnings of local residents averaged 589 yuan per person in 1993, up 9.3 percent in real terms, he said. Moreover, the local market is brisk, with retail sales totalling 16 billion yuan last year, a rise of nearly 39 percent, he said. Shenzhen's revenue soared by almost 57 percent to 6.73 billion yuan in 1993, he said. Furthermore, the local financial order has turned for the better, the local foreign exchange swap market has been stable and money has been in ample supply, he said. At the end of December, savings deposits in local banks totalled 65.74 billion yuan and loans extended amounted to 50 billion yuan, he said.
