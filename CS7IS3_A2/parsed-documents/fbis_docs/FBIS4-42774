This is what French business circles and some Chinese sources are reporting. The Chinese leaders are, it seems, in a hurry to see this visit materialize because it represents for them a source of pride since it was Paris that most energetically condemned the 4 June 1989 Tienanmen Square massacre. Beijing diplomacy has brought down the wall of condemnation with which the West intended to isolate the regime. Jiang Zemin was received by Bill Clinton in Seattle in November. In July, Prime Minister Li Peng is expected in Austria and Germany, where Chancellor Kohl intends to use the "Chinese card" to revive the economy through contracts signed with Beijing. Despite the speed with which the "normalization" of Franco-Chinese relations, undermined by the 1989 protests and then by the sale of Mirage planes to Taiwan, is taking place, the economic effects of this improvement in relations will take a long time. Longuet's Mission in July The chapter was "closed" in January thanks to secret negotiations carried out by UAP [Paris Insurance Union] President Jacques Friedmann, but the Chinese apparently wanted to speed things up for political reasons. The timetable has scarcely allowed time for the French to negotiate economic compensation with the Chinese. French officials are apprehensive about the approach of the visit by Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, who is expected to arrive in early July with almost 150 businessmen: The harvest of contracts promises to be small. A few good deals have been concluded by Alcatel. Dumez has just won a share of the construction of a hydroelectric power station on the Yellow River, worth $130 million, but it lost the construction of the dam proper which went to an Italian company. However, some French industrialists working in China hope that this visit will make it possible to prepare the ground for the medium and long term, particularly in the areas of telecommunications and energy. Jiang Zemin, who is 68 years old, an electrical engineer and former trainee at the Stalin autombile works in Moscow, became head of the Communist Party and then the Army after the crushing of the Tienanmen Square demonstrations five years ago. He then replaced General Yang Shangkun as head of state in 1993. He is the official heir of Deng Xiaoping, who will be 90 in August. However, none of the successors appointed by Deng has survived at the top.
