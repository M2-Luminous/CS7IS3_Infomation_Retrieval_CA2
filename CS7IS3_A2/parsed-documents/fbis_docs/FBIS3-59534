His mission: to turn Bull into a profitmaking company like any other and, in the long term, to privatize it. A carte blanche, an Fr11 billion stash, and the job of readying Bull for privatization are the means and mission industry minister Gerard Longuet has assigned to Jean-Marie Descarpentries, Bernard Pache's successor as the head of Bull. Despite the high financial stakes (Fr7 billion from the state, Fr1.6 billion from France Telecom, and Fr2.5 billion from a loan granted early this year), neither the entrepreneur nor the politician has unveiled a strategic plan. They have also failed to sketch out a profile of Bull's indispensible partner. Despite the new CEO's reluctance to present a plan of action, Jean-Pierre Muller, president of Bull's user club Cube, thinks "things are starting to pick up speed." Muller is happy with the inverted pyramid model cited by Jean-Marie Descarpentries, because "it puts the customer first." The challenge now is to preserve a customer base attractive enough to lure potential investors into participating in a private-sector-handled (not-yet-scheduled) privatization. The most palpable hypothesis, given the reticence of IBM, is that a big Japanese group prepared to invest in a beachhead in Europe will come forward. NEC, a top international company with long-standing ties to Bull, seems the most likely rescuer. In addition, the Japanese manufacturer needs to expand its geographical territory in personal computing, notably in the United States. Before it can be freed from state tutelage, Bull must post profits again. To make the manufacturer "a profitable company like any other, responsible to its market," Jean-Marie Descarpentries must act quickly, persuade NEC and IBM to inject fresh capital, and attract new customers and partners while cutting costs. What price will the manufacturer pay for a return to profits, once its debts of Fr9.5 billion are cleared? Claiming that he does not want to touch "Bull's core", Jean-Marie Descarpentries has left the question of the manufacturer's future scope totally up in the air. The new CEO has enumerated five business the group must preserve: company servers, personal computing, open architectures, systems integration, and all customer services. Jean-Marie Descarpentries envisions a structural change for Bull, to make it "a clearly-organized, lean, decentralized company, in which decisionmakers will have the authority they need." He wants to move quickly to implement the company's thinking about a specialized business-based and not geographically-based organization. On the other hand, Descarpentries has not a word to say about Bull's manufacturing base, which in France now consists entirely of the Angers factory. He is just as silent about the United States, where Bull has lost a pile of money in the past. For the immediate term, the debate centers around the future of Zenith Data Systems and of Bull's service strategy. ZDS, which Bull acquired for 500 million dollars in 1989, remains the manufacturer's greatest lossmaker. Following a restructuring of its industrial base and a partnership agreement with Packard-Bell, ZDS CEO Jacques Noels says "We will have a good idea of the impact of the steps taken" by mid-1994. As for services, Bull, which has still not scored any major successes in France, got into FM late and has had no luck persuading France Telecom to team up with it. Yet the idea of an FM partnership between the two is making headway in the Ministry of Industry, where officials are working on [finding] areas, particularly in services and multimedia, where the two French technology hubs overlap. Boxed Material: Luc Fayard's Opinion Here the state goes again, toying with its favorite plaything, Bull. While grousing about "the last time", the government is kicking another almost Fr9 billion into the pot. It is presenting a new CEO with no strategy as the nth archangel of a miraculous rescue mission, and inventing a new sort of "good riddance" privatization. This has been going on for 20 years. What a mess -- and what a shame! For the French firm has many assets it could use to pull through, provided it was given the means to follow its head. It is time to decide. Should Bull shift its focus back to high-added-value technical products such as its Unix (with IBM) and GCOS (with NEC) systems, even if that means selling off its personal computer business (Zenith Data Systems)? Or should it expand into services and systems integration? Whether alone or with a partner, Bull must finally be allowed to act. Boxed Material: A Commando Fighter First came the era of technician or strategist bosses, then the reign of manufacturer Bernard Pache. Now a commando fighter has taken over the helm at Bull. Jean-Marie Descarpentries has built up his image as a "come-hell-or-high-water" type through takeovers and mergers (Carnaud-Metal Box), but also as a result of his views on what motivates people. The 56-year-old polytechnical school graduate, who also has a Harvard degree, has thought out and refined those ideas while working for Shell, McKinsey, Belgium's Glaverbel, and -- until recently -- the logistics and transport group Novalliance. While working as the director of Carnaud-Metal Box (CMB), he adopted the Swedish manager Jan Carlzon's ideas on the "inverted pyramid", which makes the customer the basis for company decisions. Bull's Assets -- Its installed customer base and distribution channels. -- Close long-standing ties with Japan's NEC, which supplies Bull with its GCOS 8 big systems line. NEC's investment in CMB in 1992 enabled Bull to reorganize its businesses in the United States. -- Its alliance with Cisi in FM, which offsets Bull's late start in that niche. -- DCM, its architecture for non-homogenous environments. -- The international service contracts it has won, notably in the United Kingdom, Poland, and the United States. -- The efforts Bull has made since 1991 to cut structural costs, which have resulted in staff reductions and a reorganization of its industrial base. -- The PC agreement with Packard-Bell, which opens the doors to large-scale distribution for ZDS in the United States, and gives it the critical mass to buy components. -- A RISC line that will be relayed by the PowerPC, the future generation of microprocessors. -- Recent successes in the United States (including the Desktop IV contract and a $62-million contract recently concluded with the American federal government to reengineer big system applications). Boxed Material: Bull's Handicaps -- State tutelage, which has slowed decisionmaking. This was especially true when NEC acquired a capital stake in Bull or during RISC negotiations with IBM and HP. The discussions between Bernard Pache and the government over the last few months heightened the wait-and-see attitude of customers. -- Internal fiefdoms, watered-down decisionmaking within the company, and a lack of money, particularly among sales forces, for implementing strategies. -A deplorable financial structure, aggravated by heavy interest expenses on a Fr9.5 billion debt (reduced in 1992). Losses over the last three years of nearly Fr15 billion, and sales that have declined for the last two years. -- A Unix strategy that depends on IBM's. The French manufacturer has still not come out with any multiprocessor-based computers. -- A tardy and unsuccessful foray into personal computing, which led to the costly acquisition of ZDS. Bull's integration of the American PC manufacturer, which it undertook at the same time as an overhaul of its distribution channels, was time-consuming and caused significant development delays. Dates 1931: The French company HW Egli Bull is created in Paris, to make machines based on the patents of the Norwegian engineer Frederik Rosing Bull. 1951: The Bull machine company brings out the Gamma 3, an electronic computer. 1962: Honeywell concludes a technology agreement with NEC allowing the Japanese firm to use the American company's technology. 1964: General Electric takes control (66 percent) of Bull, Europe's top and the world's second-ranking computer manufacturer. 1966: A merger of CAE (born of CGE/CSF), SEA (Schneider), and Analac (CSF) creates CII. 1970: Honeywell buys back General Electric's computer business and Honeywell Bull is born. 1972: Bull and NEC sign an agreement to collaborate on integrated circuits. 1976: Honeywell Bull merges with CII's big computer business, creating a company controlled 53 percent by the French state and 47 percent by Honeywell. 1978: CII Honeywell Bull acquires R2E, the designer of Micral, the first personal computer marketed in the world. 1980: Saint-Gobain takes control of CII Honeywell Bull. 1982: Bull is nationalized. 1983: NEC, Honeywell, and Bull sign a long-term licensing agreement for powerful, central computers. Following the acquisition of Sem and Transac, CII Honeywell Bull becomes Bull. The state owns 94 percent of the group. 1984: The Micral 30, the first French compatible, is launched. 1989: Bull buys Zenith Data Systems. 1990: Bull announces a three-year reorganization plan. 1991: NEC swaps its interest in Bull HN for 4.7 percent of the capital of CMB, the group's parent company in which France Telecom holds a 17-percent stake. 1992: IBM acquires 5.68 percent of the capital of CMB as part of a manufacturing (portables and electronic boards) and technology (Unix) agreement. Bull launches the Zeus project, to replace the DPS 9000/800, with NEC. 1993: The state makes its final allocation before Bull's privatization, to be handled by the private sector.
