They signed an agreement on cooperation in culture, science and education. Later on Papazyan and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev signed a trade and economic cooperation accord. These are the first bilateral documents signed by Bulgaria and Armenia. "I believe the two agreements would provide the legal framework for the relations which Bulgaria and Armenia are willing to develop on the basis of their historical links", Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov told reporters. He was optimistic about the relations between the two countries. His view was shared by his Armenian counterpart. "Considering the historical relations between our countries, we must promote our relations at all levels", Mr. Papazyan said. The two foreign ministers agreed to start preparations for the signing of an agreement on friendship and cooperation between Bulgaria and Armenia. Mr. Daskalov has already received Armenia's draft agreement. The Bulgarian proposal is also under way and the agreement will be signed as soon as the experts are ready with it, Mr. Daskalov told reporters. The two foreign ministers exchanged information about the situation in the Balkans and the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the two countries' relations with the neighbouring countries and the priorities in the foreign policies of Bulgaria and Armenia. Mr. Daskalov and Mr. Papazyan discussed the possibilities for activating the economic contacts which are now hampered by the regional conflicts in the Caucasus. They discussed the possibilities for joint actions within the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, for promotion of relations in culture, art and education. The promotion of bilateral relations in the economy was high on the agenda of the talks between Papazyan and Bulgarian Trade Minister Karabashev. Under the trade and economic cooperation accord, Bulgaria and Armenia grant each other a most favoured nation status in tariffs, indirect taxes and other charges on imports, payments and in the sales, shipment, storage, etc., of goods on the domestic market. The accord expires in five years and can be automatically extended. It provides for the exchange of economic information and the establishment of an intergovernment committee on trade-economic and scientific-technological cooperation. Papazyan and Karabashev shared the view the level of bilateral trade is far lower than what it can be. Trade in 1993 amounted to $1.5 million, down from $3 million in 1992. "We coordinated a programme for further cooperation", the Armenian minister said after meeting with Karabashev. A package of economic agreements is to be prepared and is expected to be signed within a few months. "Such a package is a must, as we should lay the legal groundwork of our relations", said the chief Armenian diplomat. The promotion of relations was further discussed at Papazyan's meeting with National Assembly Deputy Chairman Yordan Shkolagerski. "There have never been any problems between the Bulgarian and Armenian peoples", said Shkolagerski. About 20,000 Armenians live in Bulgaria and they are well-integrated in public life here, according to him. Papazyan and Shkolagerski committed themselves to establishing friendship groups in the two parliaments. Papazyan will tomorrow visit Plovdiv and meet in the evening with representatives of the Armenian community in Bulgaria. On Wednesday he will be received by President Zhelev.
