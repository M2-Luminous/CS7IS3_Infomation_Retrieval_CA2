FR940921-0-00058 FR940921-0-00016 (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, OMB has notified EPA that it considers this a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of the Executive Order. EPA has submitted this action to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record. VIII. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Public recordkeeping burden is estimated to average 115 hours per response. It is not anticipated that the revisions being promulgated today will have any impact on the recordkeeping burden. These requirements are not effective until OMB approves them and a technical amendment to that effect is published in the Federal Register . Send comments regarding the burden estimate, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M St., SW. (2136), Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' IX. Impact on Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., EPA is required to determine whether a regulation will have a significant adverse impact on a substantial number of small entities. Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The new vehicle standards will affect only manufacturers of motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines, a group which does not contain a substantial number of small entities. The aftermarket conversion portions of today's regulations will not significantly impact the small businesses in the aftermarket conversion industry because the provisions are voluntary, and the cost of voluntary compliance with these requirements will be small when spread over the projected volumes of conversions expected to be sold in the near future. X. Judicial Review Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, EPA hereby finds that these regulations are of national applicability. Accordingly, judicial review of this action is available only by filing a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by September 21, 1994. Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, the requirements which are the subject of today's notice may not be challenged later in judicial proceedings brought by EPA to enforce these requirements.
