FR940223-2-00211 FR940223-2-00101 Congress has found that ``the current state of HBCUs is partly attributable to the discriminatory action of the States and the Federal Government and this discriminatory action requires the remedy of enhancement of Black postsecondary institutions to ensure their continuation and participation in fulfilling the Federal mission of equality of educational opportunity.'' 20 U.S.C. 1060. See also, House Report No. 102&hyph;447, 1992 U.S. Code Cong. and Adm. News p. 353; House Report No. 99&hyph;383, 1986 U.S. Code Cong. and Adm. News 2592&hyph;2596. This includes providing access and quality education to low-income and minority students, and improving HBCUs' academic quality. 20 U.S.C. 1051. For these same reasons, every Administration in recent years has recognized the special role and contributions of HBCUs and expressed support for their enhancement. See ``Revised Criteria Specifying the Ingredients of Acceptable Plans to Desegregate State Systems of Public Higher Education,'' 43 FR 6658 (1977); Exec. Orders Nos. 12232, 45 FR 53437 (1980); 12320, 46 FR 48107 (1981); 12677, 54 FR 18869 (1989); and 12876, 58 FR 58735 (1993). The Department's own data indicate that HBCUs continue to play a vital role in providing higher education for many black students. In 1989 and 1990, more than one in four black bachelor's degree recipients received their degree from an HBCU (26.7%). See, ``Historically Black Colleges and Universities, 1976&hyph;90'' (U.S. Department of Education, Office of Educational Research and Improvement, July 1992). This policy guidance is not intended to limit the efforts to enhance HBCUs called for by Congress and the President. The Department recognizes, however, that Principle 3 (remedying past discrimination) and Principle 4 (creating diversity) may not provide for HBCUs the same possibility of participating in race-targeted programs of financial aid for black students established by third parties as are provided for other colleges and universities. As some commenters pointed out, HBCUs continue to enroll a disproportionate percentage of black students and need to be able to compete for the most talented black students if they are to improve the quality and prestige of their academic environments and, therefore, enhance their attractiveness to all students regardless of race or national origin. HBCUs' abilities to recruit, enroll and retain talented students will be undermined unless HBCUs are permitted to attract talented black students by participating in aid programs for black students that are established by third parties in which other colleges, i.e., those that meet Principle 3 or 4, participate. Limiting or precluding HBCUs' participation in private programs, such as the National Achievement Scholarship program, would have an unintended negative effect on their ability to recruit a talented student body. Under this scholarship program, which is restricted to academically excellent black students, one type of National Achievement Scholarship is funded by the institution. If HBCUs were unable to participate in this program, some top black students might be forced to choose between (1) receiving a National Achievement Scholarship to attend a school that met Principle 3 or 4 and (2) attending an HBCU. For these reasons, the Department interprets Title VI to permit HBCUs to participate in certain race-targeted aid programs for black students, such as the National Achievement Scholarship program.
