FR940523-2-00044 FR940523-2-00024 We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process, the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, State, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend that the Commission approve or not approve the project. Currently Identified Environmental Issues We have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed facilities and the environmental information provided by Northern. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list. The list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis. Issues are: •The Alexandria Branchline Loop crosses residential land within the Platte River Estate. •The pipeline would cross 4 perennial streams and 19 wetlands. •The project may potentially impact federally listed threatened or endangered species. •The project may cross or be near cultural resources/archeological sites. Public Participation You can make a difference by sending a letter addressing your specific comments or concerns about the project. You should focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded: •Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol St., NE, Washington, DC 20426; •Reference Docket No. CP94&hyph;224&hyph;000; •Send a copy of your letter to: Ms. Medha Kochhar, EA Project Manager, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol St., NE., room 7312, Washington, DC 20426; and •Mail your comments so that they will be received in Washington, DC on or before June 10, 1994. If you wish to receive a copy of the EA, you should request one from Ms. Medha Kochhar at the above address. Becoming an Intervenor In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or become an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 3. The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file late interventions must show good cause, as required by §385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status to have your scoping comments considered. Additional information about the proposed project is available from Ms. Medha Kochhar, EA Project Manager, at (202) 208&hyph;2270. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
