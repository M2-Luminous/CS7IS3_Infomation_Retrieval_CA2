According to Qol Yisra'el's military correspondent, the course centers on the jeep patrols which will take place: one vehicle with IDF soldiers, the other with Palestinian police. The head of IDF's Southern Command, Major General Matan Vilna'i, has called for improved coordination with the Palestinians and their future police force in the Strip. He was interview by Alan Ben-'Ami: [Begin recording] [Vilna'i] The coordination now is very important, but one has to remember that they have to coordinate with us and not we are going to coordinate with them. I believe that it's good coordination with them. [passage omitted] [Ben-'Ami] How long is it going to take you, from the time the agreement is signed, to actually complete the withdrawal? What do you estimate? [Vilna'i] It depends on the treaty, on the exact treaty that we are going to sign with them. After we see the exact treaty, we'll decide what is the time that we need to withdraw. [Ben-'Ami] Can you do it within a matter of hours? [Vilna'i] We can do it from hours to several years. No problem. [end recording]
