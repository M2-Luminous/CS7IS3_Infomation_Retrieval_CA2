The unplanned Ukrainian electric energy imports, which started in November after the energy supply situation within Ukraine became critical, "caused economic damage to consumers belonging to the system", Tombor told the VILAGGAZDASAG economic daily. Electricity suppliers in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary and the eastern part of Germany set a January 21 deadline for Ukraine to return the extra energy, drawn after these states' grids were separated from the Russian and Ukraine-Bulgarian electricity grids in November. Hungary supplied a quarter of the extra energy to Ukraine but practically all other central European states were affected by the unplanned draws, which caused "considerable frequency fluctuation" in the Centrel system, Tombor said. He added however that Hungary had not had to introduce any consumption restrictions due to the extra Ukrainian consumption, but electric appliances here slowed down and were overstrained. Currently, only a 400- and a 200-kilovolt electric conductor is in use between Hungary and Ukraine after the main 750-kilovolt line went out of use in November. The central grid is to be reconnected with the Russian and Ukrainian electricity grids after mid-May, he said.
