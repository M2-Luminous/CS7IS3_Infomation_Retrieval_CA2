Field Marshal Tantawi returned to Cairo from Washington yesterday after a visit of several days to the United States. Speaking after the meeting, Tantawi said he briefed President Mubarak on the results of his visit to the United States and his meetings with senior military, U.S. Administration, and Congress officials. He noted that the U.S. officials expressed their appreciation of Egypt and of President Mubarak's role in its every aspect, particularly regarding world peace and the Israeli- Palestinian Agreement recently signed in Cairo. The defense minister added that his talks in Washington covered every current world issue, Egypt's role in the region, Egyptian-U.S. military ties and cooperation in the field of joint training, and the U.S. military grant to Egypt. He described the results of these talks as good. Asked about reports on a reduction in U.S. aid, which will be directed to East Europe, and how prepared Egypt is to deal with such a reduction, the defense minister said the U.S. Administration has reduced its own military budget. As a result, he added, there was a tendency to reduce foreign aid. But considering the role Egypt is playing and in view of its importance, its status, and its Armed Forces in the region, I hope Egypt will not be affected by such a reduction. Asked about the notion of replacing the U.S. aid with cooperation in the field of technology transfer to compensate for the loss and whether his talks in Washington dealt with this, Field Marshal Tantawi said: It is not an issue of replacement; the two things must go together. He noted that cooperation exists between Egypt and the United States in every field. He added: I have sensed an understanding of Egypt's role and position and our bilateral relations are proceeding in the right direction, be it in the field of technology transfer, aid, joint training, or other areas. Asked if anything new in the field of military cooperation was agreed upon with the United States, the defense minister said there are procedures concerning the armament and modernization of the Armed Forces and U.S. assistance in these areas, noting that these procedures follow an established plan and that the plan is continuing. Asked if new arms deals were concluded as part of this plan, Field Marshal Tantawi said: We operate according to a five-year plan, which is proceeding in the right direction.
