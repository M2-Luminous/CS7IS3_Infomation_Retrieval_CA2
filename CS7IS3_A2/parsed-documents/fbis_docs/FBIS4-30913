"Although the defeat was bigger than expected, the MDF cannot be wiped out of Hungary's political map because it was supported by 600,000 voters," he said. "The Forum prepares for its new role as a constructive opposition, keeping the interests of the country and the entire Hungarian people in view and unwilling to make a surrender of its principles and ideals," the MDF chairman said. Fur expressed the conviction that his party would return to power in four years. Prime Minister and MDF Deputy Chairman Peter Boross congratulated the MSZP and its chairman Gyula Horn. "Although it is not yet clear what kind of government will be formed, I think the chance of a governing coalition is smaller than it was before the second round," Boross said. "The victorious party faces four difficult years because it must come up to the expectations which brought a victory for it," he said. "The MDF should accept the outcome of the elections, and draw the conclusions," Boross said.
