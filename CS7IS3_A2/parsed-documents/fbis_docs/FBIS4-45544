The PGR, which is headed by Humberto Benitez Trevino, has begun a campaign in Mexico City to prevent crime. The sale, distribution, and consumption of drugs are the first of a number of federal crimes about which citizens will receive information. For this purpose, the PGR has distributed posters in discotheques and restaurants in Mexico City, especially in the Zona Rosa, which is usually crowded with young people. The posters have been placed mainly in rest rooms and have the objective of making known to youths the dangers that the consumption and sale of drugs represent. In the next few days, this crime prevention campaign will be extended to the entire country and will deal with various crimes, such as the illegal possession of firearms and theft of archaeological artifacts. The colorful posters have the objective of preventing rather than just lamenting crimes. The struggle against drug addiction must begin from childhood and continue with greater intensity during adolescence.
