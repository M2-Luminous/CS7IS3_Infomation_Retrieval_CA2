Taiwan took the action following a meeting in Seoul Tuesday and Wednesday between non-governmental representatives of the two countries, the source said, requesting anonymity. The Taiwanese measure covers South Korean exports of apples and pears, he said. The source said the two sides are expected to sign a formal agreement Thursday evening. Seoul and Taipei will soon hold negotiations on Korean auto exports to Taiwan and the reopening of civil airline services, the sources said. In the case of apple exports, Seoul will increase the amount slightly from the 3,780 tons it last shipped before the severance of diplomatic ties. Pear exports will be about 1,040 tons or nearly the same level of 1992. As for counterpurchase, the two countries will increase the volume slight from the 1992 level of 3,696 tons. Due to Taiwan's competitive strength in banana exports, two sides agreed to include bananas along with onions and garlic in the counterpurchase category.
