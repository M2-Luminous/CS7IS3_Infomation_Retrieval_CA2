The hardliners within the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania -- the ruling party] have mentioned you as one of the ministers that should be replaced. Have you noticed any signs that they are preparing for your deposal? [Spiroiu] That statement was made some time ago by [PDSR Vice President and Senator Ion] Solcanu. I have never asked him why he said that, and I do not think I ever will. In any democratic system, the ruling parties have the right to set up the governmental teams; therefore, it is only natural that they should ask for various portfolios. [Baesu] Did they request that you become a PDSR member? [Spiroiu] No, never. But let me finish answering your first question. I learned that during the talks that were held on the government reshuffle, various parties requested the portfolio of defense [reference to the National Romanian Unity Party]. Aside from this, I have not noticed any other signs that they are preparing for my deposal and no one has tried to obstruct me in my work. [Baesu] You and [Foreign Affairs Minister] Teodor Melescanu are the only ministers of the Vacaroiu cabinet surrounded by a certain kind of consensus. Despite the fact that you are a member of the PDSR government, [opposition leader] Emil Constantinescu recently stated that the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania] will support you. Except for the aforementioned hard liners within the PDSR and [Greater Romania Party Chairman and Senator] Corneliu Vadim Tudor in his weekly ROMANIA MARE, no one else has attacked you. How do you explain this unusual situation of yours? [Spiroiu] That is quite simple. Beginning in May of 1990, ever since I have been defense minister, my principal goal was to keep the armed forces out of the political struggle. We have been equidistant to every party and never flirted with any of them. As far as Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor is concerned, the reason he is attacking me has nothing to do with politics. He has a brother who is a colonel in our forces and the senator asked me to promote him to the rank of general, something I rejected, as his brother does not meet the necessary preconditions. That is why the senator has been assaulting me. [Baesu] Could it be that the consensus around your person is required by the parties' similar interests, namely that the country should join NATO, and that is why the opposition is also backing your efforts, especially considering the fact that the opposition believes you are a person who is liked in international circles. [Spiroiu] They might really like me, considering that last year, eight defense ministers of NATO's European member states visited Romania. The activity of our ministry to implement reform is quite appreciated; that might be the reason of their having accepted me. [Baesu] Does that acceptance also mean that NATO circles are manifesting a certain amount of interest in Romania? [Spiroiu] The NATO countries are interested in seeing that Romania remains a stability factor in an area that is considerably tensioned. [Baesu] Certain politicians of the opposition believe that our country will not be accepted as a full member of that body, among other things, owing to the current political regime. [Spiroiu] In NATO circles, I have never heard anyone say that Romania should not be admitted because of that. This is an issue that depends on the decisions taken by the Atlantic Alliance regarding the admittance of new members. Their latest statement shows that for the time being, the extent to which they are prepared to expand the organization is the Partnership for Peace. At the Brussels summit meeting (of 9-10 January, editor's note), they will adopt a declaration regarding that partnership, which is not a collective relationship but rather a bilateral one. Every single Central and East European state may apply for and establish ties with NATO. There are a number of preconditions regarding the military body. Everything we currently do in our armed forces is done according to the plans elaborated by the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC], which shows Romania's willingness to join the military structures of both the WEU [Western European Union] and NATO. [Baesu] Of course Romania is willing, but will it ever be admitted? [Spiroiu] For the time being, there is a consensus among them that the alliance is not prepared to admit any new members. [Baesu] Is that delay too dangerous for us, considering especially how close we are to Russia? [Spiroiu] It is our own interest to gain admittance as soon as possible. However, it is not important that we should gain admittance, but rather that no one should be discriminated against by admitting other Central and East European states first. We are struggling for a security area equally valid for all, without any discrimination, without establishing new boundaries. Of course, Russia's interests should be observed and we should avoid creating the impression that our approaching the alliance is done because of our hostile stance regarding that country. [Baesu] What would happen if they would decide for a two-step admittance of the East European countries to NATO? What if Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia, and Poland are admitted first? [Spiroiu] A two-step admittance to the NATO structures would generate insecurity, instability, suspicion, and it would generate a feeling of isolation that would bolster the conservative forces, such as those in Russia, for example. [Baesu] Under such circumstances, could we be forced to strike an alliance with Russia? [Spiroiu] Such a thing is out of the question. For the time being, in my opinion, military alliances are already old-fashioned things and after the Paris Charter was signed, they have no real purpose. NATO itself, which we wish to join, has lost its role as an organization opposing the Warsaw Pact. This is another NATO that has developed a third dimension for itself, namely to support the countries that have set out on the way of democratic reforms. [Baesu] Still, the emergence of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on the Russian political scene does not pose any peril for us? Mikhail Gorbachev has recently stated that he [Zhirinovskiy] is supported by the KGB. What are the consequences for Romania of the apparition of this person, whom some people call the second Hitler? [Spiroiu] Mr. Gorbachev has hopefully made that statement on the basis of some evidence. I, as a military person, cannot make any similar assertions, as I lack the evidence. However, on the basis of what I do know, I can assert the following things: No real security system can be achieved with the democratization of Russia. That is why we morally support the democratization process taking place in Russia. Zhirinovskiy is the representative of extremist and conservative forces. His apparition could be dangerous if he comes to power and if he had a much larger audience than the one he currently has. Heaven forbid he should be supported more massively, because if he becomes the ruler of the country, that would strengthen the forces that are striving to rebuild the Soviet empire with all its imperial characteristic features. Thus, that would not only endanger the security of the neighboring states but world security as well.
