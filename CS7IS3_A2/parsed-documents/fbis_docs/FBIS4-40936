Journalists Are Going To Combat Crime Their Own Way"] [Text] The participants in yesterday's press conference at the Central Journalists House were Eduard Sagalayev, head of the TV-6 network; Artem Borovik, chief editor of the newspaper SOVERSHENNO SEKRETNO; Aleksandr Mitroshenkov, director of public relations for the "LogoVAZ" joint-stock company; and Nikolay Koptev, deputy chief of the Regional Directorate on Organized Crime of the Moscow Internal Affairs Main Administration. Participants in the press conference proposed that journalist collectives stage an action of protest against rampant crime in the country. In the view of Mr. Borovik, it is impossible today to combat crime effectively because the "executive positions in the economy and politics are under mafia control." Gangster formations also put pressure to bear on the mass media. Mr. Borovik has already been in two "deliberate road accidents." In order to draw the authorities' attention to the problem of crime, he suggested that all newspapers simultaneously carry on their front pages early in July stories about crimes committed by gangster groups. Some other suggestions were voiced at the press conference. For example, all publications should leave blank spaces reserved for stories of crimes. The blank spaces in newspapers would symbolize the state of crime in the country. Besides it was proposed to declare as of 1 July a year of the mass media combat against organized crime. Mr. Mitroshenkov, director of public relations for the "LogoVAZ" joint-stock company, pointed out that the attempt on the life of Boris Berezovskiy, general director of the "LogoVAZ" joint-stock company and chairman of the AVVA board of directors, can be seen "as an encroachment on the interests of millions of depositors of these companies." In Mr. Mitroshenkov's words, "LogoVAZ" and AVVA are trying to stabilize prices in the Russian auto market. Some people did not like this, he thinks, and as a result the attempt on Berezovskiy's life was organized. He stated, however, that "LogoVAZ" and AVVA will keep trying to create a civilized auto market in Russia. Mr. Mitroshenko advised that the attempt on the life of the "LogoVAZ" general director could have resulted in a much greater number of victims because there were more than 100 people at the streetcar stop a short way from where the bomb exploded. They were unhurt by pure chance: The streetcar pulled up minutes before the blast. Mr. Mitroshenko voiced dissatisfaction with the fact that the investigation did not come up with any results two weeks after the attempt on Berezovskiy's life. Nikolay Koptev, deputy chief of the Regional Directorate on Organized Crime, told the journalists that a four- or five-fold growth in the crime rate has been recorded this year. He suggested, however, that the situation should not be dramatized: In his words, the mafia does not rule the country, while the Ministry of Internal Affairs has the power to cope with crime. Provided of course that laws on combating corruption and organized crime are passed soon. Mr. Koptev did not recommend to journalists that they go ahead with the protest action and asked that, rather, they should simply objectively cover the work of militia.
