Commenting on the LDP's move at a 23 June meeting of members of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors who are affiliated with the ruling Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], DSP Chairman Takashi Yonezawa pointed out: "If the no- confidence motion against the Hata cabinet is approved in the Diet, then the Hata cabinet would resign en masse, leaving no possibility of Prime Minister Hata becoming again prime minister." He went on to say, "the Hata cabinet should think of its voluntary general resignation while watching as the LDP submits a no-confidence motion to the Diet." He also stated that the Hata cabinet should study the possibility of resigning en masse depending on the outcome of talks with the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] on forming a new coalition and the SDPJ's internal situation.
