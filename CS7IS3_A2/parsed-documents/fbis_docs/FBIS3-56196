His Victory Was Finally Ensured by Two Votes, But What Votes They Were!"] [Text] In the latest round of voting held 13 January Vladimir Shumeyko polled 98 votes and was thus finally elected chairman of the Federation Council. Petr Romanov got 52 votes, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov seven, and Eduard Rossel six. Federation Council deputies were candid and forthright about the reasons for Vladimir Shumeyko's surprise failure to win in the second round of voting, in which he dropped four votes, when they spoke about it the next day, 13 January. They recalled the wire that North Ossetia leader Akhsarbek Galazov, absent from the session, had sent in Shumeyko's support but which he addressed not to the Federation Council but to President Yeltsin and to the actual contender for this prestigious post. In the opinion of Viktor Stepanov, chairman of the Karelia Supreme Soviet, Shumeyko made a tactical mistake: "He should have refused that vote, but he said nothing." Aman Tuleyev, former chairman of the Kemerovo Oblast Soviet, was even more forthright: "It was a shoddy affair. People in the president's team do not balk at pressuring deputies whenever they get the opportunity." Meanwhile, the attempts to tilt the balance of voting in favor of the president's protege continued on the morning of 13 January. According to confidential information, Eduard Rossel received an offer from the prime minister's messengers of the post of first deputy speaker if he persuaded his supporters to vote for Vladimir Shumeyko. The offer was rejected. A little earlier, at 0830, Viktor Chernomyrdin called the heads of administration to see him and, probably in exchange for a pledge of additional credits, investments, tax concessions, and so forth, obtained their "understanding" and "surety" by clearly indicating which of the candidates they should vote for. Finally that morning, before the latest nominations began, First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets went to the building on Bolshaya Dmitrovskaya Ulitsa where he "consulted" with powerful representatives of the industrial directors' lobby. Such very close attention paid by the top men in the government to the course of the campaign for the speakership of the upper chamber was due not only to a desire to ensure that their man got the job (although that was the prime reason) but also to the sudden appearance on the political horizon of the figure of Petr Romanov, general director of the "Yenisey" Petrochemical Combine, who publicly confirmed his adherence to Sterligov's Russian National Assembly. Be that as it may, the president and head of the government now have the man they wanted as chairman of the Federation Council. And the senators dependent on the executive have gotten the man that the president and the prime minister wanted.
