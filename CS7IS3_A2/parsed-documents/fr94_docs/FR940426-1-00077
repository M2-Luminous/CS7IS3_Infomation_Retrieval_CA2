But if it is not required under section 177, the OTC recommends that the ``individual States within the OTC may at their option include such a requirement and/or economic incentives designed to increase the sales of ZEVs in the programs they adopt.'' (5) The effective date for the OTC LEV program would be January 1, 1996, allowing two vehicle model years prior to applicability of the standards in 1999, but does not preclude earlier State implementation. D. Legislative History of Section 184 The OTC provisions originated in Congress in the House bill as introduced. That bill, as introduced, established an ozone transport region for the Northeast, and incorporated the procedures specified for general transport regions under what was finally enacted as section 176A of the Act. That provision in the House bill did not involve a plan for specific additional control measures. See H.R. 3030 at 92&hyph;93 and 49 (July 27, 1989), reprinted in 2 1990 Legislative History of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 103rd Cong., 1st. sess. (Nov. 1993) (hereinafter ``1990 Legislative History'') at 3828&hyph;29 and 3785. The House committee then marked-up H.R. 3030 to include the provisions as finally enacted. See H.R. Rep't No. 101&hyph;490, part 1, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. at 527&hyph;28 (May 17, 1989), reprinted in 2 1990 Legislative History at 3551&hyph;52. It described the bill as establishing ``a public procedure and structure'' for an OTC to transmit recommendations to EPA and explained that EPA's response ``should be buttressed by supporting material.'' It further stated, ``The Committee expects that the Administrator's review of additional control measures recommended by an ozone transport commission will fully acknowledge and respond to the dimensions of the transport problems addressed by the commission's recommendations.'' The report also set out the timetable for EPA's response within nine months, and for EPA to issue a finding of SIP inadequacy ``[u]pon full or partial approval'' followed by States' SIP revisions within one year. H.R. Rep't. No. 101&hyph;490 at 256, reprinted in 2 1990 Legislative History at 3280. The Senate bill, in contrast, as introduced provided that the commission could, without any independent EPA review or approval, ``after notice and opportunity for comment, require additional control measures to be applied within such transport region if the commission determines such measures are necessary to bring all areas in such region into attainment by the dates provided by this subpart.'' See S. 1630, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (Sept. 4, 1989), reprinted in 5 1990 Legislative History at 9111. The Senate bill, as introduced, was amended in committee to provide for EPA review of an OTC ``plan'' for additional control measures. Under the Senate committee mark-up, the OTC could, after notice and comment, develop a plan for additional control measures for the OTR, and would then transmit the plan to EPA for review. The committee then included the general framework for EPA review that survives in section 184 as enacted, including EPA's obligation to explain any disapproval and recommend alternatives. The bill differed from the statute as enacted, however, in that: (1) EPA was obligated to state in the Federal Register notice upon receipt of the plan that ``written data, views, or comments on the plan may be submitted to the Administrator within ninety days beginning on the receipt date'' but was not obligated to conduct a public hearing; (2) EPA's period to determine whether to approve the plan was 120 days, rather than nine months; and (3) the bill provided that the plan would be deemed approved if the Administrator failed to act within 120 days. The Senate committee mark-up also included the mechanism for implementation whereby EPA would issue a finding that the States' plans were inadequate, and that the finding would require the States to revise their SIPs to include the approved additional control measures within one year after the finding is issued.

This version was reported out of committee to the full Senate. See S. 1630 (Dec. 20, 1989), reprinted in 5 1990 Legislative History at 7986&hyph;7988.
