He is president of the Serbian Democratic Forum [SDF]. [Dujmovic] Whenever we asked ourselves how you envisioned the beginning of the normalization of the relations between the Croats and the Serbs, it always seemed to us that you envisioned it exactly as it is happening now. How right are we about that? [Pupovac] The normalization started, in fact, much earlier. That means that efforts were made by both the Croatian and the Serbian sides to arrange the relations between the two states and the two peoples as soon as possible. We at the SDF, and I personally, believed profoundly that this was possible, and we have been doing everything during the last three years to achieve it. It sometimes seemed to us that we were very close, especially two years ago, and then things started going in the opposite direction. Not so much in Croatia but elsewhere, maybe more in Bosnia and in terms of world policy. [Dujmovic] When we say that you imagined the beginning exactly like this, we are referring to the unresolved issue of the UNPA [UN Protected Areas] zones and the appointment of Veljko Knezevic as the head of the Serbian office in Zagreb. What do you think about this, is Knezevic coming to Zagreb as a winner or a loser? Is his appointment a provocation? [Pupovac] This is the decision of the government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], and one should not doubt its good will as long as there is no proof to the contrary. Veljko Knezevic is a citizen of the FRY, and it is probably best to put aside all the stories regarding this issue, including the stories linked to the name and work of Veljko Knezevic. If it is proven that his choice was not in accordance with the declared intentions, then, of course, there will be changes. But I hope that it will not be necessary to come to that. [passage omitted] [Dujmovic] You have been in contact with Belgrade and Knin. Is it true that Knin is willing, under certain conditions, to accept the Croatian Government? [Pupovac] Many have confirmed to me that a Croatian-Serbian agreement on the relations of Zagreb and Knin is possible. [Dujmovic] Do you speak about individuals, "persons from the people," or statements of important politicians? [Pupovac] No, I am not speaking about the people, because they are molded in accordance with the demands of the current political trends. I am speaking about those who know what is and what is not possible. Finally, I speak about those who know that compromise in Croatian-Serbian relations, and especially between Croats and Serbs in Croatia, is inevitable and necessary. [passage omitted] [Dujmovic] What would be the compromise, what would both sides have to renounce in order to reach it? [Pupovac] It is important to accept that mutual relations be resolved through an agreement, to find transitional solutions, a modus vivendi, which will be the basis for the final political agreement. This agreement must contain a mutual recognition of two peoples within one state, and, on the basis of this agreement which would precede the recognition, a political solution for life in common must be found. [Dujmovic] When you say "mutual recognition of two people," does that mean that Croatia must recognize the so-called Krajina? [Pupovac] I think that the fact must be recognized that the Serbian people have lived in Croatia throughout history and that they are a people with autonomous political will. Thus, what is at issue is an inalienable sovereign political will which simply cannot be annulled. This is why it is important that this fact be confirmed by the Croatian side, just as it is necessary for the Serbian side to realize that the fulfillment of its own right cannot be achieved by bringing into question the right of another people, but that a compromise has to be made. [Dujmovic] Does the "political will of the Serbian people" also include the possibility of secession? [Pupovac] The right to secession is a risky right, which, based on all that we know about international rights, cannot be achieved only on the basis of the desire of those who interpret this right as theirs. Namely, the rights of others should be taken into consideration, as well as the interests of the international community as a realistic framework for the fulfillment of this right. I expect, in this respect, that the Serbs will coordinate their national will for autonomy with the rights of the Croat majority people and that they will find a way of fulfilling, within this context, their right to self-determination within the republic. [Dujmovic] Why, in speaking about the Serbs, do you use the expression "Serbian people in Croatia"? In doing this you violate the Badinter [EC Arbitration] Commission. Why do you qualify an entity consisting of somewhat more that 10 percent of the total population as a people? [Pupovac] Do not mention the Badinter Commission, because it is one of the rather bad episodes in the disintegration of Yugoslavia. It is one of the episodes that undoubtedly can be linked to the escalation of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, not to mention that no one, absolutely no one, and especially not an ad hoc commission, can determine what this international right is. But, since we are speaking about this issue, one should say that what is at issue is a perception. What is involved is self-perception. You cannot tell the Serbs, who for the last 150 years have been perceiving themselves as a people with autonomous political will, that from now on they must not have that perception. It may be that such a self-perception is wrong, but it exists, and it is better to understand it that to go against it. [passage omitted]
