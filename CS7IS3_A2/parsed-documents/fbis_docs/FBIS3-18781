The EU [European Union] Member States' energy bosses will be meeting officials from the European Commission's Directorate-General for Energy (DGXVII) on April 22 to study a text which will form the basis of a Communication to be submitted to the EU Energy Council on May 25, with the aim of feeding the energy policy debate. Their deputies will be in Brussels on March 24 to go over an informal version of the document with DGXVII. On the basis of the Communication, the May 25 Council will strive to establish energy policy priorities, on the basis of which the following Energy Council, held under the German Presidency of the Council, will be able to adopt working guidelines and energy policy objectives for 2005. The next step will be to prepare a text for inclusion in the Maastricht Treaty. DGXVII also expects to publish its Annual Energy Review, analysing energy trends throughout the world region by region, possibly as early as April. De Facto Liberalisation The forthcoming meetings with the top national civil servants working in the energy field are the first since September 30 last year, when the Commission, believing the Member States' Directors-General for Energy had realised the international energy market would not let them move in any direction other than towards greater liberalisation, flexibility and competitiveness, invited them to engage in informal talks outside the framework of the routine attitudes customarily expressed on energy matters. This led to a debate centred on a macroeconomic and policy-oriented discussion paper entitled "The European Community: New Orientations in Energy -- The Economic Foundations." The aim now is to conduct a much more analytical examination of the supply side of the equation. During the preparation of the Maastricht Treaty, the proposed text for an energy policy chapter was thrown out by the Member States. This was due in part to a certain amount of last-minute horse-trading but also stemmed from the Member States' belief that the energy policy objectives set out in the draft text submitted by DGXVII were too "irresponsible" to be acceptable. Over the last two years, events have moved on, Commission energy experts now believe, and while the Member States may not yet accept wholeheartedly the need for competition on the EU's captive Internal Market, they have generally acknowledged the contradiction of playing their ultra-liberal cards abroad and resisting liberalisation at home. In addition to changes in their own domestic energy set-ups, European producers are increasingly looking to invest in non-EU energy markets, particularly in East Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where they are forced to compete with other giants like the United States and Japan at prices much closer to cost. With the EU now much further along the Single Market road and the Delors White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment providing an impetus to boost Europe's competitive position, there is now a much clearer political base on which to attempt the construction of a specific, coherent European energy strategy. Investment Implications The discussion paper on which the current round of talks is based hammers home the point that the Union's energy demand continues to grow and that its dependence on conventional thermal power plants is likely to continue well into the 21st century. In view of the long lead-times required to bring new plant onstream, the implications for investment are important. Investment decisions taken during the 1990's, particularly in respect to electricity generation, will affect the energy sector for the next 20-30 years. These effects will be very difficult to reverse without enormous cost, the Commission warns. EU Energy Priorities EU energy priorities, as DGXVII sees them, revolve around the need: - to get the white paper plans for major trans-European energy networks on the rails; - to use the energy potential of the Union's peripheral regions to best effect through greater cohesion; - to sustain and develop European technological expertise and more rational energy use, through such initiatives as the Thermie demonstration programme; - to respect the EU's environmental commitments, while continuing to guarantee the security of energy supplies; - to diversify sources of supply away from heavy dependence on the Middle East; and - to fulfill the EU's responsibilities beyond its borders, particularly as regards the economic and political stability of the transition economies of East Europe. The completion of the pan-European Energy Charter, whose next week-long plenary session begins on March 7, is seen as a crucial element in this respect. Open Questions While circumstances may now be more propitious to the fully-fledged revival of the EU energy policy debate than they were two years ago, the horizon is far from clear. The current Commission's term of office is drawing to a close, as is that of the European Parliament, whose say in energy matters increased with the extra legislative powers brought by the Maastricht Treaty. It also remains to be seen exactly on what terms oil-rich Norway and the other three accession candidate countries join the Union. Security of supply remains a major bone of contention. In fact, part of the Commission's thinking in establishing informal top-level discussions with the Member States was to avoid conducting the talks, for the time being, through the Council Energy Working Group. The latter has a reputation for beginning any debate on energy policy with the matter of security of supply and then getting bogged down in interminable discussions over how this relates to the principle of subsidiarity. In this context, the question of specific EU-wide arrangements for crisis management within the framework of International Energy Authority action, still has to be addressed. Discussions appear to be getting nowhere and the subject has not figured on recent Energy Council agendas. DGXVII officials are now saying former Energy Commissioner Antonio Cardoso e Cunha was "mistakenly" understood to be pressing for Community ownership of basic fuel stocks rather than Community management of supplies. They acknowledge that to be palatable to Member States, provisions for a distinct Union safeguard mechanism will probably have to come out of the proposal. On the other hand, the "U.S.-dominated" IEA has since declared itself in favour of Union membership, somewhat tipping the balance towards such a development. The trick now will be to strike a happy medium between areas of Union and national Member State competence.
