Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-30Mar94-Russia Agrarian Lobby Moves To Block Food Imports SUMMARY Announcing a sharp swing away from its dependence on imported food in recent years, the Russian government, prompted by the agrarian lobby's desire to protect farms from foreign competition, has declared it will import no grain in 1994 and has slapped import duties on most other food products. The moves were made despite a poor grain harvest in 1993 and an expected further decline this year and provoked outcry by the mayors of Moscow and St. Petersburg, whose constituents face higher food prices and possible future shortages as a result of the cutoff of their large-scale food imports. But the moves were accompanied by reformist measures seeking, for example, to reduce the state's role in agriculture in order to develop private marketing channels. END SUMMARY Russian President Boris Yeltsin told reporters on 9 March that "for the first time in three or four decades, Russia will not import grain, linen or wool this year" and "we have enough grain to last us until the new harvest'' (ITAR-TASS, 9 March). He told Interfax (9 March) that he had made this decision after talking to Deputy Premier for agriculture Aleksandr Zaveryukha that morning, and on 12 March Zaveryukha publicly applauded Yeltsin's statement and said that his own calculations showed that there is sufficient food and no grain need be purchased abroad (Russian TV, 12 March). In a further move against food imports, Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin on 10 March signed a decree ordering imposition of duties on many types of food imports, including fish, shellfish, milk, potatoes, vegetables, and apples, although not on grain (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18 March). Previously, most foods were imported duty free (Interfax, 16 March). Reaction The import duties brought an outcry, especially from big city leaders who had been trying to prevent this move for weeks. Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov in mid-January had written an open letter to Chernomyrdin complaining that some members of the cabinet were trying to push through a plan to "protect the interests of Russian agricultural producer5?? by eliminating federal food stocks, introducing high customs duties on imported food, and abolishing subsidies for foreign food prices. He argued that by raising prices for foreign foods the duties would enrich Russian farmers at the expense of Russian consumers, pointing out that foreign sugar sells for 600 rubles a kilo whereas Russian sugar costs 900 rubles (ITAR-TASS, 17 January; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18 January). After the 10 March decree, the mayors of Moscow and St. Petersburg and the head of the Yekaterinburg Administration sent Yeltsin an appeal protesting the increase of import duties (Krasnaya Zvezda, 22 March). Luzhkov on the television program Itogi on 20 March assailed the increases, which he attributed to Zaveryukha, and said he had gone to Chernomyrdin to complain and try to defend the interests of cities. Izvestiya reported on 22 March that Moscow's food suppliers ''immediately jacked up prices'' after import duties were raised, especially for livestock products. Zaveryukha and Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun held a news conference on 22 March to defend the decision, arguing that Russia can feed itself, but an influx of foreign food is hurting Russian farming. They complained that Moscow and St. Petersburg consumed 70 percent imported food and ignored Russian-produced food (Russian TV, 22 March). Zaveryukha complained that imported food ''has started to flood in from abroad via various commercial structures'' and that big city leaders, primarily in Moscow and St. Petersburg, prefer imported foods to Russian foods (Selskaya Zhizn, 24 March). In a 24 March Rossiyskaya Gazeta interview he argued that ''we have plentiful supplies of our own food products'' and therefore food prices will not rise. As an example of how imports have damaged domestic agriculture, he complained that last year's importation of large amounts of dried milk had cut demand for milk in Moscow and disrupted Russian milk production. He said that "unless the chaotic situation with imported products--which are often of poor quality--is stopped, entire sectors in our own country, such as livestock raising, poultry farming, and flax growing, are doomed to disappear" (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 24 March). Food Supplies Zaveryukha has long talked of cutting or ending imports, and in fact, imports had been reduced to 10.4 million tons in 1993--the lowest in 15 years (Interfax, 14 January) and down from 25.5 million in 1992 (Interfax, 20 January). Zaveryukha had told a press conference in early March that Russia will export 3-4 million tons of grain this year (Interfax, 2 March). He recently argued that Russia has enough grain reserves to last until October when the new harvest comes in and may actually be able to export 2 million tons (Interfax, 16 March). Aleksandr Kudelya, first vice president of Roskhleboprodukt (the company that buys grain for the government), at the beginning of this year contended that farms really have more grain than they admit and indicated that Roskhleboprodukt has already contracted with farmers for 32 million tons and has actually bought 26 million tons of this, compared to 25 million tons actually bought in 1992 (Interfax, 14 January). Despite this optimism, the decision to end imports is clearly not based on increased production, since last year's harvest was not very high and domestic production this year is expected to be much worse. Khlystun has forecast a grain harvest of only 89 million tons for 1994 (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 17 March)--far below the 99 million tons produced in 1993 (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 11 March), reflecting dim prospects for 1994 as farmers continue to experience financial difficulties in buying fuel, equipment, and seed. Others assert that even predictions of 89 million tons are far too optimistic and that Russia will run out of grain, pointing out, for example, that fall planting of winter grain was down 20 percent from 1992 (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 23 March). An Agriculture and Food Ministry official, speaking before Yeltsin and Zaveryukha announced that there would be no imports, said the country will need 113.9 million tons of grain (28 million for food, 28 million for seed, and about 62 million for fodder) and will have to import 13-14 million tons this year (Interfax, 17 February). Zaveryukha's optimism seems based largely on reduced demand, especially for livestock fodder, rather than increased production, and he has said that his calculations show that Russia has enough fodder grain this year (Selskaya Zhizn, 29 January). Much of Russia's grain has traditionally been used to feed livestock--more than in other countries--and much of the imported grain is precisely fodder grain. Under the pressure of higher grain prices and limited grain supplies, livestock herds have been cut recently, reducing the amount of grain going to fodder and cutting grain consumption markedly. An agricultural institute estimated that grain consumption by livestock has fallen from 70 million tons in 1988 to 56 million tons in 1993 (Interfax, 14 January). Roskhleboprodukt President Leonid Cheshinskiy recently said that the lower import needs were based on lower fodder consumption since the number of hogs had fallen 36 percent since 1992 and cattle and poultry 19 percent (Interfax, 23 March). Kudelya said that last fall's freeing of bread prices had led to a 15 percent drop in its consumption (Interfax, 14 January), discouraging human consumption as well as feeding cheap bread to animals. Ironically, the reduction of livestock herds now seems to be treated as a positive step- -reducing wasteful use of grain--even though in the past cutting herds because of fodder shortages was viewed as a major setback to agriculture, reducing meat and dairy production for years to come and setting back efforts to improve the Russian diet. Zaveryukha has also raised the idea that demand will be reduced by cutting the state's role in procurement. He argued that a new procurement system being introduced will decrease the number of consumers dependent on the federal food fund and make more of them depend on regional food funds and non-government markets (Selskaya Zhizn, 29 January). He has also claimed that federal food reserves would be reduced this year and would cover fewer areas, and that wholesale markets would form "the basis of stable food provision'' (Interfax, 2 February). An edict ''On Liberalizing the Grain Market in Russia'' adopted by Yeltsin on 24 December formed a federal grain fund and regional funds and announced that the federal and regional governments would no longer require mandatory deliveries from farms (Sobraniye Aktov Prezidenta i Pravitelstva Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 27 December 1993; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15 January). The state set a target of only 10-11 million tons for its 1994 federal grain fund (10 million, according to Interfax, 14 January 1994; 10.7, according to Russian TV, 16 March; and 11 million, according to Cheshinskiy in the 23 March Rossiyskaya Gazeta). A 23 March Rossiyskaya Gazeta article called the decree on liberalizing the grain market "essentially aimed at considerably reducing state purchases of grain for the federal fund" and creating competition in the grain market by privatizing grain procurement centers and creating grain markets. Reducing the federal food fund would directly allow a cut in imports because this fund is largely formed from imported grain (Interfax, 17 February). Despite Zaveryukha's assertions, however, the new procurement system does not seem likely to bring a drastic reduction of state grain needs compared to last year since most of its features had already been introduced last year. The government had also established separate federal and regional food funds in 1993, with the federal fund only covering the military, Moscow and St. Petersburg (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 16 February 1993) and had set federal reserves at only 11.8 million tons for 1993--as against about 30 million in previous years (Interfax, 2 March 1993). The federal fund actually bought 11.5 million tons in 1993 (Interfax, 14 January)--not much more than this year's target. Total needs- -including regional as well as federal--may be not much smaller than the 30-some million purchased in most past years. Interfax on 20 January said that present federal and regional funds comprised 27 million tons. Financial Aid Zaveryukha's drive against food imports is part of his campaign to rescue the ailing farm sector by increasing government financial aid. He stated at a February Ministry of Agriculture and Food meeting that the main thing this year is to prevent ''disintegration'' of Russian farming and ''preserve Russia's food independence" and that farms are counting on financial support in a new government decree on the agroindustrial complex and on introduction of customs duties on imports (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18 February). Zaveryukha appeared to achieve considerable success recently in protecting agricultural interests by pushing through cabinet approval of a decree "On Functioning of the Agroindustrial Complex in 1994?' that orders the government to pay farms for the products they sold to the state in 1993, to allow farms to postpone payment of their debts, and to retain existing state subsidies for equipment, parts, fuel, and fertilizer. According to the Agriculture and Food Ministry, the decree, approved by the cabinet on 3 February, was to cost the government 14 trillion rubles, but according to critics, its cost would more likely be 34 trillion, and this big sum from an already hard- pressed budget caused a big political uproar. Even after the cabinet decision, controversy over the decree's financial aid to agriculture continued, and Chernomyrdin delayed signing it, alarming agrarian lobbyists. Zaveryukha assured the Agriculture and Food Ministry on 15 February that the premier would soon sign the decree (Segodnya, 17 February), but 39 worried Agrarian Party Duma deputies visited Chernomyrdin on 18 February to urge him to sign, and Chairman Aleksandr Nazarchuk of the Duma's Committee on Agrarian Matters afterward announced the premier would sign it before the 25 February cabinet discussion of the budget (Segodnya, 19 February), presumably to nail down agriculture's allocations before final decisions on the budget. When finally signed, the controversial decree, now titled "On Economic Conditions for Functioning of the Agroindustrial Complex of the Russian Federation in 1994," did include big financial aid for farms but less than the draft approved on 3 February. Chernomyrdin signed it on 23 February, and it was published in the 26 February Selskaya Zhizn and 28 February Sobraniye. Like the earlier version the cabinet approved on 3 February, the final decree ordered paying off of 1993 state debts to farms and subsidizing of farms' purchase of electricity, fuel, fertilizer, equipment, and seed, but, according to Nazarchuk, it provided for considerably less funding for spring sowing and other items (Segodnya, 24 February). Zaveryukha portrayed the decree as a "victory for agrarians," although he admitted that he was ??not entirely satisfied?? with it (Trud, 26 February), and he insisted it will provide enough to finance spring sowing (Interfax, 24 February). Later, farmers complained that banking and finance officials are dragging their feet in distributing the funds allotted for the 1994 spring sowing, leaving farmers without the needed financial help at this critical time (Selskaya Zhizn, 24 March). It is still unclear whether the amounts promised to agriculture by the decree conform to the draft budget's allocations. Prospects Zaveryukha's moves to bar imports, accepted by Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin, seem prompted more by the desire to protect Russian farmers than by the prospect of satisfactory food supplies. It may, however, give needed incentives to farms and help restore proper domestic production by making the government and others buy from farmers rather than seek food abroad. Moreover, the 23 February agroindustrial complex decree, in addition to protectionist and subsidy aspects, appears to contain reform features. It ordered creation of a network of "food markets'' and agromarketing services'' as "alternative channels" for selling grain, helping create free market conditions for farmers and following up on Yeltsin's 24 December edict that abolished mandatory deliveries and ordered other steps to create a freer market for food. But little has been seen yet about the new system of private markets and regional food funds, and it is not clear how well it will ensure supplies. (AUTHOR: HAHN.
