The two premiers expressed the pledge during their talks at the Great Hall of the People here this morning. Li said that relations between the two countries have developed smoothly since they established diplomatic ties 15 years ago. Especially over the past few years, he added, the exchange of visits between high-ranking officials of the two countries has increased and the bilateral relationship has been growing. Li said China places great importance on its economic relations and trade with Portugal on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and will send a purchasing group to Portugal at an appropriate time. Extending his warm welcome to Portuguese entrepreneurs who are accompanying the prime minister on the visit, Li said it is his hope that industrialists and businessmen of the two countries will have wide contacts and explore various ways for cooperation, to enable bilateral trade to rise by a big margin and expand the scale of bilateral economic cooperation. Praising the fruitful cooperation between China and Portugal on the issue of Macao, Li said the Macao society is stable and its economy is growing steadily. The residents of Macao have full confidence in its future, he said. The facts demonstrate that earnestly implementing the Sino- Portuguese Joint Declaration conforms to the interests of the two countries and cooperation benefits them both. He expressed the belief that so long as the two sides, as always, act in accordance with the spirit of friendly consultation, various issues concerning the transitional period of Macao can be properly settled and Macao can realize a stable transition and smooth transfer of power in 1999. Silva said he was very pleased to have the chance to revisit China on the occasion of the 7th anniversary of the signing of the Portugal-China Joint Declaration on the question of Macao. He expressed the hope that this visit will give impetus to the smooth implementation of the joint declaration and promote the growth of bilateral relations. Silva said the Portuguese Government consistently attaches great importance to its relations with China. He has brought a large delegation of entrepreneurs with him to China, which he said vividly shows that the Portuguese Government and entrepreneurs have sincere aspirations for and are eager to develop Portugal-China economic ties and trade. He said the Portuguese Government and people pay great attention to the question of Macao and are looking attentively at Macao's future and stability. "What we are gratified at is that the two countries have had very good cooperation on the question of Macao in the spirit of friendly trust. "The joint declaration is being implemented smoothly, which gives us full confidence in Macao's future," he said. On international issues, Li said that after the end of the Cold War, the world people's demands for the establishment of a new international political and economic order has daily become stronger. This is the need of the times and also the inevitable result of the development of the international situation, he said. Li said the new world order should be based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence. Countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, all have the right to be involved in international affairs and can make their due contributions to this end. He said international affairs should not be decided by one or several big powers in the world. Therefore China supports the current world trend toward multipolarization. The Chinese premier said China attaches great importance to developing its ties with European countries, adding: "We have no conflicts of interests and our economies are mutually complementary and have great potential." He said China thanks Portugal for its support of the resumption of China's status as a signatory party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). During the talks, Li recalled with pleasure his visit to Portugal in February 1992. Silva invited Li Peng to visit Portugal again and the Chinese premier expressed his thanks and accepted the invitation with pleasure. Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and visiting Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Durao Barroso participated in the talks. After the talks the two premiers attended a ceremony for signing a framework loan agreement between the Bank of China and the National Overseas Bank of Portugal (Banco Nacional Ultramarino). According to the agreement, the Portuguese bank will provide the Bank of China with a credit line of 200 million U.S. dollars. This is the first instrument of credit between the banks of the two countries and also the largest credit agreement signed between the two countries. This evening, Li Peng hosted a banquet here in honor of Silva and his wife and their party.
