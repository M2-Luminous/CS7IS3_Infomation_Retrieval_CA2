The nomenklatura blames it on the "disruption of ties" and "collapse of the Union". To explain the true causes of the severe crisis and how it could be solved we invited Yuriy Orobets, candidate in technical sciences and a specialist in managing the energy industry. [Orobets] Our country is not particularly poor in energy sources. Coal deposits alone, even if worked intensively, could satisfy Ukrainian demand for more than two centuries. However, conditions in the coal industry as a whole do not meet current requirements. Twelve 12 percent of mines are older than 50 years, while 60 percent have not been overhauled for the past 30 years. These factors negatively impact on the production of fuel. Substantial investment is also required to modernize the industry. The outlook is good also for brown coal deposits in the Dnieper basin. Especially since coal can be mined there the cheapest way: in open pits. Experts estimate that brown coal could yield 600,000 tonnes of cheap gasoline per year. The situation is difficult in the oil and gas industry. The peak of its development in the Carpathian region and eastern oblasts is long past, and Ukraine supplies only 9 percent of its oil demand and 22 percent of its gas needs. It was the discovery of rich deposits in Siberia and Central Asia that lead to the contraction of exploration and development works here. Another negative factor was our ground yield coefficient for oil, which is low (but, nonetheless, twice as high as in the U.S., where geological conditions are similar.) [Kulchynskyy] What is the cause of the energy crisis in Ukraine? [Orobets] Supply and demand for energy have developed over the past 30 years without regard for world prices, which have the decisive impact on the development of energy producing and processing operations. This has caused an energy crisis not only in Ukraine and other new countries, but in Russia itself. The discovery of rich deposits of oil and gas in Siberia led to the intensive production of light products, such as gasoline, kerosine and diesel fuel, and a huge quantity of heavy fuels. Moreover, low yields from refining were tolerated. Ukrainian refineries get only 40 percent of light fuels from processed crude, whereas US refineries get up to 70 percent. The existence of rich deposits of inexpensive natural gas allowed us to bring gas to most cities and towns, and to use it widely in industry. The low prices on oil and natural gas were based on costs, and not set to match world prices. This principle resulted in the construction of a large number of cheap but wasteful energy using systems. Unfortunately, delivery of oil and gas to Ukraine is being used by Russia to apply pressure in solving political problems. At the same time, Russia itself is experiencing a profound crisis of oil production. Output has declined by 40 percent. Therefore, from every point of view, Ukraine must find a general solution for other sources of energy. [Kulchynskyy] What is the outlook for the development of hydroelectric and nuclear power? [Orobets] Ukraine has resources to develop nuclear power, but the entire processing plant of the nuclear power industry is based in Russia. As to hydroelectric power, our low-lying country with slow-flowing rivers would limit the development of this type of energy. This is why hydroelectric plants produce only 4 percent of power while their reservoirs take up hundreds of hectares of some of the richest black soil in the world. [Kulchynskyy] Recently, in this country and the world over, the idea of using alternative sources has become popular. [Orobets] The most realistic sources of alternative energy are, in practice, the energy of the sun, the wind, sea waves and photosynthesis. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to tap solar and wind energy. From the practical point of view, it is necessary to know exactly how much capacity must be in reserve for the period when there is no sun or when it goes behind clouds, or when there is no wind, and how long it will last. Taking into account these details, as well as the great expenditures required for the mass production of generating equipment, commercial production of this "free" energy turns out to be considerably more expensive than traditional sources. Along with wind-driven generators, the most promising is research in the production of fuel using photochemical and photobiological processes. Also, sun batteries can be used effectively. By the way, Ukraine produces and profitably exports them. Using alternative sources, the problem of supplying energy to some remote sites can be easily resolved. [Kulchynskyy] In your opinion, can the energy crisis be overcome, or at least mitigated, using domestic capabilities? [Orobets] Of course. To do this, we must first of all reorganize import and export of petroleum products. Despite difficulties with energy sources, gasoline remains Ukraine's main export. The theft of national property must be decisively stopped. Moreover, for various reasons, energy is used very ineffectively. Measures to save energy can be divided into two categories. The first category consists of organizational measures, which entail the introduction of strict discipline and order in industry. The second category is the development of technical measures to reduce energy intensity in industry. The first category of measures can be implemented very rapidly. Moreover, privatization would accelerate this process. This can save 5-to-7 percent of electric power and 10-to-15 percent of energy used for heating. The implementation of the second category of measures will bring results that are 2-to-3 times greater, but here, major investment and considerable reconstruction will be required. Ukraine is building an oil terminal near Odessa, the first line of which will begin operation in October of this year. We must also explore the possibility of bringing in oil through Baltic ports, using the pipeline system in Belarus. In the future, we could export light fuels produced by the excess capacity of our refineries. For this, however, investments are necessary to raise yields. It is extremely important to reduce the use of gas and heavy fuels in producing electric power. The necessary condition for this is to modernize our coal-burning plants, first of all by installing boilers using nontraditional methods to burn solid fuels with a high soot content. But Ukraine produces no such boilers. [Kulchynskyy] What would you like to see happen in the industry? [Orobets] To rebalance our fuel and energy complex will require much work and, as you have already seen, considerable investment. To attract it, we need a strong government comprised of specialists and reformers whose deeds would not differ from their words.
