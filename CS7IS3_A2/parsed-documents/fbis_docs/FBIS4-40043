The program is moderated by Ala Ustsina, and a chief legal adviser and a member of the Central Electoral Commission are also in attendance. The program consists of a live segment with Novikaw, and a recorded video portraying Novikaw as family and public man. Questions, both live and recorded, are posed to Novikaw by unidentified journalists. Novikaw speaks in Russian throughout the program. Touching upon political issues, Novikaw states that all the misfortunes of the people began with the "Moscow events of 1991" and the agreement in the Belavezha forest, where the "great three ruined the great country -- the Soviet Union." The Communist Party of Belarus, which put forward his candidacy, speaks for the "building of authentic socialism -- a society of social justice," Novikaw says. He voices assurances that "the mistakes of the past will not be repeated by Communists in the future." Asked about differences between the Communists and other political forces in Belarus, Novikaw says that these differences can be seen as "ways and methods for obtaining a common goal -- the welfare of Belarus." Novikaw assures that the Communists do not want to "expropriate" private property after coming into power "again," but they will give priority to the state form of ownership in those branches of the national economy, which are "vitally important" to the maintenance of society as a whole. He adds that in other areas of economic activity -- for example, in trade and services -- private forms of property and business will be admissible. Discussing the problem of responsibility for the current economic situation in Belarus, Novikaw states that, beginning 1991, the power in Belarus was in the hands of "non-Communists," who dominated both the government and the Supreme Soviet. According to Novikaw, Communists -- that is, members of the current Communist Party of Belarus -- comprise only 20 percent of the current Supreme Soviet. The government and the Supreme Soviet, he affirms, are dominated by members of the "party of power." He argues that the Communists are capable of managing the economy efficiently. Novikaw cites China as an example to support this claim. Asked about possibly abandoning his candidacy in favor of Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich, Novikaw answers in the negative and adds that he has been obliged by his party to "go to the end" of his presidential campaign. At the end of the program, Novikaw promises that in a few days he will publish his propositions, with regard to reforms in the Armed Forces, in local newspapers.
