The source, who did not want to be identified, said, "We want to produce a concluded package at the earliest possible date in March." Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa decided last week to formulate a set of measures including deregulation and import promotion to improve foreign access to the Japanese market. His decision came in the wake of a U.S. announcement that it plans to impose sanctions against Japan on cellular phones. The source said, however, the planned market-opening steps are not designed to avert threatened U.S. trade retaliation. "Rather, they are voluntary efforts," the source said. The source also said the scheduled emergency meeting of cabinet members on the new package will be held after the third supplementary budget for the current fiscal 1993 becomes law, probably on Wednesday.
