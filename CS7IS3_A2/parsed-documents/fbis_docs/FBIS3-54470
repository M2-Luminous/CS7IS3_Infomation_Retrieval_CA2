FBIS3-54470 "drnes016__s94011" FBIS-NES-94-016-S Document Type:Daily Report 25 January 1994 * RESALAT Editorials on Voice, Vision Matter * What Should Be Done? 94LA0051C Tehran RESALAT in Persian 9 Nov 93 pp 1, 2 94LA0051C Tehran RESALAT Language: Persian Article Type:CSO [Editorial by Political Section] [Text] The broadcast of the answer from the Voice and Vision organization to the Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group continues to be a serious issue in domestic political circles. In this regard the following points are worthy of notice and further discussion: 1. There is no doubt that the broadcast of the Voice and Vision organization's answer over the national radio network was irresponsible, because Article 76 of the Constitution states that the Majles has the clear right to research and investigate all the nation's affairs. Apart from its insults to the sacred Majles and its respected deputies, the answer from the Voice and Vision organization did not have sufficient evidence. Even assuming that there was material in the report from the Inquiry and Investigation Group that does not conform to reality, the authority to determine that is not the body that is being investigated! That body can defend itself in a judicial trial and if any right has been violated, it can take steps to vindicate its rights. Otherwise, all the bodies and organizations investigated would want to investigate and even judge and issue an opinion about the work of the Majles, including any report it issues about their own organization, and such a right is not given in the Constitution to any body, organization or government unit in any of the ordinary laws or the Constitution. 2. From the failure to broadcast the subsequent portions of the answer from the Voice and Vision organization, it appears that this decision was precipitous and hasty, and a violation. The question arises, why does the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization act on his own in matters of such importance? What is the penalty for doing this? 3. The question of the competence of a deputy or deputies is the concern of the executive councils, the Guardian Council and also the Majles. This matter is pursued by the deputies themselves at the beginning of each term. In any case, a deputy who has taken a seat in the Majles is competent in the eyes of the people who voted for him and also in the eyes of the deputies themselves. How is it possible that his competence can be questioned by a body that has been investigated for improper performance? The insults to the sacred Majles and its deputies, which are in the first part of the answer from the Voice and Vision organization, are unprecedented, and the Voice and Vision organization certainly must make amends. Public opinion expects the honor of the deputies who have been slandered to be restored. 4. Among the insults, which have been improperly propagated, is the claim that is in the first of the answer from the Voice and Vision organization in the sacred presence of Imam Khomeyni (peace be upon him). Although the criticism in the answer is useless and it contains completely incorrect material, it is not without benefit to mention the following in order to reveal for readers the logic of those who prepared the answer. The answer from the Voice and Vision organization states: "The goals of the Voice and Vision organization are guidance, training, information, education, recreation, amusement. This organization has never once broadcast a neutral program and it does not do so. All the programs have goals and are educational. This is not a claim that the Voice and Vision organization is making, this is the opinion of His Holiness the Imam, may God be pleased with him, in the fall of 1366 [1987]." Although in a message in the year 1366 [21 March 1987-20 March 1988] His Holiness the Imam said "violations are sometimes rarely seen, and one must be more vigilant." The officials of the Voice and Vision organization believe that they have not broadcast a neutral program even once, and they have also connected that to the Imam's testimony. First of all, the Imam's blessed manuscript pertains to what had been broadcast, not to what would be broadcast in the future. Second, His Holiness the Imam said "violations are sometimes rarely seen." Thus it is not as the gentlemen claim, not even once. Third, has the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization forgotten that on 8/10/1367 [1 November 1988] the Imam wrote a harsh letter protesting what was being broadcast by the Voice of the Islamic Republic? For Mr. Hashemi's information, we present His Holiness the Imam's opinion: In the name of the Almighty Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, executive director of the Voice and Vision organization of the Islamic Republic: It is absolutely regrettable and sad that yesterday (Saturday, 8 Bahman [28 January]) material was broadcast over the Voice of the Islamic Republic on the model for women, which one is ashamed to repeat. The person that broadcast these things is to be punished and fired and those involved in this will be punished. If it is proved that there was an intentional insult, without a doubt the person making the insult will be condemned to death. If this sort of thing is repeated, it will mean severe and serious punishment and penalties for the high-level officials of the Voice and Vision organization. Of course the judiciary will take steps in all areas. 11/9/1367 [29 January 1988] Ruhollah al-Musavi al-Khomeyni Do you still claim that all the programs are educational? Now answer, which of the Voice and Vision organization's goals were being pursued by insulting the sacred things of Islam, in such a way as to draw a protest from His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him)? Was it guidance, education, information, information, training, recreation or entertainment? Apart from any kind of penalties that the law may set for him, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization certainly must remember the holy presence of His Holiness the Imam in relation to the violation he has committed and he must also apologize to the deputies of the Majles Footnotes [location within text not indicated] [.sup]1.[/] Newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI [.sup]2.[/] Sahifeh Nur, Vol. 21, p 76
