At first everything seemed to go "according to plan." The other candidates for mayor besides incumbent D. Bednyakov were two of the city's well-known individuals, Ye. Krestyaninov and O. Maslov. True, the latter dropped out during the registration period "due to an insufficient number of voter signatures for nomination." However, the two remaining candidates have waged such a campaign that the citizens of Nizhniy Novgorod have begun following it just like they do events on the shows "Santa Barbara" and "Simply Maria." The election campaign gets daily coverage on the two local television channels. The two candidates were allies until just recently. Together with the governor they discussed and decided all the key issues in the life of Nizhniy Novgorod's citizens. But then at some point (exactly when remains a mystery to a majority of the city's population to this day) their relations went sour. Worse yet, B. Nemtsov, abusing his official position and violating his own "democratic principles," set out to "dump" Dmitriy Bednyakov, his former protege. Now he likes Ye. Krestyaninov better. Nor did the governor make any secret of his sympathies. Higher-level authorities pointed out to B. Nemtsov that he was in violation of legislation when he campaigned in favor of Yevgeniy Krestyaninov. Supposedly the governor should remain neutral in election campaigns. However, last Friday evening, just two days before the election, in a speech broadcast on local television the governor gave the people a de facto ultimatum: do not elect Krestyaninov, or bad things would happen to the city. That same evening Bednyakov stated on a different television channel that under pressure from the governor he had been forced to withdraw the "city charter" from a referendum which was supposed to take place simultaneously with the mayoral election. He also issued an invitation to independent observers to oversee the election. The next thing that happened was completely unexpected. At around midnight Yevgeniy Krestyaninov showed up at the television studio and announced that he was withdrawing his candidacy. And under the election statute that could mean only one thing: no mayoral election could be held. The next day, on Saturday, people waited to hear local radio and television reports announcing that the governor and the two candidates had come to some sort of agreement. Yet nothing changed. The result is that the election was not held. Approximately a billion and a half rubles of budget funds had been spent for nothing. And that despite loud talk --broadcast around the world -- of "new democratic principles in local government..." Our Commentary Never before have the people of Russia seemed so passive with regard to their voting rights as in the course of elections to local representative bodies that began late last year. Voter turnout hit a "record" low at about one-third of eligible voters. Yet there were seemingly innumerable okrugs, rayons and cities where the numerous candidates for deputies' seats were not able to get even 25 percent of voters to turn out on their first attempt. As you will recall, that kind of "massive" turnout is now sufficient to constitute a legal election. Last Sunday elections were held in approximately 30 regions. This does not include areas where a runoff election was scheduled. The final results of this latest stage in the sluggish campaign, enlivened only by scandalous events of the sort that occurred in Nizhniy Novgorod, may become available in a day or two or, most likely, at the end of the week. But judging by fragmentary preliminary information received from a number of regions, the voters were once again none too eager to perform their civic duty. For example, nine districts in Nizhniy Novgorod will have to hold runoff elections for local Duma seats. In Ryazan only one candidate for deputy out of 14 was elected, and in Novgorod no Duma election was held at all in one out of eight districts. Voter turnout in three Bryansk districts ranged from 18.5 to 22.2 percent... Good grief, should we just start over? Oh, Moscow, give us a few more billions! From the Russian Federation Central Election Committee and structures close to the president there have been complaints that local elections are just taking place spontaneously, without any sort of "sponsorship" on the part of federal authorities. Supposedly if the latter were to "get involved" the outcome would be different. It is also supposedly time to finally approve a whole series of laws, one of the most important of which would pertain to fundamental guarantees of citizens' voting rights and... financial support for election campaigns. But citizens are sick and tired of these "democracy games" in which they are supposed to play the role of spectators. A majority of citizens see no benefit whatsoever in all these expensive elections, referendums, polls, etc., which threaten to become endless. Therefore they are in no hurry to get out and vote... It would seem that this is clear to everyone by now. Unfortunately, everyone has not yet realized who does in fact benefit from all THIS. Who is it? Just the bureaucrats and administrators who are gathering more and more local power into their hands. And perhaps some bureaucrats higher up as well? Think about it, voters. Think!
