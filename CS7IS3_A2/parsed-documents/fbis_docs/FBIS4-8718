[Kanis] There are two main areas of cooperation -- research and cooperation in the production of weapons and arms systems, and our moving closer toward NATO within the framework of the Partnership for Peace project. After the demise of the Warsaw Pact, its former member states spontaneously started to do exactly the same things. The system of production sharing, which made arms production cheaper and more efficient, fell apart, and as a result, everything became more expensive. The innovation of the T-72 tank is a case in point. All the former Warsaw Pact states are working on it independently. Division of labor is necessary to make the innovation of arms equipment cheaper. We can cooperate with the Poles in many fields. [Brozik] But cooperation will not remain bilateral or confined to the framework of the former Warsaw Pact. [Kanis] Our orientation toward transatlantic and West European security structures is an exceptionally serious matter. We are confronted by new realities. Partnership for Peace, which is a framework project, should be given specific shape in so-called presentation documents [prezentacne dokumenty]. This requires an exchange of opinions within the framework of the Visegrad Four [V-4] group, including about the division of tasks within the framework of the project. Cooperation within the V-4 is connected with this. The Czech Republic and the Hungarian Republic give preference to a race for NATO or European Union membership. It is apparent that this pursues propaganda aims without yielding any benefit for the aforementioned states. First it is necessary to demonstrate the ability to form integration relations among ourselves and only then is it possible to consider integration into Western structures. The Poles' idea of the V-4 is that of a grouping with common intentions in terms of contents and time. The Polish view is very sympathetic to us. It is the idea of a cart with four wheels, one of which is Slovakia. [Brozik] The post of defense minister should not be combined with membership in any party. Have you not considered suspending your membership in the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]? [Kanis] I expected this question, but it is necessary to view this matter realistically. I am not a soldier minister. Hence, I do not have to meet the criteria that a soldier would if he became minister. I am a civilian who has been nominated by a "certain" party. Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys is also a high level functionary of a political party. The same goes for Lajos Fur in Hungary, who is even chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum. A civilian minister must be considered differently from a soldier minister. However, the Army should self-evidently be above party affairs. This means that one must not engage in any political activities on the premises of Army barracks. A soldier can be politically engaged when he is out of uniform. My membership or nonmembership [of the SDL] depends on coalition agreements.
