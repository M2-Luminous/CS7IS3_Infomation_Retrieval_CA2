The measure to mobilize an undetermined number of soldiers was adopted this morning by the military garrison in Anzoategui State, following the governor's request this morning to Garrison Commander Miguel Aparicio Ramirez. Police had been literally "run over" the past few days by angry mobs and had been unable to prevent vandalism, which left many supermarkets looted and several vehicles ablaze. Up until now the authorities have not disclosed whether any arrests have been made. Violence unleashed by a group calling itself "Red Flag" [bureau records show this organization was founded in 1970 by Carlos Betancourt] had paralyzed activities in Barcelona, capital of Anzoategui State, for about a week. Disturbances also reached the nearby beach resort of Puerto la Cruz. Even though both Barcelona and Puerto la Cruz woke up in complete calm today, it was a tense calm because of the presence of National Guardsmen patrolling the streets. Meanwhile, transportation services, which had been temporarily suspended, have been totally reestablished, allowing students and workers to meet their obligations, the local VENPRES wire service reported. Likewise, many businessmen opened their stores. Anzoategui Governor Ovidio Gonzalez gave assurances that the situation had been normalized in the northern part of the state, even though he would not admit that Barcelona and Puerto la Cruz are "militarized." He said that street patrols by the Armed Forces represent "a routine situation when there is violence."
