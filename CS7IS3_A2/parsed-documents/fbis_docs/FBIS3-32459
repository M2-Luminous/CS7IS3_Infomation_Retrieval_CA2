He said that "the consciences of many persons from several municipalities have been bought off, having in mind the 1994 election campaign." The legislator supported the statements made by his colleague Juan Jose Chaux Mosquera who was one of the first to denounce the presence of drug money in political circles. Papamija Diago promised to cooperate with Chaux Mosquera to investigate and reveal the names of those politicians who are buying votes, apparently with money obtained from drug trafficking. Meanwhile, Senator Humberto Pelaez Gutierrez, a Liberal leader in northern Cauca, said that "one should bear in mind whether Congressman Chaux Mosquera made the statements while intoxicated or while sober," and Pelaez Gutierrez hopes to begin investigations aimed at clearing up such statements.
