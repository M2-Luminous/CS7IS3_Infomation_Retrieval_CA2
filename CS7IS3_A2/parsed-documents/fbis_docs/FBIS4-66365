Coal seam water injection is an engineering standard during the coal mining process to reduce coal dust and prevent gas eruptions and the occurrence of shock ground pressures. Because China has no experimental standards for coal permeability coefficients and coal body water conduction coefficients had never been measured, on-site water injection mostly depended on experience and water injection at most mines depended on their situations, so it was difficult to obtain the expected results. To undertake intensive research work on this topic, Ma Guangdi, Zhao Yangsheng, and others developed their own coal and rock body water conduction coefficient experimental console and triaxial stress measurement instrument. They can use this equipment to conduct research on coal and rock samples measuring 100 x 100 x 200mm. These dimensions are eight times those of samples measured using similar experimental equipment in foreign countries. It provided the conditions for doing research on coal and rock pore and crack permeability, and it can be used to study the permeability of softer rock. In addition, they conducted 300 x 300 x 300mm coal sample tests and derived the conclusion that the dimensions of coal bodies do not change their permeability. They also collected coal samples from China's seven big unified distribution coal mines and conducted a large amount of experimental research in the laboratory on coal bodies that contain pores and cracks. They derived a mathematical model for water conduction coefficients under the effects of three-dimensional stress and pore water pressure, and the laws of coal body deformation and effective stress caused by pore water pressure, and produced a correction formula for the (Taishaji) principle. These research achievements have laid a solid foundation for coal seam water injection. On the basis of a large amount of basic research, they have conducted industrial experiments at Datong, Lu'an, Xishan, and other coal mines in Shanxi Province. They successfully conducted a coal seam water injection shock ground pressure prevention experiment that enabled the safe extraction of 140,000 tons of coal in one year from this work face. Their softening of moderate hardness coal seams using coal seam water injection overcame a problem in mining roof coal in moderate hardness coal and led to success in a skylight coal mining method which produced 1.65 million yuan in economic benefits for this mining bureau in one year. Their water injection dust reduction experiments have achieved a gratifying on-site result of a 63.2 percent reduction in dust. They are now working on a scientific research project for the Ministry of Coal Industry in which they will complete research on the water conduction properties of coal samples from all of China's primary coal mines and will propose a water conduction characteristic classification program.
