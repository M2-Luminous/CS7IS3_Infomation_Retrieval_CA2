Stepashin gave the reasons for his Far East tour as: The increased counterintelligence activities of the Japanese, North Korean, and Chinese intelligence services in this region of Russia; the upcoming Federation Council discussions on Russian border issues; and to get acquainted with working conditions in regional FSK departments to find out how the Russian president's edict on combating organized crime and banditry will be implemented in practice. According to the FSK director, the Chinese and North Korean intelligence services are actively recruiting people, and studying military technology and the drug business in the Far East territory. Stepashin also said the document on joint action to implement the president's edict on combating organized crime will soon be signed with the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry. In the FSK director's opinion, this edict is very tough and even disagrees with some statutes of Russian law, but it is extremely necessary given current conditions. The document specifically permits not only lengthening the period of investigation, but also gives the right to legalize operational and technical information and hand it over to the court.
