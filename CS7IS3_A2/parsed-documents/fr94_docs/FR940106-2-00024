FR940106-2-00024 FR940106-2-00008 Preliminary Results of Review As a result of our comparison of USP to FMV, the Department preliminarily determines that a margin of 8.06 percent exists for Benkan for the period March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. Interested parties may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice and may request a hearing within 10 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication of this notice, or the first workday thereafter. Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to the issues raised in the case briefs and comments, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication. The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review, including the results of its analysis of any such written comments or hearing. The Department shall determine, and U.S. Customs shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentage stated above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to Customs. Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this administrative review, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be that rate established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for merchandise exported by manufacturers or exporters not covered in this review but covered in a previous review or the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the rate published in the most recent final results or determination for which the manufacturer or exporter received a company-specific rate; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, earlier reviews, or the original investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be that established for the manufacturer of the merchandise in these final results of review, earlier reviews, or the original investigation, whichever is the most recent; and (4) the ``all others'' rate will be 49.31 percent, as explained below. On May 25, 1993, the CIT, in Floral Trade Council v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;79, and Federal-Mogul Corporation v. United States , Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company it can only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders. Accordingly, the cash deposit rate for any future entries from all other manufacturers or exporters, who are not covered in this or prior administrative reviews and who are unrelated to the reviewed firms or any previously reviewed firm, will be the ``all others'' rate established in the original LTFV investigation which is 49.31 percent. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: December 29, 1993. Barbara R. Stafford, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;280 Filed 1&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
