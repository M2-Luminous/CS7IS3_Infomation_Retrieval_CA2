In a "Dear Colleagues" letter, the "infiltration of our state leadership by Jewish circles" is deplored. The letter, seen at nearly all Vienna police stations and also found at external units, including the Security Alert Department, lists eight persons -- partly indicating their addresses -- who participated in talks on amending the "Stalinist" law banning neo-Nazi activities. The names include Simon Wiesenthal, "correct name: Szymon Wizenthal, reparation fraud," and the lawyers Gabriel Lansky and Georg Zanger, both described as "Jews, communists, freemasons, members of the Udo Proksch gang [Vienna businessman who was sentenced for causing the death of six persons], probably KGB and Mosad agents." Zanger has now brought charges against unknown perpetrators, and he wants to support the proceedings as a private person. According to the Self-Defense Community, the Austrian Government consists "only of freemasons and partly of Jews or of persons with Jewish ancestry (Education Minister Scholten, Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek, Social Affairs Minister Hesoun, Transportation Minister Klima, Finance Minister Lacina)." Austria's "official immigration policy" leads to the "destruction of the racial nature of the people through the replacement of natives by foreigners, and through the settlement of members of other races." Thus, the government is "guilty of genocide." The "admission of foreigners and the destruction of closed settlement areas of native (German) population" is "high treason." The letter refers to, among other things, the "Illustrated Review of the Austrian Federal Police" and a "secret file of the Vienna Police" and also deplores the fate of Gottfried Kuessel and Guenter Reinthaler. A "statement" that ends with "yours sincerely, your Self-Defense Community of Police Officers (NS)," announces that the politicians will no longer be protected. "Our professional honor and conviction as representatives of law and order -- and not of `legal injustice' -- commands us to serve the people." Thus, the "NS" considers itself "unable to guarantee the security of politicians responsible for the replacement of natives because they have lost their right to protection through their criminal actions."
