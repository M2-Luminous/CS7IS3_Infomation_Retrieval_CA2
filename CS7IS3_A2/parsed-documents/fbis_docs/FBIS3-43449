PAC national organiser Maxwell Nemadzivhanani was reacting to reports that Mr Kriel had linked Transkei to the St James Church and Heidelberg Tavern massacres. Mr Nemadzvhanani said in a statement the recent arrests of PAC western Cape leaders Theo Mabusela and Michael Siyolo, as well as attempts to link Transkei to Azanian Peoples Liberation Army [APLA] attacks on South Africa, were "part of the regime's strategy to target the PAC in those areas where it is strong". He accused "the same forces" for arresting PAC leaders and members in a "nation-wide swoop" in May 1993 and "killing children" in a raid on a house in Transkei in October last year. "Following the Kenilworth church gun attack in July 1993 in Cape Town, the regime summarily arrested Vuyo Tekane, a PAC activist and schoolteacher allegedly for masterminding alleged APLA activities. "Tekane, according to police allegations then, was also linked to the 1922 APLA attack at a King William's Town golf club. Once again Tekane was released from detention without being charged for the alleged offences," Mr Nemadzivhanani said. He said from all the cases or "so-called police breakthroughs" a clear picture had emerged of "camouflaged hostilities" against the PAC in the guise of maintaining law and order. "The PAC strongly condemns the detention of Comrades Theo Mabusela and Michael Siyolo as pure political gangsterism by the (President F W) de Klerk regime, designed to manipulate the transition and eventually the outcome of the election by 'unlevelling' the playing field against the PAC and thus rigging the elections long before they start," Mr Nemadzvhanani said. Mr Nemadzvhanani's statement was issued to SAPA shortly before Mr Kriel on Wednesday announced the arrest of two alleged APLA members in connection with the Heidelberg Tavern attack.
