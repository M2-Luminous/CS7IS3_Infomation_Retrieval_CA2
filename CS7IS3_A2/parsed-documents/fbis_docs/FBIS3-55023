According to the ambassador, these myths are spread by some politicians and reporters. One of those myths is the opinion expressed in the Lithuanian press that Poland either had or has such political and social groups that raise territorial claims to Lithuania. The ambassador assured that this is not the case, and that the Polish Government recognizes Lithuania's territorial status quo. Jan Widacki also expressed his surprise with the statements that some "third party" is behind the issue of the registration of the Home Army veterans' club in Lithuania. He ruled out the proposal examined in the Lithuanian press that this club be registered at some Lithuanian veterans' organization or function within the framework of the Poles' Union. To reduce such misunderstandings, the ambassador proposed that journalists of both countries meet for seminars at least twice a year. In Jan Widacki's opinion, the journalists' duty is to dispel myths which emerged in relations between the Lithuanian and Polish nations rather than on the interstate level.
