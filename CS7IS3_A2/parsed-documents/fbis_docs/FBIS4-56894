"This situation increases the dissatisfaction of potential illegal emigrants and magnifies their individual and professional frustrations," the Political Alternatives Studies Center has indicated. The study is based on a poll carried out among people who tried to escape the island. Sixty percent of the people polled alleged that they had tried to escape because of economic reasons associated to material needs in the housing and consumer areas. The results of the study published today indicate that 54.7 percent of the people said they wanted to emigrate to the United States due to personal aspirations; 28.4 percent mentioned the search for personal freedom; and 16.3 percent cited family reasons. One of the family-related reasons given by the people polled was to alleviate their economic status in the United States because they did not think Cuba had the proper conditions for establishing a family. They also cited reasons related to family reunification. The poll revealed that 31 percent of the people interviewed had expressed differences or dissatisfaction with the Cuban political-social program. In this sense, "they judged the economic policy to be inadequate and underscored problems other than the ones brought about by the special period, such as the depreciation of work, the handling of religious beliefs, and the existence of marked social inequalities." The fact that the people polled hoped to find a network of relatives and friends who would welcome them abroad was another factor in their decision to abandon the island, the Havana University branch pointed out. A recent U.S. Coast Guard Service report recently published in Havana revealed that 2,173; 2,557; and 3,656 Cubans had reached the coast of Florida in 1991, 1992, and 1993, respectively. Meanwhile, the official BOHEMIA magazine revealed that there had been 5,597, 7,053, and 10,579 foiled escape attempts during that same period.
