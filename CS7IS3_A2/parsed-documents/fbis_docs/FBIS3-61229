I will deal with only the main directions of the programs. Let us start with the Russia's Choice program. It does not contain populist promises or idle talk. Priority problems are clearly identified, and the program says what needs to be done and how. The cornerstone is bringing down inflation, that is, bringing it down to 3 percent a month by the end of 1994. This is a bit too much as compared to countries with stable economies (which have 2-4 percent a year), but it would still make our life easier than it is now. In August inflation was 28 percent; in September a little less--22 percent; in October--24 percent; and in November--15 percent. I should note that how steadily inflation subsides will depend on how we all work. It was inflation more than anything else that pushed the voters into Zhirinovskiy's embrace. It irritates people more than high prices and a low standard of living, especially considering that in 1993 the latter rose somewhat as compared to 1992, although we still have not returned to the standard of living of the relatively prosperous years. The entire decline in the standard of living occurred during the first year of reforms. Our country is not the first or the last to fall into the inflation trap. Inflation, like an invisible thief, picks every pocket. It would seem that people are already paid relatively well--the average monthly wage in Russia has long exceeded the 100,000-ruble [R] mark, but this money melts away in front of our very eyes. You have to run and buy something quick, because prices go up instantly. I would not even mention that at this level of inflation it is impossible to save rubles. Every family loses in this respect, and the poor more than all the others. If we manage to bring inflation down, every family will benefit, too. This will by itself raise the standard of living. Besides, capital investment is only possible after inflation has been reined in. There are no precedents in the immense history of the world of investment and growth of production beginning before inflation is brought down. This does not happen. That is why Russia's Choice did not promise that next year would be a year of economic growth, rather that the work of the government should create the preconditions for it beginning in 1995, provided there is stability in the country. Do not jerk the government; give it a year to work normally, and the conditions will be laid down for Russia's development for the next 10-15 years. Then you will not recognize our country. After all, there has been a Japanese miracle, Italian, Spanish, and German... There will be a Russian one, too. But it took every country 10-15 years. This is a normal time frame. It is silly to believe in a fast--and double at that--increase in the population's income, as LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Zhirinovskiy promised. Taxes are another acute issue in the programs, which affected voter sympathies. Russia's Choice said honestly: It is impossible to cut taxes right now. And I will add that lowering them would be useless from the standpoint of economic development. Until inflation is brought down, the benefits accrued to tax-paying goods producers would immediately go into raising salaries rather than investment. Income freed from taxes would be converted to wages. And nothing else. The Russia's Choice program envisages three kinds of taxes. The greater part of the tax on profit and value-added tax remains in local budgets. These are local, or municipal, taxes. There are regional taxes, which are collected, for instance, into the budget of an oblast, kray, or republic. In my estimation, approximately one-third of all taxes should be transferred into the federal budget. This sensible taxation creates an economic foundation for staving off sovereignization of Russia's regions. Create conditions for local enterprises' operations and collect taxes from them for the local budget, because they are mostly local. Draft laws are ready on real estate taxes and introducing a tax for use of natural resources. Most countries do this. The total sum of taxes does not increase; it is simply that part of it is shifted from tax on profit into tax on real estate and natural resources. The program for bringing inflation down is realistic, and it is already being implemented. Taking advantage of the fact that nobody interfered with the government's work over the past few months, preferential credits to sectors and enterprises were suspended already in September. I was baffled, though, to see the president sign an edict giving agriculture preferential credit in the amount in excess of R300 billion a few days ago. This is an unpleasant deviation from the program, but not a catastrophic one. In essence, it is again propping up kolkhozes and sovkhozes, and one can see why: the agrarian lobby is pushing it. Tax preferences with respect to tax on profit and value-added tax have been reduced. So many preferences have proliferated that nobody knew any more who was supposed to pay taxes to the treasury, and how much. Another anti-inflation measure: All import subsidies have been removed, except subsidies for purchases of medications and medical equipment. Until recently such subsidies consumed 12 percent of total national income. Now if you want to buy something for dollars--be my guest, but buy your dollars at the current exchange rate like everybody else and stop begging the treasury for cheap hard currency. There had been incidents when the treasury, sympathetic to someone in a bind--textile producers need to buy dyes, they would say, and car makers need to buy equipment (everyone had a good reason)--sold dollars tens or even hundreds times below their market value. Various nonbudget funds have been merged into budget funds, that is, they came under the jurisdiction of the government. This is also a serious anti-inflation measure. It is outrageous when the means of nonbudget funds exceed the entire Russian budget, as happened last year. The pension fund had been under the control of the Supreme Soviet; social security by tradition was the province of trade unions; the fuel and energy complex had its own fund; and so on... The result was that the government had under its control a smaller part of national finances than the agencies that controlled nonbudget funds. It is impermissible for several financial systems to operate within one country. I am enumerating only those anti-inflation measures that have already been implemented or are in the process of being implemented; this means that the Russia's Choice program is quite realistic as long as they stick to it. Of course, anti-inflation measures are harsh. If, for instance, a defense enterprise does not get preferential credit, it may potentially face bankruptcy, which will cause unemployment and possibly a social explosion. But unless tough anti-inflation measures are taken, we will see a Ukrainization of the Russian economy. What this entails is quite graphic. There is no alternative, and Russia's Choice said so honestly, which is the main distinguishing feature of this program as compared to others. Ninety percent of the major program planks of G. Yavlinskiy's bloc probably coincide with the Russia's Choice program. Nevertheless, each plank in Yavlinskiy's program is preceded by berating the government: We would have done it better! Naturally, they do not say how. There is, however, one principal difference. G. Yavlinskiy proposes to stretch the anti-inflation program through 1997. Broken down by year, it looks like this: 1994--monthly inflation at 15-20 percent, that is, it remains at the current level. In 1995--10-15 percent a month. In 1996 inflation will be reduced to 3-8 percent, and in 1997--2 percent a month. Now let us look what a monthly inflation of 15-20 percent will bring us next year. Prices will rise 10-fold over the year. This year we also had a ninefold increase in prices, and we say quite correctly that it is impossible to go on living this way. If the current rate of inflation remains for the entire 1994, as G. Yavlinskiy's program proposes, it will, of course, create a reserve for the implementation of social programs and support for priority sectors in production. But this will be support provided by paper money not backed up by anything, or by empty figures in noncash transactions. I cannot say that stretching the anti-inflation thrust is the result of evil intentions or thoughtlessness. The leaders of this bloc see the situation differently and, in my opinion, overestimate the potential for social explosion resulting from some sector not getting subsidies or the absence of new social programs. But it has already become clear to the population that when production declines, handing money out to enterprises does not raise the standard of living. G. Yavlinskiy's program envisages budget investment in sectors that act as locomotives, that is, those that will pull along other sectors and bring them up. At the top of the list, however, are budget investments in....the space program and aviation industry, followed by housing construction. Of course, the Russia's Choice program, too, envisages support for some sectors, but why give the space program priority? Such priority seems very questionable to me, because the treasury's ability is very limited. And, as I have already mentioned, budget investment is completely impermissible. We are already fed up with it. Practically all investment in the Soviet economy came from the budget, that is, from the state. We had 500,000 ongoing construction projects, spreading the money thin, burying it into the soil and foundations, and did not properly complete a single needed construction project. And what we did build turned out to either be harmful, such as canals, or a nonpriority, such as the BAM [Baykal-Amur Main Line], because it was the state that decided where to put the money. Budget investment may be justified perhaps in construction of housing for the poor and perhaps in railroads with the participation of private joint-stock capital. But, I repeat, investment, especially private (which should comprise the predominant part of it), is only possible when the ruble is stable, not in the conditions of 15-20 percent a month inflation. There are no fools. G. Yavlinskiy's program also contains purely populist promises; for instance, it promises--and at a rather high level at that--budget support for science and culture. If this is so, it would be good to be more precise regarding at whose expense such support would be achieved. Science will get support, but someone else's share in the budget will be reduced. Whose? Pensioners? Teachers or doctors; builders or miners? There is no other method of budget financing. Over the past three years the share of science and culture in the budget has not diminished, but remained at the same level. But in real rubles, of course, the magnitude of appropriations has dropped by about 30 percent. The share of science and culture in the budget will be filled with increasingly greater amounts of money not expropriated from others only as the economy begins to pick up. It is more difficult to comment on Zhirinovskiy's economic program, since it is scattered all over in verbal statements and publications, although some points of it have been announced. As an economist, however, I cannot seriously analyze it. The program consists of a bunch of populist promises, most of which cannot be fulfilled. Those that are in fact realistic already have been or are being implemented by the government, but Vladimir Volfovich still makes these promises. His biggest promise to the voters is to double the population's real income in a matter of six months. "How do we do that?" Zhirinovskiy was asked. He named two major, in his opinion, sources. First--stop nonrepayable aid to CIS countries. But the government has already done this. Beginning 1 January 1994 Russia will trade with CIS countries only at world prices. Nonpayments or debts of former republics have been converted into credits. True, the interest rate is a bit low, but we cannot get more from them. So, the first source of immediate enrichment for the population named by Zhirinovskiy already has been exhausted. The second source, in his opinion, is to stop conversion and sell arms. He told the public the figure of earnings from arms sales: allegedly $30-32 billion a year. Such earnings have never existed, and cannot be real. Theoretically, the USSR sold this much worth of arms. But last year income from arms sales was slightly less than $2 billion. And prior to that Russia did not get anything for arms deliveries to regimes friendly to the USSR. All in all, the Communists left Russia an "inheritance" of $130 billion. This is how much has been handed out to other countries, and mainly it is debts for arms shipments. None of the debtors has ever paid or intends to pay. It is hardly realistic to demand these billions in payments. India and Egypt pay some, but this is small change. Cuba alone owes us $18 billion, and they are merely laughing: the debt we incurred was not to Russia, they say. Thus, earnings of $30-32 billion a year from arms sales belongs in the realm of nonscientific fiction. Thus, the sources through which Zhirinovskiy promised to double the population's real income in six months simply do not exist. His program also promises support for state enterprises, but it does not say how this would be done. If it is support through preferential credits, inflation will have to be let loose. I do not think I need to repeat what will happen next.... V. Zhirinovskiy promises regulated prices. As it turned out, this is the most desirable device in the understanding of most voters. But if we begin regulating prices, we will inevitably have to freeze wages. Otherwise, wages will jump, and with fixed prices the population will sweep the stores clean. As a result, the stores will be empty and money will be worth absolutely nothing. In this respect, too, Zhirinovskiy proposes a Ukrainization of the Russian economy without using this particular word. The harm done to Russia by Zhirinovskiy's foreign policy statements is already obvious; this is being enunciated quite clearly. Through Zhirinovskiy's efforts, NATO is moving closer to Russia's borders; Ukraine has practically rejected nuclear disarmament; he has threatened Japan with a nuclear bomb, and all of us--with friendship with S. Husayn. Zhirinovskiy is war, poverty, complete disintegration of the economy, and hyperinflation.
