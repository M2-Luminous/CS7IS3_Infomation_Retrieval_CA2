Recalling that Comrade Kim Chong-il in this work indicated a unique line of vigorously conducting economic propaganda and agitation on the basis of a scientific analysis of the realistic demand of socialist economic construction in our country and precious practical experience, the author of the article says: The great vitality of our party's policy of economic propaganda and agitation lies, first of all, in that it has brought home to the party members and working people our party's chuche-based line of economic construction and economic policy and guided them to thoroughly defend and implement them. The work contains the idea of energetically conducting the work of arming the party members and working masses with the party's line of building an independent national economy and its economic policy in each period. The proud reality in which all people have turned out and are achieving new miracles and feats, upholding the revolutionary economic strategy setpforth by our party, is a precious fruition of the arming of the party members and working masses with the party's line of economic construction and economic policy. The great vitality of our party's economic propaganda and agitation lies in that with the brisk progress of economic agitation, the revolutionary zeal and the creative ingenuity of the masses have been brought into full play in socialist economic construction. The dear leader in the work indicated concrete tasks arising in vigorously conducting economic agitation on the basis of the success and experience already attained. What is important here is to concentrate economic agitation on the fulfilment of economic tasks set forth by the party and the leader in each time. The great effect of economic agitation was demonstrated by the completion of such difficult and gigantic project as the West Sea barrage in a short time and construction of many monumental edifices including the May Day Stadium in a brief period. With stress laid on enlisting the idea of people in economic agitation, a change has taken place in the work of remoulding their idea [word indistinct] construction. Noting that the great vitality of our party's policy of economic propaganda and agitation also lies in the successful application of the anti-Japanese guerrilla-style propaganda and agitation, the article says: This is a most revolutionary one which makes it possible to stir the hearts of the masses by conducting agitprop activities with mobility any time, without formality and not restricted by place and condition.
