The teams have been instructed to negotiate as long as it takes to resolve differences. Foreign Minister Peres says even if agreement is reached on the security issues, much work still remains, but he says that he and the PLO chairman have decided to stay on in the Egyptian capital until all the obstacles are overcome. David Ze'ev examines the reports from Cairo: Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres told reporters in Cairo he has a mandate to reach agreements with the Palestinians. The Palestinians say they have been told that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has given his foreign minister the green light for what the PLO ambassador to Cairo said would be a breakthrough toward drafting an agreement on an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. Foreign Minister Peres repeated the Israeli position that much work remains, but he also said that his discussion with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat late last night in Cairo was held in a positive atmosphere and that he was sure both sides will make a far-reaching effort to achieve agreements on whatever issues possible, and Peres said he has the authority to sign agreements. The reference is to the Palestinian anger that he would not sign after agreements were reached in Davos over a week ago and the PLO accusing Prime Minister Rabin of vetoing his foreign minister's achievements. In the meantime, Peres and 'Arafat will remain in Cairo as their negotiating teams try to work out the differences. The teams have been instructed to hold marathon sessions toward reaching that objective. Despite the war of nerves that preceded the resumption of the negotiations, both Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman 'Arafat smiled and were upbeat after their meeting last night. Here in Jerusalem, a senior Israeli official said the key in resolving the differences has been the open line with the Palestinians: the ability to pick up the phone, in the Israeli official's words, an option that exists both with the Palestinians and Jordan but not with Syria, preventing contacts with Damascus during breaks in the Washington negotiations to raise such issues as the Syrian role in the violence in Lebanon that claimed the lives of four Israeli soldiers yesterday. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 8 February carries a report on a telephone interview with Foreign Minister Peres in Cairo on 8 February. The report notes that "referring to the serious incident in the security zone in south Lebanon yesterday, Minister Peres said that one of the issues in the peace negotiations with Syria should be that of Damascus' curbing Hizballah." [A report by Gay Bekhor and Aluf Ben on page A1 of Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 8 February adds: "In a session held at the prime minister's bureau prior to the departure of the Israeli delegation for Cairo, Rabin decided to accept Peres' position not to alter clauses in the understandings reached with the PLO in Davos. The prime minister rejected the demand by security elements to introduce certain amendments into the Davos document in order to underscore Israel's responsibility for security on the roads in Gaza and along the 'safe passages' of the Palestinians in the Jericho area."]
