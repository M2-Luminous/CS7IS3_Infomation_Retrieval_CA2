Membership would include Finland in the EU's economic and social policy decisions and would also have an effect on security policy issues. "From a standpoint of military security, this change would not appear to significantly affect Russia's position as Finland's neighbor, nor does it effect Finland's position as Russia's neighbor," said Klenberg, in a speech, last Monday [14 February] in Tampere. According to Klenberg, a possible peace partnership with NATO, NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], or serving as an observer within the WEU [Western European Union], should not change Finland's security situation. On the other hand, if Finland chose to join NATO or the WEU, that would drastically change Finland's military security status. Klenberg feels that it is uncertain whether the CFE [Conventional Armed Forces in Europe] agreement, concerning limiting conventional weapons in Europe, will become effective in the areas surrounding Finland. In Klenberg's view, the CFE agreement has reached "an interesting stage." "At this stage, it appears that the implementation of regulations regarding peripheral areas is in the danger zone," concluded Klenberg.
