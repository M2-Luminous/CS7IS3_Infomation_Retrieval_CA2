I also congratulate the people who have such a leader." This was stated today in Vladikavkaz by Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian president's administration, at a meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the republic devoted to assuming office by the first president of the republic. North Ossetia, Sergey Filatov stressed, has never suffered from anarchy. But it is necessary to change structures of power, this is the call of the time. The republic has been confidently carrying out democratic reforms against the background of social and political life in Russia. Some republics, the head of Russian president's administration said, "believe that president is needed to protect the republic from the central power. This is an erroneous position. [The] president is necessary to become a connecting link between the center and the republic so that all our Russia lived as a single family". I am sure, Sergey Filatov said, that the multinational people of North Ossetia "associate their revival with strong democratic power in the republic. This will help successfully resolve all complex problems in economics, political life and in the social sphere. What is more, this is possible with close interaction between all branches of power and the observance of the Constitution and Russian laws". According to Sergey Filatov, Boris Yeltsin asked to convey that he would render all-round support both to the president and the people of North Ossetia.
