Gu Jinchi said: Premier Li Peng drew applause from deputies when he touched on successfully launching the anticorruption drive in his government work report. It fully shows that the anticorruption drive is an issue of common concern to the masses of the people, and that the central authorities' decision to improve the building of a clean and honest government has won their resolute support. The current anticorruption drive has produced certain results, and the situation is good. However, we should be soberly aware that corruption among a small number of government functionaries is still relatively serious, that relevant policies and regulations drawn up by the central authorities have yet to be carried out to the letter, that the anticorruption task is still very arduous, and that we still need to be mentally prepared for making unremitting efforts for a protracted period of time to come. Gu Jinchi believed that deepening reform, amplifying laws and regulations, and establishing an effective supervision and restriction system to prevent and eliminate corruption through the system are the fundamental measures for fighting corruption and advocating a clean and honest government. In this connection, he made three suggestions: 1. A clear distinction between the functions and powers of party committees and governments at all levels should be made in earnest during reform of organizations so as to define responsibilities and establish an appropriate supervision mechanism. Administration should be exercised in accordance with the laws and discipline; necessary restrictions will be imposed on the exercise of powers to eliminate the cause and spread of such corruption as shifting responsibility onto others, arguing back and forth, abusing power to seek personal gain, and taking bribes among relevant units and individuals when fulfilling their functions and exercising their powers. 2. A system that standardizes the management and use of personnel, funds, and materials, and makes public such management and use must be established to persist in a system of relying on supervision by the masses, to place those who exercise powers under public supervision, to enable people to inform those who violate regulations and abuse power to seek personal gains to the authorities, and to eradicate the environment of concealment upon which corruption subsists. 3. Restrictions should be imposed on those who indulge in the collection and spending of fees which are apt to make them reluctant to practice plain living and wage hard struggles or dishonest in the performance of official duties by adopting measures indirectly linked to the income of relevant personnel; a system for reporting the income of leading cadres for the record will be gradually implemented. Meanwhile, appropriate measures will be taken to stop concealed income and to plug the loophole that gives rise to corruption. Deputy Gu Jinchi expressed the belief that so long as we take the correct road, we can achieve marked successes in the anticorruption drive and will surely be able to fulfill the objective determined by the central authorities.
