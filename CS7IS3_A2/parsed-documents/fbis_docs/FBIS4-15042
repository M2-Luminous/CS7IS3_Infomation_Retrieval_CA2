Kozyrev and Kostikov Have Meant Different Things"] [Text] By the end of last week Russia's top officials gave the press cause to talk about confusion within the state structures on a foreign policy issue currently being given much prominence: Russia's joining the Partnership for Peace program. Or rather, about the time frames mentioned last Friday [1 Apr]. As is known, during U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's visit to Moscow in mid-March his Russian colleague Pavel Grachev stated that the Russian Federation will sign the Partnership at the end of March. On Thursday, 31 March, Russian Federation presidential press spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov announced that the process of acceding to the Partnership could take between six to seven months, thereby shifting, as it seemed, the date for joining the program at least until September-October. Citing Boris Yeltsin's opinion, Kostikov attributed this to the fact that the "Partnership for Peace formula does not quite correspond to the scope of Russia's political and military power." Next day, Friday, Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told journalists that Russia will accede to the Partnership as early as April. It turned out, however, that the presidential press secretary and the head of the Foreign Affairs Ministry were speaking about different things. Subsequently Kozyrev's supposition that Kostikov was misunderstood was also confirmed. Commenting Saturday, at the request of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent, on the current situation, Russian Security Council Deputy Secretary Valeriy Manilov said that "everyone who has commented on the Partnership for Peace has meant different things: First, the intention to join the framework agreement," which is only a statement of intent and does not impose any obligations on the signatory. This was also what Andrey Kozyrev meant. Second, there is also "another aspect: a representative [prezentativnoye], individual agreement with NATO defining specific terms on which the state intends to cooperate with this bloc within the Partnership for Peace framework." Owing to its strategic importance, the resolution of this question, as it appears, is not the domain of separate departments. In the very near future, the Partnership -- its substantive, not declarative, part -- will be considered by the Russian Security Council, which will task the corresponding structures to develop and substantiate Russia's position on Partnership for Peace which would not be detrimental to its national interests. After this the Russian Federation president will make a decision in the shape of an edict or his approval of the Security Council protocol. Then, according to Valeriy Manilov, "I suppose that this decision will be presented to parliament for ratification." Yesterday Pavel Grachev stated that his department's and the Foreign Ministry's views on Partnership for Peace coincide. In addition, he said that he does not see any disagreements on this issue between the government and presidential structures, referring to his talks with Yeltsin.
