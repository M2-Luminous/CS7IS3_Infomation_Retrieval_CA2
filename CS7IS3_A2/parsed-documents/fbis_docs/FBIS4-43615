Many banks have gone bankrupt. Thousands of workers are being laid off. The trade union leaders are saying that the workers might work for free to save the economy. The need is felt for employers to make sacrifices. The government is getting more reaction than support at home and abroad. In view of this, based on which forces are Ciller and Karayalcin able to remain in power? [Bayik] Everyone agrees that Turkey is in an insurmountable crisis, which is not solely economic. One could also speak of crisis in the economic, political, social, cultural, military, diplomatic, and all other areas that feed each other. In addition to surmounting the crisis, the adopted measures have further deepened it. Most importantly, though the pro-regime parties are continuously stressing that things are going bad, they are not proposing any solution. The events starkly show that the regime has reached the brink of bankruptcy and it has no way to avert it. Each day brings the growing realization that the increased cost of war in Kurdistan will further aggravate this bankruptcy and will bring an end to the regime. The war is the main source of all the problems. The Turkish Republic, which insists on waging the war, will not be able to extricate itself from the situation it has fallen into. It will certainly erode even further with the loss of foreign trust. The reasons for the survival of Ciller-Karayalcin government should be sought in this helplessness we try to portray. It is a matter of the regime's bankruptcy. A government change would have been easier had the problem not been at the dimension portrayed. The lack of an alternative makes a change of government costly for the regime. This plays a role in the survival of the government. Another factor is that this government enjoys the army's support. The Ciller government meets every demand of the generals, and fulfills each demand promptly. It has plainly handed the initiative to the army. The army feels the need to be in power at a time when war is determining every aspect of life in Kurdistan and Turkey. The army is supporting the present government which uncritically complies with its demands. An army unsuccessful at war has no tolerance for government changes or criticisms. It needs a government that does everything it says. The Ciller-Karayalcin government is doing just that. The army will not accept the change of a government with which it is in full harmony. If, despite this, a government change is insisted upon, then the generals might intervene. [KURD-A] The Turkish Republic finds itself in a logjam in foreign policy. It is unable to exert influence on Southern Kurdistan [Iraqi Kurdistan]. It cannot exploit the KDP [Democratic Party of Kurdistan] and other forces as it has in the past. Its military operations are without result. Its attempts to reopen the oil pipeline is facing obstacles. It is being forced to make concessions on the Cyprus problem to international organizations, primarily by the UN. In view these developments, what sort of a connection exists between Turkey's increased attacks on Greece and the Cyprus problem? What could you say other than those already known to the public? [Bayik] Efforts to solve the Cyprus problem have intensified. Pressure on the Turkish Republic to end the Turkish occupation has intensified. Now, practical results are needed. But, the Turkish Republic insists on being an occupationist and is avoiding taking steps. To counterbalance the pressure on it, Turkey is trying to drag Greece into artificial tensions because the latter is taking the Cyprus problem to the international arena and is intensifying its efforts for a solution. The aim behind creating tension and fomenting problems between Greece and her neighbors Albania and Macedonia, is to rein Greece in on the Cyprus problem. With its provocations, Turkey could aggravate the problems between Greece and her neighbors Albania and Macedonia. It could also organize provocations using the "Western Thrace Turks." If these prove insufficient, Turkey may aggravate the tension by some de facto moves of its own. Turkey's ultimate aim is to bring about the capitulation of Greece by encircling it externally and internally. It is likely that Turkey will step-up its pressure on Greece. One of the aims is to neutralize Greece on the Cyprus problem, and the other is to prevent an alliance between the Greek people and the Kurdish people, which has launched a war of liberation under the guidance of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Presently, Greece has won a strong ally against the constant threat posed by Turkey in the war-waging Kurdish people. The Turkish threat has been weakened as a result of our struggle. The alliance of the Kurdish and Greek people is the main factor capable of preventing the aforementioned threat. With the attacks described above, Turkey wants to prevent the development of this alliance. If Turkey succeeds, it will not only deprive Greece of a strong ally, but will also neutralize one of the Kurds' principal allies, which could take the Kurdish people's cause to international platforms and strengthen it with multisided support. Turkey's efforts in this direction produced some results in the past because of a lack of solidarity and mutual support among people facing the Turkish threat. If the same failings are not repeated and a strong alliance is forged, this threat will vanish never to rise again. The success of the Kurdish people fighting under the guidance of our party will bring success to the Greek people. The support given by the Greek people will bring our people's success closer. [KURD-A] The Turkish Republic is unable to achieve any serious results with its military operations. It also could not stand up to ARGK guerrillas during its "cross-border operations." Despite that, statements are being issued at home to the effect that "PKK is on the verge of extinction." The Turkish Army and state are calling for the surrender of ARGK guerrillas and asking people to help bring about this surrender. Why does the Turkish Republic feel the need for this? [Bayik] The Turkish state's endurance is waning in the face of problems generated by the war. The filthy war waged by the army is constantly eating up Turkey's resources. Even a day's war expenses is enough to aggravate the crisis into which the regime has fallen. The Turkish Republic has channeled all its strength and potential to the service of war. Yet, it is unable to obtain any result. Failure would mean disappointment for it. It declared 1994 a successful year. The state and the army tried to convince themselves of this. Despite the passage of time, no success has come their way. On the contrary, they were further weakened. The army's morale has plummeted drastically. There was a drop in the intensity of the operations. The blows dealt by our guerrillas have plunged the army into disintegration. Not only is the army disintegrating, but also other state institutions. The guerrilla force, which has taken the initiative, will henceforth escalate and amplify its attacks. We will henceforth witness rapid disintegrations. Faced with this situation, the state and the army are drawing up deceptive pictures of success claiming to have attained goals which they have not. The psychological aspect of the war is given prominence to avert a disintegration, to prevent further aggravation of the crisis in which the regime finds itself, to weaken our people's participation in the struggle, and to prevent international recognition and support for the PKK. At first they adopted the strategy of dealing a blow to the guerrilla force and bringing about its dissolution. They wanted to inflict heavy blows on the guerrilla force and then force it to disintegrate. They thought then they could do away with the whole problem. These strategies did not succeed. Their attacks were repulsed by the guerrillas and their offensive potential was broken by counterattacks. For that reason they are now partially changing their strategy. They have now chosen to bring about disintegration and destruction of the guerrilla force by undermining the morale of the guerrillas and the people through propaganda. Let us state that their efforts will be in vain. Such tested and failed strategies have no chance of success. The Turkish Republic is in a situation of completely losing the war. No war strategy will save or bring success to it. The morale of the ARGK guerrillas is being strengthened with new successes won daily. No call could undermine its morale; rather, our people and young men will redouble their contribution by taking heart in our successes. ARGK's strength and initiative is making more decisive clashes possible. I am asserting that the course of the war will rapidly run counter to the Turkish Republic. [KURD-A] You had once expressed your position on thestance of the West and of the United States towards the Kurdish problem and their move to occupy South [Iraqi] Kurdistan. Has any change occurred in your policies since then? What is the latest situation in the South? Why is Turkey mediating? [Bayik] Both the United States and the West are losing hope that Turkey could be successful in the war. They are also admitting that policies denying the existence of the Kurdish problem are impractical. Hence they find it meaningless to press ahead with the war based on these policies. Therefore they are trying to persuade Turkey to make changes in its policy. Where their advice is not heeded, they are launching certain initiatives. But all these are being done to ensure Turkey's existence. The United States and UK are looking at the issue within the framework of the Kurdish problem, whereas the Turkish Republic is not even admitting the existence of the problem by claiming that "there is no Kurdish problem, but a problem of terrorism." This is where contradictions exist between them. Again, whereas the United States and the Western powers are pressuring Turkey to introduce certain reforms, the Turkish Republic insists on a policy of denial and annihilation. This is the second point of contradiction. It appears that the United States and the Western powers will intensify their efforts to make Turkey accept their position. Where persuasion fails, they will use warning measures, and if those also fail, limited measures might be considered. All this does not mean that these powers have forfeited Turkey. It also does not mean recognition of our people's will. But, nevertheless they imply a change. The further development of our war might speed up this change and bring us to the point of a federal solution, and the recognition of our people's will. But this will not come easily; there is a need to strengthen the struggle and exert intensive effort, and a need for time. There is no serious change in the position of the aforementioned powers towards South Kurdistan. The U.S.-UK duo are inclined to freeze the problem at the stage it is now in and to safeguard the existing situation. They did not take sides in the clashes; rather, they did not show much interest in them. Their involvement is through the Iraqi National Congress. They do not want to be a direct counterpart. We could state that compared to the past, their interest in South Kurdistan has waned. Barring serious developments, this waning interest could go as far as embracing Saddam. Germany and France are after a solution that would not eliminate Saddam. They appear to have reached an agreement on this issue with the Turkish Republic and Iran. They are exerting efforts to revive the KDP-based autonomy and Iraq's sovereignty over Kurdistan. Therefore, they are trying to subdue the YNK [Patriotic Union of Kurdistan], which they regard as an impediment to their plan. This is what rests behind the latest clashes. Through talks they want to bring about the surrender of the YNK, which they pushed into the clashes. If they succeed in this, they will have not only neared a solution they envisage for the South but also managed to sideline a force which is an ally of the PKK. In this way they want to deprive us of the opportunity to make use of the South. Any upsurge in clashes between the YNK and the KDP is fraught with risks. Despite all foreign assistance, the KDP's strength is limited. It is questionable if it could gain the upper hand in the fighting or take the area under its control. If the clashes continue and escalate the possibility of the independence line advocated by the PKK making fast advances and gains could arise. That is why the Turkish Republic is entering the developments and is assuming the role of a mediator in the clashes. It considers establishing control over the region by limiting the clashes to be to its advantage. This is the essence of its mediation efforts. If the talks do not do the trick it is always possible to rekindle the low-intensity clashes. Yet another reason for its mediation at the talks is to charm the domestic and international public and thus to hide its role in the clashes. This is truly a demonstration of duplicity. [KURD-A] In contrast to other European countries, Germany is continuing attacks on your party. It has gone beyond all bounds. What are the reasons pushing Germany into such a situation? [Bayik] The German state is a full participant in the Turkish Republic's dirty war against our people. Only, unlike the case of General Moltke [Helmuth Karl Bernhard who served in Ottoman Army], it has not allowed its generals to take part in Turkey's operation to quell the uprising. Perhaps it has, but we are not aware of it. However, I can state that we expect it to take such a step. Not only is Germany taking sides, it is a partner in the war. The German state's stance towards our party and people is unacceptable. We are duty bound to defend ourselves not only against the Turkish Republic but also against its German accomplice. We will make use of this right by using all means at our disposal. We cannot cave in to a bully, if we do we will be subjected to more bullying. While using our legal self-defense right, we would like to see our German friends, the German people, and the progressive public on our side. The only way not to become partners with the German state's dirty objectives is to oppose its war partnership with the Turkish Republic. To oppose it is tantamount to defending democracy, human rights, and humanity. It must be understood that the German state will not be the winner. Our people's will, reflected by our party, will win with the support of progressive mankind, primarily our German friends. We believe that both the German people and the progressive mankind will mete out the punishment deserved by the German officials who in unison with the Turkish Republic officials chant: "We will eradicate the PKK;" "The PKK does not represent the Kurdish people." [KURD-A] Documents and evidence suggest that many circles feel Behcet Canturk [a Kurdish businessman], who was murdered last month, and Savas Buldan and his two abducted friends [also Kurdish businessmen] were murdered by the state. Mahir Kaynak [a former Turkish National Intelligence Organization official] claimed that the businessmen were killed by those who submitted a list of Kurdish businessmen to Ciller. As always, the state-run televisions and radios are trying to establish a link between the murder victims and the PKK. As you know just before dying Muhsin Melik [a Kurdish party official] said: "The police shot me." We want to know your views on this matter. [Bayik] For some time now the Turkish Republic's attacks on the guerrillas have assumed the dimension of national annihilation. All sections of the society favoring national liberation have become targets. It has become a daily business to destroy all the national elements. Those siding with the national liberation and contributing to the struggle are being murdered. Savas Buldan and his friends were murdered as part of this policy by the colonialists. The same thing applies to Muhsin Melek. We cannot consider these murders and previous ones as mystery murders. Those who perpetrated them are not unknown. These murders are being committed by the Turkish Republic without much bother to hide them; only that it does not openly assume responsibility for them to deflect criticism. All the national strata started entering the ranks of the struggle over the last few years. This is also true for the wealthy and intellectual sections of the society. While all the dynamic forces of the nation went into action and started contributing to the war of liberation within their means, the Turkish Republic launched a variety of attacks in response. Those prominent among the national groups (intellectuals, businessmen, and so on) who have taken a clear stance on the side of the struggle are being murdered one after another. The aim is to cut off the contribution of various social strata to the struggle. An all-out genocide is being perpetrated against our people these days. These massacres do not pale in comparison to the past ones. There is no difference in the number of people killed now and those killed during massacres in the past. Only the method of implementing the genocide is different. In the past, our people who were regarded as enemies were massacred in a certain place and time and then buried alone or in mass graves, or sometimes they were not even buried. Today's massacres are not confined to a specific place and time. Now the ongoing massacres are spread over all areas and time. That is, in the past tens of thousands of our people used to be massacred in one specific location within a brief time. This change in method is due the fact that our struggle had spread over a large area and a longer time span, and the public has become more sensitive. The colonialists are afraid of domestic and foreign reaction to mass massacres. For that reason, they want to attain the same results by massacring people one-by-one or in groups. They are trying to hide this as much as possible. All these show that the Turkish colonialists are developing new methods of genocide. They carry out the massacres with more mastery. The mystery murders are a part of this mastery. In the case of Behcet Canturk, Savas Buldan and his friends, Muhsin, and tens of murders committed daily, the murderer is the Turkish Republic. Whether or not the massacres are being committed by the state's open or secret forces is not important. What is important is that one should not be caught unaware at a time when the enemy has intensified its genocidal activity. Measures against it would be even closer ties with and more effective participation in the struggle. Our reply will be to escalate the war. [KURD-A] Political circles are indicating that the Turkish Republic will step up violence until the autumn and then introduce Kurdish television, education, and similar things. Is this possible? By launching such a propaganda what does it hope to gain vis-a-vis the PKK? [Bayik] It has become impossible to deny the Kurdish existence or to try to find solutions based on this policy of denial. It is possible that at this stage the Turkish Republic might take such steps, though it is a different matter if they could be taken sooner or later. Having said that we should also state the following: It might take such steps to distance people from the struggle. In both cases the taking of such steps would be rationalized on the farce that the struggle being waged under our party's guidance has been destroyed. The current recourse to such propaganda aims at weakening our party's domestic and foreign support, and at alleviating the growing pressure on Turkey. But, what should be well understood is that such tactics have gone stale. The Turkish Republic cannot get anywhere with such tactics. Our people, which has given thousands of martyrs and made all these sacrifices, cannot be satisfied with these offers. It is resolved to attain its freedom under the guidance of our party. It will firmly continue in its path of freedom, even if that demands very heavy costs.
