FR940727-2-00004 FR940727-2-00003 National Institute of Standards and Technology [Docket No. 940795&hyph;4195] RIN 0693&hyph;AB34 Proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for Cryptographic Service Calls AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce. ACTION: Notice; Request for comments. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to announce the proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for Cryptographic Service Calls for Federal agency use. This proposed FIPS specifies a standard interface for application programs to request cryptographic functions from a cryptographic module. The cryptographic functions include message encryption and decryption, message authentication, digital signature generation and verification, key management, and user authentication. The proposed standard supports both secret key and public key algorithms Prior to the submission of this proposed FIPS to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval, it is essential to assure that consideration is given to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and State and local governments. The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views. This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications from the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building, room B&hyph;64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975&hyph;2816. The specifications are also available in electronic form as cryptcal.txt (ASCII version) cryptcal.ps (PostScript version) cryptcal.ps.Z (Compressed Postscript version) For access by modem, dial (301) 948&hyph;5717 and set modem communications parameters at no parity, 8 data bits and one stop. Modem speeds of up to 2400 baud are supported. Files are in /NISTPUBS directory. For access by Internet, ftp to csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (129.6.54.11). Files are in the /pub/nist/pubs directory. DATES: Comments on this proposed FIPS must be received on or before October 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments concerning this FIPS should be sent to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN: Proposed FIPS for Cryptographic Service Calls, Technology Building, room B154, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. Written comments received in response to this notice will be made part of the public record and will be made available for inspection and copying in the Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW, Washington, DC 20230. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Shu-Jen H. Chang, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975&hyph;2940. Dated: July 21, 1994. Raymond G. Kammer, Deputy Director.
