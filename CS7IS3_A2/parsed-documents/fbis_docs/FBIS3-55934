What has this period been like for you? Have the former Security Ministry apparatus and its directorates been working or have they all been waiting for the decision on their fate? Have things become easier for terrorists, the corrupt, spies, and other of your "clients"? After all, for almost three weeks there have been just two officials at the Federal Counterintelligence Service -- the director of the new service and yourself. [Stepashin] As is well-known, during this period B.N. Yeltsin signed three edicts relating to our service -- two open edicts and one classified edict. I had a personal meeting with the president lasting more than an hour on 5 January. That meeting resulted in the signing of the edict setting up the FCS. To be frank, there was a certain element of panic among my colleagues -- after all, they are all waiting for recertification of their jobs. But we reassured people that there would be no purge and that those who fail to come through the recertification could resign or be dismissed but would not be left jobless -- some would go to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], others to the Prosecutor's Office, others to the Tax Police, and so forth. Foreign special services have not relaxed their efforts during this period, our former brothers from the Baltic and Georgia are making their presence felt, corruption is still prevalent, and terrorists have been active. So we have no time to sigh and feel sorry for ourselves -- we have to do our job. Twenty people have been arrested for espionage alone, and several dozen such cases are in the pipeline. The entire country was shaken by the abduction of the Rostov schoolchildren. The highly complex operation to free them was carried out brilliantly and, most important, without a single drop of blood being shed -- our operatives definitely deserve praise for that. [Sopelnyak] At a 10 January press conference you said that the edict of 21 December last year was an expected surprise. What do you mean by that? Or did you have wind that an edict to abolish the Security Ministry was in the offing? [Stepashin] Of course, I knew nothing about it. But I realized that our department needed radical restructuring and that we were often doing things that were alien to the security service. So the edict was timely. [Sopelnyak] You were given two weeks to draw up the statute on the FCS. Is this document ready, and, if so, could you comment on its main points? [Stepashin] As far as the statute on the FCS is concerned, it is ready and has been ratified by the Russian president. The Russian Federation FCS is a central federal executive organ. Its mission includes the exposure, prevention, and curtailment of subversive intelligence activity by foreign special services and organizations, and of illegal attacks on Russia's constitutional system, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and defense capability. In its activity the FCS should be guided by the Constitution, laws, and other legal acts issued by organs of state power, as well as by international treaties. [Sopelnyak] To whom will the FCS be subordinate -- the Federal Assembly, the government, or the president? [Stepashin] The president. And to him directly, rather than any intermediate authorities. [Sopelnyak] Does that mean that your assignments will be set by the president? [Stepashin] Our assignments, as I have already said, are defined by the Constitution, laws, and the statute on the FCS. Our main mission is to obtain intelligence information on threats to Russia's security; to combat terrorism, illegal armed formations, and illegally created or prohibited associations attacking Russia's constitutional system; to expose, prevent, and curtail subversive intelligence activity by foreign special services against our country; to safeguard the security of state secrets and, of course, to provide the president with information on threats to the Russian Federation's security. [Sopelnyak] That is a lot of assignments, and you will need people to carry them out. At the same time, the president's edict states that the size of the FCS' administrative apparatus should not exceed 1,500 people, and the total number of service and civilian personnel has been set at 75,000. We know another figure, too -- the number of FCS staffers will be 46 percent fewer than the former Security Ministry staff. Who will you be working with? Is it realistic to carry out the aforesaid mission with the number of staffers that the FCS will have available? [Stepashin] Yes, it is. The personnel cut will be substantial, but we have worked out an entire system for carrying out this operation without affecting our performance. Some directorates will be disbanded, others will be merged -- we will be trying to avoid any duplication or overlapping in the work of certain subunits. Ultimately we will be left with the most necessary directorates. The most important of these are the Directorate for Counterintelligence Operations, the Directorate for Counterintelligence Provision for Strategic Installations, the Directorate for Military Counterintelligence, the Directorate for Economic Counterintelligence, the Directorate for Combating Terrorism, and a number of others. There will be virtually no staff cuts to these subunits either centrally or at the local level. But, for instance, there will have to be cuts to the Secretariat, the Material and Technical Services Directorate, or the Military Organizational Development Directorate. Moreover, certain subunits -- including the famous "Lefortovo" -- will be transferred to the MVD. [Sopelnyak] Does this mean, to use the words of the presidential edict abolishing the Security Ministry, that counterintelligence work will not be relaxed? [Stepashin] Under no circumstances! Moreover, our effort will be focused in precisely this area. [Sopelnyak] What can you say about the "system of political investigation, which has been mothballed but could easily be reactivated"? [Stepashin] There can be no question of any political investigation -- except, of course, for those cases when we are talking about illegally formed or prohibited associations of an extremist nature setting up armed formations and attacking the Russian constitutional system. [Sopelnyak] The director is now leader of the FCS. Could you tell us about his rights and duties? [Stepashin] First and foremost, the director heads the FCS and leads its 11-man collegium. Moreover, the director has one first deputy and five deputies. The president appoints the director and relieves him of his duties personally. The president also monitors the activity of the entire Russian FCS. As for the director, his rights and duties are not much different from those of the head of any other ministry. [Sopelnyak] And, last, perhaps the most important question -- has Russia benefited from these transformations and will we ordinary Russian citizens benefit from them? [Stepashin] First and foremost, I would like everyone to realize that the need to set up the FCS was dictated not by some kind of whim but by life itself. I am sure that the FCS, in taking what was best from its predecessors and avoiding what was "negative," will become a reliable shield for both Russia and all Russian citizens.
