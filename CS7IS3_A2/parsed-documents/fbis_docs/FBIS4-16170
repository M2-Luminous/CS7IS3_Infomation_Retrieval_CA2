Who made the decision on the air strike, by whom and how was it sanctioned? If this had been demanded by British General Rose, commander of the UN forces, why was it approved over the phone (!) by UN secretary general envoy Yasushi Akashi, a Japanese, who was in... Paris? Was the sanction not received from Butrus-Ghali himself? Why such a hurry at all in making so responsible a decision with such dangerous possible consequences? Just a few days ago, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry; General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff; and indeed, Secretary of State Warren Christopher admitted: Air strikes serve no purpose because they may disrupt talks on a general peaceful settlement in Bosnia. Could that have been precisely someone's purpose? True, by this "retribution strike" President Clinton seems to have refuted the accusations of being indecisive and inefficient, which he has been increasingly subjected to from his critics in the United States. Clinton thereby has avenged, as it were, the failure of the American operation in Somalia. Now he states: "We have risen to the occasion." A rather doubtful statement. Amazingly, Moscow had not been even informed in advance about the planned bombing. What can account for such an attitude of Clinton to President Yeltsin, who once already opened to the Americans the way out of the impasse by his well-known peace initiative on Sarajevo, precluding their involvement in the Balkan war? Or is it that all means of demonstrating American leadership are good, and why think of the consequences? And these consequences are rather serious. The American bombing hit at Yeltsin's trump card -- cooperation with the West, the United States. How would the U.S. President's failure to honor the Russian-American understanding on mutual consultations in similar situations be interpreted? It is obvious that President Clinton is rather unceremoniously edging Russia out of solving the Balkan problems that are so painful for us. To a Russian, all this recalls Nozdrev [Gogol's character in "Dead Souls"] who, pointing at his own and his neighbor's field, said: "This is mine" and added: "Everything behind the woods (read: across the ocean) is also all mine." Washington's moves undoubtedly compromise Russia's cooperation with the West and add grist for the national-radicals opposed to Yeltsin. One can imagine the zeal with which Mr. Zhirinovskiy will now descend upon American and, for that matter, Russian foreign policy: American rockets for him are a godsend! And what will Russian representatives feel when they sign the "Partnership for Peace" with NATO to the echo of the bombings? Or maybe the events are interlinked so as to derail the signing, to push Russia aside? The disregard for the agreed on consultations with Security Council permanent members in advance of UN military operations arouses a sense of protest. As indeed does the statement on the NATO bombings coming "automatically" on instructions from UN commanders in Bosnia, hence once again bypassing the Security Council. Can one actually identify the United Nations with the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance? The bombings may be expected to weaken sharply the positions of such relatively moderate Serb politicians as Milosevic and Karadzic. Until recently, they managed somehow to contain the "implacable" in their ranks, for instance General Mladic, the Bosnian Serbs commander. Now they will have to radicalize their stance. Apropos Mladic. A year or so ago, meeting him in Pale, I tried to persuade him to stop shelling the beleaguered towns. "Is there any military reason for such shellings?" "No," he replied without batting an eye. "Why then you do it? Can't you see you are sapping your own prestige in the world?" "We'll think." High time for the Serb radicals also to reach the conclusion that continued bloodshed in Bosnia is against the genuine interests of the Serbs themselves. Now it is extremely sad that civilians once again suffer from the bombings. Such is the result of American military operations be it in Bosnia, Panama, or Somalia: They are ostensibly undertaken to protect people but as a result it is innocent civilians who die, and often on a greater scale than before the interference. One may hope that in the critical situation that has taken shape, the Russian state will demonstrate its dignity and intention to protect its interests, and Russian diplomacy will demonstrate its skill in gluing together the broken pots. To all appearances, gluing them together now would be much harder.
