This lent the discussions of items on the agenda a corresponding tone. "The state budget is the most important document we will be adopting," Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the upper chamber of parliament, stressed. He had a brief but pithy conversation with the pickets following which he proposed that the deputies hear a report on this matter from the Federation Council budget committee. In his words, their State Duma counterparts had adopted the draft budget on its first and second reading with unbelievable ease, without considering the 252 amendments formulated by the Federation Council deputies. "The Duma people are about to approve it on the third reading now, so we, too, have got to step on it," Shumeyko remarked. The centerpiece yesterday was of course the president's edict on the possibility of employing the Russian Federation Armed Forces in a peacekeeping operation in the Georgia-Abkhazia conflict zone. A report on this problem was provided by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev behind closed doors, unfortunately. However, the sending of Russian troops into the Georgia-Abkhazia conflict zone has been approved in principle. "In a matter of literally two or three days, when they report to me that the Abkhazia territory has been cleared of mines, we shall press ahead directly with the peacekeeping mission," Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev stated after this question had been discussed in the upper chamber of parliament. According to him, an efficient group has been created of five battalions up to 3,000 men strong and it is on full combat alert. A question was raised on financing this action other than from Defense Ministry appropriations. The Defense Ministry, in particular, asked for 10 to 11 billion rubles until the year's end but the positive decision was yesterday short of a few votes.
