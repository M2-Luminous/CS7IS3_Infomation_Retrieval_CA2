The Council held a morning session and an evening session yesterday, and addressed several topics on the agenda, led by the situation in the occupied Syrian Golan. The Council also discussed a draft resolution on the occupied Syrian Golan stressing the Council's rejection of all measures that the Israeli occupation authorities have taken and are taking with the aim of changing the legal, natural, and demographic situation of the occupied Syrian Golan. The draft resolution reaffirms that the Israeli measures extending sovereignty to the Golan are illegal, null, and void, and that they violate both the international agreements and the UN Charter and resolutions, which emphasize that Israel's decision on 14 December 1981 to annex the occupied Syrian Golan is illegal, null, and void. The Knesset's decision, made on 11 November 1991, in this regard, is also null and void and has no legal force. In the draft resolution, the Council demands that the Security Council assume its responsibilities toward Israel's compliance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. These resolutions provide for both full withdrawal from the Syrian Golan and for supporting the Syrian Government in its efforts to implement these resolutions. The draft resolution also calls on the international community, particularly the United States, to force Israel to comply with the UN and other international resolutions pertaining to full withdrawal from both the Golan and other occupied Arab territories. It stresses support for the steadfastness of the Syrian Arab citizens in the Golan in their confrontation of both the Israeli occupation and its repressive practices, and also for their insistence on adhering to both their territory and their Syrian Arab identity. The draft resolution stresses the need to implement the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 for the Syrian citizens in the occupied Golan. It renews the Arab states' emphasis of their firm support for Syria's just demands and right to regain the entire occupied Syrian Golan based on the peace process and the resolutions of international legitimacy, particularly Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.
