Source is cited in parentheses following each item. COSTA RICA Costa Rica today applauded the GATT ruling through Economy Minister Roberto Rojas who described the GATT ruling as a "great triumph for the region" He also voiced hopes that the ruling "will convince the EC to modify the import regime imposed since 1 July" on Latin American bananas. Rojas added that Costa Rica has been in the vanguard in the struggle against restrictions to the banana market and will continue "to struggle." He, however, admitted that this struggle will be "as difficult as the one waged so far." The minister pointed out that he will work with his trading partners within GATT to achieve this goal. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2046 GMT 18 Jan 94) The representatives of the National Chamber of Agriculture and Agro-Industry have termed the GATT ruling as important and historic. Executive Director Jose Carlos Barquero said this confirms it is possible to resort to this mechanism to settle international trade problems without undue influence from the political weight of the countries involved. He added that "because of this ruling, minority groups will have an appropriate base to face conflicts that affect them and involve powerful nations." (San Jose Radio Reloj in Spanish 1730 GMT 20 Jan 94) ECUADOR Diego Paredes, Jose Vicente Maldonado, and Mariano Gonzalez, the Ecuadoran ministers of foreign affairs; industry, commerce, integration and fisheries; and agriculture, respectively, during a news conference urged Latin American banana-exporting nations to "rebuild their damaged regional union in order to conduct negotiations as a bloc against the banana export quota system that has been in effect since July in the European Union (EU)." Latin America has been divided over a EU proposal to increase Latin American imports from 2.0 million to 2.1 million tons in 1994 in exchange for the region's withdrawal of its complaint to GATT on the EU quota system. Colombia and Costa Rica, with the support of Nicaragua and Venezuela negotiated the withdrawal of the complaint in exchange for a more favorable distribution of the European quotas, but the opposition of Ecuador, Guatemala, Panama, and Honduras prevailed in the end because on 18 January the GATT rejected the EU restrictions on banana imports to favor banana producers in Europe and its former colonies. Jose Riofrio, head of the Ecuadoran National Banana Program, characterized the EU proposal as a "scandalous bribe" and described the Costa Rican and Colombian Governments as "disloyal." Agriculture Minister Gonzalez announced that the Union of Banana Exporting Countries, UPEB, will hold a meeting on 24 January in Guatemala to "examine the GATT panel's conclusions," which he described as "positive for Latin America." (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0722 GMT 19 Jan 94) Ecuadoran banana producers today accused the government of tolerating injustices because the country is not a member of GATT and other countries are representing its interests in the negotiations that are under way to counteract European protectionism. Ecuadoran Banana producers have proposed a change of foreign policy aimed at fostering rapprochement with the EU and to end the problem of foreign representation. Nicolas Castro, a leader for the producers, criticized the EU for its continued assignment of quotas despite the GATT rejection of its protectionist policies. Segundo Wong, representative of one of Ecuador's largest banana exporting companies, said the country "should intensify negotiations with the EU and exhaust every alternative for an agreement." Wong added that Ecuador should "aggressively" seek new markets worldwide, including European banana producing countries like France, Spain, and Portugal. The Ecuadoran Government on 18 January rejected the EU banana trade plan. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0148 GMT 19 Jan 94) GUATEMALA Guatemalan Deputy Foreign Minister Salvador Cohen warned today that the EU might disregard the GATT decision against its Latin American banana import quota system, which violates free trade. Cohen reiterated that Guatemala, the only Central American member of GATT, is pleased with the decision, but he admitted that "many GATT panel decisions have been disregarded." Meanwhile, Guatemalan Deputy Economy Minister Guillermo Rodriguez said that "Guatemala will not accept any measure that restricts free trade." (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2119 GMT 19 Jan 94) The Guatemalan Foreign trade Ministry has announced that the GATT on 18 January "flatly and categorically condemned the banana import system implemented by the European countries since July 1993." The ministry added that the system is discriminatory and cannot be safeguarded by the Lome Convention, adding that the GATT decision constitutes a "huge success" because it is very difficult for a small country like Guatemala to fight against a group of developed countries. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 19 Jan 94 p 8) HONDURAS Honduran Economy Minister Carlos Chain described the GATT decision against the EU restrictions on Latin American bananas as a "success for all the countries in the region." He added that "the struggle will be difficult but the region will be in a better position to negotiate." Chain said: "Now the Europeans will have to approach us for negotiations and we will be in an excellent position." (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0146 GMT 19 Jan 94) President Callejas said the GATT decision to condemn the EU banana import system constitutes a victory for Latin American unity. He added that the Honduran people are quite flattered by the decision because "its represents a promising situation for the nation's banana industry." Callejas regretted the loss of banana plantations to floods and hurricanes last year, but said the GATT decision creates hope for the banana industry. (Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO in Spanish 20 Jan 94 p 10) NICARAGUA Nicaragua has expressed satisfaction over the GATT decision against the EU banana import system. Foreign Trade Director Oscar Aleman said "Nicaragua will struggle for the GATT council to adopt the panel decisions, which constitute a very important step toward the solution of the trade conflict." (Paris AFP in Spanish 2352 19 Jan 94) PANAMA UPEB Director Enrique Betancur has confirmed that on 24 January this organization will hold a meeting in Guatemala to decide on a common position against European "injustices" in the area of banana imports. The meeting will seek to design a strategy for Latin American banana exporters in light of the GATT decision in favor of their complaint against the EU. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1703 GMT 19 Jan 94) Latin American banana-producing countries are celebrating the GATT decision in favor of the complaint they filed against the EU. Colombian Foreign Minister Nohemi Sanin, who was on an official trip to Panama when the news came, declined to comment before talking with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria.
