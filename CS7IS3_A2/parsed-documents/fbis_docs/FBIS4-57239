The government, however, supports pressure tactics to restore democracy in that Caribbean nation. According to the spokesman, Venezuela will not join any armed multinational force or support a unilateral decision by the United States if that country decides to intervene in Haiti. Venezuela is the only Latin American country that belongs to the Group of Friends of Haiti, which comprises the United States, France, and Canada. The possibility of an armed intervention in Haiti has gained strength after the military who toppled head of state Jean-Bertrand Aristide appointed a puppet president. This week the military, led by Raoul Cedras, who headed the coup, appointed Supreme Court Justice Emile Jonassaint president, something the United Nations and the OAS have rejected. The United Nations agreed to tighten the economic sanctions on the Haitian military regime as of 21 May.
