In a petition filed on Monday with the International Trade Commission and the US Commerce Department Bic also asked for a 346 percent duty on Chinese-made lighters. Neither federal agency had any immediate comment. "As the only remaining US manufacturer of disposable lighters, Bic is taking this action to protect our competitive position so that we can continue to provide consumers with made-in-the-USA quality and value," said Bic president Ray Winter. In Bangkok, a Foreign Trade Department source said the department had not yet received the information about the dumping investigation in the United States because dumping involves the private sector. A source from Thai Merry, the major exporter of Thai disposable lighters, said the company had not been informed about the case but believed it did not dump the products even though the US is the major importer of its products. Thai Merry already faces an anti-dumping duty collection of 14.1 percent on the value of lighters exported to the European Union after the EU Commission found that the Thai products were priced in a way that caused damage to local industries. The EU also investigated dumping of disposable lighters from China and announced a duty of 16.9 percent.
