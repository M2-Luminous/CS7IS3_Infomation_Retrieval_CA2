The Canadian peacekeepers were on a patrol with two UN military observers -- whose nationality was not specified -- in the Medak region, which is under the protection of the UN Protection Force in former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR), when the incident took place Tuesday. The Croatian soldiers confronted the six men and fired shots into the air to force them to surrender their weapons. They were then taken to a Croatian Army post and released only after negotiations between local Croatian military officials and the local UNPROFOR commanders, the UN source said. A similar incident occured in the Medak pocket on January 5 when four Canadian UN troops were disarmed and detained for several hours by Croatian soldiers. General Jean Cot, the French general who at the time was commander of UNPROFOR, protested to Zagreb authorities, calling the incident "outrageous." Canada has a battalion of some 600 men in the region. They were deployed in Medak in September after the Croatian Army launched an offensive there, seizing three Serb vilages and, according to UNPROFOR reports, massacring several residents.
