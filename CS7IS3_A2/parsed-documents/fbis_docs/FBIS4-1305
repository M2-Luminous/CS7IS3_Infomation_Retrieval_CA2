FBIS4-1305 "drafr080_c_94023" FBIS-AFR-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 26 Apr South African Press Review for 26 Apr MB2604160194 MB2604160194 BFN [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN Johannesburg Bomb Blast `Bloody Madness' -- "Madness. Sheer, bloody madness" is how Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 25 April in its page-6 editorial describes the bomb blast in central Johannesburg on 24 April. "Since the explosion was near both the ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional and Pan-Africanist Congress offices, we can safely assume that it was intended as an attack on one of them, probably the ANC." Ultimately, the explosion was "a futile" deed since "the election will go on. Nothing will stop it." THE STAR `Wild Men' of Right Need To Be Addressed After Election -- Referring to the bomb explosions that have shaken the country since Sunday, 24 April, Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 26 April in a page-18 editorial says: "We should have expected the merciless actions of the wild men of the Right. Now that this stage is upon us, let it not drag the country off its momentous course." Firstly, the bombers should be tracked down and brought to justice. Secondly, they should be made to understand that "they achieve nothing." "There is a belief among such people that they can blast their way to the future security they seek. In reality, they do the reverse." "Reason cannot speak to the wild men themselves; but it can speak to their families and friends, the confidantes and advisers upon whose tacit support the bombers depend." In conclusion, the paper warns "it is clear that the concerns of the right wing -- both inside and out of the constitution -- have not been met. We have, miraculously, come to this election without them. In the early aftermath, our leaders must turn with utmost sincerity to finding the rightists, too, a place in the sun." BUSINESS DAY Bomb Blasts; FF Needs To be Addressed After Election -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 26 April in a page-16 editorial says the rash of bomb blasts since 24 April should be viewed as "a desperate but doomed last ditch flourish perpetrated by a dying movement." BUSINESS DAY believes the "dissident, non-participating right wing has been reduced to two groups. First there is a small coterie of ineffectual CP [Conservative Party] politicians, centred on Ferdi Hartzenberg. Second is the more dangerous -- though often clownish -- group of shadowy mini-armies, numbering perhaps a thousand individuals. Given effective police intelligence work, this guerrilla threat is far from unmanagable. Compared to the now disappearing prospect of civil war in Natal, the bombers are a minor problem." South Africa faces a period of "vicious though limited terrorism" which may intimidate voters, but the best response would be to "go out and vote in the new South Africa. The more these brutal elements are isolated, the better." The government is also warned "not to treat the Freedom Front lightly once the election is over. To do so would invite a mushrooming of the dangerous right." SOWETAN Bomb Blasts Attempt To Cause `Panic' -- We are outraged at the senseless killing of innocent people through the use of car bombs," declares a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 26 April. "We urge our people to make it their business to go out and vote instead of being frightened off by these enemies of progress. They are out to cause as much panic and fear as they can to disrupt the elections. The opposite will in fact become the truth." CITY PRESS ANC's Mandela `Head and Shoulders' Above Other Parties -- "We, the people of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world to know that as from Wednesday [27 April] a truly new South Africa will be born," declares a front-page editorial in Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 24 April. "While there are many men and women of vision who made this day possible, ANC President Nelson Mandela undoubtedly stands head and shoulders above all who finally took us to this glorious and momentous day. We thank God almighty. Let us go to the polls on Wednesday and vote for a party we can trust with our lives."
