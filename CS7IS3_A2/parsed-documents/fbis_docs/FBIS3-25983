ARATS Executive Vice Chairman Tang Shubei and ARATS Vice Chairman and Secretary General Zou Zhekai held the first round of talks with SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary General Jiao Renhe [Chiao Jen-ho] at the Diaoyutai Guesthouse this afternoon. Prior to the talks, Tang Shubei noted: Since we successfully held the "Wang-Gu talks" and signed agreements, the two organizations have made some progress in implementing the agreements. During Mr. Jiao Renhe's visit to Beijing, both sides will exchange views on implementing the agreements. This is an excellent opportunity. Jiao Renhe also indicated: According to the "Agreement on Establishing a System of Making Contacts and Holding Talks Between the Two Organizations" signed during the "Wang-Gu talks," the vice chairmen or secretaries general of the two organizations will, in principle, meet and hold talks once every six months. The time for doing so has passed. Coordination between the two organizations for implementing the agreements has been largely good over the past nine months. During the current talks, we will exchange views on better implementing the agreements. After the talks, Tang Shubei and Jiao Renhe gave separate briefings on the talks and answered reporters' questions. Tang Shubei said that during today's discussions, he first forwarded ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan's letter to SEF Chairman Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu], in which the former invited the latter to visit the mainland this year. Afterward, the two sides exchanged views on progress in implementing the agreements of the "Wang-Gu talks" over the past six months or so. They also discussed current conceptual issues affecting progress in discussions on affairs of a routine nature between the two organizations. Tang Shubei said: During the discussions, both sides reiterated that in principle, airplane hijackers should be repatriated without exception. The framework of the agreement on repatriating airplane hijackers, reached by the two sides during their discussions in Taipei, is good. Both sides also agreed that in handling matters relating to agreements, the two nongovernmental organizations should follow the principle of "stressing the nongovernmental and routine nature," eschew politically sensitive issues, and refrain from imposing their political demands on each other. This is because the two organizations are cooperating amid political differences between the two sides. It takes time to solve these political differences. Therefore, we should shun politically sensitive issues. Tang Shubei said: "Mr. Jiao and I share the feeling that we should place on our agenda the economic topics specified in the joint agreements of the 'Wang-Gu talks.' We should hold early discussions on better protection of Taiwan businessmen's investments on the mainland, cross-strait joint development of energy and resources, and scientific and technological exchanges. With the consent of their leaders, the two organizations should also jointly hold a meeting on people-to-people economic exchanges at the earliest possible date." Regarding economic topics, Jiao Renhe proposed signing an agreement on protecting Taiwan businessmen's investments. Tang Shubei indicated: By taking account of Taiwan businessmen's views and bearing in mind its own actual conditions, the mainland has drafted the "Law on Protecting the Investments of Taiwan Compatriots" and forwarded it to the National People's Congress Standing Committee for examination and approval. In accordance with the principle of reciprocity and mutual benefit in cross-strait exchanges, we hope that Taiwan will lift restrictions banning Taiwan businessmen from investing on the mainland, initiate cross-strait cooperation in labor services, and ease restrictions on access to Taiwan for mainland goods. In the spirit of adopting active measures on both sides and protecting Taiwan businessmen's rights and interests, we do not exclude the possibility of the two sides signing nongovernmental agreements in the future. During the talks, Jiao Renhe noted: The two organizations have been in rather close contact over the past year, assisting each other in solving quite a few difficulties encountered by people on both sides of the Taiwan strait. Regarding the use and verification of notarial certificates, the two sides have exchanged approximately 20,000 notarial certificates. They have exchanged more than 350,000 letters since registered mail services were initiated. The scale, range, and level of cross-strait cultural and educational exchanges are being expanded and upgraded with each passing day; this is a heartening sign. The SEF hopes to gradually establish order in cross-strait people-to-people exchanges on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation. The talks this afternoon lasted for two hours. In the morning, Jiao Renhe and his entourage toured the Biyun Temple at Xiangshan and paid homage at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's cenotaph.
