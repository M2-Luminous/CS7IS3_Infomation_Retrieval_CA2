ROMPRES 8/3/1994 -- Oliviu Gherman, president of the Party of Social Democracy of Romania, told a news conference on 8 March that the recent government reshuffle was, "like everywhere in the world and the more so in a country in transition, a natural and constitutional way of improving the activity of the executive." In that context, Oliviu Gherman stressed his party's readiness to continuously improve the government activity by associating personalities "adjusted the new requirements of the Romanian society." The recent government reshuffle meant the replacement of the ministers of defence, the interior, transport, and justice. Ioan Solcanu, vice-president of the ruling party, said that his party's negotiations with the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic National Peasant Party and the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) were not fortuitous. "Their purpose was to probe those parties' attitude in the event that the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] would propose a minority, one-colour government, improved with technocrats." Also, Ioan Solcanu said that the current government reshuffle, tacitly accepted by the Romanian National Unity Party, completed a first round of consultations, that with the parties of the majority parliamentary coalition. For the time being, Ioan Solcanu said, the formula proposed by the National Peasant Christian Democratic Party (a government formed by the PDSR-Democratic Convention and Democratic Party) could not be achieved. The PDSR's intention, Ioan Solcanu recognized, was to single out through those political dialogues the possibilities to speed up the reform through an agreement of the parties of the whole political arena.
