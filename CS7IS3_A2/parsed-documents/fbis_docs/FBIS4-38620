The sides focused on Russia's role in the Middle East peace process and agreed that it must step up its peace activity in the region. They also discussed bilateral relations between Russia and Jordan. Speaking at a news conference after his talks with the prime minister, Posuvalyuk called for working on a parity basis in order to ensure the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan Heights and restore peace between Israel and Syria. He stressed that this is vital for reaching an overall settlement in the Middle East. The envoy emphasised the importance of the willingness of the sides involved to achieve progress in the peace process on the basis of the principle "full return of occupied territories in exchange for peace." He believes that the lack of progress or failure of peace talks will play into the hands of forces opposing restoration of stability and security in the region. Posuvalyuk is in Amman on a working visit as part of his Middle East tour aimed at invigorating the peace process in the Middle East. He has already visited Damascus and is expected to go to Israel on Sunday. He will hold talks with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and visit the city of Jericho for talks with Palestinian officials.
