For example, it finds that women-owned firms are 22 percent more likely to report problems dealing with their banks than are businesses at large. In addition, the NFWBO study finds that the largest single type of short-term financing used by women business owners is credit cards and that over half of women-owned firms use credit cards for such purposes, as compared to 18 percent of all small to medium-sized businesses, which generally use bank loans and vendor credit for short-term credit needs. With regard to long-term financing, the study states that a greater proportion of women-owned firms are turning, or are forced to turn, to private sources, and to a wider variety of sources, to fulfill their needs. Based on these findings, the NFWBO study concludes that removal of financial barriers would encourage stronger growth among women-owned businesses, resulting in much greater growth throughout the economy. 9 9 See The National Foundation for Women Business Owners, Financing the Business, A Report on Financial Issues from the 1992 Biennial Membership Survey of Women Business Owners, October 1993. 7. If we are to meet the congressional goals of promoting economic opportunity and competition by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of providers, we must find ways to counteract effectively these barriers to entry. As chronicled in the Fifth Report and Order, both Congress and the Commission have tried various methods to enhance access to the broadcast and cable industries by minorities and women. 10 These efforts however, have met with limited success. The record shows that women and minorities have not gained substantial ownership representation in either the broadcast or non-broadcast telecommunications industries. For example, a 1993 report conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's (NTIA) Minority Telecommunications Development Program shows that, as of August 1993, only 2.7 percent of commercial broadcast stations were owned by minorities. Another study commissioned by the Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency in 1991 found that only one half of one percent of the telecommunications firms in the country were minority owned. The study also identified only 15 minority cable operators and 11 minority firms engaged in the delivery of cellular, specialized mobile radio, radio paging or messaging services in the United States. 11 And, according to the last available U.S. Census, only 24 percent of the communications firms in the country were owned by women, and these women-owned firms generated only approximately 8.7 percent of the revenues earned by communications companies. 12 When companies without paid employees are removed from the equation, firms with women owners represent only 14.5 percent of the communications companies in the country. 13 One result of these low numbers is that there are very few minority or women-owned businesses that bring experience or infrastructure to narrowband PCS. They thus face an additional barrier relative to many existing service providers. 10 See Fifth Report and Order at ¶¶103&hyph;106. 11 See Testimony of Larry Irving, Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, U.S. Department of Commerce, before the House Minority Enterprise Subcommittee, May 20, 1994. In his testimony at this same hearing, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt cited some of these statistics and noted that in light of this serious underrepresentation, there remains ``a fundamental obligation for both Congress and the FCC to examine new and creative ways to ensure minority opportunity.''

The census data includes sole proprietorships, partnerships, and subchapter S corporations. We have no statistics regarding women representation among owners of larger communications companies. 13 Id. 8. Small businesses also have not become major participants in the telecommunications industry. For instance, one commenter asserts that ten large companies_six Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), AirTouch (formerly owned by Pacific Telesis), McCaw, GTE and Sprint_control nearly 86 percent of the cellular industry. This commenter further contends that nine of these ten companies control 95 percent of the cellular licenses and population in the 50 BTAs that have one million or more people. 14 14 Ex parte filing of DCR Communications, May 31, 1994. 9. In the new auction law, Congress directed the Commission to remedy this serious imbalance in the participation by certain groups, especially minorities and women. The auction law itself contemplates that requiring payment for initial licenses through competitive bidding, unlike existing licensing methods such as comparative hearings or lotteries, may inhibit participation by those with limited access to capital and could further diminish opportunities for designated entities. The first nationwide auction demonstrated that a 25 percent bidding credit may not be sufficient to ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate where narrowband PCS values are high. The regional auctions will demonstrate whether a 40 percent bidding credit for women- and minority-owned firms combined with installment payments for eligible small businesses is sufficient to provide meaningful opportunities for designated entities at the regional level. We further propose to examine the use of measures we specified in the Fifth Report and Order to carry out Congress's directive to provide meaningful opportunities for small entities and businesses owned by women and minorities to provide PCS services. If, based on the results of the regional auction, we conclude that the 40 percent bidding credit is insufficient, we may decide that these measures, which are expressly designed to address the funding problems faced by these groups, may be necessary to achieve Congress's goals with respect to narrowband PCS. B. Summary of Special Provisions for Designated Entities 10. While there was significant designated entity participation in the nationwide narrowband PCS auction, we are concerned that the high license values in that auction and the substantial involvement by large, incumbent firms with significant financial resources suggests that designated entities may have difficulties in competing in future narrowband PCS auctions. We recognize that larger incumbent firms are able to pay much higher license prices than smaller firms because of the significant infrastructure and cost of capital advantages these firms enjoy. Because of these factors, we believe that additional measures may be necessary to achieve Congress's mandate that we ensure the opportunity for designated entities to participate in the competitive bidding process and in the provision of spectrum-based services. In this regard, we propose additional provisions for businesses owned by women and/or minorities and small businesses similar to those employed in the auction rules for broadband PCS.
