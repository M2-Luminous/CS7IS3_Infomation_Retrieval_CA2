The Russian delegate called for an urgent report of the U.N. secretary-general to the Security Council on the details of the event. The Russian side insistently demands explanations from the U.N. Secretariat on the practical implementation of the procedure for using military aircraft, envisaged by the council's decisions, including the need to hold consultations with its members. It wants to know what concrete targets were subjected to air strikes and what were the results of these blows, etc. The Russian side also wants to know whether there were victims among the civilian population. Vorontsov stressed the impermissibility of violating the resolutions adopted by the Security Council on "safety enclaves" in Bosnia and Herzegovina, noting that, at the same time, it was wrong to connive at Muslim provocations, which were repeatedly recorded by U.N. representatives. He referred to the Security Council's call to all the sides involved in the conflict to stop provocations, contained in the latest statement by the council chairman, released on April 6. Vorontsov called for urgent measures in the Gorazde area -- the deployment there of U.N. troops, withdrawal of Serb units from their present positions, demilitarisation of this "safety enclave", including the disarmament of Muslim units now active there. Vorontsov stressed that the Russian side believed it was the duty of the Security Council to actively contribute to the achievement of these goals. He noted that Russia, as a direct and active participant of the Bosnian settlement, wanted to prevent the escalation of this conflict and expected more vigorous efforts by the world community to indicate the way to peace to all the sides involved in the conflict.
