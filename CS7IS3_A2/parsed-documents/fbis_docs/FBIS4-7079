(Posco) flatly denied rumors Tuesday that its Chairman Kim Man-che would meet Pak Tae-chun, former chief of the mammoth steelmaker, in Japan during Kim's current four-day visit. The former deputy prime minister and finance minister, who was sworn in March 8, has wound up a company reshuffle and embarked on his first trip abroad to become familiarized with Japanese steelmakers and to discuss technological cooperation. Kim chose Japan as his first overseas destination because it is not only the world's biggest steelmaker but also because it is Posco's major technology teacher, a company official said, adding that Kim had no reason to meet Pak. Rumors of a Kim-Pak rendezvous have circulated since former Chairman Chong Myong-sik and other executives refrained from traveling to Japan lest the public misunderstand the purpose of their trip. Pak, who has been in Japan since resigning the chairman's post, had expressed his wish to come back home through various channels. But Posco, reacting sensitively to the rumors because of Pak's connection to politics, emphasized that Kim was strictly on business in Japan, discussing technological cooperation, the position of Japan's steel industry and Mitsubish Motor Co.'s plan to import Posco cold-rolled sheets. Company officials added that Kim had no reason to meet Pak, with whom he has no personal relations.
