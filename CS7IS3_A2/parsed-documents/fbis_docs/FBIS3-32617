Government Minister Fabio Villegas, the minister in charge of political issues, said the position voiced by the high-ranking tribunal [as heard] does not obligate the government to immediately withdraw the troops, which are in Juanchaco and which have created a serious controversy among various sectors of the country. He insisted the Council of State did not issue a ruling, rather, an opinion that will now be debated at the Charges [Acusacion] Committee of the Chamber of Representatives and will be studied by the Attorney General's Office. The Executive Branch stated in a communique the president of the Republic violated neither the letter nor spirit of the Constitution. The executive branch will not avoid the political debate at the Congress of the Republic. It is not our goal to deceive anyone, because the documents which contain these agreements have been at the Colombians' disposal, and thus, there is nothing secret, the government minister added.
