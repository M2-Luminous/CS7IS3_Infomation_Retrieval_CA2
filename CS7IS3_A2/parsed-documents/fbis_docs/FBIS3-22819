Nikolay Bisovko, a senior official in the Federal Supervision of Nuclear and Radioactive Security, who looks after the safety of nuclear power plants used by the country's defense agencies, told Interfax that a mobile LNW processing unit would be built in the Maritime Territory at a cost of 1.2 Bn [billion] rubles. "We believe that it will be assembled in three to four months and become operational in 1994," he said. He added that a stationary processing unit had to be constructed in the area. The unit will need filters and other parts that will have to be manufactured in numerous factories. Bisovko thinks said that an ecological study would precede the construction of stationary LNW processing units. It was hard to say at this stage how much time and funds would be required for that project.
