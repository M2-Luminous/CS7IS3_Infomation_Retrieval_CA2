Tempers became so frayed that at one point Mr Major banged the declaration down on the table in front of him. But officials fiercely denied Dr Paisley's claim that Mr Major was "throwing papers around." It was the kind of rowdy setback to the Downing Street declaration that everyone expected. In fact, some observers were astonished that the meeting ran its full 30 minute course. They assumed Dr Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists, would have stormed out within the first few minutes. And there was plainly no prospect that the Prime Minister could influence Dr Paisley's implacable stand against the declaration and the peace process, which he had already denounced as "a sham and a deceit." The meeting was destined to be a shouting match from the moment Dr Paisley, and his colleagues, Peter Robinson and William McCrea, strode into the Prime Minister's study. It was the first "formal" meeting between Mr Major and Dr Paisley since the declaration was proclaimed on December 15. The versions of the stormy encounter from Downing Street and from Dr Paisley did not tally in all respects -- but what was clear from both accounts was that this was the biggest row Downing Street has seen for years. Their reports left the impression that Dr Paisley was roaring like a bull -- and that the Prime Minister's own voice was more than once untypically raised in anger. Although this was not the sort of confrontation the Prime Minister relishes, there is a widespread feeling that he was well-prepared for an onslaught. It will make not the slightest difference to his faith in the Declaration. In other developments today: - Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, repeated there could be no negotiations in return for a temporary IRA ceasefire; - Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, speaking in Dublin, underlined that all-party talks on the Province's future still offered the best path to peace, despite the Unionist threat to boycott any new discussions. But the Downing Street row dominated. Afterwards, Dr Paisley said that Mr Major was "very, very angry." "It was a very rough meeting. I have never seen the Prime Minister more angry. I had to raise my voice in order that the Prime Minister could hear because he was shouting so loudly," he said. Dr Paisley said he urged Mr Major to abandon the declaration and made clear he would make it the main issue at the Euro-elections in June. The Prime Minister, he said, was "throwing papers around -- he must have thrown them around three or four times or more." "We served notice on him that we were seeking a mandate from the people of Northern Ireland against the joint declaration in June," said Dr Paisley. "He said he wanted to have peace. We told him that you don't have peace with surrender. He was very, very angry. He refused even to listen to the points we were making. He abandoned the meeting and said we would have to meet again." Dr Paisley described the declaration as "a rotten, sinking vessel which is going down now in confusion." Junior Northern Ireland minister Michael Ancram confirmed that the meeting was "very frank" and Mr Major made his views known "forcibly." He added: "The Prime Minister took Mr Paisley to task for misrepresenting the declaration on a number of occasions." Downing Street said Dr Paisley handed over a submission, "a printed piece of paper about his view of things." Officials said he denounced the declaration as "iniquitous" and utterly rejected it as a "farce" -- a description the Prime Minister called "rubbish." And as Dr Paisley continued to condemn the declaration, the Prime Minister took the opportunity to point out that he had a mandate from the people of the United Kingdom. Mr Major said they wanted all the constitutional parties to take part in the talks. Dr Paisley and Mr Robinson continued expressing their hostility to the declaration "in rather loud terms." The Prime Minister said he had been very patient with Dr Paisley but had had enough of listening to his misrepresentation of the declaration. "Dr Paisley continued to misrepresent the declaration and Mr Robinson then accused the Prime Minister of giving way to violence. The Prime Minister retorted by saying how could he justify that statement when the Government maintained nearly 20,000 troops in Northern Ireland." Mr Major was said to have been "very calm, very firm, extremely tough and vigorous." But officials afterwards claimed it was probably salutary that Dr Paisley had been given a "correct interpretation" of the declaration. Mr Hurd, said after hour-long talks in Dublin with Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring that fresh talks were "the only way in which progress was going to be likely." He said: "We all know this is a difficult path and that it will not be easy. That has been proved over and over again. But the status quo...is not acceptable either. We all have a duty to find ways of making progress. And we -- the two governments -- believe the talks offer the best way. So we intend to pursue that path." Mr Hurd said the peace declaration was not a "bargaining offer." And Sir Patrick repeated that there could be no negotiations in return for a temporary IRA ceasefire. A temporary ceasefire carried the risk that the terrorists would start their campaign again, he said in Newcastle, Co [County] Down.
