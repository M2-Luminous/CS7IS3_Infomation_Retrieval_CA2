FBIS4-28187 "dreas110_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 North Korea ROK Monetary Reform Called `Antipopular' ROK Monetary Reform Called `Antipopular' SK0406110194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1045 GMT 4 Jun 94 SK0406110194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in its information published on May 31 branded the Kim Yong-sam group's planned "monetary reform" as an out-and-out anti-popular one, according to Radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul. The information says: The Kim Yong-sam group is compelled to force the "monetary reform" because it has been driven to a blind alley by the failure of its economic policy and political crisis. One of the chief aims sought by it in this "reform" is to bind working people to low wages and help raise the "international competitiveness" of big businesses at their sacrifices. Most of the money to be redeemed through the "monetary reform" is not money of comprador businesses but of middle class and other people, and the money will find its way into the hands of comprador businesses, bringing benefits, not any losses, to them. A buyer will suffer a bigger loss when he buys a thing with the newly issued money than with the former currency lower in value, and wages will automatically be frozen on a low scale and commodity prices again rise variably. It is only working people, after all, who will suffer from it. The anti-popular "monetary reform" will drive the "civilian" regime now in the grip of a crisis into a hopeless pitfall of destruction.
