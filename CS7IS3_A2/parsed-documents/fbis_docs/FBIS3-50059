Initially, I had doubts and thought that the document might be a forgery. Unfortunately, however, the material was authentic and its contents deserved attention, because of its quite peculiar orientation. It was a report by the U.S. Congress Helsinki Commission for Security and Cooperation in Europe, [prepared] under the auspices of liaison officer Erika B. Schlager. The text of the report deserves to be published in full, not only to document the present, but also for the sake of history. It documents the concerns of U.S. senators who are, at the same time, leading representatives of the U.S. Commission for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Their concern about freedom and democracy in the state between the Danube river and the Tatra mountains is all the more remarkable as they probably never set foot on its territory, which ordinary Americans mostly confuse with Slovenia or Croatia and which they place somewhere in the Balkans. The full text of the report follows: CSCE PRESS REPORT COMMISSION FOR SECURITYAND COOPERATION IN EUROPE For immediate circulation Liaison: Erika B. Schlager Washington 9 September 1993. Senator Dennis De Concini (Democrat - Arizona) and Representative Steny H. Hoyer (Democrat -- Maryland), chairman and deputy chairman of the Helsinki Commission, have sent the following letter to Peter Burian, charge d'affaires at the Slovak Embassy in Washington: ``We feel obliged to voice our concern regarding Slovakia's continued intolerance for non-Slovak ethnic and religious communities, as reported in the press. In word and deed, Slovakia's officials have raised serious doubts about the state's willingness to observe human rights commitments voluntarily accepted by the new state as part of the Helsinki process. The acts and statements of several Slovak government officials not only give grounds for warranted apprehension about the security of minorities in Slovakia, but also about the prospects of democracy itself. ``For example, the highest officials of the present government -- including Prime Minister Meciar and Minister of Culture Dusan Slobodnik -- have repeatedly warned that those who `slander' the Slovak state or disseminate `erroneous information' about it, or are not `objective' in their reports, should be punished or subjected to control. This intimidation is reminiscent of the legal situation under communism, such as the well-known ban on `anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda' in the Soviet Union. Moreover, by systematically defaming the press, Slovak representatives have taken steps, the clear result of which is the stifling of freedom of speech. In this context, the political use of the state subsidies system in converting the Slovak economy to a market economy comes to our mind [sentence as published]. ``Moreover, as we have noticed, the general approach of intolerance is being stepped up. In the course of the last few weeks, Slovak Minister of Transportation Roman Hofbauer started a campaign to render impossible the use of the Hungarian language in traffic signs throughout the state territory. Leaving aside questions concerning the economic justifiability of expenditures, this uncompromisingly controlled and highly centralized manner of governing does not heed the interests of local communities. This runs counter to specific commitments undertaken by the Slovak Government upon admission to the Council of Europe and the general assurances made by Prime Minister Meciar to Congressman Tom Lantos this spring about a just approach to minority communities. ``This week we have heard further disquieting reports. First, it has been announced that, in his speech at Spisska Nova Ves, Prime Minister Meciar warned against the high birth rate in the Romany (Gypsy) community, claiming that `if we are not going to deal with them, after a while they will deal with us. We must perceive them as a problematic group that is constantly growing.' In the light of Slovak deportations of Romanies to death camps during World War II and the forced sterilization of Romany women under the postwar communist regime, these are shocking statements. They are also in sharp contrast to Slovakia's commitment, adopted at the CSCE forum in Copenhagen in 1990 and approved by the Slovak Government in January 1993, `to clearly and unambiguously condemn totalitarianism, racism and ethnic hatred, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and any discrimination, as well as persecution for religious and ideological beliefs. In this context the participating states also acknowledge the special problems of Romanies (Gypsies).' ``It has also been announced that a U.S. citizen serving in the Slovak Jewish community -- Rabbi Baruch Myers -- was assaulted in Bratislava this week. Apparently, the manner of public pronouncements by representatives of the Slovak Government about the problems of minorities in the course of last year might have contributed to an atmosphere that is conducive to official indifference to racially-motivated attacks, or even to their toleration. In sum, this development has seriously disrupted confidence in the process of Slovak conversion to democracy. ``The CSCE will meet in Warsaw in a few weeks to discuss human rights, including questions of CSCE member states' observance of their commitments. We would welcome by then any supplementary information on the problems we have outlined.'' Cowardly Slovak Charge d'Affaires Since the authors of the letter and the report, and exponents of the views expounded in them, expressed their interest in any further information on their assertions (concerns?!), which they would welcome, a prompt and businesslike reaction was to be expected from those to whom these alleged problems, which are actually accusations, were addressed. The first reaction came from the Slovak charge d'affaires in Washington (not from our ambassador because, after nine months of existence as an independent state, our republic still does not have an appointed ambassador in the world's foremost superpower). This reaction to the assertions raised was more than cowardly. He expressed the view that realities in the Slovak Republic were not as bad as presented in the senators' viewpoint or as they appear to be, and that intolerance or anti-Semitism occur, as they do also in other states. Well, the reaction to the senators' letter, to such grievous accusations -- accusations, not concerns! -- of our state, our government, and our supreme constitutional officials was neither fish nor fowl and almost apologetic. The worldwide dissemination of a written statement by senior senators of the CSCE committee on the eve of the drafting and the discussion of a final CSCE report on human rights in Warsaw and the naming of [Slovak] constitutional representatives in connection with untrue assertions extracted from one-sided information sources -- that has nothing to do with concerns! The diplomatic vocabulary and the diplomatic code have established very precise rules in this regard. Silent Foreign Ministry The staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the sovereign and freely and democratically established Slovak Republic considered the whole matter settled with the Washington charge d'affaires' statement. So it seems, at least, for the ministry itself did not react at all. I do not like it when anyone associates me, as a member of the Slovak Government, with alleged permanent Slovak intolerance, suppression of freedom of speech, ban on the use of the Hungarian language, deportation of Romanies to death camps, the forceful sterilization of Romany women, or even toleration of racially motivated attacks in Slovakia. I therefore assumed a clear and unequivocal stand on all points in the report. For the sake of documenting the present for the future, I consider it warranted to acquaint the public with my reaction. It is uncommon in the world of diplomacy to make such correspondence public but, in doing so, I am only following in the steps of the U.S. senators, whose action went beyond the framework of diplomatic fairness. My Reaction to the Congressmen's Report ``In connection with the report of Senator Dennis D. Concini (Democrat -- Arizona) and Representative Steny H. Hoyer (Democrat -- Maryland) of 13 September 1993, intended for the CSCE, in which the two gentlemen express their apprehensions about Slovakia's alleged continuous intolerance of non-Slovak ethnic and religious communities, about alleged punishment and control of the press with the alleged aim of stifling freedom of the press, about the transportation minister's alleged campaign to render impossible the usage of the Hungarian language, about Prime Minister Meciar's alleged statements directed against the Romany ethnic group, or about the allegedly racially-motivated assault on Rabbi Baruch Myers, a U.S. citizen serving in the Slovak religious community -- I consider it unavoidable to inform you about the following: ``1. I think it is deplorable that the aforementioned gentlemen assume a stand on a state, the existence of which they are aware only on the basis of tendentious and distorted arbitrary information. It would be extremely beneficial if they visited our country personally, to confront their apprehensions directly with the persons they mention in their report. This would be the easiest way to convince them that their apprehensions are based on arbitrary disinformation. ``2. The Constitution and the entire state legal framework establish scope for a democratic and free society, to which intolerance of non-Slovak ethnic groups and religious communities is alien. The Slovak Republic is the only European post-communist country that has thoroughly redressed the wrongs of the past that were committed against all churches. This redress of wrongs is based on a return to the situation prior to 1948 (communist coup) or 1945. The Jewish religious community constitutes the only exception; the starting point for redressing the wrongs committed against it is 2 November 1938, that is, the date of the occupation of southern Slovakia by fascist Horthyite Hungary in the wake of the Vienna arbitrage. Your assertions about Slovakia's continued intolerance are completely false. ``3. In respecting the freedom of the press, the government is basing its policy on Council of Europe Resolution 1003 of 1 July 1993 on journalistic ethics. I am enclosing the text of this resolution. Unlike journalists in advanced democratic countries, some representatives of our press confuse reports with commentaries, facts with hypotheses, arguments with opinions, and comprehensive information with excerpts torn out of context. I am of the opinion that the Council of Europe recommendations concerning this issue are warranted and correct. I hope that you are of the same opinion. ``No one in the government can control the press because in Slovakia there is no censorship. If, however, journalists are authors of damaging lies, it is possible to seek legal recourse in conformity with valid laws. Judicial power is independent of the state in our country. The realization of such steps has nothing to do with suppressing the freedom of the press but is a normal legal mechanism of a democratic state, such as is applied also in other free and democratic states of the world. ``4. Statements about the `extermination' of the Hungarian language from Ministry of Transportation road signs are grossly distorted. In every state there is an established legal framework for traffic signs that cannot be changed at will and arbitrarily on the basis of the views of a certain ethnic community. If such a situation were common in all states, it would lead to organizational chaos in traffic signs. Even in the United States there is a large number of traffic signs with inscriptions, and I did not notice languages of other nations being used on them. If my observations were inaccurate, I would welcome more specific details from your side. ``5. Prime Minister Meciar's alleged statements about the Romany community were apparently gleaned from the Czech news agency CTK. Its journalist [Karel] Hirman put into Prime Minister Meciar's mouth words that he did not utter. Because slander of this kind is criminally liable in civilized and democratic states, the prosecuting authorities have initiated proceedings against him. ``6. The physical assault on Rabbi Baruch Myers of the Jewish community was connected with the deplorable growth in crime in the wake of the opening up of society and had nothing to do with racial motives. The offenders were three juveniles who stole Mr. Baruch Myers' characteristic black hat. They were detained still on the day of the theft and the stolen object was returned to its owner. ``I consider it extremely unfortunate that our state is assessed by persons who have never been in our country and on the basis of out of context information. Such a course of action cannot be positively received, also in view of the methods that had been applied against our country until recently and that we thought were a matter of the past since 1989.'' Assurance That Was Not Kept My reaction went to Eleonor Sutter, U.S. charge d'affaires in Bratislava, Senators Steny H. Hoyer and Dennis De Concini, the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Slovak American National Council in the United States. After the intervention of the chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic [Ivan Gasparovic] with those who prepared the report in the United States, the Slovak side was assured that, in view of the Slovak side's objections, the report would not be published. This was presently disavowed, as confirmed also by the commission's assistant Erika B. Schlager, and the report was widely distributed to the public. Can it be considered a coincidence that this happened immediately before our talks with the World Bank? One can calmly reason that this is quite an effective point of departure for levying financial and economic sanctions against a country that has been questioned in this way. Sufficient scope is created for intervention by UN troops, with massive participation by the Marines, in the interest of protecting human rights and combating racism. Scope is created for the materialization of the intention to peacefully alter borders in Central Europe on the basis of arbitrage by the world powers. He who does not believe this, let him study the U.S. Congress Helsinki Commission's report about Slovakia to realize where it is necessary to intervene against evil, in the interest of the good. The world powers did this twice before, at the international arbitrages in Munich and Vienna [in September and November 1938], for the sake of saving peace and calm and in the interest of addressing the situation of minorities deprived of their rights. After their "remedial" steps, millions of Czechs and hundreds of thousands of Slovaks found themselves in the position of minorities without rights in Germany and Hungary. Instead of the longed-for peace, the war broke out! Mrs. Schlager's Sources of Information I am of the opinion that it is appropriate to stop for a while to consider a matter of principle -- the sources of information about the Slovak Republic on which documents of this kind draw, and to which they refer. In an interview for Radio Free Europe, Erika B. Schlager said that members of the U.S. Congress Helsinki Commission are responsible for the preparation of the aforementioned report. According to Erika Schlager's information, staffers of various U.S. Congress offices travelled to Slovakia and their reports served as a point of departure in preparing the aforementioned document. Hence, this is not the viewpoint of private persons but a document expressing views that are close to the U.S. Administration. The report on Slovakia also draws on materials sent by various people directly from Slovakia, materials of unofficial institutions in the United States which monitor developments in Slovakia, and many articles from various Slovak newspapers and magazines. Mrs. Schlager, who was in Slovakia twice, in 1990 and 1992 (!!!), states that the view that the report's section on minorities is based on clippings from the Hungarian press is not quite accurate. There is really nothing to be added to this, except, perhaps, for one thing: It suffices to attentively study the senators' letter and the "apprehensions" concerning democracy and freedom in Slovakia expressed in it, to very easily identify the press sources of such reports from Slovakia. These are newspapers that given their print run, the number of unsold issues, and attained economic results, should have theoretically gone bankrupt and perished a long time ago. In spite of that, these newspapers are prospering, evidently not from their own resources. It is being said in some circles that the pay of some of their reporters, who dip their pen in venom and spread untruths about Slovakia, reaches four digits and not in korunas, as everyone knows.... Nothing happens of its own accord, without a cause. Let us identify the aims of this escalated anti-Slovak crusade and we will come to understand the steps being prepared and realized and, in particular, their purpose. Let us assert our interests, our needs, and our plans. Only, let us do this quickly, effectively, and vigorously. Our ill-wishers are doing it too! Current developments within the state and abroad signal the warranted risk that the Slovak Republic may not live to see the second anniversary of its independence. It should, and definitely will, live to see it, however! And not just the second anniversary but countless further anniversaries, within the framework of the broad family of sovereign European national republics. No nation in the world is better off under foreign rule, no matter what foreign rule this is, than when it decides on its affairs itself. Well, then: Shall we let ourselves be intimidated, perturbed, divided, and corrupted?! Shall we allow the social atmosphere to be poisoned by ill-wishers who are full of hatred and who, not infrequently, wage a struggle for foreign interests and aims for foreign money? Or shall we confirm the continuation, along our own path, into our own promised land? After all, the results achieved in the brief period of the first year of our statehood are far more favorable than expected by any world political scientists, economic experts, and forecasters. We are also facing considerable problems, which is understandable. We are building and furnishing the home of our own statehood in conditions of a deep worldwide economic recession. But just as bad weather can only improve after some time, depression can only be followed by prosperity. We are not going to achieve it in a month or two. We are going to make it, however, provided all of us will really want it! The decision is in our hands and our decisions will affect many generations of our children's children. Let our decisions be wise.
