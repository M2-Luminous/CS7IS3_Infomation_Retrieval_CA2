An on-going meeting on national rural hydropower construction revealed that 14 out of 200 counties selected to undergo full electrification by the State Council in 1991 have now attained the goal ahead of time. Over the past three years, rural areas of the country have added a generating capacity of 3.77 million kilowatts, according to the meeting. Also, the total generating capacity of waterpower projects which are now under construction is expected to reach about 9.6 million kilowatts this year. Controls on electricity prices for users on rural hydropower networks have been lifted, and newly-built power stations have adopted a new price system of capital repayment with interest. According to the meeting, the nation's total investment in waterpower construction in 1993 was seven billion yuan. It also said that agricultural banks throughout the country provided loans of 8.64 million yuan to build medium- and small-sized power stations, 6,855 of which have been put into operation and more than 400 of which are still under construction. The focus of the hydro-power construction drive over the past few years has been on the development of local electricity networks and joint stock companies. More than 40 trans-county regional companies have been set up, and nearly 150 companies have been reorganized or rebuilt in line with the share-holding system or joint stock system. The electrification in recent years has boosted economic development in rural areas, in mountainous areas in particular. The average area of irrigated land per capita in the initially electrified counties increased to nearly half a hectare, with an average grain output per capita reaching more than 360 kilograms, according to the meeting. The electrification drive enabled 33.2 million farmers in poverty-stricken mountainous areas to use electricity, the meeting said.
