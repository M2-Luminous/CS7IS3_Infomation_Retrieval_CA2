The last official activity of the delegation was the signing of accords and a sister cities act. Three letters of intent regarding exchanges and cooperation between Cojedes and Cuba on health, sports, and housing were signed by Governor Machado and Cuban authorities from the respective spheres at a ceremony held this morning at the seat of the National Assembly of the People's Government. After the signing, Machado pointed out the importance of this event: "These mutual cooperation accords will allow me, as governor of Cojedes State, to solve many problems which the science and resources available there cannot solve. I am pleased with the support and cooperation from the Cuban Government, all its mid-level authorities, and deputies for their kindness, support, and efforts to seal the unity of the people today. The unity of the people is sealed with deeds, with realities, with good things." The five-day trip ends today. The delegation includes members of the governor's office and Professor Filipio Duran, vice director of the Latin American University. "What I take to my people and country are the good things you have here in terms of health, sports, and housing construction." A document was signed decreeing sister city status between Cojedes and Boyeros Municipality.
