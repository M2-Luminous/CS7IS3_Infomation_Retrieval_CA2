He said that we will be lying in wait to foil such attempts. At an expanded meeting of the Phalangist Party Political Bureau and Central Council members at the headquarters in al-Sayfi at 1700 today, he said: Frankly speaking, we can see no difficulty in uncovering the details of the crime. In fact, we are sure that we will uncover them. The possible perpetrators are limited because the parties who are capable of preparing such operations are few, and those with places where bombs are prepared and those who have interest in this crime are all well known. There is evidence. The security agencies are active and sincere and our judges are competent, and it is not difficult for them to solve such an easy case. Sa'adah said: What we fear are decisions dictated by political calculations. There is justification for our fear because there are attempts to acquit certain parties through tacit political decisions. We will be lying in wait for such decisions because this case exceeds our personal safety and involves political freedoms and the homeland's security and destiny. [passage omitted] On the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva yesterday, Dr. Sa'adah emphasized its importance at this stage in particular. He said that it was a successful and important summit, noting that the Lebanese issue was discussed during the summit. All we hope, he said, is that the Lebanese Government will follow up on the results with sound diplomatic and political moves and benefit from its positive aspects.
