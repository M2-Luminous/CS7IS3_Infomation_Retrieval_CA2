The protocol was signed by Culture Minister Fikri Saglar and Enest Drakovic, Bosnian minister of education, science, and culture. Saglar and Drakovic have also issued a joint communique appealing to the world to end the continuing massacre of the Bosnian people and the destruction of the Bosnian cultural heritage. The communique strongly condemns the international community's indifference against the massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Stressing the necessity of implementing all the UN Security Council resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the communique asks that the unjust arms embargo be lifted immediately. The communique further calls for an end to the bombing of the civilian population, the declaration of an overall cease-fire, and for NATO to undertake every possible military action to prevent Serbian aggression. The communique, which is signed by the two ministers, will be sent to international organizations including the United Nations and the Council of Europe. Drakovic also met with National Defense Minister Nevzat Ayaz. Ayaz said that Turkey is supporting Bosnia-Herzegovina at international platforms and that it will also help solve the problems encountered in the field of education. Drakovic thanked Turkey for the close interest it has shown and the aid it has extended so far.
