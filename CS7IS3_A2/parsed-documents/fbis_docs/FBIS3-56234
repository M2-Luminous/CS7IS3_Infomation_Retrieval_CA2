The session involved regional legislators and administrators and leaders of political parties and movements. Instead, the Commission approved a proposal by Parliamentary Chairman Ivan Plyushch saying that only constitutional clauses on power sharing in the center and regions must be brought for discussion by parliament due to open on January 20 before these are approved in a referendum. Plyushch will lead a working group to draft main constitutional provisions to be adopted by a new parliament. The Supreme Soviet did not authorize the Commission to bring a new constitution under a referendum, head of the law commission Alexander Kotsyuba said. He said the paper must be adopted by the next session of parliament, but any controversial points be put for a referendum.
