The sources from which it has derived this information are liars and harm the credibility of the agency itself. If AFP were not one of the world's most far-reaching agencies, we would not have replied to these allegations, especially because Syria, as is known, adheres to the framework of the Madrid peace conference and to the Washington talks that stemmed from that framework.
