However, his movement "is prepared to examine the possibility of forming a national union government with members selected on a regional basis," Mr. Moukoueke told AFP, stressing that this should be "done strictly in accordance with the Constitution." "If it is established that the formation of a national union government is the only solution to the current crisis and that Congolese killed each other in their search for this government simply because everyone would like to have a share of the cake, then we accept to examine the issue," he added. On the other hand, Mr. Moukoueke said he "is totally opposed to a government consisting of political parties because people would seek to defend their party views." Prior to the eventual establishment of a national union government on a regional basis "a working document and a consensus program must first be devised," Mr. Moukoueke stated adding "I wonder why there is so much talk about this union government; it may not necessarily bring an end to the crisis." President Lissouba had announced on 31 December 1993 that he was prepared to set up a national union government. The opposition had expressed support for the formation of this government, provided it was formed after the final verdict of the arbitration college, which is expected to rule before 5 February on the 58 petitions for the annulment of the 1993 early legislative elections. The legislative elections constitute one of the factors leading to the bloody political clashes that have ravaged the southern districts of Brazzaville for several months now.
