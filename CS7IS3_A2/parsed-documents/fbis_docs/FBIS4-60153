Kidnapping and government terrorism are the main characteristics of the Zionist entity and the declared policies of Tel Aviv's Government. Israel's brutal government lives in fear of the Muslims' power and the ability of the Islamic resistance front in Lebanon and occupied Palestine. The blows dealt by the Islamic resistance keep Israel in a constant state of nervousness. Therefore, it crushes all international values and norms and rushes to announce its responsibility for kidnappings, killings, and the most horrible crimes. Israel has not minded perpetrating massacres, killing Palestinians and breaking their bones and demolishing their houses, and raiding south Lebanon and destroying residential areas in Iqlim al-Tuffah. After all, the usurper state of Israel was founded on the ideology of killing, terrorism, and crime. This is how it has managed to establish itself in the heart of the Islamic world for some length of time. The Muslim Lebanese people, who are facing the Zionists in the first line of battle, have a long and enlightened history of confrontation with the Zionist entity. Over 13 years of direct Zionist intervention in Lebanon, interference by other international arrogant forces, and attempts by political Maronite forces to divide Lebanon, the revolutionary Muslims have played an important role in foiling all these conspiracies. The massacres of Sabra and Shatila, and the destructive war ignited by Michel 'Awn are still remembered. Those were links in a conspiracy designed to annihilate the Lebanese Muslims, restrict their freedom, and deny them their rights. But it was the revolutionary Muslims who ended the theory of Israel's steel arm in southern Lebanon. They stood up against the despotic tendencies of Michel 'Awn's Maronite Army. They forced that Army, which paved the way for the Zionist aggression against Lebanon and the arrival of Israelis at the door of Beirut, to surrender. The Lebanese people foiled the schemes of Western espionage against Muslims. Their continued presence on the political stage, therefore, is the guarantee of Lebanon's independence and steadfastness in the face of Western schemes of partition and Zionist schemes of sedition. The name of the Islamic resistance front is associated with the confrontation and repulsion of the Zionist aggressors. The Islamic resistance in southern Lebanon is the only defensive line against usurper Israel. Had the resistance not been there, the Zionists would have realized their dreams. Lebanon's entity is preserved through the jihad of the valiant Islamic resistance front. The Zionists perpetrate acts of terrorism and kidnapping because of their impotence and helplessness in the face of the Islamic resistance in southern Lebanon.
