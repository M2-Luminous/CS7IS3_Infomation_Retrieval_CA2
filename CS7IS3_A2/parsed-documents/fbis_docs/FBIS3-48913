[Daskalov] This represents support for the government's present activity, because the government has always expressed our interest in joining the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. We will now work even more actively. A matter of great importance is how the conference of NATO members on 10 January will end, what decisions they will adopt, whether NATO will extend its influence on the East, and whether or not they will adopt the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" initiative. Most likely, we may expect a favorable outcome, but only then will it become clear what rights and commitments the countries to which the initiative is addressed will have. I cannot make any guess now. [Spirdonov] Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Avdeyev assured Prime Minister Lyuben Berov that there is no danger of tension in the two countries' relations. He made this assessment immediately following the vote on the parliamentary declaration. Do you admit the possibility of any problems arising in bilateral relations, perhaps at a later date? [Daskalov] The North Atlantic Alliance will do nothing that disregards Russia's interests. Without Russia, we will find it difficult to guarantee European security, and furthermore the "Partnership for Peace" initiative is directed at Russia as well. I think that our joining NATO cannot become a motive for friction between our two states. [Spirdonov] It is still too early to talk about what will happen after 10 January, but nevertheless, if the results of the NATO forum are to our advantage, what will be the first step that our country will take? [Daskalov] We will study how to react to the results of the meeting, and I am duty bound to inform the National Assembly deputies about it.
