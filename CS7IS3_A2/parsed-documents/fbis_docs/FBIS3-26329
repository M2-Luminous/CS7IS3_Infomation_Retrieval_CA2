The supportive statements of the senior cadre who will officiate at the opening of the Daya Bay nuclear plant tomorrow, were partly responsible for the 5.74 percent jump in the Shenzhen stock index yesterday. Mr. Li arrived at the special economic zone early yesterday morning after a five-day inspection of neighboring Zhuhai. Security was extremely tight with police armed with sub-machine guns and assault rifles stationed on every road junction, while others patrolled in unmarked pick-up trucks. Mr. Li's motorcade had more than 30 motorcycle outriders and half a dozen station wagons with heavily armed escorts. Sources in Shenzhen said Mr. Li, who has visited Shenzhen annually in the past few years, headed straight to the local bourse. "Li heaped praise on the stock exchange as a vehicle for raising capital and restructuring the state enterprise system," an informed source said. "The premier expressed confidence Shenzhen economy could cross a new threshold once every few years." "However, the premier also told bourse staff that progress of the 'stocks system' must match the pace of development in the entire country." The source said his brief remarks were interpreted by brokers and investors as a pat on the back for Shenzhen and the Guangdong coast in general. The Credit Lyonnais index for Shenzhen's A shares shot up 98.09 points yesterday to close at the 1,807.18 mark. During a previous visit to the Shenzhen bourse, the premier issued a stern warning against "speculationary activities" and insisted that the facility remained a "socialist stock exchange". "Li listened to reports about Shenzhen's economic development the whole afternoon," a local journalist said last night. It is understood the premier gave instructions to a few cadres who would shortly take over leadership positions in the economic zone. Local sources said Mr. Li would today tour major infrastructure projects in Shenzhen, including the new airport. Shenzhen officials said Mr. Li had shown "great personal concern" for the Daya Bay facility. [passage omitted] Cadres in Shenzhen said yesterday at a time when hundreds of China's open cities had been granted "preferential policies" akin to those of the special economic zones, Mr. Li's remarks in the two zones were a great cause for reassurance. As is the custom with the provincial tours of senior cadres, Mr. Li's presence in Shenzhen or Zhuhai was not recorded by local papers or TV stations. When told that it was Mr. Li who was in town, local residents expressed wishes he could use his authority for the benefit of the zone. One driver suggested that the premier take a good look at Shenzhen's roads. "The city Government never thought the place would develop this quickly," he said. "The cars and lorries are all over the place. It's a real mess."
