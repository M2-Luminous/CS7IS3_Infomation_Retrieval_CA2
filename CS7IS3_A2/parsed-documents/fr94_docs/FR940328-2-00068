ACTION: Notice of the Office of Management and Budget review of information collection. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has recently submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review the following proposal for the collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). 1. Type of submission, new, revision, or extension: Revision. 2. The title of the information collection: 10 CFR part 40_Domestic Licensing of Source Material. NRC Form 244_Registration Certificate_Use of Depleted Uranium Under General License. NRC Form 484_Sample Format for Reporting Detection Monitoring Data. 3. The form number if applicable: NRC Forms 224 and 484. 4. How often the collection is required: Required reports are collected and evaluated on a continuing basis as events occur. Applications for new licenses and amendments may be submitted at any time. Renewal applications are submitted every five years. NRC Form 244 is submitted when depleted uranium is received or transferred under general license. NRC Form 484 is submitted to report ground-water monitoring data necessary to implement EPA ground-water standards. 5. Who will be required or asked to report: 10 CFR part 40: Applicants for and holders of NRC licenses authorizing the receipt, possession, use, or transfer of radioactive source and byproduct material. NRC Form 244: Persons receiving, possessing, using, or transferring depleted uranium under the general license established in 10 CFR 40.25(a). NRC Form 484: Uranium recovery facility licensees reporting ground-water monitoring data pursuant to 10 CFR 40.65. 6. An estimate of the number of annual response: 10 CFR part 40: 577. NRC Form 244: 40. NRC Form 484: Included in 10 CFR part 40, above. 7. An estimate of the total number of hours needed annually to complete the requirement or request: 10 CFR part 40: 19,645 (Approximately 12.6 hours per response for applications and reports plus approximately 73.2 hours annually per recordkeeper). NRC Form 244: 40 (an average of one hour per response). NRC Form 484: Included in 10 CFR part 40, above. 8. An indication of whether section 3504(h), Public Law 96&hyph;511 applies: Not applicable. 9. Abstract: 10 CFR part 40 establishes requirements for licenses for the receipt, possession, use, and transfer of radioactive source and byproduct material. NRC Form 244 is used to report receipt and transfer of depleted uranium under general license, as required by 10 CFR part 40. NRC Form 484 is used to report certain ground-water monitoring data required by 10 CFR part 40 for uranium recovery licensees. The information is used by NRC to make licensing and other regulatory determinations concerning the use of radioactive source and byproduct material. The revision reflects an increase in burden primarily because of the addition of burden estimates for decommissioning financial assurance provisions and emergency plans. There is a revised estimate of the number of labelings or markings of industrial products or devices containing depleted uranium under ยง40.35(b). There is a small increase in the burden estimate for Form 244 because a greater number of the forms are now being received from licensees. Copies of the submittal may be inspected or obtained for a fee from the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC.
