The Saeima decided Jan. 27 that this document should be submitted to the United Nations together with a request to officially recognize that Latvia was occupied in 1940. The adoption of the document does not solve the Russian troop withdrawal problem but it is still important as an instrument to press on Russia, said Indulis Berzins, of the Latvia's Way. If the United Nations approves of the document, Latvia would become aware of the attitude of the world community toward the occupation, Berzins said. The United Nations, however, may reject or ignore the statement if Latvia has not duly prepared its presentation, said Janis Jurkans, another speaker at the committee meeting. Democratic Party's Ilga Grava suggested that Lithuanian and Estonian parliaments should be invited to draft a common statement on occupation. The preliminary coordination of that declaration could take place during the Baltic-Nordic seminar, scheduled for Feb. 4-5 in Riga. Estonia has prepared a similar statement. The committee wants to consult Russian parliamentarians to clarify Russia's official stance on the acknowledgement of Latvia's occupation. The Foreign Affairs Committee will also contact the Latvian envoy to the United Nations, Aivars Baumanis, to find out the anticipated reaction of this international organization to the Latvian application.
