The key to fulfilling this goal is to make peasants more enthusiastic in growing cotton. Now, some cadres and peasants have a lopsided view of cotton production. Some maintain that cotton is a low-efficiency crop and thus readust the agricultural production structure to lopsidedly reduce cotton growing acreage. Others only catch sight of a few minor projects whose efficiency is higher than that of cotton, and then put undue emphasis on diversified management to neglect and give up cotton production. Still others unreasonably compare the disaster-afflicted cotton fields with bumper-harvest grain fields and then draw the conclusion that growing cotton is less profitable than growing grain. All these ideas are extremely lopsided and harmful and negatively influence cotton production. To make peasants more enthusiastic about growing cotton, we must clear up these lopsided ideas, widely propagate the important role played by the development of cotton production in developing high-yield and fine-quality agriculture, in invigorating rural economy, and in increasing peasants' income. By working out accounts and making comparisons, we should enable peasants to understand that developing cotton production is conducive to becoming prosperous. At the same time, all pertinent departments should set forth feasible measures to provide good service for peasants in growing cotton and help peasants solve practical problems in cotton production so that peasants will be more conscious in growing more cotton, in a better manner, with a view to bringing about an upsurge in cotton production.
