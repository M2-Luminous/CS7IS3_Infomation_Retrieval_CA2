A large number of parliamentary members spoke in favor of the proposals submitted by Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister of finance and prices, who outlined what may be collected by the state to achieve the liquidity the economy requires through an increase in tax collection. The minister emphasized the need to have healthy finances, the lack of which presents the greatest obstacle to improving the Cuban economy. Following the statements made after thousands of meetings were held throughout the country earlier this year at the so-called parliaments in the workplace, deputies endorsed the elimination of certain benefits, as well as the implementation of formulas to encourage savings. The plenary session was encouraged by the report that outstanding debts among enterprises dropped 11.3 percent in the first quarter. The reduction of 1 billion pesos (equal to the dollar at the official exchange rate) in this year's budget, determined by the government, was taken as an example of the implementation of recommendations issued within the consultation process begun months ago. There was a consensus among speakers that none of the proposed measures per se will work miracles if they are not accompanied by increased production and economic efficiency. Another general idea that prevails among parliamentary members is the need to strengthen the national currency, to encourage work and productivity, and to progressively recover the role of the salary. According to the analysis, this entails a gradual increase in the offering of assets and services to predetermined groups, along with measures to encourage workers in priority areas. Benefits were also questioned, and special emphasis was placed on the educational character of charging for certain services that are offered free or at nominal fees to the population. While the debates continue, the search for solutions is still the main concern of the 551 parliamentary members. The goal is to overcome the country's difficult economic situation, which was characterized by a monetary surplus of approximately 11.636 billion pesos at the end of March and a budget deficit of approximately 4.2 billion.
