FR940812-2-00212 FR940812-2-00075 6. Similarly, one Acquiring Fund might be deemed an affiliated person of an affiliated person of its counterpart Acquired Fund because First Trust and its affiliates hold of record more than 5% of the outstanding voting securities of such Acquiring Fund and hold or share voting and/or investment discretion with respect to a portion of such shares. 7. Section 17(d) of the Act prohibits any affiliated person of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal from effecting any transaction in which such registered company is a joint, or joint and several, participant with such person in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by such registered company on a basis different from, or less advantageous than, that of such other participant. Rule 17d&hyph;1 under the Act provides that no joint transaction covered by the rule may be consummated unless the SEC grants exemptive relief after considering whether the participation of the investment company is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the participation in on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants. 8. The proposed sale of assets by each Acquired Fund to its respective Acquiring Fund and the related transactions involved in the Reorganizations might be deemed to be a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which a registered investment company and affiliated person of such company are participants. 9. Applicants submit that the Reorganizations meet the standards for relief under section 17(b) and rule 17d&hyph;1, in that the terms of the Reorganizations, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; the Reorganizations are consistent with the policy of each Acquired Fund and Acquiring Fund; the Reorganizations are consistent with the general purposes of the Act; the participation of the Acquired Funds and the Acquiring Funds in the Reorganizations on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act; and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants does not outweigh the advantages of such participation. 10. Section 15(f) of the Act permits an investment adviser or affiliate thereof to receive any amount or benefit in connection with the ``assignment'' of its investment advisory contract with a registered investment company if the requirements of that section are satisfied. Section 15(f)(1)(A) requires that, for three years after the transaction, at least 75% of the directors of the investment company (or its successor) are not interested persons, within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act, of the investment adviser or predecessor investment adviser of such investment company. 11. Applicants request an exemption from section 15(f)(1)(A) because FBS' acquisition of indirect ownership of Boulevard Bank constituted a sale of Boulevard Bank and an assignment of its advisory contract with FAMF within the meaning of section 15(f). 12. Although FAMF's Board of Trustees currently meets the 75% requirement of section 15(f)(1)(A), upon completion of the Reorganizations FAIF's board of directors will not because two of its six directors will be deemed ``interested persons'' of the Adviser under section 2(a)(19). Thus, unless exemptive relief from section 15(f)(1)(A) is granted, the Reorganizations cannot be completed within the ``safe harbor'' of section 15(f) unless the Board of Directors of FAIF is reconstituted by either adding two disinterested directors or by securing the resignation of one interested director. Neither of these actions is believed by applicants to be in the best interests of FAIF shareholders or necessary for the protection of FAMF shareholders. 13. Section 15(f)(3) of the Act provides that if an assignment of an investment advisory contract with a registered investment company results in a successor investment adviser to such company and such adviser is then an investment adviser with respect to other assets substantially greater in amount than the amount of assets of such company, such discrepancy in size of assets shall be considered by the Commission in determining whether or to what extent an application for exemption from the provisions of section 15(f)(1)(A) should be granted. 14. As of June 13, 1994, FAMF had total net assets of approximately $129 million, while FAIF had total net assets of approximately $979 million. Applicants submit that this substantial disparity in assets should be taken into account under section 15(f)(3) in determining whether to grant exemptive relief. Applicants believe that it is appropriate to compare the overall size of FAIF to that of FAMF, because the question is whether the Board that is responsible for all series of FAIF (and not just for the Acquiring Funds) is to be reconstituted. Applicants further submit that the requested relief from section 15(f)(1)(A) is necessary and appropriate in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors, and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the Act, as required by section 6(c). For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
