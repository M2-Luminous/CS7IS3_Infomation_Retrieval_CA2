FR940104-0-00071 FR940104-0-00016 A student who accepts a Direct Loan completes a promissory note and returns it to the school; the school may not disburse Direct Loan funds without a completed promissory note. An originating school in the Direct Loan Program requests and obtains loan funds from the Secretary using a process similar to the process for drawing down funds for other Department of Education (ED) programs. The Secretary adopted this process to ease the burden on schools participating in the Direct Loan Program. The Direct Loan Program system, however, differs from the systems used for other ED programs in two ways. First, a school transmits to ED a specific Direct Loan funding request that is separate from its funding requests for other programs. Direct Loan capital must be tracked separately and cannot be used for purposes other than making Direct Loans. The actual transmission request and subsequent electronic transfer of funds uses the same delivery process as is used for the Federal Pell Grant Program. After a request for funds is received, the Secretary uses the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) process through the Federal Reserve Banking system to deposit funds in a school's designated bank account. Currently, this process takes between 48 to 72 hours from the school's request for funds until the school's receipt of funds. The second difference between the Direct Loan Program system and the system used for other ED programs is that the amount of loan capital needed by the school is dependent on the eligibility of student and parent borrowers at the school. Funds for the Direct Loan Program are not limited by Congressional appropriations. As a result, there is no need for a maximum funding level to be authorized for a school in the Direct Loan Program. The Direct Loan system, however, incorporates internal fund controls to monitor school drawdown requests; these controls will flag any requests that appear excessive. The system also identifies schools that have failed to comply with program requirements. These flags result in immediate inquiry and intervention by the Secretary. The software provided by the Secretary computes gross disbursements, loan fees, and net disbursements on the basis of the loan amounts entered by the school. A school requests the amount needed to fund net disbursements to borrowers. The Secretary expects that schools will follow the guidelines for cash management set out in The Blue Book, which is the manual of accounting, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for postsecondary educational institutions under the federally-funded student financial aid programs. This notice requires any interest earned on funds drawn down to be returned to the Secretary. For future years, the Secretary anticipates that issues related to fiscal control and final accountability will be addressed in more detail in negotiated rulemaking. After receiving funds from the Secretary, a school disburses funds to students by crediting their accounts at the school or by sending checks to the students. Before a school may disburse funds to a borrower, the school must ensure that it has a completed and signed promissory note. After the first disbursement is made, the school must record the actual disbursed amount and the date of each disbursement in the loan-origination record and transmit all completed loan records and promissory notes to the Secretary. The school transmits subsequent disbursement data to the Secretary as the disbursements occur. A school is required to reconcile cash and individual loan records monthly. To reconcile cash, a school must provide documentation that the total disbursement minus cancellations, plus return of excess cash, is equal to the amount of money the school has drawn down during a one-month period by the end of the next month. For example, loan records and promissory notes for all disbursements and cancellations made in July 1994 must be transmitted to the Secretary by the end of August 1994. To reconcile loan records, a school's records must match the records of the Direct Loan Program Servicer. The software that is provided to participating schools is designed to assist schools in this reconciliation process. B. Schools That Use an Alternative Originator Schools that use an alternative originator transmit to the Direct Loan Program Servicer the data necessary for the Direct Loan Program Servicer to generate the combined promissory note/disclosure statement unless the school chooses to print the promissory note/disclosure statement on its premises. After the Direct Loan Program Servicer generates the promissory note/disclosure statement, it is sent to the school or to the borrower depending upon the school's established procedures. The borrower must complete the promissory note/disclosure statement and forward it as instructed to the Direct Loan Program Servicer or to the school. The Direct Loan Program Servicer must review the promissory note/disclosure statement before funds can be disbursed. If the Direct Loan Program Servicer or the school determines that the promissory note/disclosure statement is not accurate or complete, the promissory note/disclosure statement must be correct and complete before funds can be disbursed. The Direct Loan Program Servicer initiates drawdown of funds to the school based on the completed promissory note/disclosure statement. The school also receives a roster from the Direct Loan Program Servicer identifying each borrower, the disbursement date and amount to be disbursed for each borrower, and the total amount of funds received by the school. Schools that use alternative origination are still responsible for reporting actual disbursement data, reconciling cash, and returning funds that are not used or for which the borrower is not eligible.
