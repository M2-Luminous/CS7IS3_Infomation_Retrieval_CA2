The annual turnout was put at 10 million in recent years, represented only 50 percent of production. -- Personal computers: These are produced by 30 enterprises across the country with a mere four of them being big in scale. The current turnout in this business sector is put at 150,000 computers. An increase of 250,000 was seen during the Eighth Five Year Plan period, a gain capable of meeting the market needs. -- Colour TV tubes and screens: Production of colour TV tubes registered 7.5 million in 1990 and will rise to 12.9 million during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period. Some export-oriented enterprises can produce 4.1 million colour TV tubes. The turnout of television screens was 5.26 million pieces in 1990 and this increased to 19.08 million during the Eighth Five Year Plan period. Meanwhile, export- oriented enterprises were capable of turning out 4.45 million screens. -- Videotape recorders: Production of this item is three million while production of components and spare parts and certain supplementary devices for the recorder has also been arranged in the country. -- Magnetic tubes for microwave ovens: There are now five enterprises specializing in the production of these tubes with an annual turnout of between 2.4 million and 2.5 million, sufficient for meeting domestic and foreign demand. -- Television cameras: There are so many enterprises applying for production of this item, resulting in a heavy input of high technology and capital. -- Digital programme-controlled switchboards: Production of this item is now increasing and the state will select certain production entities for renovation in order to meet the market demand. -- Laser discs, karaoke machines, mobile communications sets, facsimile machines and optical fibre communications items: There are so many enterprises now producing these items which involve a heavy input of technology and investment and the market is yet to be developed. -- Transport vehicles for agriculture: As this item is in strong demand, many plants are tending to produce them. Incomplete statistics indicate that there are now 80 enterprises in this sector across the country with an annual turnout of between 130,000 and 150,000. A mere three big-sized enterprises are capable of turning out over 10,000 vehicles a year while 75 percent of all such enterprises have a turnout of not more than 1,000 each a year. Production of such kinds of vehicles should be reserved for big- sized plants in a bid to improve product quality.
