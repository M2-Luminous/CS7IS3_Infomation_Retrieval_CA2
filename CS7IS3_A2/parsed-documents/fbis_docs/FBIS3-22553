Sixty patients have been released, but two remain at the hospital. Yesterday, the deputy minister of health care, Dr. Lyubomir Kumanov; a national consultant on infectious and tropical diseases, Professor Petur Petrov; and representatives of NIZPB [Scientific and Eductional Institute of Communicable and Parasitic Diseases], the hospital for infectious diseases, and the KhEI [Hygiene-Epidemiological Inspectorate] in Pernik, met to consider the origin of the trichinosis infection in "Stomana."
