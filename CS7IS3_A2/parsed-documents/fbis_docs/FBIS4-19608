All through last year there reportedly were 36 such accidents. To put it quite simply, what prevents the final closing down of this reactor? [Meyer] Certainly the energy situation in Ukraine. In 1991 the Ukrainian Parliament decided to close down the two reactors that are still in operation in Chernobyl by the end of 1993, that is, by the end of last year. Because of the bad energy situation, the bad situation regarding electricity supply, it was then decided not to do that. Since 1991 nothing has been done in connection with the reactors, they have not been improved, even though this is being done for all other reactors, including those in the former East Bloc. These reactors have been left as they were and are still in operation. Of course, they are in a dismal state. [Renschke] More than one-third of the power in Ukraine reportedly comes from this nuclear power plant. On the other hand, there is the opinion of the environmental organization Greenpeace, for instance, which reportedly has proven in a study that Chernobyl can be closed down immediately without hurting the country's power supply -- is this an argument that you do not want to agree with? [Meyer] First of all, I must correct two things. [Renschke] Please, do. [Meyer] First, it is not one-third of the power that comes from Chernobyl, but power from the 14 nuclear power plants that are in operation in Ukraine -- only two of which are of the Chernobyl type, which is RBMK reactors -- amounted to 32.9 percent of the power, which is one-third, produced last year. Second, the 8,000 dead because of the Chernobyl disaster did not die directly in the disaster but were the so-called liquidators, who built the sarcophagus. The number of deaths resulting directly from the disaster was 32. [Renschke] Back to the problem of energy supply and safety defects. You have mentioned the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament. During a recent visit your organization also found safety defects. May the decision of a parliament be the last word in such a case? [Meyer] Look, the parliament is the representative of the people, and internationally the situation is such -- and this is the problem of the United Nations everywhere, and we are a special organization of the United Nations -- that each people is responsible for its own policy. Of course, there are many interconnections at the international level, and one cannot see Chernobyl purely from the Ukrainian point of view. This is the reason why we have invited this delegation to Vienna so that they can talk with delegations of 13 other member states and with international organizations. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister will come, and we will try to have them implement the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament of 1991, namely to close down these two reactors, which would be best. Otherwise, one possibility would be to discuss what can be done if they really keep these two reactors in operation. [Renschke] What can you actually achieve at this special conference, in view of this situation? [Meyer] Specifically, we can make it clear what our experts found. This week we have another team of experts in Chernobyl, who are reexamining and analyzing all the accidents that you mentioned before to find out why they happened. During our last visit in March we clearly found several particularly severe defects -- deficient fire protection; above all, deficient radiation protection in the facility; a lack of spare parts; then, above all, the difficult situation of employment. This year alone 13 highly qualified people have left Chernobyl. Last year a far higher number of them left. Twenty percent of the good staff has left. This situation must be pointed out again -- and this is the purpose of this conference today and tomorrow. Some of the things can be improved relatively easily. However, as I said before, the issue also is to find out whether the facilities cannot be closed down once and for all. [Renschke] Incurring the danger that you will correct me again, is it justified to deal only with Chernobyl at this conference since there are nuclear reactors of this type and in this condition not only in Ukraine but also outside? [Meyer] I did not want to correct you again, Mr. Renschke. It is certainly good that -- and this is what we are doing -- one is dealing with all East European reactors. We have programs for all reactors. However, in this case it is necessary to act right now because these two reactors in Chernobyl that are in operation are in such bad condition. At this conference we will concentrate on these two reactors. There is no point in acting globally at the moment. We are doing that anyway. Here we want to bring about quite specific improvements or the closing down of these reactors. [Renschke] Does the West, which has often promised to help, actually do enough? [Meyer] This is a difficult question to a representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In one sentence, I would say the West could do much more. However, there is the question of how much it wants to do. [Renschke] Put in one, two, or even three sentences, Mr. Meyer, what will be the result of the special conference? [Meyer] One cannot predict that at the moment. We really have to wait until tomorrow noon. As I said before, 30 percent of the power is produced by 14 reactors, and, since we are now moving toward summer, I assume that there would be a possibility to close down these two reactors. However, there is the danger that, if the Ukrainians cannot promise that the reactors will be closed down permanently, the reactors will be left idle during summer, nothing will be done, and then in winter, when power is needed urgently -- and last winter they really needed power urgently -- the two reactors will be put into operation again without having undergone any repair work. This is a far greater danger. [Renschke] Do those who are responsible for the matter in Ukraine play down the issue? [Meyer] I cannot say that at the moment. We are waiting for what they are going to say now, how they will behave at this meeting. They come with a very high-ranking delegation. Deputy Prime Minister Shmarov will come and so will the deputy energy minister. Thus, we hope that they clearly see the situation and realize what must be done.
