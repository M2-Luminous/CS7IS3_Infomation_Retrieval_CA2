The conference was attended by well known Russian politicians. A SEM DNEY correspondent attended a meeting with Russian State Duma Representative Anatoliy Lukyanov, member of the Russian Federation Communist Party Central Committee Presidium. Anatoliy Ivanovich described the current situation in Russia as the result of a "the three-year policy of wrecking the foundations of people's life." To confirm this, he provided the following figures. Decline in production, compared with the last year, amounts to 51 percent (27 percent during the first five months of this year). About 5,500 Russian enterprises have been brought to a standstill, around 400 companies stop working every month. Twenty percent of society lives below the poverty level, the same amount -- on the verge of poverty. Meanwhile, 0.3 percent (586 families) of people are billionaires in terms of rubles, including Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The crime rate has increased by 2.5 times, according to official data. Moreover, the current state leadership is blamed for allowing the pilferage of public property (which is currently governed by the criminal capital), the disruption of economic ties, and the subordination of foreign policy to nondomestic interests. Anatoliy Lukyanov also responded to some questions. We present a few of his answers. [Bakhir] Is Belarus' joining the ruble zone really so burdensome to Russia? [Lukyanov] This, in my opinion, is a concoction of people who do not want real unification. No ruble zone will diminish the loss caused by our disunion. [Bakhir] How do you see the mechanism for cooperation among Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, etc.? [Lukyanov] I see it as a massive pressure on the authorities, though within the law. In particular, this is the establishment of a union of 19 communist parties, the "Accord in the Name of Russia" movement, development of a concept to restore the Soviet Union, and the September Congress of USSR Nations, which should be linked to the establishment of cells to support the union. In particular, a special debate in the State Duma was devoted to relations with Belarus. The conclusion was unequivocal. The majority believes that our rapprochement is necessary by any means. [Bakhir] Can one presume that the tide of stormy events (the State Committee for Emergency Situation [GKChP], the October events) came to nothing? [Lukyanov] If the tide had succumbed, there would not have been political amnesty. The cause of the GKChP is being continued; the trial of Varennikov has just begun. Each one of us is interested in defending our comrade, and we intend to reveal what we have not been able to reveal before. Now, it is completely clear that there was no coup, no blockade of Gorbachev's dacha, and so on. Regarding the October events, I think that was the authorities' greatest provocation. The defenders of the Constitution simply lacked political restraint. [Bakhir] Do you not think that the main reason behind these events was the rejection of a class analysis of the situation? [Lukyanov] A class analysis is now more important than ever before. The Russian Communist Party has not abandoned it. There are people, however, who believe that forceful methods should be applied now, based on class positions. But, there is no revolutionary situation... I sometimes have the impression that this is the age-old disease of "leftism" among communists. [Bakhir] What do you think is the weakness of the patriotic (communist) movements in the republics? [Lukyanov] It is their disunity, the ambitions of leaders, the lack of a real revolutionary situation, and speculations with patriotic movements by such populist activists as Zhirinovskiy....
