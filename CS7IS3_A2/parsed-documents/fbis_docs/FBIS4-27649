Alcanzo] [Text] The country's outstanding foreign debt as of December last year reached $34.282 billion, up 10.82 percent from the $30.934 billion recorded during the corresponding period in 1992. On a monthly basis, this represented a slight 1.47 percent increment from $33.787 billion in November last year. Official records from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) [Central Bank of the Philippines] show 85.31 percent of total foreign debt were classified as medium-and long-term obligations, which rose 14 percent from $25.678 billion in the same period in 1992. On the other hand, short-term loans comprised the remaining 14.69 percent, which amounted to $5.035 billion. By types of borrower, the public sector received the biggest chunk of foreign loans. This was placed at $27.177 billion, taking in a 79.28 percent share of aggregate loans. The private sector was granted $5.817 billion, allotted between corporate and financial firms. Corporate firms received a bigger share of $5.296 billion while financial firms cornered the rest. Meanwhile, the BSP got a measly 3.76 percent or $1.288 billion of total borrowings. BILATERAL CREDITORS Bilateral creditors extended the biggest amount, which stood at $13.369 billion or 39 percent of total loans. This represented an 18 percent hike from the $11.328 billion lendings in the comparable period in 1992. All loans granted by bilateral creditors have beyond one year maturity. Among bilateral creditors, the country remains to be heavily indebted to Japan which granted medium-and long-term loans amounting to $7.577 billion. The United States came in next providing $684 million while Germany lent out $489 million as of the period in review. Roughly 23 percent of aggregate foreign exchange liabilities were extended by multilateral creditors. As in the preceding months, the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development furnished the largest amount at $3.936 billion. It was followed by the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which shelled out $2.3 billion and $1.312 billion, respectively. WORLD BANK In a related development, the World Bank has lined up 12 more projects for the next three years. These projects offer an aggregate financing cost of $2.585 billion which is $853 million more than the "shopping list" presented by the Philippine Government. These include agriculture support services, power transmission, and AIDS emergency projects which are all set for next year. For 1996, the following will be eyed: Central Visayas regional project; and power distribution, capital market development and urban water supply projects. Meanwhile, by the year 1997, rural regional development, private investment credit, water distribution, urban sanitation and provincial road projects are expected to be put up. It may be recalled a few weeks earlier, Senator Blas Ople urged the National Economic and Development Authority to undertake a full accounting of foreign loans that flow into 16,000 nongovernment organizations (NGOs) amid reports that human rights groups in Europe have been subsidizing communist insurgency in the country. He advocated the use of caution in giving direct aid to local NGOs.
