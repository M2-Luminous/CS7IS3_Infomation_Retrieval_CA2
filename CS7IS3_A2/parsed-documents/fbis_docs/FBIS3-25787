In the new year, comrades on the propaganda and ideological front subject themselves to and serve the overall needs of "seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, promoting economic development, and maintaining social stability." They must provide correct guidance for public opinion; take a clear-cut stand in support of reform; have a good understanding of and publicize the party's principles and policies; and make full, correct, and timely reports on economic development as a whole. The principle of doing solid work, telling the truth, bringing the initiative of the masses into full play, and achieving actual gains should be carried out to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. They should regard it as their duty to maintain social stability and help solve any ideological and perceptual problems which might arise in the course of reform by providing clear and timely explanations. First, Zhu Rongji fully affirmed the tremendous progress comrades on the propaganda and ideological front have achieved over the years in serving reform, opening up, and the modernization drive while under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line. He urged them to continue playing a still greater role in reform and development. Zhu Rongji briefed the conference on China's economic situation in 1993. He said: The year 1993 saw China implement in an all-round manner the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and march triumphantly along the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics charted by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Over the past year, industrial development has increased its pace; economic returns of enterprises have improved; new progress has been made in the development of the rural economy; and production of grains and edible oil has reached new highs. We have increased efforts and greatly accelerated construction of key projects; the consumer goods market has been brisk; and the people's standard of living has risen continuously. In connection with the conspicuous contradictions and problems which have arisen in the first half of 1993 as a result of rapid economic growth, the Central Committee took the resolute step of strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control, thus swiftly halting the tendency of over extension of credit, over supply of currency, and the rapid drop in the exchange rate of the Renminbi. Consequently, order in the banking and circulation sectors has improved markedly. The policy of macroeconomic regulation and control has yielded positive results. Zhu Rongji said: Now is the most opportune time for deepening reform. First, the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics has struck root in the hearts of the people after a decade or so of reform. Following the publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches in 1992 and the triumphant convocation of the 14th CPC National Congress, our party, has broken the ideological bonds of whether our reform is capitalist or socialist by clearly defining the goals of socialist market economic reforms, thereby emancipating our minds and making it possible for us to be free of fear and restraint in formulating a fairly forward-looking and stable reform program to tackle the salient economic problems facing us today by following the general law of market economy, drawing on the successful experience of developed countries, and proceeding from the realities of China. Second, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have accumulated a wealth of experience in reform in the past decade or so. In implementing reform, we have gone through many difficulties, have experienced success as well setbacks, and have learned some lessons. The current reform program -- its principles and framework have been studied for years -- embodies the experience of many years of practice. A majority consensus has emerged in theoretical circles after repeated discussion and analysis. Third, after the publication of the important speeches made by Comrade Xiaoping in 1992, the momentum of China's economic development has been very good. Political and business circles abroad are unanimous in their optimism about China's economic development, and foreign capital has been flowing into China at a rate never before seen. In regard to problems which occurred on the way forward, the Central Committee has taken a range of measures aimed at strengthening and improving macro-economic regulation and control to tackle them. These measures have yielded positive results, and we have gained more experience in how to promptly and appropriately deal with expected problems in the course of implementing reforms. By pooling the wisdom of the entire membership, the party at the Third Plenary Session of its 14th CPC Central Committee worked out a basic framework of socialist market economy, thus laying the ideological foundation for implementing the current reform policies. Zhu Rongji stressed: The current rare historical opportunities should be firmly seized and highly valued in order to firmly advance the reforms we deliberated and wanted to implement for years but could not because conditions were not correct. If we fail to seize this opportunity to overcome the numerous difficulties in structural reform, then we will not be able to maintain sustained, rapid, and sound economic development and will not able to accomplish the second-step strategic objective of national socioeconomic development. Zhu Rongji added: The preparatory work for the reform program for this year is quite adequate. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, the reform program was worked out by two task forces composed of talents and backbone personnel from various sectors who had conducted long, careful, and painstaking research and who have canvassed the views of all quarters. We have taken into full account the formidable difficulty and complexity which the current reform entails. It goes without saying that no pre-designed reform program is perfect; all we can do is constantly put it into practice, constantly sum up experience, and constantly make readjustments in the course of reform. As Comrade Xiaoping said: "The entire party and the nation must be told that it is a hard task. There are no perfect policies or methods. Facing us will be new situations and problems; we have to create experience on our own." "This requires us to be bold yet careful in every step we take, to sum up experience in a timely fashion, make readjustments as problems arise, and adapt according to the actual conditions." So long as we act according to the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's speeches, we will certainly be able to make reform a success. Zhu Rongji pointed out: Currently, the main risk does not lie in reform itself, but in the overexpansion of investment in fixed assets which has gone beyond the capacity of the nation to build on the investment. The agricultural problem remains outstanding. Some comrades are keen on launching new projects; on expanding the scale of construction; and on vying with one another in chalking up faster growth rates, in displaying wealth, and in creating high consumption. However, they are not interested in improving economic returns, in practicing economics, in moving from the red ink into the black, and in improving management. They are not keen about promoting agriculture, improving the vegetable supply, developing the market, keeping prices under control, or taking care of the well-being of the broad masses. This situation must be changed. Zhu Rongji said: Reform and development in 1994 entails heavy work. The people are concerned about it, and the world is looking at us. Whether or not we can effectively carry out this key battle of reform is a rigorous test. We must show great determination in decreasing the scale of investment in fixed assets, and must continue stabilizing and developing the rural economy. Comrade Xiaoping said in 1988: "For reform to succeed, it must be carried out under organized leadership and in a measured manner, otherwise everyone will go his own way and there will be chaos. What a terrible thing that would be!." "If the CPC Central Committee and State Council do not have authority, then the situation will be out of control. " "Macro-control must be based on what the central committee says will hold." Leading comrades at all levels and all party members must further unify their understanding, march in unison, work vigorously, and help each other to make the country prosperous. Party committees and governments at all levels must pay still more attention to reform, and principal leading cadres must stand in the forefront of carrying out the reform program. In conclusion, Zhu Rongji said: We are convinced that under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, we will successfully implement the decision adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the reform program formulated at the Central Economic Work Conference through the common efforts of the entire party and whole nation, and will achieve still greater advances in economic development this year. Leading comrades present at the conference were Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, and Ren Jianxin. Ding Guangen presided over the conference.
