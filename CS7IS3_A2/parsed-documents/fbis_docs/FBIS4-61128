The picketers demanded the authorities to grant a permanent resident's status to everybody who has the Estonian resident's status stamp in their Soviet passports from earlier than July 1990, said Nikolai Klotschkov, editor in chief of Sillamae's local newspaper. Other demands included amendments to the pension law, determining of the cost of living index, and increasing the pensions of retired workers of the nuclear industry -- the leading branch for decades under the Soviet rule in the once closed-for-outsiders military plant town of Sillamae. The roadside picket, organized by local pensioners unions, was called by the activists a "Baltic Chain", referring to the 23 Aug 1989, event under the same name. In 1989, Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians linked their hands in a chain extending from Tallinn to Vilnuis to demand from the then Soviet leadership official denouncement of the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.
