Meanwhile, surveys taken by several La Paz radio stations regarding the social situation indicate that most urban residents are asking for a state of siege "once and for all." Lupe Cajis, the president of the La Paz Journalist Association, told DPA that "the people are clamoring for a state of siege." People called the radio stations to decry the acts of vandalism by the demonstrators, who -- according to the radio stations' listeners -- loot and destroy everything in their path as they flee from the police tear gas. The authorities used tear gas today to disperse several attempts by the workers to gather at different points of La Paz. "We are virtually living under a state of siege, the only thing missing is an official declaration," a top opposition leader said. The state of emergency measure was expected tonight, but the government of Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada decided at the last moment not to implement it. Incidents of abuse by the men in uniform against civilians not participating in the demonstrations have been reported. Soldiers and policemen were deployed in Bolivian cities in the early morning hours to prevent workers rallies and demonstrations. The Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) has been on an indefinite general strike since 15 April demanding a wage increase above the 8 percent included in the general budget approved last week. Several observers agree that the moderate COB leaders have been overrun by extremists.
