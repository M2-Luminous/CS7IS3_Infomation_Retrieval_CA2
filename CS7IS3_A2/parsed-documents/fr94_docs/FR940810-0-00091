FR940810-0-00091 FR940810-0-00021 OSHA believes these decisions are well supported by this rulemaking record. Many participants urged OSHA to expand the conditions for permitting glove bag use. For example the Dow Chemical Company stated, ``removal of asbestos containing material from pipes or pipelines can best be accomplished with the use of glove bags in all instances, not just when pipes are elevated. Needless to say, the employees carrying out the operation must be trained and adequately supervised to the glove bags properly.'' (Ex. 7&hyph;103). The American Paper Institute and the National Forest Products Association stated that ``(w)e fully agree with the field personnel that there should be no linear footage limit for the removal of asbestos insulation on pipe when proper glove bag techniques are used'' (Ex. 7&hyph;74 at 9). The National Insulation and Abatement Contractors Association commented ``(a) skilled asbestos abatement mechanic can certainly remove in excess of 21 linear feet in properly used glove bags in as safe a manner as he or she can less than 21 feet.␣*␣*␣*␣(i)n addition, the implied restriction against glove bag use outside of small-scale, short-duration work ignores the advances made in glove bag practices and worker skills'' (Ex 7&hyph;72 at 2). Mr. Vest of the U.S. Air Force commented: ``(t)he regulation should clearly allow for *␣*␣* operations that are not small-scale, short duration but are also not within the purview of the full requirements for a regulated area. We believe multiple glove bag operations would fall into this category; this in-between category should require training and additional procedures, but not necessarily ``negative pressure enclosures.'' James Snyder, representing the American Paper Institute, maintained that there should be no linear limit as long as proper glove bag techniques were used (Ex. 7&hyph;74). Exhibits 7&hyph;9, 7&hyph;19, 7&hyph;21, 7&hyph;26, 7&hyph;32, 7&hyph;33, 7&hyph;50, 7&hyph;63, 7&hyph;72, 7&hyph;73, 7&hyph;74, 7&hyph;76, 7&hyph;95, 7&hyph;99, 7&hyph;102, 7&hyph;103, 7&hyph;106, 7&hyph;107, 7&hyph;120, 7&hyph;121, 7&hyph;125, 7&hyph;128, 7&hyph;130, 7&hyph;139, 7&hyph;144, and 7&hyph;146 also supported expanded glove bag use. In addition, to these generalized statements of support for expanded use of glove bags, participants submitted data to show the effectiveness of glove bags in protecting workers. For example, the U.S. Air Force, introduced data (Ex. 3&hyph;9). The large majority of measurement were below 0.1 f/cc. Only 54 of the 370 measurements sets were over 0.1 f/cc, some of which were within the sampling and analytical error margin of 25%. Dr. Vernon Rose of the University of Alabama at Birmingham submitted a paper entitled: ``Analysis of PCM asbestos air monitoring results for a major abatement project'' (Ex. 7&hyph;194), in which over 2000 sampling results were presented, taken over a five year period during which thermal system insulation was removed from a single building. This study provides very extensive data on closely observed work which the authors described as ``*␣*␣*␣ideal conditions existed to support the proper abatement of ACM'' (Ex. 7&hyph;194). However, they also noted that the environment was generally quite dusty and that since the results were PCM counts, they might overestimate the true exposure level. The results are summarized Table I.

In OSHA's view, the large amount of data contained in this study demonstrating that exposure levels at the glove bag consistently were well below the PEL of 0.1 f/cc supports the effectiveness of glove bags in protecting the asbestos worker. Additional data were submitted by Grayling Industries and Control Resource Systems, Inc., glove bag manufacturers (Ex. 7&hyph;144). Personal breathing zone measurements representing varied removals are almost all below OSHA's proposed PEL of 0.1 f/cc. After the hearing, Grayling submitted letters from some of the contractors and organizations in charge of the projects for which data was submitted, which detailed the procedures followed by employees during the jobs where low exposure levels were recorded. (Ex. 111). These conditions correspond to the specifications and work practices which OSHA is requiring in this standard for glove bag use. Virtually all of the participants who opposed expanded use of glove bags for removal jobs, cited the NIOSH study referred to above. (See e.g. Ex. 143 at 98&hyph;100). The study was conducted jointly by NIOSH and EPA in 1985, and its results were made public, as a Health Hazard Evaluation (Exs. 1&hyph;1, 1&hyph;2, 1&hyph;20). It has also formed the basis for NIOSH's institutional position on glove bags published as ``An Evaluation Glove Bag Containment in Asbestos Removal'' in October 1990. (submitted post-hearing as Ex. 125). Based on the data and analysis in that document, NIOSH's spokesperson, Richard Lemen testified at the rulemaking hearing:
