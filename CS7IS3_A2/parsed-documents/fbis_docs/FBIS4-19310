Shevardnadze in Vienna"] [Text] The Republic of Georgia is apparently making adventurous efforts to raise money on the free Western capital market. In Vienna, a court has temporarily seized copies of Georgian Government bonds and securities, documents signed by President Eduard Shevardnadze. The total value of the sum guaranteed by Tbilisi is the equivalent of nearly 72 billion schillings! A Vienna businessman tried to convert these bonds into money. As a result of this, he was imprisoned for a few days. The 54-year-old Heinz J. was arrested on 12 April on suspicion of fraud and forgery at a hotel in Vienna's 15th district when he tried to sell Georgian securities to an interested person. Securities of a nominal value of $10 million each (120 million schillings) were involved. The government bonds were offered at half or one-third of this price. Buyers were promised repayment of the nominal value in a few years' time. The Vienna businessman got involved in the capital procurement operation through other agents and wanted to participate in the profit. J. is not unknown to the finance police. About two years ago, on 9 April 1992, he was arrested in Vienna on suspicion of participating in a fraud involving millions of schillings. At the time, he described himself as an expert on deals with the East, reported enthusiastically about profits from coffee and cigarette deals, and persuaded several people to participate. Yet these megadeals turned out to be failures, and the damage amounted to about 2 million schillings. Heinz J. was released from prison a few days later. He then fled to Florida, where he has a second residence in Boca Raton near Miami. His lawyer at the time, Herbert Eichenseder, was successful in obtaining the rescindment of the international arrest warrant. J. returned to Austria and has largely paid off the damages. However, he will still be facing charges of fraud at the provincial court in Vienna in June. Klothilde Eckbrecht will be the judge. This new affair also "smells" of fraud. Officials from Vienna police headquarters even suspect organized crime behind the planned deal involving billions of schillings. The fact that a Vienna businessman who had previously come under the suspicion of fraud was trying to sell Georgian Government bonds worth 72 billion schillings was not exactly credible. J. claimed that the documents were copies of real securities. The originals were to be handed over to the buyer after the money transfer. The criminal police submitted the documents to the Georgian Embassy in Vienna for examination. On Friday [15 April] the answer from Tbilisi arrived: The documents are authentic, and so is Shevardnadze's signature. The judge responsible who until recently had been carrying out the investigations on the suspicion of fraud (punishment one to 10 years) ordered J.'s release from prison on Friday. The question remains whether the Vienna businessman will be continuing to raise money for Georgia.
