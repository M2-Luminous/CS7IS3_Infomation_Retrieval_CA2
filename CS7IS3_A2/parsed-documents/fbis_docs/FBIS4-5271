He is believed to have changed his comments on Japan out of concern that if his criticism of Japan spurs further appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar, this may result in higher interest rates and lower stock prices in the United States at a time when fears are rising of a crash on the New York Stock Exchange. In his lecture to a gathering of medium and small businesses on 5 April, Mr. Kantor only cited the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks as an example of U.S. efforts to open foreign markets. In his lecture he did not mention the "closed nature of the Japanese market," a term that he has frequently used. Foreign investors rushed to U.S. stock markets in search of profits from a rise in stock prices after interest rates were lowered last autumn in the United States, but they recently began suffering losses in their stock holdings in the wake of a recent rebound in interest rates and a plunge in stock prices. If the yen appreciates further against the U.S. dollar in this situation, foreign investors would suffer another loss from the fluctuation of the exchange rate between the yen and dollar. A major Japanese securities firm says, "Under the present situation, we want to pull out of U.S. stock markets after selling off our stock holdings even if we risk losses." The U.S. Government is conspicuously jittery about the rise in interest rates and the plunge in stock prices. Robert Rubin, chairman of the National Economic Council (NEC), appearing on television on 3 April; Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; and President Clinton, speaking on television on 4 April, appealed to investors to respond calmly to plunging stock prices. Mr. Kantor appears to be "taciturn" about Japan as a result. If the present situation continues, the U.S. Government will be pressed to alter its strategy toward Japan that aims at using the Super 301 provision to apply pressure on Japan. It has been said within the U.S. Government that the "United States should pursue closer policy coordination with Japan and European nations to keep the rise in long-term interest rates in check, and curb further plunges in stock prices." Hence, there is a possibility that the low stock prices and the high interest rates in the United States will be taken up as an agenda item for discussion at the talks of G-7 financial ministers and central bank governors scheduled to be held in late April.
