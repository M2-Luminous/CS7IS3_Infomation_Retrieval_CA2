During a meeting with Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, who paid a brief visit to the Kingdom Thursday [12 May], the King expressed concern with maintaining the unity of Yemen and ending the bloodshed between forces loyal to South Yemeni leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid and Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. Mr. Basindwah, who is on a tour of Arab countries to inform them of the developments in the Yemeni conflict, left Jordan for Damascus after delivering to King Husayn a verbal message from Mr. Salih. In an arrival statement carried by the Jordan News Agency, Petra, Mr. Basindwah praised the role Jordan played in trying to mediate the crisis between former socialist South Yemen and the Conservative North before the political crisis there erupted into full-fledged civil war earlier this month. "Jordan entered the Yemeni history" when in February it hosted the signing of a reconciliation agreement between Mr. Salih and Mr. al-Bid, said Mr. Basindwah. He also thanked the Kingdom for treating some of the wounded in the war, which has claimed thousands of casualties since it started 11 days ago. Jordan has also sent a medical team to help treat war victims. After the war erupted, North Yemen rejected any foreign mediation effort, insisting on a military settlement of the conflict, but indicated it would accept a negotiated settlement to the crisis after it had become clear that it will not be able to achieve a military victory. An Arab League delegation was on its way to Sanaa in a bid to end the conflict but Mr. Basindwah said the league did not offer mediation. its delegation would only "review developments in the situation in Yemen," he said. Prime Minister Abd al-Salam al-Majali has said that Jordan would not mediate in the conflict unless both parties to it agree on the Kingdom's role, adding that Jordan would not "interfere in support of either parties to the crisis." Dr. al-Majali said King Husayn had telephoned both Mr. al-Bid and Mr. Salih in a bid to end the fighting but North Yemen sees any foreign intervention as meddling in its internal affairs. Jordan has evacuated over 750 Jordanians from Yemen on board military aircraft, and Royal Jordanian (RJ) airliners. RJ has halted its flights to the country, which observers say would be dragged into a protracted civil war unless a negotiated settlement is found.
