FR940303-2-00050 FR940303-2-00036 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [FRL&hyph;4845&hyph;2] Acid Rain Program: Allowance Tracking System AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of opening for business of the Allowance Tracking System. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency is announcing the commencement of operation of the Allowance Tracking System (ATS) on March 14, 1994. As of that date, EPA will record transfers of allowances between accounts in the ATS. Subpart C of 40 CFR part 73 directs EPA to establish an allowance tracking system for the allocation, transfer, and use of SO 2 emissions allowances, as required by section 403(b) of the Clean Air Act. Section 403(b) specifically provides that allowance transfers are not effective, for purposes of compliance with the allowance holding requirements of the Acid Rain Program, until EPA receives and records a written certification of the transfer signed by a responsible official of each party to the transfer (e.g., a completed Allowance Transfer form). Subpart D of 40 CFR part 73 establishes the procedure by which EPA will record transfers of allowances to and from accounts established within the ATS. An ATS unit account has been established for each utility unit that was allocated allowances under 40 CFR 73.10 (58 FR 15634, March 23, 1993) and general accounts have been established for those who have submitted an Allowance Account Information form. Allowances allocated to each unit as well as any allowances that were purchased at the 1993 EPA allowance auctions have been assigned unique serial numbers and placed in the appropriate unit and general accounts. ATS does not currently contain any additional allowances to which a utility may be entitled, such as those associated with Phase I compliance plans, the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve, Early Reduction Credits, and Phase I Extension. These additional allowances will be placed in the appropriate ATS accounts later this year, when the next version of ATS is completed. All information in the ATS is publicly available. To receive instructions on how to place an information request, call the Acid Rain Hotline at the phone number listed below. ADDRESSES: Any correspondence in this matter shall be sent to: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Acid Rain Division (6204J), Attn: Allowance Tracking System, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Janice K. Wagner, Chief, Allowance Market Section, Acid Rain Division, (202) 233&hyph;9170 or by mail at the address above. To obtain written materials describing ATS or any of the forms mentioned above, call the Acid Rain Hotline at (202) 233&hyph;9620 and leave a message in the allowance system voice mailbox. Dated: February 24, 1994. Janice K. Wagner, Acting Director, Acid Rain Division, Office of Air and Radiation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4924 Filed 3&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
