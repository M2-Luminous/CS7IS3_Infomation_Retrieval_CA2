FBIS4-2128 "drchi066_s_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-066 Daily Report 19 Dec 1993 Northeast Region Heilongjiang Secretary's CPC Plenum Report Heilongjiang Secretary's CPC Plenum Report Harbin HEILONGJIANG RIBAO in Chinese 19 Dec 93 pp 1-2 Harbin HEILONGJIANG RIBAO Chinese BFN [Report by Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee, at the second enlarged plenary session of the seventh provincial party committee on 16 December: "Profoundly Implement the Guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and Rapidly Set Up the Socialist Market Economic System"] [Text] Since the beginning of this year, party organizations at all levels in the province have guided the vast numbers of cadres and masses to implement conscientiously the guidelines of the important speeches made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his south China trip and the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress, to execute firmly the party's basic line, and to promote positively reform and opening up as well as the work in various fields around the central task of economic construction, thus overcoming all sorts of difficulties and gaining the good situation characterized by in-depth reform, economic progress, and social stability. The summary of the 1993 work and the priorities of the 1994 work of the provincial party committee, which will be submitted to the current session for examination and discussion, and the provincial economic work conference, which is scheduled to open on 23 December, will set forth specific arrangements for the various tasks on the provincial economic and social development in 1994 on the basis of summarizing the work of 1993. The current plenary session of the provincial party committee is primarily devoted to studying the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, discussing and defining the province's specific opinions on implementing the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and mobilizing all party committees and Communist party members to lose no time to accelerate the pace of reform and opening up and the pace of setting up the socialist market economic system. Hereafter, I want to dwell on three issues in line with the discussed opinions of the standing committee of the provincial party committee. 1. Profoundly Implement the Guidelines of the Central "Decision," and Enhance the Sense of Responsibility and the Sense of Urgency in Deepening Reform and Accelerating Development Since the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, based on the profound summarization of the great practice of reform and opening up, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and in line with the objectives and principles for the economic structural reform put forward by the 14th CPC Congress, the CPC Central Committee has adopted the "decision on several issues concerning the socialist market economic system" and has set up the outlines for the action of accelerating reform and opening up during the 1990's for the whole party and the people throughout the country. If we say that 15 years ago the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee realized the shift of the work emphasis of the whole party and helped push our country to the historical period of reform and opening up, then, today's third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has sketched the blueprint and defined the basic framework for China's socialist market economic system and has pushed China's reform to a completely new stage of proceeding in an all-around manner and making breakthroughs in key aspects. Successful implementation of the "decision" will certainly consolidate and perfect the socialist system further and make socialism with Chinese characteristics even more vigorous and superior. In implementing the "decision," we must proceed from the reality of our province and enhance the sense of urgency in establishing the socialist market economic system. Through more than 10 years of reform and opening up, the pattern of common development of all sectors of the economy, with the state-owned sector predominant, has been formed; breakthroughs have been made in changing the operational mechanism of large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and in the property rights reform of small enterprises; market cultivation and construction have been accelerated; the commodity prices have been gradually decided by markets; the rural management system has been perfected and the collectivized service system and the trade-industry-agriculture organizations have developed greatly; and even more border areas have been opened to the outside world and the pattern of opening to all directions has been formed gradually. This has not only laid a good foundation for accelerating the transition from the planned economic system to the socialist market economic system, but has also promoted the development of the national economy. This year, the province's gross national product has increased steadily, grain output has reached a record high, structure has improved, total supply and demand have gone up, and efficiency has improved. In addition, township and town enterprises have developed in a sustained and rapid manner, and their output value has surpassed agricultural output value for the first time. The total amount of import and export has increased and the amount of foreign funds utilized and the number of foreign-funded enterprises of three types has doubled and redoubled. Markets have been brisk, purchases and marketing have been thriving, and the current situation continues to develop in a good direction. In the process of development, however, we have also encountered some conspicuous difficulties and problems. Major ones are a long period of shortage of investment, with the investment in fixed assets lower than the national average for 10 successive years; outdated equipment and technology; heavy burden accumulated in history; and the lack of vitality in market competition of state-owned large-and medium-sized enterprises, which support the province's economy; and the lack of major projects to promote the economy and the relatively sluggish economic development rate. These problems have resulted both from the shackles of the traditional systems and from the lack of sufficient dynamics in doing work. As far as the systems are concerned, the central revenue and the local revenue were separated in 1980, and 74.5 percent of the profits and taxes turned in by the country's industrial enterprises owned by the people have been allocated to local authorities. In our province, however, merely 23.5 percent of the profits and taxes are put under the local authorities, 51 percent lower than the national average. Heilongjiang's per capita national income is 28.5 percent higher than the national average, but its per capita revenue is 24.2 percent lower than the national average, thus making the province's finances a typical example of "finance to feed the people." The proportions of the allocations for fixed assets and circulating funds have declined by a large margin, and that of the allocations for administrative funds and various subsidies have notably increased. Due to the limit imposed by the traditional investment system on the use of investment, state investment has been focused on coal, timber, oil, and other basic and heavy industries, while that of the province has been focused on light industry and infrastructural facilities, making the ratio of investment in heavy industry to that in light industry 9 to 1 for a long time. Due to the abnormal ratio of investment, 90 percent of our investment has been used mostly in maintaining reproduction or in resource producing industries during the recession period. This has made us merely capable of maintaining a zero growth rate and preventing a minus growth rate and made it difficult for us to establish a fairly large production capacity. Using the remaining 10 percent of the investment to support the light industry, which accounts for 32.7 percent of our total industry, we are merely capable of maintaining simple reproduction, making it more difficult to restructure the industry. The serious barriers between the industrial enterprises of different regions and different departments and the separate development of the enterprises directly under the central authorities and local enterprises have made it difficult to work out overall plans for and achieve overall balance in the operation of the industry. The limit imposed on the dissemination of the products and technology, as well as the promoting role of key enterprises have led to a broken industrial chain and the obstacles to the development of local industry. Due to the price distortion resulting from the traditional price system and the double-track price system, which has existed for a long period, adjustment of the prices of such primary products as coal, timber, grain, and oil have been sluggish or stagnant. This has not only caused a large loss of efficiency every year, but also made the mining and raw material industries, which account for more than one-third of our total industry, dwindle every year and made it difficult to develop the follow-up industries and substituting industries. As far as our work is concerned, although we have come to understand that structural contradictions are the deep-seated reasons for the sluggish economic development, we still lack significant measures for the transformation of enterprise property rights, the development of the nonstate sectors of the economy, and the in-depth reform of local monetary, investment, and planning systems because of a lack of conditions for macro reform and a lack of courage. Also, although we have come to understand that the bottleneck restrictions imposed by fund shortages and the structural restrictions imposed by underdeveloped processing industry have seriously affected economic development, we have failed to achieve notable results in solving problems because of a lack of unremitting efforts, a pioneering spirit, and a down-to-earth work style. We might not be the only one to blame for the zero or minus increase rate in coal, timber, oil, and other mining industries, but it is our work that has caused the lack of vigor in local industries and the sluggish economic development. There might be numerous reasons for the slow technical transformation and equipment renewal of state-owned large-and medium-sized enterprises, but it is our lack of project development and lack of efforts to win projects from higher authorities that have caused the shortage of important projects to promote our economy for 10 successive years. The above-mentioned conditions and problems show that the fundamental way to resolve the system and structural contradictions restricting economic development; to accelerate economic development and promote the province's economy to a new height lies in speeding up the transition to the socialist market economy and in pooling the efforts of the people throughout the province to promote development through reform. The central authorities have decided to establish the socialist market economy system. This has provided unprecedented conditions and a historical moment for us to resolve the structural contradictions and difficulties in economic development. As the major trend of the new round of reform is coming near in the country, those who have made full preparations will win the conditions for accelerating development; and those who have seized the opportunity will gain the initiative. As long as we firmly implement the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, uplift our spirit, emancipate our minds, seize the opportunity to advance, and deepen reform in an active and prudent manner, we will be able to create a new situation in reform and development. To study and implement the central "decision," we must comprehensively and deeply understand the guidelines of the "decision" and grasp the grand objectives, basic frame, and main links of the socialist market economic system. According to the progress of reform and opening up and the provincial reality, we should pay particular attention to understanding five important viewpoints: 1) Really understand the viewpoint of linking the socialist market economic system with the basic socialist system, further change the confused ideas of setting the market economy against the socialist system, and define that the key to speeding up economic development is to bring into full play the market's fundamental role in distribution of resources and that setting up the socialist market economic system is consolidating and developing socialism. Only when we actually stand from the high plane of the times and the party spirit, further emancipate the mind, and expand the extent of reform will we be able to promote the transformation of the economic system. 2) Really understand the viewpoint that public ownership should play a dominant role in the national economy on the premise that some localities and industries are allowed to have the difference in this aspect, change the mechanical thinking of using the proportion of quantities to define the position of the public ownership, and define that there are various ways to realize public ownership and that the market economy is one in which various sectors of the economy vie with one another for equal development. Therefore, we should further firmly proceed from the provincial actual conditions and proceed from the principle of giving full scope to the strong points and making up for the shortcomings to optimize the ownership structure and to encourage the full development of the nonstate economic sectors. 3) Really understand that setting up the modern enterprise system is the foundation for the socialist market economic system; change the old habits that the property rights are not clear, the responsibility for profits and losses is not clearly defined, scientific management is ignored, and government functions are not separated from enterprise management; and define that enterprises have the decisionmaking rights to manage the property of legal persons. Only when we set up the modern enterprise system characterized by well-defined property rights and duties, separation of government functions from enterprise management, and scientific management will we be able to actually liberate and develop the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. Only by so doing will we be able to boldly promote the reform of the enterprise property right system and comprehensively enliven state-owned enterprises. 4) To actually understand the socialist market economy, we should perfect the viewpoint of the macroeconomic regulation and control system, change the lopsided understanding that the market economy is a free economy to expel the macroeconomic regulation and control, and define that strengthening the central macroeconomic regulation and control rights is conducive to maintaining the basic balance of the overall economy, ceaselessly optimizing the economic structure, and promoting a coordinate economic and social development. Therefore, we should further consciously implement the central decision on strengthening the macroeconomic regulation and control. Simultaneously, we should proceed from the actual conditions and strive to set up a macroeconomic regulation and control system in coordination with the central macroeconomic regulation and control system and suitable for the objective requirements for local economic development. 5)Really understand the viewpoint that the principle of distribution according to work must be dominated by efficiency and be carried out by giving consideration to equality and change the tendencies of unfair distribution and distribution according to the principle of equality. Therefore, we should further positively implement the policy on encouraging some localities and individuals to be rich before others through honest labor and legal management. Simultaneously, the individuals are allowed to have their production factors participate in the distribution of benefits. Simultaneously, we should further appropriately regulate and handle the relations of distribution between different stratums and between the groups of different benefits and gradually seek common wealth. In short, only when we study the central "decision" closely in line with the local practice of reform and development and the work reality of departments and clearly understand the decision's basic viewpoints and basic requirements of great practical significance, will we be able to strengthen the awareness and firmness of implementing the central "decision." The next several years is a period of critical importance and is a stage to tackle difficult problems. Fulfilling the tasks of this stage is of extreme significance. In line with the reform priorities defined by the "decision" of the CPC Central Committee, we have to make plans for all fields, make breakthroughs for major aspects, promote work in an all-around manner, make full preparations, be careful in doing the linking work, and, in particular, resolutely put in place the reform measures that will be set forth next year. This requires us to persist in the fundamental criterion of facilitating the development of vocalist productive forces, facilitating the strengthening of the comprehensive strength of the state, and facilitating the improvement of the people's living standards and require us to emancipate the mind in the course of seeking truth from facts. In establishing a socialist market economic system, there are no precedents in the history of socialist development. Because reform foundations and implementation conditions vary from place to place, we must proceed from realities in implementing the "decision" of the CPC Central Committee. We should further emancipate the mind, continue to carry forward the spirit advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping of daring to think, try, and go ahead, and should boldly support the grass-roots areas and the masses in blazing new trials. We should boldly absorb all the useful reform experiences gained by coastal areas and by other provinces and regions in the country, especially the successful experience in invigorating large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. We should boldly absorb and use as reference all the management and operation forms of developed countries that facilitate the development of productive forces. We should exploit our initiative and creativity to constantly create work advantages and new conditions for accelerating development. We should persist in the principle of promoting development by carrying out reform and concentrate our energy on beefing up economic construction. The fundamental purpose of reform is to accelerate economic and social development and to constantly improve the people's level of material and cultural livelihood. Development is the foundation for solving all social problems and for deciding if the people are for or against reform. We must pay attention to the organic combination of reform and development and regard the difficult points we have met in development as the focal points on which we concentrate to make breakthroughs. In adopting major reform measures, we should fully consider if the mainstay of the national economy -- production and management -- can adapt themselves to the measures. The implementation of economic development strategy should facilitate in-depth reform. While meticulously organizing the reform, we should uphold the central task of economic construction and make all the work manifest the principle that only development is the essential criterion. We should give prominence to developing precision and deep processing and developing new and high-technology industries to enhance the level of industries and extend the chains of production. We should also give prominence to developing high-output, fine-quality, and high-efficient agriculture, as well as township and town enterprises to improve the economic efficiency of the countryside. We should pay equal attention to key projects and technological transformation projects to improve the general quality of the national economy. We should strive to ensure the investment that facilitates the upgrading of industries, expand the scale of production that has a large market, and develop as quickly as possible efficient production. We should persist in the principle of submitting to the overall situation and conscientiously organize the various reforms that help strengthen the macroeconomic regulation and control of the state. Only when the market economic system takes shape throughout the country, can economic structural reform succeed in localities. Only when a strong and effective macroeconomic regulation and control system takes shape throughout the country, can we thoroughly solve the problems of barriers existing between different departments or regions, market blockade, and uneven development in different regions. Only when the central authorities strengthen financial capacity and the regulation and control capacity can they make industrial policies truly favor old industrial bases and major grain production areas. Although the reform of financial, tax, banking, investment, and planning systems, which will be carried out next year, will bring about some new circumstances, we should also submit ourselves to and support the overall situation and conscientiously do the work arranged by central authorities. The special situation and practical difficulties of the province should be reported to the central authorities voluntarily and repeatedly in order to garner the support of the state. This is also an important link to do the partial work well and to support the overall work. We should persist in integrating the effort to deepen reform with that to safeguard social stability to ensure the smooth progress of reform. Only by seizing the favorable opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, and accelerate development, can we consolidate the stable and united political situation; and only when social stability is maintained, can we ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic development. Therefore, in the crucial period for reform and the period for tackling the most difficult problems, we should make particular efforts to safeguard social stability. When adopting major reform measures, we should fully consider the extent the masses approve, attach importance to their vital interests, and protect their enthusiasm. When trying to achieve breakthroughs in key areas of reform, we should pay attention to improving supporting measures, carry out ideological and political work successfully, and reduce social fluctuations as much as possible. In particular, following the deepening of enterprise reform, enterprises that are closed down and suspended or go bankrupt may increase within a short period of time. We should implement guaranteeing and preventive measures in advance and adopt every means to arrange well the life of the workers who are laid off. We should persist in the principle of promoting economic structural reform and political structural reform in a coordinated manner and step up efforts to improve the socialist legal system. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out on many occasions that the corresponding reform in the political structure is an important condition for the ultimate success in the reform of the economic structure. Practice of reform and opening up proved that the development of the market economy has set a still higher demand on improving socialist democracy and the legal system. We should further improve the people's congress system and the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party and establish and improve a democratic and scientific policy-making system. Focusing on establishing the socialist market economy system, we should facilitate the reform of the party and government administrative systems at the same pace, change the functions of party and government organs, simplify them, and raise their efficiency. We should step up economic legislation and upgrade the levels in acting according to law and strictly enforcing laws. We should achieve progress in grass-roots democratic politics and respect and protect the mainstay of the market and the democratic rights of the masses. We should conduct reform and opening up on the one hand and crack down on crimes and punish corruption on the other and do a good job in party building and the building of the spiritual civilization to create a good social environment for deepening reform and establishing healthy and progressive social conduct. 2. Deepen Economic Structural Reform and Accelerate Establishment of the Socialist Market Economy System In Heilongjiang, where large- and medium-sized enterprises are concentrated, the large proportion of basic industries, especially the industries related to resource production, the extensive and long period coverage of mandatory plans, and the serious barriers between different regions and different departments have established a special method for economic operation and a special economic structure. When implementing the "decision" of the party Central Committee, we should proceed from this special feature of the province and, focusing on establishing a modern enterprise system, regard them as the priorities of reform to transform the property right of state-owned enterprises, to change government functions, to cultivate the markets for the essential elements of production, and to establish unemployment and old-age insurance systems, facilitate the supporting reform in other fields simultaneously, and strive for breakthroughs next year. In about five years of time, we should strive to build a basic framework for the socialist market economy system, complete the transition from the planned economy system to the market economy system by the end of this century, and establish an initial administrative system and operating mechanism that meet the needs of the socialist market economy to promote a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development in the province. A. We should speed up establishment of the modern enterprise system focusing on the reform of the property rights of state-owned enterprises. We should popularize the corporation system more rapidly and achieve success in the reform of the property rights of state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises in an active and orderly manner. After standardizing the existing shareholding enterprises, we should select a number of large- and medium-sized enterprises provided with necessary conditions, especially industrial enterprises, to implement the shareholding system. We should increase the number of the enterprises implementing the shareholding system to 150 by next year. We should define the responsibility for undertaking the projects for "grafting" transformation according to the agreements of intention signed during the outside-the-border business introduction activities sponsored by the provincial government on two occasions and firmly organize forces to fulfill the projects. We should strive to expand the scale of "grafting" transformation. Enterprises are allowed to conduct "grafting" transformation wholly and partially and to carry out the policy of one enterprise, several systems. We should strive to introduce more businessmen and capital from developed countries. We should pay attention to bringing in not only capital but also advanced technologies and managerial forms so as to accelerate the pace of "grafting" transformation. To speed up the progress of setting up enterprise associations, we should persist in linking enterprise self-participation with government guidance and have key enterprises play a key role in organizing large trans-regional enterprise associations that have industrial and product advantages and involve various trades. Next year, we should concentrate efforts on grasping the organization of the petrochemical industrial, dairy product, and machine tool enterprise associations. The existing enterprise associations should balance, as soon as possible, their internal relations; perfect the organizational structure and the management system; and actually bring their advantages into play. We should clearly understand, one by one, the situation of the small number of enterprises with serious losses; merge them into the enterprises with advantages; or have them resolutely declare bankruptcy. Next year, the province and all cities and prefectures should make solid strides for experimenting with the auction of large and medium-sized enterprises and the work of having the enterprises with serious difficulties declare bankruptcy. According to actual provincial conditions, we should coordinate the reform of property rights with technological transformation, solve the problems of a lack in motivation by defining property management rights of legal persons of enterprises to conduct enterprise technological transformation, encourage and restrict enterprises to speed up the pace of technological transformation and the upgrading and updating of products, coordinate the reform of the property rights system with the enhancement of the enterprise internal power, solve extensive management problems by setting up a scientific management system, and encourage and restrict enterprises to strengthen management and increase economic results. We should accelerate the pace of system reform, and the lease and sales of enterprise property rights, and comprehensively reform the property rights of small public enterprises. In the next one or two years, we should strive to comprehensively fulfill the tasks for reforming the property rights of state-owned large enterprises with the shareholding cooperation system, lease management, and the marketing of property rights so that they comprise the mainstay. Enterprises with good economic records are allowed to convert their assets into stocks and to sell the stock wholly or partially to staff members, workers, and legal persons so that the enterprises are managed by legal persons and enterprises' staff members and workers with stock, or collectively by the staff members and workers with stocks. As for money-losing enterprises where it is impossible to halt deficits from forming, their staff members and workers can obtain the enterprise property rights by taking up the debts and risks instead of paying money, and then managing the enterprises through stocks. The enterprises without conditions for carrying out the shareholding cooperation system are allowed to carry out the leasing management system. That is, this type of enterprise can be managed wholly on lease or be divided into several relatively independent parts for separate leasing. In the method of managing the enterprises first on lease and then buying the property rights, we should reasonably define rent and sell the enterprise property rights in a step-by-step manner. We should openly sell off the property rights in society. The enterprises without hope for halting deficits and with difficulties in paying the debt in kind and transferring the property rights must resolutely declare bankruptcy according to laws. We should speed up the change of the enterprise managerial mechanism and create conditions for setting up the modern enterprise system. We should continue to conscientiously implement "regulation" and the "detailed rules" of the province and implement to the letter various rights and duties of enterprises. We should further deepen the enterprise internal reform and scientifically set up the labor, personnel affairs, and wage system. We should comprehensively check up on enterprise property, creditors' rights, and debts; define property rights; check the amount of property obtained by the enterprise legal persons; and lay a good foundation for generally carrying out the company system. We should positively explore effective ways for strengthening the supervision and management of public property and protecting and increasing the value of public property. The province, cities, and prefectures should respectively select some enterprises to carry out the modern enterprise system on a trial basis so as to provide experience for various categories of enterprises in carrying out the modern enterprise system. B. We should give priority to the cultivation of markets with essential production factors and accelerate the building of a united and open market system with orderly competition. As a big province rich with natural resources, our province is located in the central part of the Northeast Asian Economic Circle with conditions for becoming the center of distribution for commodities and essential production factors of the Northeast Asian Region. Therefore, the orientation of cultivating and developing the market system must be placed in the commercialization, monetization, and marketing of all essential factors and concentrate efforts on the cultivation and development of the markets with essential production factors. First, we should develop the money market. In the four central cities of Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, and Jimusi, we should build the money markets to serve the whole province. We should also develop the second-grade stock markets in Harbin city, accelerate the cultivation of foreign exchange regulation markets and become a center for money lending. Meanwhile, we should expand the scale of issuing of stock on the market. Second, we should develop the labor market. Industrial cities should run special technology and personnel markets to serve the main bodies of production and operation, in particular, the township enterprises. The agricultural areas should give priorities to running markets of labor forces for promoting the transfer of idle labor forces in the rural areas and the development of non-agricultural industries. Border cities and counties should establish labor service export intermediary organs to serve places outside the territory. All cities and counties may open employment agencies in a planned manner and gradually turn them into the whole province's network for the supply and demand of information on labor forces. Third, we should develop the technology and information markets. All cities and prefectures may establish permanent technology markets or science and technology streets, proceed from reality and develop science and technology fairs and technology management organs in the rural areas. It is necessary to establish a modern information network linking domestic areas with foreign countries. Fourth, we should develop the real estate markets. We should turn the renovation and real estate development of large and medium-sized cities and county seats to the market and implement open bidding and competition on an equal basis. We should combine the renting of land with the paid utilization of land and housing reform and make the real estate industry become an important pillar industry in the development of cities. Fifth, we should develop the property right markets. In places where the environment for inviting business and investments are fairly good and the conditions for becoming centers for information and commodity distribution are favorable, we should step up efforts to establish property rights markets to serve state-owned enterprises. It is necessary to further develop all sorts of commodity markets, give priority to grasping the estabishment and operation of grain, cereal oil, meat, fruit, vegetable, coal, furniture, and sugar wholesale markets in the province. Continued efforts should be made to improve the operation of timber markets in the northern region, the Daqing petrochemical market and the provincial markets of machinery and electric products and light industrial and dairy product and expand their scope of influence. We should raise funds to build the provincial-level futures markets and improve the transportation markets. We should include the building of market system into the overall plan for national economic and social development. We should uphold the principle of adopting a unified plan, building the markets with the efforts of all sectors and allowing them to enjoy benefits before drawing profits from them, and the principle that whosoever builds and invests in the markets will enjoy the benefits and encourage all localities and departments to run the markets. We should accelerate the establishment of market law and regulation system, issue stipulations for market building in our province as quickly as possible and guarantee that all markets will be managed and operated in line with the law. In addition, we should cultivate market intermediary organs in a planned manner, perfect the arbitration and notary organs and improve the market functions. We should accelerate pricing reform according to the changes of relations in the supply and demand of commodities and the marketing of essential production factors. Regarding the prices managed by the province, except the products of monopolized industries and commodities implementing the protective prices, we should decontrol the prices of all other commodities and let enterprises set their own prices in line with market supply and demands. We should gradually reduce and stop the dual-tracking pricing system for the means of production and implement the ceiling price in the means of production for agricultural use. It is necessary to establish the money system for regulating prices, improve the method of collecting and using the funds and strengthen the government's capacity to stabilize market commodity prices. We should step up efforts to formulate laws and regulations for local prices, improve the market price management system and standardize the prices of enterprises. C. We should improve the system for economic regulation and control, with the focus on changing government functions. The state will start reform of the financial and tax, monetary, investment, and planning systems next year. We should achieve success in the work we need to do and take advantage of this moment to establish, as soon as possible, an economic regulation and control system that coordinates the macroeconomic regulation with the control system of central authorities. This requires that we speed up change in government functions, turn the microeconomic administration into macroeconomic administration, and put the focus of work on making overall plans for the economy, implementing macroindustrial policy, keeping total supply and total demand stable, and solving problems that cannot be solved merely through the market mechanism. We should focus work on indirect administration, such as regulation and control of economic levers and improving economic laws and regulations, mainly through economic, legal, and necessary administrative means instead of administrative means alone and guide and regulate enterprises' economic activities to operate in line with market regulations and the general targets of the economy. All departments should examine their powers of screening and approving before the first quarter of next year, delegate to lower levels those that should be delegated, and return to enterprises those that should be returned. We should accelerate institutional government reform to change from a government characterized by a mix and overlap of government functions with business into one characterized by separation of government functions from business, unity, and efficiency, and establish a multi-purpose, flexible, and highly efficient administrative system. The plan for the provincial-level institutional reform will be issued and implemented next year, and experimental institutional reform will be conducted in cities and prefectures. We should actively promote financial and tax reform and strive to cultivate and expand financial resources. Based on the tax assignment system and the changes resulting from a system wherein the central fiscal authority returns and transfers payments to local authorities, we should deepen the reform of the local financial and tax systems to enhance our capacity to create and accumulate financial resources. In line with the principle of making the grass roots affluent first before making the province prosper and the principle of properly enhancing the provincial-level capacity for regulation and control, we should establish the provincial tax assignment system to support the accelerated economic and social development of all localities and to guarantee the funds to support key construction projects within the province and poverty-stricken areas. We should pay attention to the coordination with the important financial and tax policies the provincial party committee and government issued in the past, implement the policies on supporting prosperous counties, poverty-stricken counties, and border cities and counties to accelerate development, and continue the policies related to some enterprises' reform experiment until the end of 1995. To enhance local economic and financial strength, we should particularly support the technical transformation and new product development of the large tax and profit payers among the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises to ensure the steady growth of the local revenue; speed up the development of the intensive processing industry to increase the income tax revenue from local enterprises; expedite the development of transportation, telecommunication, construction, tourism, catering trade, service trade, and other trades of the tertiary industry to increase the business tax revenue; expedite the development of the agriculture with high economic results to increase the farm, forestry, and special product tax revenue; expedite the development of individual and private economies to increase the personal income tax revenue; and accelerate the development of real estate to increase house property tax, land use right tax, and real estate business tax revenues. While cultivating financial resources, we should conscientiously implement the industrial policy of the state and the province and avoid ill-considered and overlapping construction. We should use the lever of local tax rate to promote local economic development. We should complete establishment of local tax institutes as soon as possible and conscientiously do a good job intax collection and management. We should actively support the state in the establishment of tax institutes. We should accelerate the reform of the financial system and further expand the channels for circulating capital. The provincial government should work in coordination with various specialized banks to organize the circulation of capital and to ensure various specialized banks change into commercial banks. In line with the method of separating policy-lending loans from commercial loans, the majority of the enterprises in the province are designated to use commercial loans. We must appropriately designate the nature of loans granted to the forest, coal, and war industries; and study and also adopt effective measures for changing specialized banks into commercial banks. Based on the existing city credit cooperatives, we should firmly attend to setting up the city cooperative banks to serve the local economy and small-and medium-sized enterprises. Based on the rural credit cooperatives and the rural cooperative funds, we should firmly attend to setting up rural cooperative banks to serve agriculture and town and township enterprises. We should also make positive efforts to have the state policy-lending bank and the central credit industrial bank to establish branch offices in our province and to have the Communications Bank of China establish branches in the central cities of the province. It is necessary to deepen the reform of the investment and planning systems and to intensify the investment risk-taking restriction mechanism. In line with the problems that the mainstay of investment is weakening, the investment in fixed assets is increasing at a slow speed, and the investment structure is not reasonable, we must standardize the mainstay of the investment in line with three major investment spheres -- the competitive projects, the projects of infrastructural facilities, and the social welfare projects. We should delegate the right to examine and approve investment items to the governments at various levels to further expand city and prefectural governments' rights. We should use the registration system for the record to replace the administrative examination and approval system in competitive projects. Beginning in 1994 we should carry out the system that representatives of legal persons should assume responsibility for the investment in the fixed asset projects of the industrial enterprises and carry out, on a trial basis, the system that representatives of legal persons should assume responsibility for the investment in infrastructural facility projects. The representatives of legal persons, as soon as they are designated, have decisionmaking power to charge the entire process of collecting funds, inviting and determining bidders, engaging in construction and management, managing production after operation, and returning loans; and also assume the responsibility for taking the risk. The representatives of legal persons should be relatively stable and must not be changed easily. To speed up the development of the basic industries and the intensive and precision processing industries, we should firmly attend to studying ways for building investment group companies in the province. We should further change the functions for planned management; strengthen the coordination with the economic lever departments; calculate and monitor the macroeconomic operation; coordinate the investment orientation and the investment structure according to the industrial policies; particularly strengthen the functions for development and scientific management of projects; set up a project tank including the ongoing projects and reserve projects; accelerate development of a group of key projects with technologically high-quality starting points, great influential functions, good economic results, and short construction periods; and make positive efforts to strive for more projects. D. We should set up and perfect the social guaranteeing system with the focus on unemployment insurance and the insurance for providing for the aged. Next year we should make breakthroughs in perfecting the unemployment insurance system and the system for insurance for providing for the aged to promote the reform of the enterprise property right system and the reasonable flow of production factors. We should expand the scale of unemployment insurance work and gradually set up the insurance and service system for the staff and members of state-owned, collective, and private enterprises, as well as the Chinese staff members and workers of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises. We should expand the implementation of the unemployment insurance system from some staff members and workers of state-owned enterprises to all staff members and workers of state-owned enterprises. We should carry out the system of setting up unemployment insurance funds among the enterprises of various ownerships, strengthen the management of the funds, and ensure that special funds should be used for special purposes. The specialized training bases and the production self-salvation bases should bring their functions into play, enhance the unemployed staff members and workers' employment ability and the awareness of participating in social insurance, and expand the channels for arranging jobs for jobless staff members and workers. We should gradually establish a system wherein the basic old-age pension insurance, enterprises' supplementary old-age insurance, and the old-age insurance derived from workers' individual accounts are combined and should develop old-age insurance for the workers of the enterprises of various ownerships and urban self-employed workers. In rural areas, support of the aged should be shouldered chiefly by their families and supplemented by community assistance, and the old-age insurance derived from accumulation of individual accounts should be gradually popularized so as to expand the coverage of insurance. We should establish city and prefectural basic old-age pension insurance reserve funds and gradually unify the management of retirement funds. We should rationalize the social security management system and, in coordination with institutional reform, establish a unified provincial social security management organization. Distribution of social property is the most sensitive issue of the economics of society. We should establish a reasonable system for the distribution of personal income, gradually standardize the mechanism for the formation of income, and reduce the opportunity for a small number of persons to take advantage of their special positions or privilege to win excessive profits. We should improve the collection and management of personal income tax, establish and improve the system to issue receipts during transactions, the bank account system, and the personal taxable income declaration system, and prevent too large a difference in final personal income. We should lift the limit of the total payroll of enterprises in line with the principle of giving priority to efficiency while considering fairness and guide the distribution of income to tilt favorably to managers, people adept at business, backbone technicians, and skilled producers. We should sell, lease, and build houses simultaneously to accelerate urban housing reform, with the focus on selling public houses. Except for the houses that governments think are not suitable to be sold, all urban public houses may be sold to urban staff members and workers. We should continue to promote the house rent reform and gradually raise house rent according to the changes in market housing prices. We should attach importance to the development and construction of the houses suitable for economic development and provide necessary support in such areas as distribution of land for construction, dismantling of houses, relocation of people, taxes, and credit to the enterprises responsible for the development and construction of such houses. E. We should further improve the rural operation system focusing on the cooperative shareholding system. The household-based output-related contract responsibility system and the dual-management system combining unified operation with independent management are the basic economic systems for rural areas. The rural work conference held by the provincial party committee has decided to extend the household-based output-related contract system another 30 years without change and the term for agricultural developmental production contract another 50 years without change. The optimal- scale operation of land should be developed on the premise that nonagricultural trades are developed correspondingly and rural labor forces are transferred reasonably and by establishing a land circulation mechanism compatible with the requirements of the market economy. We should allow peasants to transfer with compensation, mortgage, buy shares with, or lease out their land use right before their contracts expire. Institutionalizing of the cooperative shareholding system is another important reform of the rural operation system. We should apply this system extensively to the establishment of new township enterprises and to the transformation of the existing rural collective enterprises. Business entities engaged in the coordinated development of farm and animal products, the distribution of farm and sideline products, and rural socialized service should adopt the cooperative shareholding system step by step. This system may also be tried in developing the superior industries of certain localities, in establishing the entities engaged in the integrated management of trade, industry, and agriculture, and in accelerating the construction of small cities and towns. Business entities that have already adopted the system should standardize and systematize it so that their shares can be established in a reasonable manner, their organizations are sound, their management systems are perfect, and their distribution of interests is proper. Integrated management of trade, industry, and agriculture will help in guiding and organizing peasants to enter the market, in developing specialized production and optimal-scale operation, and in upgrading the industrialization of the rural economy. We should develop more rapidly the organizations engaged in the integrated management of trade, industry, and agriculture and exert great efforts to establish the production and management systems that closely coordinate farming and breeding with the processing industry, production and supply with marketing, domestic trade with foreign trade, and agricultural and industrial production with commerce. We should break with the regional barriers, combine the raw materials production zones with the processing bases and commodity distributing areas in accordance with the principle of the economic zones and efficiency and give priority to developing foreign trade-industry-agriculture integrated organizations with the serial development of grain, animal by-products and flax. We should also give priority to cultivating and expanding leading enterprises, accelerate the pace of developing other new products, markets and technological transformation, and enhance their influential capacity. Continued efforts should be made to accelerate the building of the socialized service system, strengthen the service consciousness and functions of agricultural-related departments, support rural production and management experts to take the lead in running all sorts of special associations, develop community service organizations, strengthen the building of county and township agricultural stations (centers), and gradually realize socialized service in the whole course of production, operation, circulation, and consumption in the rural areas. We should accelerate the system of cultivating and building farm product markets, do a good job in coordinating and preparing for the reform of the grain purchasing and marketing system, establish the grain risk-taking fund system, improve the grain reserve system, give priority to building special wholesale markets with the advantages of regional products, actively develop country trade fairs in counties and townships, and effectively link the rural economy with domestic and international markets. It is necessary to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control in the rural areas, make rational plans and adjust the distribution of rural productive forces and promote coordinated development in various industries and regions, as well as the economic and social sectors. F. We should give priority to deepening reform of the foreign trade system in an effort to promote a strategic escalation of opening up. Since our province has the advantages of opening up the border areas, accelerating the establishment of foreign economic trade operational mechanisms that meet the needs of the socialist market economy will be the strategic priority of our province's reform and development. Next year the country will establish a market-based manageable floating exchange rate system, abolish the mandatory plan in foreign trade enterprises, implement the foreign exchange remittance system and the system of converting Renminbi for regular projects with favorable conditions, place the export tax refund under the unified allocation of the central departments, further decontrol the management of export commodities in an orderly manner, expand the foreign business power of industrial and foreign trade enterprises with favorable conditions, develop transcountry companies that integrate industry with agriculture, science, foreign trade, and so forth. Generally speaking, these measurers are helpful to our province to expand the degree of opening up. We must implement them well in accordance with the central plans. In view of the fairly great changes in the foreign economic and trade environment, governments at all levels, and all economic and foreign trade departments and all sorts of foreign trade enterprises should conscientiously study the market trend outside the territory and the demands of domestic and foreign markets, strengthen market forecast and development, know how to manage things according to international practices, and strive to make foreign economic and trade work conform to the objective law of the market economy. We should induce foreign trade enterprises to develop in line with the orientation of becoming integrated industry-foreign trade ones and expand the foreign economic and trade bodies that serve as mainstays. Foreign economic and trade enterprises should gradually expand their business from simple commercial activities to such production spheres as developing various industries, projects and natural resources; production enterprises should cooperate with and jointly do business with foreign trade enterprises, expand the foreign trade sphere and the export quotas and make use of the advantages of products to directly participate in competition in the international market; enterprises of the same category that lack competitive power should organize associations that combine production with processing and marketing or enterprise groups with superior enterprises in the lead and production chains as the link in line with the principle of mutual benefits and enhance their capacity to participate in the international market competition. We should exert efforts to adjust the foreign economic and trade forms and enhance the competitive ability of border and local trade enterprises on the international markets. In face of the changes in the external environment of border and local trade and the stagnation in barter trade, on the basis of stabilizing the development of economic and trade cooperation with Russia, we should accelerate the implementation of various market strategies. While stabilizing barter trade, we should gradually expand ordinary spot exchange trade to reduce the business risks. We should change the dislocation between foreign economic relations and foreign trade, turn pure trade into multidirectional economic and technological cooperation, and establish long-term and stable foreign economic and trade cooperation relations. We should make great efforts to adjust the export product mix and accelerate the export-oriented economic development. We should continuously develop marketable new products to meet the changes in the world market, speed up development of export-oriented agriculture and export processing industry, and expand the exports of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises to promote the steady growth of large-scale exports. We should adopt resolute measures to block the channels for the exports of counterfeit and inferior commodities and promote barter trade. We should seize the opportunity presented by the expansion of the foreign trade autonomy of enterprises to strive to grant more large- and medium-sized enterprises import and export rights so that more enterprises can enter the world market. We should establish a unified and smooth work mechanism for foreign economic relations and trade and unify the management of ordinary spot exchange trade, barter trade, foreign capital utilization, and development zone construction so that foreign economic relations and trade can be coordinated and promoted simultaneously. G. We should speed up the close integration of science, technology, and education with the economy, with the focus on commercializing and industrializing scientific and technological achievements. We should be steadfast in implementing the guiding thought of relying on science and technology in developing economic construction and gearing scientific and technological work to economic construction, facilitate the development of science, technology, and education, and deepen the reform of the educational system and the scientific and technological system. We should comprehensively implement the strategy of "developing the province with science, technology, and education" and establish a scientific and technological system and an educational system that conforms to the development of the socialist market economy and the laws governing the development of science, technology, and education. While intensifying basic research and regular education, we should step up construction of the Harbin and Daqing High- and New-Tech Development Zones focusing on the development of high and new technology and relevant industries. The Harbin Development Zone should emphasize integration of machinery and electronic industries, biological medicine, and new materials, and the Daqing Development Zone should emphasize the petroleum industry, the chemical industry, and the integration of optical instrument, machinery, and electronic industries. They should step up the work to bring in projects from outside and to start up the projects developed by themselves. In particular, it should bring in and develop the projects that reflect the characteristics of the development zones and create high additional value for products and strive to build in two to three years a number of pillar enterprises whose output value exceeds 100 million yuan and profits and taxes exceed 10 million yuan. We should integrate science, technology, and education with the economy, with the focus on transforming scientific and technological achievements. Scientific research institutes and schools of higher learning provided with favorable conditions should strengthen joint management and cooperation with industrial and trade enterprises and, by converting their scientific research achievements and personnel into shares, cooperate with the enterprises to establish enterprise groups engaged in development, production, and marketing of new products. With government support and through shareholding cooperation, we should prepare for establishing in Harbin an intermediate experiment base for scientific research achievements. We should be determined to train a contingent of science and technology brokers to facilitate the entrance of scientific and technological achievements into the market. By next year we should complete transforming developmental scientific research institutes into business entities. The Harbin Engineering Institute New Technology Park should emphasize its functions of experimentation of scientific research achievements and development of high- and new- technology industries, and more of its funds should be used in developing high- and new-technology industries. We should support institutes of higher learning to develop their advantages in personnel and technology and to adopt different methods to develop high- and new-technology industries. We should thoroughly implement the 36-point policy on developing the role of intellectuals and encourage scientific research personnel to establish by themselves or in cooperation with others scientific and technological development enterprises and information service enterprises or to lease and contract for the management of small state-owned enterprises, neighborhood enterprises, and urban collective enterprises. We should promote the development of new products, with the focus on adjusting product mix. In line with the requirement for developing ten major projects in the province, we should organize scientific research units and processing enterprises to develop the new products that are based on a high technological starting point, create high additional value, and have good market prospects and strive to enable our several leading industries to create brand name products that dominate the domestic market and open up the world market. 3. Strengthen and Improve Party Leadership, and Provide a Reliable Guarantee for the Establishment of the Socialist Market Economic System The third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has initiated the new period of China's socialist modernization drive. To effect the historical change from old to new systems, and to establish the socialist market economic system, we must further strengthen and improve party leadership, strengthen the party's cohesive forces and fighting capacity, and persist in the principle of taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands in order to provide a strong and effective social and political guarantee for deepening the reform. A. We should profoundly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics to lay a solid ideological foundation for implementing the "decision." Party organizations at all levels in the province should give top priority to organizing party members and cadres to study the theory of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should combine the study of Volume Three of the Selected Work of Deng Xiaoping with the study of the "decision" of the CPC Central Committee, emphatically grasp the quintessence of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, and appropriately handle the relations between reform and development, between speed and efficiency, between plans and markets, between the present and the future, and between the part and the whole. We should grasp the main line that "only development is the essential criterion," clearly understand that liberating and developing productive forces is the essential demand of socialism, and always persist in the central task of economic construction without any deviation. We should guard against the right but primarily prevent the "left." We should extricate ourselves from the fixed traditional modes of thinking and get rid of the disease of fearing capitalism to maintain the continuity and stability of the policies concerning reform and opening up. To study well Volume Three of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, we must strengthen the study among the central groups of party committees at all levels. The standing committee of the provincial party committee plans to schedule a certain period of time to study Volume Three of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping around the major issues concerning the province's reform and development in order to seek unity of thought and mobilize party members and cadres throughout the province to profoundly study the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should run theory discussion classes for leading cadres of party and government organizations, run study classes for leading cadres of enterprises, and run training classes for reserve cadres. We should combine the study of Volume Three of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping with the study of the basic knowledge on market economy. We should continue to break with the old ideas and old concepts taken shape under traditional systems and should set up the new ideas and new concepts that suit the socialist market economy so that we can push forward the cause of reform and opening up with one heart and one mind. B. We should strengthen leading bodies at all levels and the grass-roots organizations and should build up the ranks of cadres that meet the demands of the socialist market economy. Deepening reform and accelerating development have set an even higher demand on the leading and work level of party organizations at all levels. To meet this demand, we must persist in the party's centralism and actually strengthen leading bodies at all levels in line with the principles of making the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger, better-educated, and professionally more competent. We should use and promote cadres based on their political achievements. Through the reform of party and government organizations, we should strive to train, choose, and promote a number of cadres who have both ability and political integrity and who have been outstanding in official performances, and should provide sufficient and competent cadres for leading bodies of all levels of party and government organizations. We should regard the building of the ranks of modern entrepreneurs and the improvement of the quality of the ranks of grass-roots cadres as work priorities of strategic significance. We should bring in the competitive and incentive mechanisms to break with the restrictions from ownership systems and administrative grades. We should not stick to one pattern in choosing and promoting outstanding talents in order to truly promote the talents, who are familiar with market economy and are good at scientific management, to leading posts of enterprises and promote the cadres, who have the spirit of blazing new trials and working practically and who are able to lead the masses to achieve prosperity commonly, to leading posts of grass-roots organizations. We should realistically strengthen the construction of the ideology and work style of the leading bodies at various levels, and concentrate energy on solving the problems in which the leading cadres stand high above the masses and remain indifferent toward the masses' weals and woes and the grass roots' difficulties. All leading cadres should go deep to the grass roots and the masses to help directly solve their practical problems. We should solve the problems of trying to skirt round difficulties, shifting responsibility onto others, and not assuming responsibility; set up a definite system of responsibility for fulfillment of the targets; and ensure that all levels take on their own duties. The problems of shifting responsibility onto others, putting blames onto others, and never undergoing self-criticism should be solved. Simultaneously, we should foster the awareness of personal responsibility and creatively do our duties well. Doing away with the tendency of blaming everyone and everything but oneself and being negative and pessimistic, we should boost morale and be inspired with enthusiasm. The cadres who do not stress party spirit and principles and refuse to do solid work must neither be put in important positions nor be promoted. Cadres who create bad consequences due to the negligence of duties or the failure to implement the decisions of higher levels should be readjusted from their leading posts resolutely. Those who damage unity must be punished strictly according to party discipline and administrative discipline. We should be determined to build grass-roots organizations into fighting forces and unite with and guide the masses to realize the fighting goal of the party. The party committees at various levels should try to clearly understand, one after another, the weak and lax situation of the grass-roots organizations; and adopt measures to consolidate them in stages into groups. Party organizations of enterprises, rural areas, organs, and institutions should strengthen self-construction and bring their functions into play in line with the requirements for setting up the modern enterprise system, increasing the income of the peasants, serving the grass roots and the masses, and implementing the strategy of relying on science and education to rejuvenate the province. Simultaneously, we should improve the work forms of the grass-roots party organizations, further investigate and study the new situation and new problems, and positively explore new ways to set up party organizations and conduct activities in various sectors of economic organizations under market economic conditions. C. We should realistically strengthen the construction of the socialist spiritual civilization and strive to create the social practice of opening to the outside world in a civilized manner and making progress healthily. To set up the socialist market economic system, we should persist in the principle of paying equal attention to spiritual and material civilizations, ensure the accurate orientation of reform and opening up by strengthening the construction of the spiritual civilization, and simultaneously ensure the provision of powerful ideological theory, a democratic legal system, science and culture, and social practice. The theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the basic line of the party, patriotism, collectivism, socialism, the people's creativity in reform, opening up, and modernization, and the fine traditional ethics of the Chinese nation should be regarded as the focal points of propaganda work and ideological and political work, and vigorously carry forward the main melody of socialism. Papers, magazines, and books should use key pages to prominently and vigorously expand the reaches of propaganda on the main melody. The radio and television stations should also use prime viewing time to do so. Enterprises, neighborhood committees, and campuses should develop cultural activities. It is also necessary to conduct mass cultural activities and strengthen the construction of civilized villages and units. We should persistently take the main melody as the keynote and ensure that the cultural activities are not only varied and colorful but also healthy and progressive. We should notice that along with the ceaseless deepening of reform and opening up, the people's thinking and the social practice are changing positively in line with the requirements for social progress. However, some negative, backward, and corrosive things that undermine the nature of socialism continue to spread unchecked. In particular, money worshipping, out-and-out egoism, corrosive lifestyles run rampant and have become extremely prominent problems. If these phenomena are spread unchecked, not only will it damage the prestige of the party and the government but it will ruin the future of reform, opening up, and modernization as well. All communist party members with the sense of responsibility for the cause of the party and the people must not turn a blind eye to these phenomena. On the contrary, they must be the first to eliminate these phenomena at their posts and departments, and realistically strengthen the construction of the spiritual civilization. We should strengthen the education on having an accurate outlook on life and an accurate outlook on value and strive to form a practice of respecting advances and stressing contributions. We should adopt various effective educational forms and conduct education on patriotism, collectivism and socialism among the masses of cadres, especially young people. The media and propaganda departments should adhere to a correct media guidance, give prominence to publicizing advanced and typical cases of diligent and honest administration and selfless dedication and gradually make selfless devotion become the guidance of value and the highest moral standard of the whole society. We should exert efforts to promote the spirit of devotion to work and strive to form a practice of paying full attention to one's post and working painstakingly. Party and government organs and all social departments should strengthen education on professional ethics in line with the characteristics of their own work, induce the people to work hard, compete with one another on an equal basis, give civilized service and observe law and discipline. Through conducting all sorts of activities on fostering the enterprise spirit, we should induce the people to enhance the sense of responsibility, dedicate themselves to their own business and work in a down-to- earth manner. We should actively induce the people to spend their money in a sound manner and strive to form a habit of practicing economy. On the basis of conducting investigations and studies, we should adopt policies, laws and regulations as well as economic and administrative measures to effectively check the spread of abnormal social consumption and the trend of lavish spending. Leading cadres at all levels should take the lead in promoting the spirit of building the country and running the households industriously and thriftily. We should resolutely check the repulsive social phenomena and strive to purify the social environment. Continued efforts should be made to deal blows to feudal superstitions, gambling, drugs trading and taking, prostitution and visit to prostitutes and other repulsive social phenomena, organize efforts to ban all sorts of pornographic services and gambling activities in recreation and service places and strictly handle the managers in line with law. D. We should continue to deeply conduct anticorruption struggle and use the actual results in fighting corruption and promoting honesty to guarantee the smooth progress of reform, opening up and economic construction. Fighting corruption and strengthening the building of clean politics is the necessary conditions for building the socialist market economic system. Since the issuance of the central authorities' important anticorruption plans, party and government organs at all levels across the province have adopted a resolute attitude, taken action actively, and witnessed a very good trend in the anticorruption struggle. Places where this work has been fairly good have achieved fairly remarkable results in carrying out the three central tasks and enhanced the confidence of masses of cadres in fighting corruption. We should continue to expand the degree of work, consolidate the expected results of the previous stage, and guarantee the realization of the three anticorruption tasks on schedule. Leading cadres at all levels must implement the relevant stipulations on keeping oneself self-disciplined and honest in places where needed, pay further attention to holding democratic life activities of leading bodies with emphasis on honesty, self- discipline and self-investigation and self-correction, compare their work one by one with the relevant central and provincial stipulations, examine their own problems in a fact-seeking manner, report their cases and criticize them within a certain scope and place them under mass supervision. We should conscientiously handle cases on law and discipline violations, strictly handle all verified corruption cases and never tolerate them. Discipline inspection, supervision and judicial organs at and above the county level should select typical cases that affect a large area and cause strong complaints from the masses for public trial. Regarding the central proposal on checking the recent unhealthy trends in various trades and the problems which all localities and departments have determined to solve on a priority basis, we should grasp them through to the end until good results are achieved. In fighting corruption, we must rely on education and the legal system, proceed from deepening reform and the building of systems and fundamentally guard against and check the corrupt phenomena. We should solve the unhealthy trends in cadre personnel affairs, real estate development and contract of projects by adopting the methods of holding public examinations, employing workers in the public and inviting tenders; solve the problems of using public funds to build houses above set standards and selling public houses at a higher price by deepening reform of the housing system and collecting unhealthy trends in housing distribution; prevent the problems of abusing one's powers to seek personal gain in the course of distribution of funds by deepening reform of the financial, tax and banking systems; and solve the problem of spending public funds lavishly and wastefully by setting standards for cadres' wages and for reception that conform to reality. In addition, we should also strengthen inner party supervision, legal supervision, media supervision and mass supervision, study and explore effective ways to exercise supervisory power under the market economic conditions, and gradually institutionalize and legalize the anticorruption struggle. While successfully grasping the anticorruption struggle, we should rectify the ideology and work style among party and government organs at all levels with opposing bureaucracy, liberalization and formalism as the main content. E. We should exert conscientious efforts to maintain social stability to provide a good social environment for deepening reform. In the current economic activities, both difficulties and destabilizing factors are rather numerous. In addition, many major reform measures will be put into practice next year. This makes it a very important task to maintain social stability. Party committees and governments at all levels should regard it as a major task to show concern for the life of the masses and maintain social stability, concentrate efforts on tackling in a timely manner the social problems that affect stability, and strive to nip the hidden destabilizing factors in the bud to maintain and develop the stable and united political situation. To achieve this, we should, first, pay attention to people's ideological fluctuations, if any, emerging in the process of reform and ease people's feelings and resolve contradictions in a timely manner. Leading cadres at all levels should go deep into the grass-roots level and the masses to intensify the investigations and analysis of public opinion and people's mind-set, learn about their thinking, do a timely and good job in education and persuasion, guide the people to correctly understand reform and to enhance their mental preparations for it, and conscientiously lead, protect, and develop well the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. Second, we should exert particular efforts to solve the problems in the life of the staff members and workers of loss-making enterprises. Party and government leading organs at all levels should adopt a highly responsible attitude toward the people and, dividing work among themselves, conduct study of the ways to guarantee the basic life of the staff members and workers of the enterprises under their charge which have stopped or postponed wage payment. They should also study the ways to reassign the laid-off staff members and workers of the closed or suspended enterprises. Labor departments should strengthen coordination for the unemployment insurance work and put the focus of social insurance business on the enterprises which have lost money for a long time. Trade unions, the Communist Youth League [CYL], and women's federations are the channels and bridges for the party to establish ties with the masses. They should fully develop their role, further represent and safeguard the interests of workers, report workers' desires and demands to party committees and governments in a timely manner, and help party committees and governments in the ideological work for workers to safeguard social stability. Meanwhile, they should conscientiously institute the system of responsibility for helping and supporting poverty-stricken localities, implement the aid-the-poor measures in every village and household, and encourage rural party and CYL members to support the poor all the year round. As the year is drawing to an end, all localities should make good arrangements for the life of poverty- stricken households to make sure that they have a happy New Year and Spring Festival. Third, we should further reduce the burdens on enterprises and peasants. The "enterprise law" and the "regulations" should be conscientiously enforced, and exaction of fees and wanton requisition of donations from enterprises and their workers should be checked. By transforming enterprises' property right system and operating mechanism and improving the social security system, the burdens on enterprises should be gradually shifted to the society. Effective measures should be adopted to continuously implement the regulations of the central authorities as well as the provincial party committee and government on reducing the burdens on peasants to prevent reemergence of the burdens. We should intensify publicity of policies to familiarize the masses with the laws and regulations on lightening the burdens on peasants so that they will resist the irrational burdens according to law. Fourth, we should keep price rises under control. There will be plenty of factors for price hikes next year, and if we fail in regulation and control, prices will still rise by a large margin. Therefore, we should attach great importance to prices, strengthen supervision and control to prevent monopolization of the market, random jacking-up of prices, and pursue of huge profits in a timely manner, and exert utmost efforts to bring next year's price rises under control. Fifth, we should do a good job in comprehensive improvement of public security. We should strictly crack down on gangs of hooligans and thieves, bus and train marauding and waylaying, and serious criminal elements. We should strengthen management of the public security in public places to safeguard normal social order. We should achieve success in mediating in civil disputes to prevent contradictions from becoming intense. We should earnestly handle people's complaints exposed in their visits and letters and strive to solve problems at grass-roots levels and in the places where they arise so as to reduce bypassing of immediate leadership to present complaints to higher levels. We should apply the leadership responsibility system to public security and make public security a decisive factor in appraising the work of a locality so as to create a stable social environment for reform and construction.
