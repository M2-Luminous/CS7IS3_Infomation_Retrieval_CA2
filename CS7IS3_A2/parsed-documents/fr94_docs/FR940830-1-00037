FR940830-1-00037 FR940830-1-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;91&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 767 Series Airplanes Equipped With Off-Wing Escape Slides AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes. This proposal would require replacement of the currently installed door opening actuators of the emergency off-wing escape system with new, improved actuators. This proposal is prompted by reports indicating that the requirements of a previously issued AD do not adequately preclude leakage from these actuators. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the escape slide to deploy, which could delay and possibly jeopardize successful emergency evacuation of an airplane. DATES: Comments must be received by October 24, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;91&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from OEA, Inc., P.O. Box 100488, Denver, Colorado 80250; and Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jayson Claar, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ANM&hyph;120S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2784; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;91&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;91&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On July 15, 1992, the FAA issued AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, amendment 39&hyph;8327 (57 FR 47987, October 21, 1992), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 and Model 767 series airplanes. That AD requires repetitive inspections (weighing program) of the door opening/snubbing actuators of the escape system (for Model 747 series airplanes) and the door opening/snubbing actuators of the off-wing escape slide (for Model 767 series airplanes), and modification of the door latching mechanism of the escape slide compartment. Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a report from an operator of Model 767 series airplanes that several actuators leaked following accomplishment of the modification procedures required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. Therefore, the FAA has determined that the modification requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 do not adequately preclude leakage from these actuators. Additionally, this operator also reported that, during subsequent inspections (weighing program) of these actuators, the weight in several actuators increased from the original weight measured during the initial inspection (weighing program) required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17. Therefore, the FAA finds that the inspection requirements of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17 cannot reliably determine the fluid level of these actuators by the weighing program. Further, since the issuance of AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;17, the manufacturer has developed a new, improved actuator for Model 767 series airplanes. These new actuators are not fluid-filled. The old actuators were fluid-filled and had a tendency to leak, which caused the actuator to fail.
