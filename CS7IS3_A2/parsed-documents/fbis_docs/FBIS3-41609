Yesterday, at a ``round table'' at the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, its draft was introduced for discussion by specialists. The document, prepared by staff members at the Institute for Radiation Hygiene of Russia, formulates scientific principles and basic methods for practical implementation of measures for protecting the populace on territories contaminated by radionuclides. The principal aim of these measures is to protect the health of the populace. And the way to achieve this is--reducing the level of irradiation [obluchenie] from all basic sources of radiation [izluchenie] (based on the principle of optimization), medical protection, an increased level of radiation-hygienic knowledge, psychological protection of the people, and increasing their social and legal defense. Also defined in the draft are principles of economic activity on these territories after a long period of time has elapsed since their contamination. Except for the section on gradation of contamination levels the remaining constituent parts of the concept raised no disagreement. The basis for gradation was a new scale developed by the authors of the document for evaluating the radioactive contamination of territories, which divides the territory into three zones--a radiation defense zone, a voluntary evacuation zone, and an exclusion zone. The optimal indicator of radiation level in Russia, as in the countries of Europe, is acknowledged to be a dose of radiation [radiatsiya] of one mZv [presumably, ``milliZievert''] (a Zivert [named for Swedish scientist G.R. Siewert] is a measure of the cumulative effect of chronic irradiation of a human being in small doses). The maximum allowable dose of radiation incurred when carrying out certain protective and preventive measures is considered to be five mZv. But according to estimates by the primary opponent--the Socio-Ecological Union--this indicator should be significantly reduced; and, in its opinion, the lowering of radiation stress should be encouraged as well. According to analysis by the round-table participants, one cannot orient oneself on Europe in questions of defense against radioactive contamination: its level in Russia is incomparable higher. Thus, it is highly likely that the levels of radiation safety in the program of the Russian government will be greatly reduced in comparison with that of civilized countries. Recommendations for Residents of a Contaminated Area 1. Every person who lives in a radioactive contamination zone has the right to know their received and projected irradiation dose. 2. One must take into consideration not only the benefit, but also the harm from defensive measures connected with changing one's way of life. Therefore, a person must take the basic decisions independently. The decision to dwell on contaminated territories in terms of the amount of risk is comparable with other decisions in life. For example, smoking presents a much greater risk to one's health, to include oncological diseases, than living in a radiation monitoring zone. 3. One should not strive to limit one's food intake groundlessly; an insufficient or unbalanced diet can lead to reduction of one's anti-tumoral and anti-infection immunity. One must regularly include vegetables and fruits in one's diet, and water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins are effective means of prevention of tumoral diseases and the consequences of irradiation. 4. One need not limit one's time in the fresh air, nor swimming in reservoirs--limiting one's mobility is very harmful. 5. A state of constant psycho-emotional pressure (stress), often caused by highly exaggerated fear of radiation, is an enormous threat to the health of the populace living on contaminated territories.
