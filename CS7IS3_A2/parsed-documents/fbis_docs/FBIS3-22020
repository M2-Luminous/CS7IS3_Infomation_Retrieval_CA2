This information was disclosed by Cochabamba Mayor German Lema Araoz. As he announced the release of the arrested people, Minister of Government German Quiroga, who applauded the fact that "fortunately no significant casualties" were registered, warned that the peasants will not be allowed to cause new disturbances. In addition to Quiroga's warning were those made by Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz, who admitted shortly afterward that the peasants who were released are being investigated by the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) to determine possible links to drug traffickers. Soliz asserted that the plan to eradicate illegal coca plantations will continue as scheduled in the Chapare area. The coca growers, in turn, accepted the government's invitation to a peaceful dialogue as of 2 March in La Paz, but warned that the eradication of coca plantations will not be discussed because, first of all, they have to discuss their proposals to fight drug trafficking and coca leaf production. Evo Morales, executive secretary of the Special Federation of Peasant Workers of the Tropics, asserted: "We are not going to accept compulsory eradication." Morales warned that in view of the "offensive" by antidrug forces, "we have no other alternative but to strengthen our self-defense committees, the peasant defense patrols, and, in some cases, the security committees." The General Trade Union of Bolivian Peasant Workers (CSUTCB) also voiced support for the coca growers' demands through leader Felix Santos, who pointed out the need to tackle this problem in a comprehensive manner because "partial" solutions do not have positive results. Bolivian Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas condemned the violence in Chapare and said he was against eradication by force of surplus coca plantations. Cardenas said: "Forced eradication only means violence, which we reject," and suggested that the reduction of surplus plantations be carried out based on agreements with the producers and their grass-roots organizations.
