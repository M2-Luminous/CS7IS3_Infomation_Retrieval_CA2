In an exclusive interview with the TEHRAN TIMES, the minister said, "The use of satellite dishes is not illegal, but will need to be authorized." Besharati was commenting on earlier reports by the local press which quoted him as saying that satellite dishes are 'illegal and will all be confiscated within two months.' There were fears after the interior minister's announcement that some could take undue advantage of the situation and blackmail those who are now using dishes. "The issue is under discussion by the cabinet and a comprehensive decision is to be made within a month," said Besharati. President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani's cabinet meets every Wednesday. Satellite dishes began mushrooming on rooftops in the last two years and the Persian daily SALAM recently reported that 400 dishes were being installed in Tehran daily. "The cabinet will approve rules and regulations on the use of dishes and the Interior Ministry will be responsible for their enforcement," Besharati said. "Of course the Interior Ministry will give enough time for dish users to surrender them to the ministry voluntarily," he said. Besharati said a commission comprising representatives from the Islamic Propagation Organization and the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance will set rules and regulations for issuing permission for satellite dish use. He said foreign missions in Iran should apply for permission and it will be granted to them. "Before the cabinet's approval and an announcement by the Interior Ministry, no one is authorized to confiscate the dishes and if approached by someone who wants to, people should inform the nearest police station," Besharati emphasized.
