FR940118-1-00015 FR940118-1-00006 Conduct of Hearings. Sections 251.46 through 251.48 are adopted nearly intact from the former Tribunal's rules. Section 251.46 describes the role of the arbitrators and the chairperson during the course of a hearing. Section 251.47 describes the course of proceedings once a hearing has begun, and section 251.48 prescribes the rules of evidence. Only conforming changes have been made to these sections. Transcript and Record. Section 251.49 governs transcription of the hearings and creation of the record. The Librarian shall, from time to time, designate an official reporter to transcribe the hearings of any arbitration proceedings taking place during that time. Since arbitration proceedings are likely to take place in different locations, the location of the transcript will not always be at a fixed site. Therefore, the chairperson is directed to specify the location of the transcript for public inspection. It is anticipated that the location will usually correspond to that of the hearing, although this may not always be the case. Once the arbitration proceeding is concluded, the transcript, along with the full written record, will be delivered to the Librarian and may be viewed at the Copyright Office. Rulings and Orders. Section 251.50 gives CARPs the authority to issue rules and orders necessary to the resolution of the proceedings. Once again, the absence of the Panels' authority to issue rulemakings amending, superseding, or supplementing the rules and regulations of this Subchapter is underscored. Closing Hearings; Submission of Findings and Conclusions; Report. Section 251.51, with respect to closing the hearing, and section 251.52, on submission of proposed findings and conclusions, are adopted intact from the former Tribunal's rules, with conforming amendments. Section 251.53 essentially codifies the provisions of 17 U.S.C. 802(e) governing the report of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels to the Librarian of Congress. The determination of a Panel is to be certified and signed by all the arbitrators, and any written dissent is to be certified and signed by the dissenting arbitrator. Panels must distribute copies of their determination to all participating parties. Assessment of Costs of Panels. Section 251.54 governs the assessment of costs by Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels. 5 It implements new section 802(c) of the Copyright Act which states: 5 Assessment of costs by the Library and the Copyright Office are addressed in §§251.65 and 251.74. In ratemaking proceedings, the parties to the proceedings shall bear the entire cost thereof in such manner and proportion as the Arbitration Panels shall direct. In distribution proceedings, the parties shall bear the cost in direct proportion to their share of the distribution. After the conclusion of an arbitration proceeding, the Panel will assess its costs in accordance with the above-described proportions. The chairperson will deliver a statement to each participating party listing the Panel's total costs, the party's individual share, and the amount due to each arbitrator from that party. Payment is to be made to each arbitrator, as provided in the statement, and must be made either by money order, check, or bank draft. Failure to submit timely payment will subject the party to the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982. Post-Panel Motions; Order of the Librarian; Effective Date; Appeals. After the arbitration process has concluded and the Panel has delivered its report, the Reform Act requires that the Librarian of Congress review the sufficiency of the Panel's determination within 60 days of receipt of the report. Section 251.55 grants the parties to the proceeding 14 days in which to file petitions with the Librarian requesting that the determination be modified or set aside, and an additional 14 days to reply to such petitions. The petitioner must clearly state its reasons for the modification or reversal, and include applicable portions of its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. After the four-week period has run, the Librarian will proceed to a decision on the Panel's report. Section 251.56 essentially codifies the review process described in 17 U.S.C. 802(f), with the Librarian publishing the order of his/her decision in the Federal Register and delivering it to all the parties to the proceeding. The order is to be effective 30 days after its publication in the Federal Register, unless an appeal is taken (§251.57). The appeals process described in §251.58 comes directly from 17 U.S.C. 802(g). 6. Subpart F_Rate Adjustment Proceedings The basic procedural mechanics of an arbitration proceeding are described in Subpart E, but the different nature of rate adjustment proceedings in comparison with that of distribution proceedings calls for additional separate requirements. Subpart F contains those requirements for rate adjustment proceedings. Scope of Subpart F. Section 251.60 describes the scope of Subpart F, emphasizing that it applies only to rate adjustment proceedings and that it augments the rules of Subpart E. In circumstances where one or more provisions of Subpart E and F are inconsistent, section 251.60 makes clear that Subpart F is controlling.
