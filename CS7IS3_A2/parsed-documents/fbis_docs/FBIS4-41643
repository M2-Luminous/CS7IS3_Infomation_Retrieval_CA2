Igor Kirpichov, a correspondent from RIA news, has rung our editorial office and his information is about Sevastopol. The townspeople have elected the city council; Viktor Semenov received the most votes. The residents of Sevastopol also had to answer the question of whether they agree to Sevastopol being the main base of the Russian Black Sea fleet. Ninety percent of the voters responded in the affirmative to this question. I repeat that this was a RIA report. Well the situation regarding the candidate for the president of Ukraine is still not clear.
