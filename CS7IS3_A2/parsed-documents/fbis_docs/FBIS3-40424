An inspection process with neural intelligence now recognizes faulty minimemories in a flash. Who can imagine a number with a million zeros? Expressed in milligrams, the weight of the Earth needs a 30 digit number. The number of atoms in the entire universe has about 125 places - but a million? Siemens engineers have to get to grips with this giant number if properly working silicon chips are to leave the factory in Regensburg: In theory 2[.sup]4194304[/]-1 reference patterns can occur in the production of a 4 megabit memory, a number with approximately 1.2 million digits. "Maps", better known as "bit-maps" showing specimen faulty memories are used to try to classify this almost infinite number of reference patterns in order to cut the time required for inspecting a silicon wafer with memory modules. At first sight it is a never-ending task: How can this huge number of possible combinations be classified at all? Fortunately, the bit-map variants are similar in appearance. Someone with a sound background knowledge who "reads" the bit-maps for a long period of time can divide them into some 80 to 100 risk allowance groups. This is an extraordinary achievement for the human brain. There is just one snag: Visual analysis takes up to 15 hours for every 6-inch silicon wafer. Siemens in Regensburg has now optimized bit-map analysis of silicon wafers with neural networks. The computer uses pattern recognition to decide in which of the 80 or so risk allowance groups a defect found on a chip falls. The actual analysis is performed on a perfectly ordinary PC. One great advantage is that any new reference patterns that occur no longer have to be reprogrammed because the system "learns" them itself. And that is not all: Since most of the equipment used in chip manufacture has quite characteristic reference patterns, the system gives a specific alarm when faults of a particular risk allowance group accumulate in part of the wafer. This enables such "output killers" to be identified early. The bit-map analysis system developed by Siemens' Semiconductor Division will also check 16 megabit and later 64 megabit memories: The number of possible reference patterns in these memories is as much as 2[.sup]108864[/]-1. To write this number out would require a computer printout which, with the pages placed end to end, would be 100 kilometers long.
