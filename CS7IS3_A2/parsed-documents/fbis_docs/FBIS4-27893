Representatives of the G-7 nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- worked out an agenda of political dialogue for the July 8-10 meeting in Naples, Italy, the sources said. Unlike previous G-7 summits, they said, the Naples summit will not issue a political declaration. Instead, they will merely issue a chairman's declaration, in view of Russia's formal participation for the first time. At previous summits, Kremlin leaders were invited to join their G-7 counterparts for a special session outside the framework of the actual summit. Russia's participation in the G-7 discussion on the former Yugoslavia will be especially meaningful, considering the country's influence over fellow Slavs in Serbia. The sources said Japan, which has not sent personnel to join the United Nations Protection Force (Unprofor) in the former Yugoslavia, will call for continued efforts to keep the conflict in Bosnia- Herzegovina from spreading. Japan will convey its resolve to extend assistance to surrounding countries such as Macedonia to consolidate stability there, as well as post-conflict reconstruction assistance to other parts of the former Yugoslavia, they said.
