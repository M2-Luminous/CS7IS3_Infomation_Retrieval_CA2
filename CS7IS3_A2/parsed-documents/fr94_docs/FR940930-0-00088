FR940930-0-00088 FR940930-0-00016 We are revising the title of §405.535 to add the words ``and suppliers.'' It will read, ``Special rules for nonparticipating physicians and suppliers furnishing screening mammography services.'' We are also making technical changes in this section to cross-refer the reader to the fee schedule for physicians' services. Additionally, we are setting forth in §405.535 requirements for the limiting charge if the screening mammography services are furnished by a nonparticipating physician or supplier who does not accept assignment. Conditions for Coverage In accordance with section 354 of the PHS Act, regarding coverage conditions for diagnostic and screening mammography, we are amending 42 CFR by revising §410.34(a) to specify definitions of the terms (1) ``diagnostic mammography,'' (2) ``screening mammography,'' (3) ``supplier of diagnostic mammography,'' (4) ``supplier of screening mammography,'' (5) ``certificate,'' (6) ``provisional certificate,'' and (7) ``meets the certification requirements of section 354 of the Public Health Services (PHS) Act.'' In §410.34, we are redesignating paragraph (b) as paragraph (d). We are adding a heading to paragraph (d), ``Limitations on coverage of screening mammography services.'' In newly redesignated paragraph (d)(1) of §410.34, we are clarifying that the current requirement that a mammogram ``must, at a minimum [emphasis added], be a four-view exposure (that is, a cranio-caudal and a medial lateral oblique view of each breast)'' is the minimum requirement that must be met, except in the case of a woman who is having a postmastectomy screening, when we will allow a two-view exposure (that is, a cranio-caudal and a medial lateral oblique view) of the remaining breast. We are adding a new paragraph (b) to §410.34 to set forth conditions for coverage of diagnostic mammography, which essentially cross-reference the same FDA certification requirements that suppliers of screening mammography must meet on October 1, 1994. Medicare Part B pays for diagnostic mammography services if the diagnostic mammography services are ordered by a doctor of medicine or osteopathy and if they are furnished by a supplier of diagnostic mammography services that meets the certification requirements of section 354 of the PHS Act, as described in 21 CFR part 900 (``Mammography''), subpart B (``Quality Standards and Certification''). We are also adding a new paragraph (c) to §410.34 to set forth the conditions for payment of screening mammography. Medicare Part B pays for screening mammography services only if they are furnished by a supplier of screening mammography services that meets the certification requirements of section 354 of the PHS Act, as described in 21 CFR part 900, subpart B. We are revising §411.15 (``Particular services excluded from coverage'') to replace the cross reference to subpart B of part 494 (which is being removed and reserved) with a reference to the certification requirements in section 354 of the PHS Act, as set forth in 21 CFR part 900, subpart B. The current §413.123(b) states that payment to hospitals for screening mammography services performed on an outpatient basis is determined in accordance with §405.534(c). We are changing this to refer to §405.534(d) to correct an error. V. Information Collection Requirements Due to the enactment of the MQSA and its implementation by FDA, we are requesting cancellation of the information collection requirements approved under OMB control number 0938&hyph;0608 for Medicare coverage of screening mammograms, effective October 1, 1994. The latter information collection document was previously required as a result of the enactment of section 4163 of OBRA '90. In implementing section 4163 of OBRA '90, we published interim final regulations on December 31, 1990 (55 FR 53510), including certain minimum safety and accuracy standards set forth in 42 CFR subpart B, which suppliers of screening mammography services had to meet in order to participate under Medicare, effective January 1, 1991. With the enactment of the MQSA, however, all mammography facilities in the United States, except for VA facilities, will be required, effective October 1, 1994, to have a certificate issued by FDA regardless of their source of payment. Therefore, under its delegation of authority from the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, FDA will replace HCFA on October 1, 1994, as the Federal agency responsible for surveying and certifying suppliers of screening mammography services in accordance with the new MQSA standards. VI. Delay in the Effective Date As required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), we generally provide for final rules not to be effective until 30 days after the date of publication unless we find good cause to waive the delay. As a result of the implementation of the MQSA by FDA, we are conforming the conditions for Medicare coverage of screening mammography services to the applicable FDA certification requirements, published in the Federal Register on December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67558 and 58 FR 67565), that all Medicare suppliers of services must meet effective October 1, 1994. We view the changes made by this rule as merely interpretative. The APA does not require that there be a delayed effective date for an interpretative rule. Accordingly, this rule will be effective October 1, 1994, the effective date of the FDA requirements on mammography services.
