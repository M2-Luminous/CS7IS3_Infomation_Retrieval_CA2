[Delorme] The accords reveal a certain complicity between the United States and Europe, rather than competition. They have arranged the resources so as to allow the two major powers to support their agricultural sectors, protect their imports, and subsidize their exports. The countries that hoped for a real opening up of the markets, such as those in the Cairns group, have been greatly disappointed. They cannot support their exports financially. Nor do they have the political power that would allow them to reject an agreement drafted without their participation. [LE QUOTIDIEN] What are the future stakes for the countries in the European Union? [Delorme] The agreement requires the Community to implement the CAP seriously. The reduction in prices for which it called has in effect been canceled out by the measures adopted following the monetary chaos in the fall of 1992. The green ECU [European currency unit], which expresses the guaranteed agricultural prices, was aligned with the mark at that time. In this way, Germany avoided a reduction in its prices just a few months prior to the legislative elections. But the other countries had to raise theirs. Apart from its budgetary cost, this policy threatens the competitive capacity of European products, grains in particular, since they are minimally differentiated products that are very sensitive to relative prices. Their price increases have prevented these countries from winning back the European market, in competing with the substitutes imported for animal feed, but they will also prevent them from exporting without subsidization in the future. France obtained a commitment from its partners not to expand their fallow land areas further. But how, then, will the future price drops be offset? By the European budget, but with a reduction in aid to the Mediterranean producers? Or by the national budgets, with a favorable modulation for the major producers? [LE QUOTIDIEN] Can France manage the future of its agricultural sector in the post-GATT era? [Delorme] Public assistance to the agricultural sector will have to be reorganized. In all the sectors, including grain production as well as livestock breeding, both the very large operations and those of medium size feel that they have been weakened, because they cannot modernize without the assistance of the state. The choice of those among them that must receive priority support is above all a sociopolitical choice. On the international level, France will from now on have an opportunity for alliances that are more varied than its traditional link with Germany within the Community. The United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Denmark, all countries that import grains, look with favor on a reduction in prices. Paris could also obtain support from Washington in the effort to persuade Germany to lower its prices. And so France could give priority to production with substantial added value, rather than focusing solely on grains.
