At present, it has sold 261 total sets of spare parts to MD, including both simple products like main landing-gear doors and advanced ones like electronic cabin doors and tailplanes which set more strict demands on technology and skills. The Shanghai Aircraft Factory has played an important role in Sino-U.S. high-tech cooperations during recent years. Apart from active competition on the world's spare parts markets, it has also introduced advanced technology and management experience from McDonnell Douglas to jointly manufacture MD-82 and MD-83 aircrafts.
