Whether North Korea will withdraw its 20,000 workers and equipment from Siberia is a matter of concern. Meanwhile, North Korea and Russia held its first forestry meeting in Pyongyang in early December to sign a new agreement. However, the meeting broke up because the sides had significantly different views. They reportedly agreed to hold a second meeting in Moscow. North Korea is expected to accept all of Russia's demands.
