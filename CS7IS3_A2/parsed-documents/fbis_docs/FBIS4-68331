A before-and-after study of the thermal radiation and spectral optical characteristics was performed with the FM-59, TRM-I, SF-26, and IKS-29 instruments with attachments for recording the mirror and diffuse components of reflection in the visible and IR ranges. Structural studies were done with optical and electron microscopy and low-angle x-ray scattering. For coatings that were 3 �m or more thick and were applied to both sides of a substrate, electron microscopy revealed that large, lengthwise pores about 1 �m wide were essentially intact after the yearlong exposure. The pores in the samples with fine coatings applied to only one side of a substrate, however, underwent structural changes in which the submicropores coalesced. Those coatings produced conditions favorable to processes controlled by surface diffusion. Exposure to open space raised the levels of reflection for the one-sided, thin coatings, and a substantial dimensional effect associated with coating thickness was observed on the radiation and thermal stability for the thin coatings. In general, diffusional changes in the substructure of the aluminum condensates were the primary source of degradation of the optical properties of the thin coatings. No appreciable changes were observed in the morphology of surface relief or optical characteristics in the thicker coatings. Figures 3, references 10 (Russian).
