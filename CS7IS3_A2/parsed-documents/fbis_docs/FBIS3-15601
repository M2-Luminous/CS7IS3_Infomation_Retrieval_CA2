Ossetia Leader Supports Yeltsin Statehood Concept LD0703211394 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 2054 GMT 7 Mar 94 LD0703211394 Moscow ITAR-TASS Language: English Article Type:BFN [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] [Text] Vladikavkaz March 7 TASS -- "The expanded session of the government of the Russian Federation has mapped out the contours of our common approach towards solving economic problems," North Ossetian President Askharbek Galazov said. In an interview with ITAR-TASS at Vladikavkaz's airport upon his return from Moscow on Monday, Galazov said that he supported the idea of strengthening Russian statehood announced by President Boris Yeltsin. This provides the basis for continuing reform, overcoming the crisis, carrying out structural reform and creating conditions for economic, political and social stabilisation, Galazov said. He welcomed the president's state-of-the-nation address as a starting point for developing and carrying out social and economic policy in regions. Speaking about the prospects for implementing economic reforms in North Ossetia, its leader said that the republic is an integral part of Russia. Its multi-national population cannot perceive its development in isolation from other republics and regions of the North Caucasus and the rest of Russia. Galazov described the situation in the republic as stable. However, there are certain forces in the region which are seeking to push the peoples of North Ossetia and Ingushetia to confrontation, he said. Galazov confirmed his initiative to hold, without mediators, a meeting between the presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia to discuss ways to restore peace and streamline bilateral relations.
