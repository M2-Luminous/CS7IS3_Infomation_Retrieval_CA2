Yitzhaq Levi, National Religious Party [NRP] secretary general, said: If you want to know the truth, do not trust the Israeli Government; listen to 'Arafat's remarks. The NRP faction held a special meeting and decided to file a motion of no confidence. Tzomet Knesset Member [MK] Moshe Peled said that he exposed the fact that the Cairo agreements include five secret addenda three weeks ago. They said I am mad, Peled said. The five addenda, according to Peled, refer to: the Palestinian right of return; an expansion of the Palestinian police force; granting the autonomy a consular status in Jerusalem; a festive ceremony by 'Arafat and his guards in Jerusalem; and a discussion of Jerusalem's final status. [Peled] And Rabin never presented this to the public. Therefore, I believe this is a total fraud. [Hecht] Likud faction chairman Moshe Qatzav demands that the government immediately present before the Knesset all the secret documents. Moledet Chairman Rehav'am Ze'evi demands that Yitzhaq Rabin immediately announce that all the agreements signed with 'Arafat are invalid. The Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza stated that 'Arafat's remarks prove that the Israeli Government has taken the path of selling out even Jerusalem. The council says it will do everything it can to stop the deterioration.
