The basic indices of this document which will have to be sent to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have been agreed, CBR Board Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko told INTERFAX. He thought that the memorandum could be sent to the IMF before the Russian parliament approves the 1994 budget. After analyzing the memorandum the IMF ruling body will decide on making the second part, worth $1.5 Bn, of the systemic credit available to Moscow. Gerashchenko thought that Russia would have that amount as early as in May. The credit will be used to offset the budget deficit which is expected to be 62.4 Tn rubles. The credit will be distributed through the Russian interbank market.
