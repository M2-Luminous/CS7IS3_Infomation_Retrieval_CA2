Hata said at a press conference that it is up to Watanabe himself to decide on his actions but things will not "make progress if he is within the LDP." Watanabe, a former foreign minister, said Sunday he will leave the LDP as early as Monday, hoping to run for the premiership following Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's announcement that he will resign. However, Watanabe, in talks with LDP President Yohei Kono earlier in the day, said he still needs more time to decide whether he will leave the main opposition party. Hata said if Watanabe, 70, had decided on his actions earlier, he could have won "understanding from various people." Hata was apparently referring to a number of LDP members who were thinking about following Watanabe in leaving the LDP, delivering a serious blow to the party. Hata is considered the top candidate to become the next prime minister.
