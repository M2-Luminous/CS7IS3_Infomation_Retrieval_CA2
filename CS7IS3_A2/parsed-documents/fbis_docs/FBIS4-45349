These police units will have agents from the Federal and State Public Prosecutors' Offices present to assist them. The latter will submit joint reports to the authorities on the three government levels, under the political responsibility of the federal chief executive, the state governor, and the mayor of Tijuana, in their respective jurisdictions.
