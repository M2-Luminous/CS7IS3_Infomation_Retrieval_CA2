FR940921-0-00049 FR940921-0-00016 Summary of the proposal: EPA did not specifically address in the November 5, 1992 proposal the applicability of on-board diagnostics (OBD) requirements to gaseous-fueled vehicles. This is because the OBD regulations were not promulgated until after the gaseous-fueled vehicle standards were proposed. 17 However, EPA proposed that emission standards for gaseous-fueled vehicles generally be equivalent to those for other vehicles. Implicit in that proposal is that gaseous-fueled vehicles would be required to meet the same OBD requirements as other vehicles (OBD II or Federal OBD, as applicable by model year). 17 58 FR 9468, February 19, 1993. Summary of the comments: The Agency received several comments concerning OBD. These comments fell into two general areas. First, several commenters requested that the Agency clarify the applicability of OBD requirements to gaseous-fueled vehicles. Second, comments were received stating that additional leadtime should be allowed for natural gas-fueled vehicles to comply with OBD. The OBD provisions as promulgated require OBD systems to monitor for conditions which would result in certain increases in THC emissions. The argument for additional leadtime centered around the fact that natural gas vehicles will only be subject to NMHC standards while all other vehicles are subject to THC standards. During the course of the OBD rulemaking comments were received suggesting that natural gas systems only be required to measure NMHC emission effects. Commenters argued that the technology likely to be used to monitor for increases in THC could not be readily adapted to monitor for increases in NMHC. The Agency received a comment suggesting that a delay until 1998 would allow sufficient leadtime to develop the technology needed for natural gas-fueled vehicles to meet the OBD requirements. EPA response to comments: The OBD requirements contained in the February 19, 1993 rule were established pursuant to section 202(m) of the Clean Air Act. That subsection provides, in pertinent part: (1) [T]he Administrator shall promulgate regulations under subsection (a) requiring manufacturers to install on all new light duty vehicles and light duty trucks diagnostic systems capable of_ (A) accurately identifying *␣*␣* emission-related systems deterioration or malfunction *␣*␣* which could cause or result in failure of the vehicles to comply with emission standards established under this section. By its terms, the OBD provision applies only to vehicles for which emission standards have been established under section 202. The regulations promulgated on February 19, 1993 simply add a new requirement that all new light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks be equipped with an emission control diagnostic system capable of identifying emissions-related deterioration and malfunction as detailed in the regulations. 18 Therefore, this provision would seem to apply automatically to gaseous-fueled vehicles as soon as mandatory emissions standards are established for those vehicles. 18 58 FR at 9485; 40 CFR 86.094&hyph;17. EPA agrees that leadtime until the 1998 model year is necessary for full implementation of the Federal OBD requirements for natural gas-fueled vehicles. Therefore, under today's regulations, implementation of Federal OBD systems will not be required for certification prior to model year 1998. This is the case for both for voluntary certification prior to model year 1997, and for mandatory certification in model year 1997. However, consistent with the approach taken in the OBD rule for vehicles granted a waiver from Federal OBD requirements on feasibility grounds, natural gas-fueled vehicles certified in the 1997 model year or optionally prior to the 1997 model year will be required to comply with OBD I provisions. EPA believes that allowing leadtime for natural gas-fueled vehicles until the 1998 model year is legally consistent with sections 202(m) and 202(a). To be sure, section 202(m)(2) specifically provides that the required OBD regulations shall take effect in model year 1994, subject to the Administrator's authority to waiver application of the regulations for model years 1994 and/or 1995 for any vehicle for which the Administrator determines the regulations would be infeasible in those model years. But EPA believes that Congress intended this effective date provision to apply only to vehicles for which standards existed at the time of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. EPA does not believe that Congress intended this provision to require OBD to be implemented immediately upon promulgation of any emission standards under section 202(a)(1) for new kinds of alternative-fueled vehicles at any point after 1995. EPA cannot adopt new emission standards for natural gas-fueled vehicles that would trigger a mandatory OBD requirement that is not feasible. It is also unreasonable to believe Congress intended that EPA refrain from establishing mandatory emission standards for natural gas-fueled vehicles simply because an infeasible OBD requirement would automatically apply once such standards are established. The Agency's efforts to ensure that natural gas fueled vehicles' emissions are no greater than their petroleum-fueled counterparts should not be frustrated by a concern that compliance with an OBD requirement requires more leadtime than compliance with the emission standards themselves.
