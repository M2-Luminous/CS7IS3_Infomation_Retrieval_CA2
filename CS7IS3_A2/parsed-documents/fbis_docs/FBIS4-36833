FBIS4-36833 "drnes114_o_94008" FBIS-NES-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 SYRIA Paper: U.S. Efforts Require `New Determination' Paper: U.S. Efforts Require `New Determination' JN1406080094 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 14 Jun 94 JN1406080094 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Press review] [Text] Under the headline "The Separate Solution and the Carrot Policy," TISHRIN says in an editorial: The separate solution cannot guarantee dignity or rights to those who chose it as a means to end the conflict with Israel. The Gaza-Jericho agreement is fresh, living proof of this. The paper adds: The Oslo agreement maintained the Israeli economic hegemony and turned the self-rule leaders into tax collectors begging for help and charity from the Arab and world financial centers. The paper stresses that the separate solution means abandoning the international legitimacy and UN resolutions, as well as the principles on which the peace process was based. It also means that Israel is appointed the only point of reference for all agreements and steps that may be accomplished. The paper adds: Israel is not only eating the carrot, but also the hand that extends it. The paper reviews the ceaseless aggressive Israeli conduct toward the Arabs, the oppressive and repressive acts in the occupied Arab territories, the acts of piracy against Lebanon, and its continued attempts to implement plans for hegemony and tutelage over the region. TISHRIN concludes: Separate solutions will not bring security, peace, or dignity to the Arabs; nor will they return to them their usurped rights. That is why Israel adopted such solutions. That is also why Syria opposed them and adhered to the comprehensive solution that will allow the Arab parties to negotiate from a position of strength and force Israel to make a full withdrawal and recognize the Arab rights in full. Under the headline "Christopher's Tour And What Is Required From The United States," AL-BA'TH says: U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will be returning to the region and we do not know if he will be carrying anything new to deal with the conditions for a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace. However, Secretary Christopher knows that the obstruction comes from Israel, and not the Arabs. It is Israel which is occupying the Arabs' territory, staging aggression against them every day, and defying the international will. The paper notes that the new endeavor must have new determination, not less than that displayed by Foster Dulles and the late U.S. President Eisenhower during the tripartite aggression against Egypt. The paper adds: We do not want the United States to be in conflict with its ally, Israel, but we do not want it to be against the Arabs, especially since it has seen the Arabs' concern for what is right. The paper stresses that the Syria of Hafiz al-Asad does not bargain, nor does it gamble with its national and pan-Arab principles as some people have done and are doing. AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Before Christopher's departure for the region, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin said that he sticks to occupation and refuses to withdraw from the Golan Heights. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres also played down the significance of the U.S. secretary's visit. We therefore feel that Israel is seeking to foil or call off the event. This shows the extent of Israel's obstruction of peace and the peace efforts. Under the headline "The Israeli Obstruction," AL-THAWRAH says: If it was not for Israel's intransigent conduct, the peace process would have made great strides toward achieving its objective. Israel's insistence on depriving the peace process of its substance and diverting it from its correct course prevented any progress. The paper feels that effective pressure must be applied against Israel to force it to change its policy into a serious policy that agrees with the international will and responds, without any hesitation, to the requirements of peace, particularly complete withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories. AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: The United States is the only party that can apply such pressure on Israel since it is one of the peace process sponsors and the source of the unjustified support for Israel. Will the United States start exercising its responsibility in showing concern for continuing the peace process until it achieves its goal of a just and comprehensive peace? In another commentary entitled "Who Rejects Peace," AL-THAWRAH says: Israel's attempts to cast doubts on Syria's intentions toward peace constitute an aggression against the international legitimacy, which acknowledged that there can be no peace in the Middle East without Syria. The paper stresses that Syria will not allow Israel to deprive peace of its just substance.
