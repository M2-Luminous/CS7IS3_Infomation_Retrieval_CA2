Implications for Non-Renewable Oxygenates EPA believes the 30 percent level will provide the benefits identified above and stimulate the development of a diverse supply of oxygenates for the oxygenate market. The 30 percent requirement will ensure a strong role for renewable oxygenates in the RFG program while still permitting the majority of the RFG oxygenate market share to be open to any oxygenate, regardless of the feedstocks used to produce it. Even with today's rule, production of MTBE and its methanol feedstock is projected to increase because of the increased demand for oxygenates in the United States as the RFG program takes effect. MTBE demand would increase by 3.1 billion gallons annually if it is used in all of the remaining 70 percent of the RFG oxygenate market. Such an expansion equals an approximate increase of 170 percent from current MTBE usage levels. While EPA acknowledges that MTBE and methanol demand might be even greater in the absence of today's rule, it is important to note that the RFG program is likely to result in dramatic growth in MTBE, methanol, and ethanol production. Furthermore, MTBE producers can modify their facilities at relatively modest expense to produce ETBE if its use should prove economically advantageous given the requirements of the RFG program and today's rule. Similar conclusions hold true for the natural gas industry. Natural gas is used to produce methanol and isobutylene, which in turn are used to produce MTBE. Since MTBE production is projected to grow from current levels as a result of the RFG program, EPA expects the demand for natural gas for oxygenate production to grow as well. Furthermore, isobutylene derived from natural gas is expected to play a major role in ETBE production. It should also be noted that oxygenate production represents a small portion of total demand for natural gas. For these reasons, EPA does not believe that today's action will result in significant adverse effects on the MTBE, methanol, or natural gas industries, as their markets will dramatically increase with or without today's action. This is particularly the case since a considerable amount of ethanol was likely to have been used to satisfy the RFG program requirements absent today's rule. As discussed in section III.F, based on the expansion of ethanol production capacity planned prior to this rule, ethanol could potentially have been used to fulfill 15 percent of the oxygenate requirement of the RFG program. F. Timing and Phase-In 1. Introduction In the NPRM, EPA proposed to require that renewable oxygenates be used to meet 30 percent of the 2.0 weight percent oxygen requirement for the RFG program. However, at that time EPA was concerned whether adequate supplies of renewable oxygenates would be available and whether the distribution infrastructure was sufficient during the initial years of the program without disrupting existing markets for such oxygenates or incurring excessive costs. With that in mind, the proposal requested comments concerning these issues. More specifically, comments were requested on the appropriate level of the renewable oxygenate requirement, leadtime requirements associated with providing adequate renewable oxygenate supplies, the potential need for a phase-in period, and any other supply-related issues. In response, EPA received considerable information on the current and projected supply of renewable oxygenates, as well as less complete information regarding the logistics of renewable oxygenate distribution. The detailed analysis is contained in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), and is summarized below. Based on the projected supply of renewable oxygenates over time and the leadtime required to establish blending and storage facilities, EPA has concluded that, while the market can readily bear a 30 percent requirement given adequate leadtime, a phase-in of the 30 percent requirement is necessary. Therefore, EPA is requiring that 15 percent of the RFG program's 2.0 weight percent oxygen requirement be met from renewable oxygenate sources in 1995, and that the full 30 percent of the oxygen requirement be met from such sources in 1996 and thereafter. The purpose of EPA's analysis was to determine whether sufficient renewable oxygenate supply, distribution, tankage, and blending capacity would be available in 1995 and 1996 to meet the program requirements. Failure to have sufficient supply, distribution, tankage, or blending capacity for the considerable increase in renewable oxygenate demand could result in shortages or price spikes and could interfere with the orderly implementation of the reformulated gasoline program. In addition, EPA considered it to be desirable for a variety of reasons to limit to the extent possible any need to displace substantial amounts of ethanol from existing markets. First, displacing ethanol from existing markets would do nothing to expand the use of renewable oxygenates and achieve the resulting benefits. Second, shifting ethanol from existing markets to RFG markets would not stimulate the introduction of more advanced renewable fuels production technology. Third, as described in sections III.H and VI of this notice, the use of ethanol from new or expanded plants is projected to displace more fossil energy than would ethanol from existing plants. Fourth, relatively high prices for ethanol would be needed to displace it from existing markets, leading to higher than necessary price increases for RFG during the initial years of the program. Ethanol purchase contracts may already be established for 1995, and breaking such agreements in order to shift ethanol from existing gasoline markets to RFG markets might be difficult and costly. Furthermore, approximately half of current ethanol consumption occurs in states which offer substantial tax credits for ethanol blends. These credits are equal in value to between 10 and 20 cents per gallon of ethanol. To induce ethanol suppliers to shift ethanol from such markets to unsubsidized markets would likely require a purchase price in excess of current market prices for ethanol equal to or greater than the value of the tax credits available in existing markets. In addition, ethanol is currently used in many markets to provide the added octane for mid-grade and premium gasolines. These gasoline grades enjoy a considerable retail price premium which can be reflected in the price paid for the ethanol. These price premiums for ethanol blended mid-grade and premium gasolines may not be available to the same extent in the new renewable oxygenate markets, particularly for the full amount of ethanol expected to be blended under the renewable oxygenate program.
