The motto of this paper which you can notice in each of its issues is the expression: "The only way to establish peace in the Balkans is the Hellenization of the entire Balkans." On March 2, 1994 the same paper warned for "the creation of the units which would fight for the `defence' of the North Epirus and the Hellenization in general." In the reprinted photo, the eyes of the terrorists have been covered in order that they be not identified. Hence, this newspaper which makes a pure warmongering propaganda has full knowledge of the activity of the terroristic groups and protects them. What about the Greek Government, does it know anything about these facts? According to STOKHOS, there are at least 8 units of the "liberation army." What is the Greek Government's attitude towards them and towards such papers as STOKHOS, which stir up war in the Balkans and declare openly their chauvinistic aims? It not only does not take any measure against them but on the contrary, in relation with the latest crime in Albania, Greek authorities declare that the Albanian party did not present facts at a time when the terrorists have posed for Greek papers. Greece is a member of the EC and it knows well the international laws especially that which does not allow the changing of the borders through violence. Above the photo of the terrorists, the STOKHOS had written: "Fear in Tirana From the Strong Attack." The Greek andarts [as received] have once learned well how much the Albanians have feared them but it is clear that those who write in this paper are men who have never known any bravery. To come and go at night, to kill people at their back, this is their bravery. Anyhow it is good for the Greek Government to act before criminals and terroristic groups that come from its territory undertake other adventures, thus not creating themselves the possibility of experiencing how greatly the Albanians "fear" them.
