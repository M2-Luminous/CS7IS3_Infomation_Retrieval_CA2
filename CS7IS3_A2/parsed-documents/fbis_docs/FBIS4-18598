The Social Democrats supposedly want to address a complaint to the Federal Constitutional Court in this matter. [Scharping] With its propagandistic contributions, the Federal Press Office is increasingly abetting the present government, its spokesman Dieter Vogel is deceiving parliament, and his office is infringing upon political neutrality that is prescribed by the Constitution. Because State Secretary Vogel is responsible for the Federal Press Office, he should bear the consequences for this affair and resign from his post. The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will use all parliamentary means to resolve this situation. It is now working on a motion that will initiate a ban on the continued publication of such contributions by the Federal Press Office. [passage omitted]
