Speaking on the event, Mr. Michael Heseltine, president of ECGD Board of Trade [title as received], said: "I am delighted that ECGD is one of the first export credit agencies to restore medium and long term cover for Vietnam. ECGD has enormous potential and Vietnam is poised for major trade expansion and economic growth in which ECGD can play an important role". The British ambassador to Vietnam, Mr. Peter Williams, said: "I am happy that this very necessary facility has been reintroduced. By insuring British exports, I see it as an excellent instrument to further increase the trade links between Vietnam and the United Kingdom and thereby to further cement our ever-increasing relationship in all fields".
