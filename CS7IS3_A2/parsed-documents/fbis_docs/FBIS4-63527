As Vyacheslav Chornovil, head of the Rukh deputies' group explained, members of the Rukh, Reform, Statehood, and some deputies from the Center group decided to refrain from registering following a joint meeting of group leaders under the chairmanship of Oleksandr Moroz. Vyacheslav Chornovil said that Petro Symonenko (from the Communists of Ukraine in support of social justice and democracy group), Serhiy Dovhan (Agrarians of Ukraine group), and a representative from the Center group, said that Oleksandr Tkachenko, one of the leaders of the Agrarian group and former agriculture minister, was a realistic candidate for the post of deputy speaker of the parliament. The national democrats made a final decision to block the work of the session after Oleksandr Moroz said Vasyl Durdynets had no chances of becoming first deputy speaker and this was why he was supporting Oleksandr Tkachenko's candidacy. At a meeting of the Rukh group, held in the chamber immediately after the registration, the view was expressed that a tough position with regard to the communist majority must continue to be maintained. The start of a campaign to gather 112 signatures to recall Oleksandr Moroz, speaker of the Supreme Council, was also not excluded.
