Speaking at a news conference on Saturday [12 February], Hall very sharply criticized the achievements of the Pawlak Government so far. "Those who thought this government would continue the work of its predecessors should take a closer look. There is no question of a sensible alternative to this government, either," he said. In Hall's opinion, the government has failed to present a scenario for any sphere of public life. The Conservative leader also criticized the Pawlak Government's personnel policy. "People are selected on the basis of political criteria, rather than professional criteria. Persons who gained notoriety under the People's Republic are receiving back high-ranking posts," he said. He viewed the latest conflict inside the coalition as evidence of a lack of elementary political culture and an inability to think in terms of the state. In view of the strength of the postcommunist camp, the forces of "Post-August Poland" must seek an accord, Hall said. The June local government elections are going to be trial of strength for them. Next, the post-Solidarity parties should produce a single candidate in the presidential elections strong enough to oppose left-wing candidates, Hall said. In his opinion, if the Solidarity groups fail to get together, they will suffer another calamity. A Solidarity presidential candidate must have a political program, said Hall. He must possess the image of a statesman, and have enough prestige to gather the broadest possible support. Last but not least, he must appeal to the voters. "Kazimierz Ujazdowski only took a small number of activists away from the Conservative Party, even though these were good people," said Hall. "So there is no question of any disintegration of the Conservative Party. We have merely lost the Lower Silesian constituency, that is all." He said he had no intention of returning to the Democratic Union but, as head of the Conservative Party, he wants to "guard and champion conservative values," even if such an attitude causes a temporary crisis among the Conservatives.
