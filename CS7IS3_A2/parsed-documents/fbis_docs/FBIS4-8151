Pal Lakatos, duty editor of "Sunday Newspaper," will be putting both the listeners' and his own questions to the prime minister. [Lakatos] [passage omitted] The collection of nomination slips for next month's elections closed on 8 April. According to the statistical data, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] can put up candidates in 166 places, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] in 172, the Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP] in 176, and the Workers' Party in 146. [passage omitted] On the basis of the figures, should one not, or do you not, fear the possibility of a shift to the left? [passage omitted] [Boross] On the basis of the figures I do not fear this. Otherwise, a tendency towards a shift to the left is something that everyone can sense. As for its proportion, that is something that only the elections will decide, and I hope that it will not be of a greater proportion than desired. These figures by themselves do not say anything. The nomination slip collections in more than one case were a show put on by campaign groups that tend to do this, rather than an expression of the personal qualities of the candidates. [passage omitted] [Lakatos] It is interesting to note that during the past few days on the part of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] there have been more and more appeals to the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]. It is generally known that you too would join a coalition with the KDNP if the chance presented itself. What is your opinion on this? [Boross] My opinion about this is that our cooperation with the KDNP is a natural one deriving from shared political orientations on the basis of shared principles and ideas. Whereas other parties -- the abovementioned one as well, I think -- would have to struggle with this difference in concept which separates them from the Christian Democrats. My impression is that the KDNP will not fall for various siren voices which are speaking in its direction, because it is aware that from the point of view of the party's future, it is extremely risky to conclude a political alliance contrary to the demands of the membership and the masses that support it. [Lakatos] Pardon the expression, but this is what people say, this is how they put it: Prime Minister Peter Boross is engaged in undermining work [aknamunkat vegez] to divide the party of the SZDSZ. At the same time they also say that he would like to lure the Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] to the MDF. [Boross] It is no accident that they use this word -- undermining. It is true that it takes place under ground and in secret and not in full view or within earshot of others. [passage omitted] My conviction is that in the SZDSZ there are two parties and two trends. I must add that the SZDSZ is the one that did not in any way split in the course of the trials of the previous four years. On the whole this sort of thing did happen to the parties, and in certain cases it ended sadly, as in the case of the smallholders. In others it could even be called a purification process. This split did not happen with the Free Democrats. However, this dual trend is perceivable in the SZDSZ. Now, in the case of Fidesz there is nothing: Our stance has not changed in any way. It is simply that Fidesz's national conference or congress, or I don't know know what they call it exactly, in Debrecen, proclaimed a national liberal profile. And naturally this aroused the attention of a national-orientated party, such as the MDF. But if this looks like some kind of allurement, then I have to say that this is not a well-meaning interpretation. We are looking for the motifs in every party that could become the basis for future cooperation in the country's interest. Accepting the national trend is one very serious element of this, and it can be found without doubt in the case of Fidesz. However, this means nothing with regard to the future. At present we are rival parties in this election struggle and each represents his own principles and programs, which, in more than one case, clash. [Lakatos] Let us leave party politics proper for a moment and let us remember the date, today's date to be precise, 10 April 1994, when throughout the world people remember the 600,000 Hungarian Jews who perished in the Holocaust. Is this an occasion for the world to bow its head? [Boross] It is an occasion for the world to bow its head; it is an occasion for every right-thinking person to bow his or her head; it is particularly an occasion for every right-thinking Hungarian to bow his or her head. On 19 March 1944 the country was caught up by the tragedy, the tragedy of the Nazi occupation. And what happened after that is the darkest point in Hungarian history, when old people, women, children indiscriminately were transported to their deaths. And these kinds of trains set off from this country. I think that the memory of this terror must shake everybody. [passage omitted] [Lakatos] Our late prime minister, Jozsef Antall, whose birthday, 62d birthday, would have been on 8 April, declared himself to be the prime minister -- in spirit -- of 15 million Hungarians. A listener from Nove Zamky [in Slovakia] asks: Do you think in exactly the same way? [Boross] I have already spoken about this; yes, I do think in exactly the same way. And on this occasion as well I would stress with great emphasis the oft-misquoted phrase of Jozsef Antall's -- in spirit -- lest it arouse excitement among those who would infer from this some kind of intention to change the borders, let alone to change the borders by force. Throughout the world there are 15 million Hungarians: four million here [in the neighboring countries], beyond the borders, and one million in the wide world who call themselves Hungarian. This has been their fate in the 20th century. And a Hungarian prime minister at all events must pay heed to these 15 million as well; and I think he has every moral basis for feeling himself to be the representative -- in spirit -- of 15 million Hungarians. [Lakatos] Istvan Gangesz from Budapest, telephone number 1320- 428, asks in connection with this: If you consider yourself the prime minister -- in spirit -- of 15 million Hungarians, then why did you permit 10,000 foreigners to privatize Hungarian industry? [Boross] I don't know who counted these 10,000, or where this figure comes from; I have no personal knowledge of this. I will give a very much simplified answer: In 1938 about 30 percent of Hungarian industry was in foreign ownership; at present this figure is around 10 percent, but it is not even as much as that. [passage omitted] A significant part of what has passed into foreign ownership in our country represents developed, modern, up-to-date technology; it means production in our country, wages paid in our country, and in every way it is a blessing to the country. [passage omitted] In any case, if this foreign capital were not to appear in Hungary, then the oft-repeated modernization, the problems caused by the oft-repeated shortage of capital, would never be resolved. I can reassure everybody: We take great care that this foreign investment should not go beyond the limits beyond which a country's self-determination, or its sovereignty, might become doubtful. Those who know us will know that we take extraordinary care about this and this is a real priority with us. [Lakatos] Prime Minister, are you not afraid, after these remarks, that the accusation of the recent past will be revived, namely that you are conducting success propaganda? [Boross] [passage omitted] These four years have been full of a lot of bitterness and a lot of counter-propaganda. There have been results, and the Hungarian economy -- but not just the economy, other sectors as well -- has started on an irreversible road. I know that this is not yet making itself felt directly in the households, but it carries within it the promise of the future. [Lakatos] Allow me to quote the words of Gyula Horn, HSP [Hungarian Socialist Party] chairman. Gyula Horn's message to the voters a few days ago was: Dismiss this MDF-led government which gives the people, the nation, as its authority, but which in the meantime, dispossesses [kisemmiz] the majority. [Boross] Well, one could quote numerous other things from Gyula Horn's ex-cathedra sentences. [passage omitted] This far I can understand it, because Gyula Horn wishes to have a socialist government; after all this is the essence of the election struggle now. Only, this socialist government has already existed once; at least, in the two years prior to 1990 it called itself a socialist reform government. Anyone who has a good memory will remember what it achieved with this reform. My conviction is that it would be very bad for the country if it listened to Gyula Horn. [passage omitted] [Lakatos] Agnes Csongradi from Budapest, or possibly not Budapest -- the telephone number is 133-203 -- remarks or asks: Will you be leaving the velvet seat with a clear conscience after having sold off the country? And she hopes that the new government will be much better than the present one. [Lakatos] [passage omitted] Will you be leaving the velvet seat with a clear conscience? We don't want to, and I personally do not want to leave this velvet seat, I who have held the post of prime minister for six months, not even for six months. But let me put it [the velvet chair] into quotation marks. This much-vaunted velvet seat is full of quite unpleasant fakir's nails. [passage omitted] [Lakatos] [passage omitted] If we have a look at the popularity ratings and if I remember well, you received a rating of around 20 percent, while the MDF received around 10 percent. These two data suggest that you may be the most popular candidate for prime minister, but if your party does not win the elections, then you are not going to be a prime minister. [Boross] The listeners should know that I can only be the prime minister of the country if they cast their vote for the MDF. [passage omitted] I aspire to be the prime minister of the country for four years so that I can put my ideas into practice in the country's economy and other fields. [Lakatos] Several opposition politicians say if they enter government they will complete the compensation process; however, they cannot give any compensation for the past four years. [Boross] Well, this is the usual irony. [passage omitted] But as far as compensation is concerned, I think that there can be many types of privatization, but privatization as a means of compensation has its own moral underpinning. [Lakatos] It would be worth talking about what the country was like in 1990 when this coalition entered government and what it is like today. Just a few important facts need to be mentioned. [Boross] [passage omitted] This country was on the brink of insolvency. It has already been said several times that the foreign currency reserves today are nearly 10 times what the previous government had at its disposal. [Lakatos] Then it was 800 million dollars and now it is nearly 7 billion dollars. [Boross] Yes, around 7 billion, but this number is moving. [passage omitted] I refute allegations that the country is in a worse condition now -- especially now, when there is no writer on economic topics or economist who would deny that industrial production grew by 10 percent at the beginning of this year. [passage omitted] [Lakatos] However, many say that to implement the tasks more quickly, debt rescheduling would be necessary. [passage omitted] [Boross] [passage omitted] We have already transformed the country's short-term debts into medium and long-term debts to make these years easier. It was only possible because we give the impression of being a stable country with our financial reserves and internal relations. [passage omitted] If somebody has reserves like Hungary has and submits a request for rescheduling over an even longer period, then on the one hand it will be turned down, and on the other hand it will give a very bad impression on the international market, where every tiny movement is closely monitored. They would arrive at the conclusion that the country is insolvent. [passage omitted]
