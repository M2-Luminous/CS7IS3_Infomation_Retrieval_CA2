FR940318-1-00002 FR940318-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 7 CFR Part 28 [CN&hyph;94&hyph;002] RIN 0581&hyph;AA85 User Fees for Cotton Classification Services to Growers AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is proposing to reduce user fees for cotton producers for cotton classification services under the Cotton Statistics and Estimates Act in accordance with the formula provided in the Uniform Cotton Classing Fees Act of 1987, as amended by Public Law 102&hyph;237. The 1993 user fee for this classification service was $1.87 per bale. This proposal would reduce the fee for the 1994 crop to $1.80 per bale. The proposed reduction in fees is due to increased efficiency in classing operations and is sufficient to recover the costs of providing classification services, including costs for administration, supervision, and standardization costs. DATES: Comments must be received by April 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and inquiries should be addressed to Lee Cliburn, Cotton Division, AMS, USDA, room 2641&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456. Comments will be available for public inspection during regular business hours at the above office in rm. 2641&hyph;South Building, 14th & Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lee Cliburn, 202&hyph;720&hyph;2145. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This proposed rule has been determined to be non-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by OMB. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has considered the economic impact of this proposal on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesses subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be disproportionately burdened. The Administrator of AMS has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the RFA because: (1) The fee reduction reflects a decrease in the cost-per-unit currently borne by those entities utilizing the services; (2) the cost reduction will not affect competition in the marketplace; and (3) the use of classification services is voluntary.
