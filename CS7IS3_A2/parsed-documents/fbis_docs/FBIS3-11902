Robaina spoke to PRENSA LATINA after holding a news conference here today. He emphasized that his visit to Vietnam ends what was announced as a diplomatic offensive in several regions of the world to explain to several governments the truth about Cuba and to study economic experiences. Our tours to the Caribbean and several Latin American countries in the past months and our tour to Asia now have given our interlocutors a broad vision of the process that is taking place in Cuba within a climate of respect and understanding, he explained. Robaina indicated that in those contacts, Cuba was allowed to explain its current situation in its own words and was able to say things that are generally omitted by the big international media sources. We are a country open to dialogue and willing to negotiate everything except our independence, sovereignty, and basic revolutionary achievements. We are willing to do so without any preconditions but based on the respect due to us for the place we have won in the world, he sentenced. Cuba is not the hell it is said to be or the paradise it wants to be and, thus, does not have to be placed on the defendant's bench. From this moment on, we will coin the phrase offensive diplomacy as part of our legitimate aspiration to consolidate and expand our country's international relations, he added. Robaina, who is probably the world's youngest foreign minister (38 years), said 1994 would be a year of very arduous work that would include a new tour to Latin America. The tour, which is to start in April, will include visits to Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. His project also includes a visit to the Middle East in the near future. However, before this, he will host an encounter called "The Nation and Emigration" to which members of the Cuban community abroad have been invited. The meeting, scheduled to be held on 22, 23, and 24 April in Havana, will be attended by Cuban citizens who reside in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, the Caribbean, and other countries. The Cuban foreign minister remarked the purpose of the meeting was to normalize ties between Cuba and its community abroad as all other nations do. "All the Cubans of goodwill who want to talk to their fatherland are invited. Only aggressiveness and hysteria have not been called," he added. Going back to his tour of Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Burma, Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam, which he started on 8 March, Robaina emphasized the importance of exchanging ideas and of analyzing very valuable economic experiences in one of the world's most flourishing areas. He highlighted that Vietnam had been one of the most important points in his tour due to the traditional bilateral ties of friendship and cooperation and reiterated that Cuba applauds and studies with particular attention, the economic process started by Hanoi eight years ago. At his farewell, Robaina confessed to Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai that he was impressed with the progress made by this Indo-Chinese country since he last visited it in 1990. He reiterated his government's gratitude to the Vietnamese Government and people for their concrete actions of solidarity with the Cubans. Accompanied by Ambassador Tania Maceira and adviser Carlos Amores, among other officials, Robaina traveled to the southern Ho Chi Minh city where he will end his tour to Southern and Southeastern Asia tomorrow.
