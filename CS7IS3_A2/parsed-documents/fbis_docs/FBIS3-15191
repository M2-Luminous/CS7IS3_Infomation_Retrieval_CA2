The first batch of missiles will be sent to Russia in the next few weeks, he told reporters in Kiev. Shmarov said that as soon as Russia gives the green light to the delivery of nuclear fuel to Ukraine, "we will give the green light to the transfer of nuclear warheads". He said there was no signal from Russia yet. The SEGODNYA newspaper referring to well-informed sources reported on Wednesday that a trainload of Ukrainian nuclear warheads was due to arrive at a closed town in the Urals on March 2.
