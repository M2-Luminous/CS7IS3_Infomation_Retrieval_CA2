FBIS4-51017 "drchi100_a_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS General Justice Ministry Refutes Report on 4 June Prisoners Justice Ministry Refutes Report on 4 June Prisoners HK2305153094 Beijing XINHUA Hong Kong Service in Chinese 1417 GMT 23 May 94 HK2305153094 Beijing XINHUA Hong Kong Service Chinese BFN [Text] Beijing, 23 May (XINHUA)--A relevant person in charge of China's Justice Ministry today pointed out here that the report distributed by the organizations such as "Human Rights Watch/Asia" on 19 May, which claimed that nearly 500 prisoners who were arrested during the "4 June" incident have been recently discovered in Beijing's No. 2 Prison and Qinghe Reform-Through-Labor Farm and have been mistreated is sheer rumor with ulterior motives. The relevant person in charge of the Justice Ministry made this remark today when responding to a question asked by a reporter who was conducting an interview in the Justice Ministry about this issue. The person in charge said that, during the "4 June" incident five years ago, criminal proceedings were brought against a small number of people according to law because they had carried out activities aimed at overthrowing the government or had engaged in crimes such as smashing, looting, burning, and killing. He said that an absolute majority of them have been released because they have obtained lenient treatment or have served their terms, and the situation of nearly 500 persons being imprisoned does not exist. The so-called "new discovery" by organizations such as "Human Rights Watch/Asia" is nothing but a new rumor created by them. This person in charge also said: Regarding the alleged coercion of prison inmates to be quality control workers for latex glove exports to the United States, investigations have found that the Beijing Municipal No 2 Prison signed a contract with a Beijing factory in 1991 to inspect its latex glove products. There were express provisions in the contract that all gloves to be inspected were to be sold domestically, and the contract has been effectively implemented. There was never any question about prisoners checking latex gloves which were exported to the United States, much less one about Beijing Municipal No 2 Prison producing latex gloves to be exported. This person in charge pointed out: Chinese prisons, including the Beijing Municipal No 2 Prison, in accordance with the law, treat their prisoners humanely. Chinese law expressly forbids using corporeal punishment or committing brutalities against prisoners. We conduct business strictly according to the relevant laws and undertake the civilized management of prisoners, who are given genuine legal protection. The Chinese "Penal Code" states that corporeal punishment, the mistreatment of inmates, and gross infringements of criminals' legitimate rights and interests are criminal offenses punishable by law. People's procuratorates at all levels have special prison-based agencies and staff to monitor the enforcement of these laws. The statement that the Beijing Municipal No 2 Prison beat, abused, and used corporeal punishment on prisoners is groundless and a pure fabrication. In conclusion, this person-in-charge finally pointed out: This was not the first time that "Human Rights Watch/Asia" and other such organizations have concocted hair-raising lies which they have spread to confuse public opinion. But lies are lies. Such malicious slander by organizations such as "Human Rights Watch/Asia" only succeeds in exposing their hostility toward the Chinese people.
