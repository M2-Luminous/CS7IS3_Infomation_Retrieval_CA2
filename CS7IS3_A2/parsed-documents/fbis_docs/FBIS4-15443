This was stated by Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius at a news conference today. The prime minister announced that President Algirdas Brazauskas yesterday signed a letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, describing all problems of cooperation. Lithuanian-Russian relations have been also discussed at a meeting of the foreign policy coordination council chaired by the president. Slezevicius also said that his letters and attempts to talk to Russian Prime minister Chernomyrdin remain without response. As is known, Lithuania is inviting Russia to confirm the note on the coming into force of the treaty on the most favorable trade regime. The treaty was signed last November in Vilnius, but Russia has so far not ratified it. The head of the Lithuanian Government also told the news conference that Russia is conducting an aggressive policy toward the Baltic states. It was also said at the news conference that if Russia does not change its attitude, Lithuania will take the same measures as regards the Kaliningrad region.
