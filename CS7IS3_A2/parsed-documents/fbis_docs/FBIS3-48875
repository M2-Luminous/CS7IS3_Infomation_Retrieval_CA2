As if reacting to the notion of a "normal nation" [futsu no kuni] advocated in Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's book: "A Plan to Rebuild Japan" [Nihon Kaizo Keikaku], Takemura proposes building Japan into a country which is small, but has a unique identity. Takemura and Ozawa, who are rumored to conflict in the ruling coalition parties, have apparently shown their sense of rivalry even in their books. Takemura's book directly refutes Ozawa's ideas. For instance, while Ozawa advocates the participation of the Self-Defense Forces in UN operations to make active international contributions, Takemura writes: "I do not agree with such ideas." While Takemura's aides stress: "This is not meant to clarify his relations with Mr. Ozawa," the book says: "When we cooperate with other political parties, the basis will be ideas on the Constitution, the future and image of Japan, international contributions...we would like to work hand in hand with political parties which share our ideas and will work with us toward a common goal." As Japan faces the second stage of the process of political realignment, there is bound to be more controversy between the two men.
