CNW has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead traffic on the line; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic requirement), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication) and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expressions of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on June 22, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 1 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 2 and trail use/rail banking statements under 49 CFR 1152.29 3 must be filed by June 2, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by June 13, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 1 A stay will be routinely issued by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation) cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay involving environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon as possible in order to permit the Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption. 2 See Exempt of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 3 The Commission will accept a late-filed trail use request as long as it retains jurisdiction to do so. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representatives: Thomas F. Flanagan, Chicago and North Western Transportation Company, 165 North Canal Street, Chicago, IL 60606. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. CNW has filed an environmental report which addresses the effects of the abandonment's effect, if any, on the environment or historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by May 27, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA from SEA by writing to SEA (room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: May 12, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12517 Filed 5&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
