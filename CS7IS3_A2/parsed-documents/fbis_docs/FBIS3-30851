The situation cannot be settled by a direct military intervention as this would only bring suffering to the civilian population, the fighting parties should be thoroughly separated and the units disarmed so that peace talks could be started, he added. The opposition Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) considers the events to be a "monstrous sign of war," but "the campaign which wants to use the massacre for an armed intervention is suspicious," the party's spokeswoman said. The campaign is motivated by an effort to create a suitable atmosphere for escalating an anti-Serbian military intervention in Bosnia, no wonder "that the campaign is as usual joined by some Czech governing circles," she added. Saturday's [5 February] Sarajevo massacre is a provocation which is to serve as a pretext for a "military intervention of the Western countries," a leader of the extreme opposition Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) said. "Even if the West resorted to force, we are firmly opposed to the Czech Republic being involved," he added.
