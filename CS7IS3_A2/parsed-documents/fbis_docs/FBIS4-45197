This announcement was made today by the agent from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF), Luis Ramon Balmori. He made this statement after witnessing the incineration of four tons of cocaine confiscated a month ago, as well as three tons of marijuana seized in various operations by the Federal Highway and Ports Police and the Federal Judicial Police. He declared that Coahuila now ranks first in drug confiscations, "because every week various amounts of narcotics, in most instances bound for the United States, are detected." He noted that surveillance operations have been intensified on all highways and at foreign transport terminals, adding that even minors have been found being used by drug dealers to carry drugs to the border. The drug burning took place at the facilities of the Sixth Military Zone, in a ceremony headed by the PGR's [Attorney General's Office] state representative, Maria del Refugio Martinez.
