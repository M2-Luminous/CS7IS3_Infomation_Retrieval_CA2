FR940906-1-00031 FR940906-1-00013 48 CFR Parts 22 and 52 [FAR Case 93&hyph;615] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Use of Convict Labor AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to remove all references to 18 U.S.C. 4082(c)(2), include the stipulation required by Executive Order 11755, as amended, in the clause for the convenience of users of the FAR, and add the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to the covered jurisdictions as required by Executive Order 12608. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before November 7, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW, Room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 93&hyph;615 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jack O'Neill at (202) 501&hyph;3856 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 93&hyph;615. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background A statutory provision (18 U.S.C. 4082(c)(2)), which is cited both in section 22.201 and in the clause at section 52.222&hyph;3, now applies only to offenses committed prior to November 1, 1987, and there is no statutory or Executive Order requirement to include it in the FAR. In addition, Executive Order 12608 adds the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to the jurisdictions covered by Executive Order 11755, which the FAR text and clause implement. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., because it merely deletes an unnecessary statutory reference and adds one jurisdiction (the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) to the coverage of the clause at 52.222&hyph;3. It also includes the stipulation required by Executive Order 11755, as amended, in the clause itself, which should be more convenient for users of the FAR but is not a substantial change. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subparts will also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 93&hyph;615), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 54 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.
