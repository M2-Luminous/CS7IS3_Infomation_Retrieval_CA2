FBIS4-3761 "drchi079_v_94003" FBIS-CHI-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Taiwan SEF Delegation To Visit Zhejiang SEF Delegation To Visit Zhejiang OW2504081894 Taipei CNA in English 0758 GMT 25 Apr 94 OW2504081894 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Lilian Wu] [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA)--Taiwan will soon send a delegation to the capital of Zhejiang Province to learn more about Mainland China's investigation into the March 31 Qiandao Lake incident, in which 24 Taiwan tourists were murdered and robbed, Li Ching-ping, deputy director-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Monday [25 February]. Li said that the delegation, to leave sometime this week, will be comprised of SEF officials, retired police detectives, and relatives of the victims. SEF is Taiwan's non-official conduit for mainland- Taiwan relations. This will be the first time Taiwan has sent a group to learn more about a criminal case on the mainland since the opening of cross- strait civilian exchanges, sources said. Beijing announced on April 17 that it arrested three men suspected of committing the "heinous murder, robbery and arson." Although Beijing has closed the probe of the case, it is still unable to answer some questions posed by the victims' relatives. Li called on Beijing to release autopsy reports made after the incident and said the Taiwan delegation will give the mainland time to prepare such reports if it has not done so already. Li added that a time and venue have not been picked for a proposed special meeting between SEF and its mainland counterpart the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) to discuss travel safety in the wake of the boat incident. Li said that SEF has asked ARATS to suggest a suitable time and venue for the meeting. SEF proposed to hold the meeting April 27-28 in either Hong Kong or Taipei.
