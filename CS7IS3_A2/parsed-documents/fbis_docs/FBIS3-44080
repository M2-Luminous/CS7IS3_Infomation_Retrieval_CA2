After 7 hours of talks in Pretoria that went into the early hours of this morning, the three sides failed to reach consensus on an inclusive constitutional deal, but they agreed to meet again later on today. Both government negotiator Roelf Meyer and ANC negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa said after the talks that they did not see much of a chance for agreement dealing with the Freedom Alliance's point of view. Conservative Party negotiator Dr. Corne Mulder indicated afterwards that the only deal which would be acceptable to the Freedom Alliance was a package which dealt with the alliance's demands.
