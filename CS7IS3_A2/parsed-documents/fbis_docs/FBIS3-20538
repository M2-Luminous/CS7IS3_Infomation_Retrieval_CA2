The difference is due to township enterprises. Practice proves that developing township enterprises is the key to increasing farmers' income. One argument is that developing township enterprises will affect agricultural production, but really, this is totally untrue. My province is the birthplace of township enterprises, and currently, the gross productive value and export for earning foreign exchange by township enterprises in the province occupies 50 percent of the province's total productive value and export for earning foreign exchange respectively. It really is like "half of the country." Meanwhile, township enterprises in Jiangsu Province have created the means by which industry can help agriculture. This is especially the case in southern Jiangsu where, annually and per capita, every township employee contributes 120 yuan to the agriculture development fund, 60 percent of agricultural expenditures comes from township enterprises, and agriculture and industry in southern Jiangsu have entered a "period of mutual assistance." Agricultural products continue to increase. Southern Jiangsu's experience proves that there is "no agricultural stability without industry." At present, the biggest problem in Jiangsu is how to improve farmers' income in the northern part of the province. Our general thinking is to do our utmost to go the way of merging trade, industry, and agriculture in order to develop agriculture as we link up the northern and southern parts to develop township enterprises, develop multiple operations which will promote sideline industries, supplying their primary accumulation to township enterprises in northern Jiangsu. The vegetable processing company run by the Agriculture Bureau in Lian Yun Gang municipality selected the "company plus farming families" way. It created over $7 million in 1993 from exports, with a gross profit of 15 million yuan. Farmers' income increased dramatically. In 1993, township enterprises in Jiangsu absorbed as many as 10 million people from the surplus labor force. We must correctly handle the contradiction between making farmers prosperous and making contributions to the state. Deng Daokun [6772 6670 0981], Director of the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Bureau of Hubei: If farmers are not prosperous -- then they will themselves be lagging in their contributions to agriculture, and stable development of agriculture will be impossible; it will also make it hard to work the rural market, which will affect the working of the entire domestic economy; meanwhile, it will cause a lot of political problems. So, the problem of increasing farmers' income is not only an economic problem but also a political problem. Due to the relatively low profitability of agriculture, farmers now have little enthusiasm for planting grains. The key to resolving this problem is to balance the contradiction between making farmers prosperous and making contributions to the state. I think we must do the following several things well right now in order to resolve this contradiction: 1) Under the prerequisite of complying with value laws, implement efficient market adjustment for agricultural products. 2) To guarantee efficient supply and accomplish macroadjustment and control, we must set up a storage system for major agricultural products, and carry out adjustment by means of such economic means as benefits, taxes, and prices, along with relevant polices. This will guarantee the current profits of producers of major and big agricultural products, and make their income no lower than that of others engaged in nonagricultural industries. 3) As major agriculture producing areas still require stronger adjustment of their industrial structure, develop "one excellent and two high" agriculture, to increase the incomes of farmers in major producing areas. 4) Establish a protective agriculture risk fund system, to protect major and big agricultural products and by-products from substantial price fluctuations. 5) Vigorously develop secondary and tertiary industry, transfer the surplus labor force, accomplish intensive farming in agriculture, and operate on a scale which will improve current labor productivity. In addition, we must perfect the market system. If we do not take efficient steps to increase the income of grain planting farmers, it will be hard to continue agricultural production. The key point in increasing farmers' income is to establish extensive agriculture concepts. Zhao Xiaodao [6392 1420 6670], Director of the Agriculture Bureau of Zhejiang: the key to growth is to adjust and perfect the agricultural structure. We must establish extensive agricultural concepts, adjust the structure and develop "one excellent two high" agriculture, including development of secondary and tertiary industry. It won't work if grain production just has grain production in mind; we must look at agriculture via the market economy concept. The per capita annual income of Zhejiang farmers is 1,600 yuan, but there are still some farmers making between 400 and 500 yuan, including over 2 million farmers who still have trouble obtaining sufficient food and clothing. Due to the development of secondary and tertiary industry, 15 percent of farmers have an income of over 3,000 yuan. So the key to increasing farmers income is to develop secondary and tertiary industry. Based on the current situation, what is important is to resolve the problem of low comparative profits from grains, cotton, and vegetable oil, while developing secondary and tertiary industry. Chiefly, the price reforms for agricultural products and by-products must support each other; on the one hand, we should put price subsidies on productive links, clarify property rights, stabilize contracted rights, make operational rights more flexible to promote operation of scale, and change the situation of inefficient agricultural operation of scale. Taking the road of capital construction has prompt efficiency for backward mountainous areas. In addition, when formulating concrete measures, we must resolve the problem of poor implementation. The biggest national concern is to increase farmers' income. Wang Shousen [3769 1108 2773], Director of the Agriculture Bureau of Shaanxi: In the last year, the per capita income of farmers in Shanxi was 559 yuan, which was 225 yuan less than the national per capita farmers' income. This year, the gap is even greater, increasing to 250 yuan. There are many reasons for this situation, but the major problem is backward thoughts and concepts, not having jumped out of the narrow circle of self-sufficiency to have sufficient food and clothing. This then leads to slow adjustment of industrial structure, undeveloped township enterprises, a low level of industrialization for agricultural products, and a loss of value-adding. The important problem now is to study why farmers' income is not high, and why their enthusiasm and investment in agriculture has declined. Based on current phenomena, it is due chiefly to the rising prices of productive materials. The policy of rising grains and cotton was just issued last year. When wheat has just been planted, there are eight months to the harvest, and there is a tendency for the prices of productive materials to rise. Therefore, there must be a protective system for organizing production, for if there is any trouble, who can farmers depend on? Who will take care of farmers who suffer disaster? If we free the prices of productive materials, to what degree can it go? What is unreasonable now is that whatever farmers investing is linked with markets, but whatever farmers sell is linked with the planned economy. If let go, the income of grain planting farmers will go lower and lower. So we have to consider carefully the transfer of profits, and consider the farmers' ability to assume burdens. Overall, the state hasn't figured out a way to develop agricultural products according to the laws of a market economy. I believe that the state cannot rely on raising the prices of agricultural products through financial subsidy as the way of increasing farmers' income, and not consider other ways. If farmers were subsidized through a per capita annual fiscal increase, they would only get 30 yuan each. To increase farmers' income we must depend on going out beyond agriculture, extending to nonagricultural industry, doing fine and deep processing to resolve the problem of employing the surplus labor force. In other words, develop township enterprises. Also, the government has to provide leadership and support in the detailed work of increasing farmers' incomes. In 1992, the gross output of apples in Shaanxi was 840,000 tons, which created sales difficulties. In 1993, the gross output was 1.12 million tons, but the government took energetic measures, taking advantage of Xian's fame, holding apple trade talks, negotiating transportation problems on behalf of the provincial party committee.... Through the efforts of leaders and masses, there have been no apple sales difficulties this year. Farmers say that the provincial party committee has done a good thing for them. This issue taught us that we can't just simply push farmers to the markets, we have to help them create markets. The government has an undeniable responsibility in this. At the same time, it also instructed us what agricultural departments should do under the market economy. We must also strengthen and accelerate establishment and perfection of the market operation system. Overall, the biggest national concerning of China is to increase farmers' income, and this is our principal mission at present.
