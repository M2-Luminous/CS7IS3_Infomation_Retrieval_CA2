Early this morning, Robaina held a meeting with his counterpart, Dinesh Singh, during which the two diplomats reviewed the historically friendly relations between Cuba and India. During this encounter, Dinesh Singh expressed his admiration for the Cuban people's efforts to resist the economic difficulties they are facing. He went on to say that India will continue supporting Cuba in international forums. Roberto Robaina said: Even though the two nations have always maintained close ties, we should take advantage of this occasion to take practical steps to search for common interests that could deepen trade relations. The diplomats agreed to meet again in June, during the summit of nonaligned countries to be held in Cairo to discuss the main problems of developing nations. Both diplomats expressed themselves in favor of strengthening the work of the Nonaligned Movement. Just hours prior to his meeting with his counterpart, Robaina placed a floral wreath at the Indira Gandhi memorial here in the capital. He also visited the Red Fort, the most important monument in New Delhi, which gives a complete vision of Muslim scholars' way of life. Today's most important event was a meeting that Roberto Robaina held, just minutes ago, with 60 businessmen at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, where the Cuban foreign minister gave a comprehensive explanation of the outlook for investment in the island. He said: Even though there is a certain preference toward Latin American countries in order to achieve greater regional integration, we must give consideration to the countries like India that have stood by us during difficult times. There was great interest on the part of the Indian businessmen in learning of possibilities for investment in biotechnology, pharmaceutical products, tourism, fishing, textiles, and agriculture. Robaina explained that today Cuba does not have enough capital but does have a great human resource and an existing infrastructure, which are primary factors for joint ventures. [passage omitted]
