Brittan was received at dinner by Premier Waldemar Pawlak. He also held talks with members of the Polish Government, including Deputy Premier Borowski, Information Minister Olechowski, and Privatization Minister Kaczmarek. The main subject of these talks was the future of relations between the European Union and Poland. The Association Treaty between Poland and the EC comes into force on 1 February, and Poland will become a fully fledged partner for the states of the Union. The commissioner also signed, in the name of the European Union, a financial memorandum relating to assistance in implementing a program of promoting and attracting foreign investment to Poland called INVESTPROM, financed from PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] funds at 10 million ecu [European currency units] over three years. During a press conference at the end of the visit, Brittan said, among other things, that Poland is continuing a policy of decisive economic reforms. This has in an unavoidable way placed great burdens upon society. In addition to granting advice, the obligation of the Union is to support the process of reforms both by granting substantive assistance and by participating in the privatisation of Polish enterprises; also Polish access to the markets of the Union should be made possible, although this in significant measure depends upon the situation in those markets. The Union also expects further close cooperation with the Polish Government, stressed Brittan.
