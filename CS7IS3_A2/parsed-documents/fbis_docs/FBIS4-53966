While both Japanese and U.S. sources said negotiators have hammered out a compromise arrangement that would allow the two countries to resume the stalled framework talks, officials involved in the negotiations would not confirm a deal is in place. "There will be a statement tomorrow," said Bowman Cutter, deputy director of the White House National Economic Council, after emerging from the negotiating session which ran past midnight. Cutter declined to make any further comments, refusing even to confirm that the four days of closed door negotiations are over. Japanese negotiators were equally reticent. Asked whether the four days of talks have been wrapped up, Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi responded, "I wish so." At stake is the fate of the so-called "framework" accord, a set of formal market-opening negotiations the two countries launched last July but which collapsed in February at a Washington meeting between President Bill Clinton and then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Shortly after Japan's new premier, Tsutomu Hata, came to office in late April, he and Clinton agreed to seek a common basis for resuming the trade talks before they meet at the Group of Seven summit in Naples in early July. The key points of the settlement on Monday, according to Japanese sources, included a U.S. commitment not to use numerical targets as "objective criteria" in measuring progress of imports to Japan. Another U.S. commitment, the sources said, is to refrain from using trade sanctions as a means of enforcing "objective-criteria" yardsticks to be set in each of the industry sectors covered by the framework agreement. Japanese sources said the two sides also agreed to continue informal talks to work out the objective criteria to be used for the "priority" industry areas under the framework -- Japanese Government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment, autos and auto parts, and insurance business. In what could be a source of future disputes, the U.S. side of the negotiating table appeared to emphasize that the settlement clinched Monday embodies the "results-oriented" trade policy championed by the Clinton administration. According to U.S. press reports, the deal includes a formal acceptance by the Japanese Government that "measurable results" will be a gauge for measuring whether the Japanese market is really open to foreign nations. In return, the United States will assure Japan in writing that it will not rely solely on "numerical targets" to determine progress on trade issues, THE WASHINGTON POST reported in early editions Tuesday. At the heart of the controversy, as both Japanese and U.S. officials have freely admitted, is "a lack of trust" between the two countries when it comes to bilateral trade issues. Japan is committed under the framework accord to significantly reduce its global trade surplus by boosting domestic demand and opening its market wider to U.S. and other foreign goods. Yet, the Japanese surplus has kept on snowballing, hitting a record 130 billion dollars last year.
