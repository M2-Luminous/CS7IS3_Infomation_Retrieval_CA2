The executive for a private broadcasting company asked to remain anonymous. Akimasa Egawa, director general of the Broadcasting Administration Bureau at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, earlier Wednesday reversed his position on HDTV development, saying the ministry will continue to support an analog HDTV system developed by Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK). Egawa had told reporters on Tuesday his ministry will promote the development of a digital HDTV system to replace NHK's hi-vision system. The remark stirred protests from Japanese consumer electronics companies, which are already selling hi-vision television sets.
