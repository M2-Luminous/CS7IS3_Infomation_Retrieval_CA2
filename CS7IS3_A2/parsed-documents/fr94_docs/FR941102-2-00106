FR941102-2-00106 FR941102-2-00072 3. The Equity Securities Trust is a newly formed unit investment trust consisting of a portfolio of common stock, convertible securities, American Depository Receipts, and contracts and funds for the purchase of such securities. The Equity Securities Trust deposits its securities with the trustee, in exchange for certificates representing undivided interests or units in the principal and net income of the Equity Securities Trust in the ratio of one hundred units for the indicated initial aggregate value of securities of the Equity Securities Trust. 4. During the initial public offering period, units of the Trust are sold at a sales charge ranging from 3.5% to 5.5%, depending on the Trust, subject to certain specified volume discounts for purchases exceeding a certain number of units. 5. The Sponsors, although not obligated to do so, maintain a secondary market for the units of all the existing Trusts after the initial public offering has been completed. The Sponsors also intend to maintain a secondary market for any new Trusts after the initial public offering has been completed. The secondary market repurchase and reoffer price, both during and after the initial public offering period, will be based on the bid prices of the Trust's portfolio securities. Any units repurchased by the Sponsors in the secondary market may be redeemed by the Sponsors if the Sponsors deem such redemption to be in their best interest. If a market for the units is not maintained, unitholders will be able to redeem their units with the trustee at a price based on the aggregate bid side evaluation of the Trust's portfolio securities. 6. Applicants propose to offer unitholders of the Trusts the ability to exchange any or all of their units for units in one or more available series of the Trusts at a reduced sales charge (the ``Exchange Privilege''). Pursuant to the Exchange Privilege, the Sponsors' repurchase price during the initial offering period of the units being surrendered will be based on the aggregate offer price of the Trust's portfolio securities, and, if the initial offering period has been completed, will be based on the aggregate bid price of the Trust's portfolio securities. Units in a Trust then will be sold to the unitholder at a price based on the aggregate offer price of the securities in the Trust portfolio during the initial public offering period of the Trust (or based on the aggregate bid price of the securities in the Trust portfolio if the initial public offering period has been completed) plus accrued interest and a reduced sales charge. 7. The Sponsors reserve the right to suspend, modify, or terminate the Exchange Privilege. The Sponsors will provide unitholders with 60 days prior written notice of any termination or material amended to the Exchange Privilege, except as provided in condition 3 below. 8. Applicants also propose to offer a conversion offer (the ``Conversion Offer'') to all unitholders of any registered unit investment trust in which there is no active secondary market (a ``Redemption Trust''). Pursuant to the Conversion Offer, unitholders may elect to redeem units of a Redemption Trust at the redemption drive determined as set forth in the relevant Redemption Trust's prospectus and apply the proceeds of the redemption to the purchase of available units of one or more series of the Trust. The purchase price for units of a series of a Trust will be based on the aggregate offer of the Trust's portfolio securities during its initial offering period, or at a price based on the aggregate bid price of the Trust's portfolio securities if the initial public offering period of the Trust has been completed, and will include accrued interest and a reduced sales charge. 9. The Sponsors reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Conversion Offer at any time without prior notice to unitholders of a Redemption Trust. 10. The Exchange Privilege and Conversion Offer are substantially similar in all respects to the exchange privilege and conversion offer already approved by the SEC in the Prior Order, except the Equity Securities Trust, as a newly formed Trust, was not in existence at the time that order was issued. The requested relief is necessary to enable the Equity Securities Trust to offer the same exchange privilege to its unitholders as is already permitted to unitholders of the other Trusts pursuant to the Prior Order, and to revise the reduced sales charge under the Exchange Privilege and Conversion Offer to be an amount equal to a percentage of the public offering price for each unit (or per 1,000 units for Mortgage Securities Trust or per 100 units for Equity Securities Trust). The requested relief will supersede the Prior Order in its entirety. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 11(a) of the Act requires SEC approval of an offer to exchange securities between open-end investment companies of the exchange occurs on any basis other than the relative net asset values of the Securities to be exchanged. Section 11(c) of the Act makes section 11(a) applicable to any type of exchange offer of securities of registered unit investment trusts for the securities of any other investment company, irrespective of the basis of exchange. 2. Applicants believe that the Exchange Privilege provides investors with a convenient means of transferring their interests at a reduced sales charge, as their individual investment objectives change, into series of the Trust that are better suited to meet these changing investment objectives. Applicants also state that the Conversion Offer provides investors with a means by which unitholders of a unit investment trust in which there is no active secondary market can redeem those units and invest the proceeds therefrom, at a reduced sales charge, into units of the trusts. Applicants' Conditions The Applicants agree to the following conditions in any order granting the requested relief:
