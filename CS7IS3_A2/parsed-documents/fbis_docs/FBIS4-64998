However, the assessments often revealed what the English call wishful thinking. To all effects and purposes, many confused their own hopes with reality: The supporters of the "new Right" gave assurances that the government would be welcomed everywhere, while those who had no liking for it forecast years of embarrassment and ostracism for Italy. Now that the Berlusconi government is no longer a mere hypothesis, the question arises once again. How will the new Italian government be received abroad, and in the United States in particular? The following are five scenarios, unencumbered by wishful thinking. Number one: Deprived of the compass offered by the Cold War, the United States is steering by the stars; it is still in search of a foreign policy, and it has serious and urgent problems (Bosnia, Korea, Haiti) to face. Italy, whoever is at the helm, is not a problem. Whatever we like to think, the Clinton Administration will devote relatively little attention and limited time to our country. The Ukraine, as of now, is much more worrying (and therefore more important) than we are. Number two: A number of Italian intellectuals, and some of their American counterparts, maintain that Silvio Berlusconi's unusual position (prime minister-publisher-industrialist) will have a detrimental effect on our country. They say that the United States leadership, which has always been sensitive to conflicting interests, regards Italy as democratically sloppy and vaguely unpresentable. Unfortunately, or fortunately (depending on one's point of view), this is not how things stand. The U.S. Administration is aware of the "Berlusconi issue," but will regard it is an internal matter as long as it does not reflect on the stability of the country. To put it in a nutshell, it is our own business. Number three: After complaining for decades that Italian foreign policy was so cautious that it bordered on indolence, the Americans will discover that the new government intends to take action. Some of its initiatives will be welcomed, whereas others have to date been feared (everything with a bearing on our eastern border, for example, is studied with great attention). Anything may be expected, even that Washington ends up by regretting the passing of Christian-Democratic inertia. Number four: While the American Administration will pay attention to matters of substance (and expediency), the press and television will be seeking stories and headlines. The National Alliance's entry into the government will give them plenty of these: Fascism and postfascism are immortal topics for a public that knows little about Europe and learned what little it knows 50 years ago. The President's two visits to Italy (in June, for the commemoration of the liberation, and in July, for the G-7 summit in Naples) will do the rest. Only if the American public were to become alarmed would Bill Clinton, after duly consulting his opinion poll experts, pretend to be worried. Fifth and final scenario: Silvio Berlusconi will enjoy considerable personal success. More in some countries than in others. The British may smile a lot before judging him on performance, but the Americans will think they are dreaming: An Italian politician who talks straight and smiles a lot (facing the right television camera) is an unprecedented novelty. However, the new prime minister must avoid making one mistake: displaying excessive enthusiasm once he is standing in front of the White House. They have seen a lot of enthusiastic Italians walk across the lawn there, and they have learned not to take them very seriously.
