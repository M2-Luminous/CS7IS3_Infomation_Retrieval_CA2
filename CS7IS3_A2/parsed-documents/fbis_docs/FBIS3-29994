"Rapid swings of exchange rates are a minus not only for Japan but also for the global economy, and I will explain this at the G-7 meeting," Fujii told the House of Representatives' Budget Committee. Finance ministers and central bankers from the G-7 industrial nations are to meet in Frankfurt on Saturday. Asked by an opposition lawmaker about a planned income tax cut for fiscal 1994, Fujii indicated that an income tax cut will be carried out in the following years as well. "It seems that the income tax cut has been misunderstood as one for a single year only," Fujii said.
