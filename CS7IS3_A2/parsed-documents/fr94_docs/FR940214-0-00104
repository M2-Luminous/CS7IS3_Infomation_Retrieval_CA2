FR940214-0-00104 FR940214-0-00016 Federalism Impact The final rule adopted herein will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the FAA has determined that this final rule is not significant under Executive Order 12866; nor is it significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). It is certified that under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act this rule will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities. Because of the negligible costs resulting from this rule, the FAA has determined that the expected impact of these regulations is so minimal that they do not warrant a full regulatory evaluation. Reason for Immediate Adoption This rule is being adopted immediately in response to comments received on an earlier issued final rule without prior public notice and comment. This rule requires immediate adoption to amend and expired regulatory compliance date, which has been an unintended burden on airport operators. By immediately adopting this amendment, the FAA alleviates the burden and cost to airport operators to request, and the FAA to process, petitions for exemption. As stated above, an amendment of the compliance date is necessary to adequately provide time for industry to manufacture and applicable airports to install sign systems. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 139 Air carriers, Airports, Aviation safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
