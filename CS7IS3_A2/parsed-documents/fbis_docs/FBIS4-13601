In a telephone call to Kharrazi, our country's permanent UN representative, we asked him for an interview for the listeners. My colleagues inform me that Mr. Kharrazi is on the line: Mr. Kharrazi, greetings and thank you for your cooperation. Last night it was announced at the UN Headquarters that the ICO contact group members are to meet next Wednesday to examine the situation in Gorazde and Bosnia. What is the reason for the delay in this meeting, especially in view of the heavy responsibility that the Islamic countries have in defending the Bosnian Muslims and the Muslims in Gorazde? [Kharrazi] In the name of God, the almighty and merciful. You are absolutely right. The responsibility that the Islamic countries shoulder in this issue is extremely heavy. I believe that not only has the United Nations lost its credibility, but the Islamic countries too are losing their credibility because the Islamic countries could have done a great deal, especially in the form of multifaceted pressures on the Security Council and on the United Nations. Now that this proposal has been adopted--and actually the decision that the ICO contact group's foreign ministers meet was proposed by Iran--once again this opportunity should be seized, although this meeting could have taken place sooner. However, naturally, a bureaucratic process was needed to call this session, the issue of visas, and operational problems. Thus, the ICO Secretariat has set Wednesday as the date for the session, even though this session could have been convened a few days sooner. At any rate, this opportunity should be seized, and we hope that with the presence of the ICO contact group's foreign ministers, the necessary pressures can be brought to bear on the Security Council members and the Security Council can be given an ultimatum to end its indifference and to take action; otherwise, the Islamic countries will have to decide on their own. [Correspondent] Thank you. Concerning the forthcoming session of the ICO contact group members, a question: Has the possibility been considered of the Islamic countries warning the Security Council that if it does not lift the arms embargo on Bosnia, they will do it themselves? How close to reality is this possibility in your opinion? [Kharrazi] We hope that during this session, the foreign ministers will adopt a decisive decision. We should wait and see what these foreign ministers on the whole think. The atmosphere is extremely ripe and some of the countries are completely ready to take serious steps. However, we should wait and see what the decision of all the Islamic countries is and, God willing, act accordingly. [Correspondent] Thank you. As my last question, many believe that as far as the tragedy of the fall of Gorazde is concerned, the UN secretary general did not use his authority and that with his procrastination he prepared the ground for Gorazde's fall with the help of the Western powers. Is this the prevailing view in the United Nations as well? [Kharrazi] The same question is being asked by the representatives of various countries on whether the secretary general acted correctly or if he did not. When the secretary general himself is asked this question, his answer is: It is true that I have some authority, but I have to apply to the Security Council powers and ask for their view and decision. Actually, I only execute Security Council decisions and I must consult with the Security Council powers. Of course, it is true that this is the Security Council's method and that the secretary general serves the Security Council and executes its decisions. However, at the same time, the secretary general has instruments in hand that he can use to inform the people. He can speak to them and express realities and his problems and, in short, give a push to the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular. The truth is that the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular have completely lost their credibility on the Bosnian problem in general and in the Gorazde problem in particular. [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Kharrazi, for answering our questions and for giving us your time. [Kharrazi] You are welcome.
