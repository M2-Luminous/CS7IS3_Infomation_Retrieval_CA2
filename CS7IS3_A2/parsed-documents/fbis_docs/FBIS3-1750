Its GNP [as received] reached 64.9 billion yuan last year, tripling that of 1978, with a growth rate higher than the country's average. Yunnan's total revenue also topped 20 billion yuan in 1993 and the province was finally relieved from the state's long-term financial subsidies. Rich natural resources and a 4,000-kilometer border have long put Yunnan at a very advantageous position to develop its economy. But substantial progress was not gained until the tidal wave of market economic reforms swept over this southwestern frontier of the country. Local people, especially the large population of minority nationalities, who used to cling to quiet and unchallenging lives, have gradually adapted to new ideas and abandoned such conservative ones as the rejection of and disgust at trade activities. Areas in southern Yunnan, bordering Burma, Laos and Vietnam, and mainly inhabited by minority nationalities, have become the vanguard for the opening-up of all of Southwest China. Scattered across this area are eight state-level trading ports and 11 provincial trading ports, linked with China's inland commercial centers and foreign countries by 80-plus roads and highways. The total volume of border trade grew to 2.8 billion yuan last year. Last year's trade volume in imports and exports saw an increase of 29 percent over the previous year, markedly higher than the country's average. Newly approved foreign-invested enterprises number 509, almost doubling the total established during the last 15 years. The amazing success of Yunnan's tobacco industry on the domestic market has greatly bolstered yunnan's confidence and determination to achieve more economic gains. The province has also taken pioneering steps in the reform of the construction system. By calling for bids on the huge lubuge hydropower station project, it managed to import advanced technology, management experience and construction skills, enabling the project to be completed in the shortest possible time while ensuring high quality. The province jointly funded the construction of Manwan hydropower station with the former Ministry of Water Resources and Power Industry instead of the traditional practice of totally depending on state allocation of funds for large power station construction. During recent years, the provincial government has altogether earmarked 30 billion yuan for infrastructural construction. Along with the improvement of its investment environment, Yunnan is striving to be the country's major electricity generation and tourism province.
