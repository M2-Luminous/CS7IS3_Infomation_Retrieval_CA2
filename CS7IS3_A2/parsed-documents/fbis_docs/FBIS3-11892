Officers have traded their uniforms for business suits and are scouring the corridors and offices of Congress in small groups in an attempt to convince all congressmen, regardless of ideological coloring, of the correctness of their proposals. Their chief proposal, embodied in a constitutional amendment submitted by Deputy Adylson Motta (PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], Rio Grande do Sul), removes them from the category of public servants and promotes them to that of "servants of the state." The immediate objective of that proposal is to solve the problem of pay. "One purpose, obviously, is to give the military a merited raise," says Motta. "The Constitution was written in a revanchist era, and the military were punished as a result." Actually, the military wanted to be recognized as "servants of the fatherland." In the explanatory statement accompanying his amendment, Motta listed characteristics supposedly distinguishing the military from other public employees: "strong professional ethics imposing irreproachable moral conduct" and "unconditional compliance with the obligation to do one's duty and sacrifice one's own life in defense of the fatherland." But the expression "servants of the fatherland" was changed to "servants of the state." Some congressmen, especially in the PT [Workers Party], considered "fatherland" to be an exaggeration and demanded its withdrawal as a condition for negotiating the amendment. Equality before the law--The basic proposal is found in Subparagraph 12: "Compensation for the military on the active roster, in the reserve, or in retirement is regulated by a separate law." Motta's amendment is supplemented by another bill, this one submitted by Deputy Prisco Viana (PPR, Bahia) and stipulating, in Paragraph X, that "the general revision of pay for civilian and military public servants will take place on the same day, except in the case of legal pay adjustments initiated by the president of the republic and intended to implement the equality before the law that is dealt with in Article 39 of the Constitution." The target of military lobbyists is the Emergency Social Fund, which is vital to the administration's economic plan. Article 74 of the amendment establishing that fund prohibits the granting of differentiated pay increases to the military, and according to the military, that makes it impossible to achieve the pay equality before the law that the Constitution calls for. "Establishing the same standards for civilians and military is illogical," says Deputy Francisco Rodrigues (PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], Rondonia). He reports that over the past few days, congressional advisers to the military ministries have been stepping up their contacts with deputies and senators in an attempt to persuade them to eliminate Article 74 from the fund bill. Military lobbyists are not confining themselves to the pay issue. For example, they do not approve of the establishment of a Ministry of Defense. And they do not want to lose their status as guarantors of law and order, which Deputy Jose Genoino (PT, Sao Paulo), wants to take away. Supporters of a redefinition of the constitutional role of the Armed Forces argue that calling them guardians of order is what gave the military the pretext for the coups recorded in our history. Fearing internationalization of the Amazon Region, the military are also preparing amendments affecting the Indian reservations. They recognize the Indians' rights over the areas they occupy, but make an exception in the case of border lands. "The native peoples have no notion of what a geographic border dictated by nationality or state boundaries is," claims Senator Irapuan Costa, Jr. (PP [Progressive Party], Goias). IPVA--The military even want to amend the article allowing the authorities to protect assets with historical or cultural value and thus "eliminate the power of one authority over the property of another." In this case, the object is to protect military property, which is the target of what they call an "abuse of authority," especially on the part of mayors. Another amendment is concerned with collection of the IPVA [tax on ownership of automotive vehicles]. Some municipalities, basing their action on Article 155 of the Constitution, have decided to apply the IPVA to aircraft, ships, and tanks. No More Right To Intervene The military do not want to lose the role of guardians of law and order that is assigned to them by Article 142 of the Constitution--that being perhaps the article most targeted by left-wing congressmen, especially those in the PT. Deputy Jose Genoino (PT, Sao Paulo), for example, says that the Armed Forces ought to restrict themselves to national defense and the guaranteeing of constitutional powers. Fear exists in the Left that in keeping with the tradition of coups that extends from the proclamation of the republic until 1964, the military will again invoke their role as defenders of law and order to legitimize their interventions. Genoino, who was a guerrilla fighter for the PCdoB [Communist Party of Brazil] in the 1970's and now debates with his former enemies in Congress, knows how important the amendment placing the military in the special category of "servants of the state" is to the Armed Forces. And he wants to trade his support on that point for withdrawal of the provision giving the military responsibility for guaranteeing law and order. "They are going to have to negotiate," Genoino says. Maybe so, but not now. According the military lobby's plan, the first step was to prepare the amendments in which it was interested. The next step was to select congressmen to sponsor the proposals. The military are currently in the persuasion phase: they are discussing their proposals with representatives of all the parties. There are over 30 amendments affecting the military, but not all of them have military support. Examples are the amendment abolishing compulsory military service and the one establishing the Ministry of Defense.
