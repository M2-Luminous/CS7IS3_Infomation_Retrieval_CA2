Gromov, commander in chief of the Russian Federation Navy, by Vladimir Maryukha, under the "Interlocutor of the Day" rubric; place and date not given: "There Is No No-Man's-Land Between Sea and Shore"] [Text] Calling Card Admiral Feliks Nikolayevich Gromov is commander in chief of the Russian Federation Navy. On graduating from the Pacific Higher Naval School he progressed via his first postings to the command of a destroyer, a cruiser, and a squadron of ships. He has served in the Pacific and Northern Fleets and at the Leningrad Naval Base. He has been commander of the Northern Fleet and first deputy commander in chief of the Navy. [Maryukha] Feliks Nikolayevich, Russia's Navy has another year behind it, not the best of years, moreover, in its almost 300-year history. How did seamen cope with the tasks they were set at the beginning of 1993? [Gromov] The tasks that the Navy was set a year ago have been performed. This means that the Navy has succeeded in preserving the specified level of combat readiness of the fleets' main large strategic formations and combined units, as well as their ability to shift in a timely and organized manner from a peacetime to a wartime footing and perform their main operational tasks within the prescribed timeframes. I think that everyone realizes that the year has not been one of the best in the fleet's history: There is no no-man's-land between the sea and shore and all the economic, political, and other difficulties that the country is experiencing were bound to affect the state of the Navy. Nevertheless it was 1993 that once again saw an increase in the intensity and effectiveness of strategic submarines' combat service and alert duty. Foreign naval forces' activity was reliably monitored by the general-purpose forces. At the same time Russian ships collaborated intensively with multinational forces in the Persian Gulf and established contacts between Russians and the population of other countries during official visits, the number of which also increased. [Maryukha] Against the overall backdrop of the difficulties experienced by the country the increase in the intensity of naval service cannot help but evoke pleasure and...surprise: How did it prove possible to achieve positive change? [Gromov] First, I must say that the Navy's combat training was carried out in a systematic manner. Intensively, but without straining them to breaking point. Of course there were and still are difficulties -- in repairing ships and providing the Navy with all kinds of supplies. However, the Navy's role goes far beyond the as yet unresolved problems. And in this main area Russian seamen have shown themselves at their best. The "Typhoon-93" command staff training exercise under the leadership of the defense minister, involving the Northern and Pacific Fleets, confirmed the naval strategic nuclear forces' readiness to perform their set tasks and the staffs' preparedness for field command and control of the main attack forces. The Navy's combat readiness was also confirmed by the competitive tactical exercises for the Navy championship which resumed after a year's gap. This was the first time that the Kuznetsov aircraft-carrying heavy cruiser took part in these exercises. And the participation of ships of the Northern, Baltic, and Pacific Fleets in joint exercises with other countries' navies confirmed our seamen's supreme naval combat, weapons, and tactical proficiency. Russian seamen worthily represented our country in Canada, the United States, Britain, France, and Greece, and, after a 90-year gap, in China and South Korea. This past year combat training plans did indeed have to be adjusted and the number of course tasks reduced. Factors beyond the fleet's control were responsible for this -- lack of fuel, lubricants, ship repair services, a dramatic reduction in funding, and undermanning of ships. But despite all this the organizational, moral, and psychological groundwork was laid in 1993 for a qualitatively new approach to the system of training command and control organs and naval forces. [Maryukha] But, Feliks Nikolayevich, last year it did not nonetheless prove possible to avoid a threat to the future of the Navy: Ships "left" Navy ranks early and a difficult situation also arose with "the Navy's wings" -- the air force.... [Gromov] In 1993 naval aviation began using the ship-based Su-27K fighter. ASW aviation must also be recorded has having shown an improvement. However, the economic crisis and the resulting lack of new equipment and spare parts, and holdups with aviation fuel did indeed reduce flying time, disrupt combat training plans, and, naturally, reduce naval aviators' combat readiness and flight safety. The worst situation developed in the Black Sea Fleet air force: Owing to nondelivery of spare parts and inadequate repairs, around half of the aircraft and helicopters are unable to take to the air today. I would also describe the upgrading and replacement of the Navy's ships as an issue of statewide importance. More continuity than ever before is needed here: from one model or design of a ship to another more sophisticated model, from the slips to the plant moorings. It is extremely essential that we preserve this technological chain both from the viewpoint of safeguarding the qualitative parameters of the fleet's fighting strength and also from the moral and psychological viewpoint. In 1994 the Navy plans to obtain from industry the Petr Velikiy nuclear missile cruiser, a large ASW ship, patrol escorts, and certain other ships. The "Sever" machine building enterprise in Severodvinsk recently began construction of the first of class of a promising multirole nuclear submarine. Those are the immediate prospects as regards Navy replenishment, prospects that are directly dependent on full funding. In the longer term it is planned to further develop combat surface ships. Priority here will be given to destroyers, patrol escorts, and minesweepers. There are plans to develop a new multirole shore-based aircraft for naval aviation, intended primarily to perform tasks of covering the surface and underwater situation. On the other hand, the quantitative reduction of the fleet will continue. This is brought about by the tasks of the new military doctrine and the state's economic potential. Our main aim is to create a relatively small, but qualitatively perfect and highly effective Navy, which would be less economically burdensome for the country than in the past. This task will be performed at the same time as the reform of the fleet and the construction of new ships. But I would not call the situation that is emerging, as this task is resolved, a simple one. [Maryukha] In your view, can it be rectified somehow? [Gromov] It must be, but is there a real chance of doing so? In any sector of industry, in any branch of the Armed Forces there will be plenty of problems that the department in question considers paramount. We realize that the country is in a difficult economic position and that the budget is not, so to speak, elastic. On the other hand, there must also be awareness that the accumulated potential with its high technologies for the construction of both surface ships and submarines must not disappear and that, if they are lost, it will subsequently be hard for decades to produce these kinds of technologies and forms of production sharing. I think that 1994 should nonetheless be the year that sees the country's economic revival. And that inspires hope. At the same time one must constantly think about those serving today and who will serve the Russian Navy in the future.... [Maryukha] I understand your concern: The naval budget, like a shagreen skin, is shrinking drastically with every day that passes, and moreover by no means having fulfilled our wishes -- owing to inflation, cuts in defense spending... But, along with a technically upgraded Navy, it is also necessary to resolve the problems of providing seamen with social protection, primarily, providing them with housing.... [Gromov] Last year we succeeded, despite all the difficulties with funding, in building and obtaining 6,035 apartments. That is with a total number of 13,220 people without apartments and 4,184 people in need of an improvement in their housing conditions. On the other hand, this number of people in need of housing is spread extremely unevenly across the regions where the Navy is based. In the Baltic Fleet it is primarily a question of Baltiysk and Kaliningrad, where housing was previously in short supply and requirements have now risen in connection with the troop withdrawal from the Baltic countries. In the Northern Fleet it is mainly the city of Murmansk and, in part, Severomorsk. And in the Pacific Fleet it is a question of Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy. In the Black Sea Fleet Sevastopol bears the brunt of the problems involved in resolving the housing problem. This problem is also hard to resolve in Moscow and St. Petersburg. That is why since 1992 we have been taking a more rational approach to resolving the question of housing construction. Now the main emphasis is being laid on housing construction in Russia's middle zone in order to move people away from the closed garrisons. I have also set the task of not expanding certain military camps but improving their structure. Of course, uneven inadequate funding has a considerable impact on this process. At the same time feasible housing construction plans should be drawn up. If the population of a garrison is falling, we should probably take a careful look at what option is more advisable here -- building a new kindergarten or refurbishing existing sociocultural consumer facilities, etc. That is, a rational approach must prevail today. In 1994 we are planning to build around 11,500 apartments with our own funds and via shared participation. Time will tell what comes of that. And, of course, what sort of money is allocated. [Maryukha] Feliks Nikolayevich, since we have started talking about the plans for 1994 I think it appropriate to ask you about the tasks that the Navy is to tackle this year. [Gromov] To use the language of command the Navy must maintain the strength and status of the naval strategic forces at a level which guarantees that tasks are implemented under any conditions and maintain the strength and status of the general-purpose forces to provide all-around backup for the Navy's activity in conflict-prevention from Russia's maritime sectors.... Combat service and combat alert duty remain the fundamental means of performing these main tasks. In order to perform these tasks it is necessary to resolve a set of questions pertaining to updating and reducing the amount of specific-task equipment amid the ongoing naval downsizing and improve the basing and support system for the Navy's remaining ships. This is primarily a question of providing amenities for the Baltic Fleet and Caspian Flotilla forces that are being withdrawn and removing shore-based naval infrastructures from Latvia, Estonia, and Belarus. Combat training, like last year, starts with training at the base and will be completed during integrated sea voyages [kompleksnyye vykhody v more]. This is dictated by the fact that one should not count on improvement in the Navy's material and technical support and instances of putting to sea with no serious intent the Navy too dear. Nevertheless ships should not stay at their moorings for long. Coastal waters and the oceans of the world will be their zone of operations. The main task facing the command of the Navy remains the creation of normal service and living conditions for all personnel -- seamen, warrant officers, and officers. It is a question of boosting the prestige of Navy service and all the concepts that go with this. It is a question of creating conditions of service where every man does his job. Naval personnel and flight personnel do their job, while shore-based structures do theirs. That is hard to achieve, but only then will the fleet unconditionally perform its main function.
