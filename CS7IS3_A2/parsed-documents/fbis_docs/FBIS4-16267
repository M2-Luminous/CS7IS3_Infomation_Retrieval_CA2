Milosevic. The letter says that just at the beginning of the military actions in Yugoslavia Armenians became indignant following the tragedy Serbians and Chernogorians [as received] were and are being involved. Armenians as all the people of Yugoslavia have been fighting for independence for years. It's very difficult to fight for independence while Russia is under the influence of "Atlantism" and practically takes the position of an observer with respect to the fate of her traditional aliens. Just this fact let the Anglo-Saxons and their Western and Eastern aliens using the slogan of peace-keeping dictate their "world order" to those nations who are in an artificial borders' deadlock. Armenian and Karabakh parliamentaries express their confidence in the fact that the creation of new political realities let the orthodoxy and the Islamic fundamentalism prevent wars and death in the region.
