We project our 1993 GNP at a comparable-price growth rate of over 13 percent, making 1993 our year of highest growth since reform and opening. After July 1993, as Central Committee Document No. 6 was issued and its macroeconomic regulation and control policy was applied, our industrial growth rate went into a sharp slide, with its monthly growth rate slipping from June's 30.2 percent to 16.4 percent by October, for a high drop of 13.8 points. But after October, as large amounts of credit funds were put into circulation, our industrial growth rate rebounded again sharply, reentering a high-growth state, with a much shorter regulation and control time-lag, which was the first year since reform in which such a situation had arisen. We hold that our 1993 economic growth features evolved in the setting of the dual-conversion of our economic growth style and economic system, showing that China's economic growth had entered a new period. I. An Analysis of Our 1993 Economic-Growth Course and Its Causes Our 1993 economic-growth course can be divided roughly into two stages: January through June, with sustained high growth; July through November, with a reentry into high-speed growth after experiencing a quite large fluctuation. 1. An Analysis of Our January-Through-June Sustained High Growth and Its Contributing Factors On the heels of our 1992 economy having entered a period of overall high growth, our 1993 economy saw sustained high growth in a state approaching the verge of overheating. Our industrial output value monthly growth rates were 9.8 percent for January, 32.9 percent for February, 26.1 percent for March, 25.2 percent for April, 27.3 percent for May, and 30.2 percent for June. This data shows that except for the monthly growth rate changing sharply from January to February due to the impact of the Spring Festival, our overall growth trend was steadily upward, topping 30 percent by June. Meanwhile, our capital goods prices rose quickly, with retail prices rising steadily to top double digits by June at 13.9 percent. Our investment, financial, and circulation activities quickly heated up to show a chaotic order, all of which indicated that our whole economy was nearing the brink of overheating. The cause of this growth course was the dual-conversion of our growth style and economy. Since 1992, China's economic growth had been conspicuously characterized by investment-demand pull with heavy industrial growth taking the lead. In contrast to its features since reform of consumer-demand pull with light industrial growth taking the lead, this shows that China's economic-growth style had undergone a great change. The setting for this was a change in our development stage. After passing through the consumer makeup-lesson stage, by the 1990s we were faced with a higher level of consumer and a changed consumption structure, in which China's industrial structure was beginning an all-out upgrading, with particularly faster change in secondary industries, mostly industry. Our industrial scale and overall economic scale correspondingly expanded rapidly. This upgrading resulted in a large amount of equipment replacement, establishment of new industries, and rapid qualitative and quantitative improvement of our infrastructures and basic industries, thus causing large-scale investment growth, as well as rapid growth of the investment-product production sector -- heavy industry. This stage was one of rapid heavy industrial growth that certain industrialized nations had experienced. Table Month January February March April May June State 64.1 70.7 68.9 69.3 70.7 Investment Accumulated Growth Rate Retail 18.9 11.1 18.5 25.4 27.3 28.4 Commodity Sales Growth Rate Heavy 15.6 36.3 30.2 28.4 28.8 30.5 Industrial Growth Rate Light 3.9 29.3 21.9 21.9 25.7 29.7 Industrial Growth Rate It was precisely because we had entered this stage that we saw the sustained rapid growth from 1992 to 1993, which growth had profound development-stage causes. Our growth reality for the first six months of 1993 shows that this stage's features are exceptionally clear. 1) Investment grows much more than market consumer demand. 2) Heavy industrial growth remains higher than light industrial growth. The following are some pertinent data: As to system reform, since the last half of 1992, [production-] factor markets had entered a period of rapid growth, with capital and real estate markets beginning to form and steadily expanding in scale, providing more channels for investment-capital formation, and supporting rapid investment growth. Our development-stage and system conversions combined to jointly drive our economy into a high-growth state. Due to the development-stage factor, savings and investment funds increased sharply, causing overall financing to expand rapidly, while factor-market development was still in a preliminary stage, with planning and order not yet evolved. Expanded overall financing drove money markets to expand rapidly, while the sharp growth of land supply and demand drove the real estate market to expand quickly. Under such conditions, money and real estate markets that were in an initial growth stage unavoidably experienced chaotic order, causing an abnormal rise in money and real estate prices, rapidly heating up our whole economy to approach the brink of overheating. 2. An Analysis of Our July-Through-November Economic Fluctuation and Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Results Faced with imminent overheating, the Central Committee issued Document No. 6 in July, taking a series of macroeconomic regulation and control steps, such as rectifying our financial order, inventorying underway projects, and rectifying real-estate and development-zone investment, which brought fast results. Our industrial output value growth rate receded from June's 30.2 percent to 25.1 percent for July, falling steadily through August and September to 16.4 percent by October. In September, directed at enterprise operating difficulties and strong local demand for faster growth, the center took steps to put more money into circulation, also bringing quick results. By November, our industrial output value growth rate had picked back up to 18.9 percent, and was in a further-acceleration trend. So prompt and effective macroeconomic regulation and control is a phenomenon that merits conscientious summing up and analysis. We would note the following about it. 1. This phenomenon shows that the central government has a clearer understanding of China's economic operating laws. Its regulation and control timing choice was more fitting, as our economic growth at the time was climbing, while supply-shortage restraints were not yet evident, and factors, such as our foreign exchange balance and key raw-material inventories, still had a certain supportive capability. In contrast to 1985 and 1988 when supplies were short and potential exhausted, with growth already causing a series of glaring conflicts, this choice of timing to take regulation and control steps showed a certain amount of foresight, preventing sharp economic volatility. Its regulation and control dynamics were also more appropriate, certainly not completely forcing our economy into a trough, but rather aiming at supporting all economic-growth terms for a timely promotion of economic recovery to high-growth momentum. These two examples show that the central government's macroeconomic regulation and control skills are much better. 2. The quick results from these regulation and control steps show that the basic terms of China's economic operations have undergone a significant change. From a development perspective, as pointed out above, in growth through the form of mostly investment-demand pull, in contrast to that through mainly consumer-demand pull, demand regulation and control capability is much greater. And from the angle of system reform, as factor markets grow, the fundamental impact of markets on economic operations grows sharply, with economic growth being guided more by all market signals, and the decisive impact of financial activities on the economy growing more prominent. It was precisely in such a setting that the mostly financial regulation and control policy measures brought such quick results. This shows on one hand that as demand-regulation capability grows, macroeconomic regulation and control results and significance rise sharply, while showing on the other that in China's macroeconomic regulation and control, financial regulation and control measures are dominant. 3. This macroeconomic regulation and control still depended mostly on administrative means, such as exercising financial regulation and control mainly through curbing all fundraising activities and interbank borrowing, which actually returned fund supply channels to banks. Bank regulation and control of overall funding relied mainly on direct control of the amount of basic currency put into circulation, thus controlling the money supply, instead of using benchmark interest rates to regulate and control monetary demand. So as to regulation and control means and conduction mechanisms, it was still nonmarket-oriented. This situation conflicts to a certain degree with our market-system development and further change in our regulation and control grounds. This review of the state of our 1993 economy shows that China's economy, as to either development stage, system base, or regulation and control capability, has entered a period of higher level and more mature development. II. An In-Depth Perspective of Our 1993 Economic Situation Despite the above assessment, our 1993 economic growth involved certain profound conflicts that must not be overlooked. 1. The Relations Among Our Growth, Investment, and Trade Structures and Reported Problems In our 1993 economic growth, the fastest growing industries were ones such as motor vehicles, building materials, metal-cutting machine tools, communications equipment, and petrochemical products; but in investment growth, the fastest growing industries were ones, such as building materials, financial insurance service trades, real estate, transportation, and commercial beverages. In contrast to our fastest growth industries, this is quite inconsistent. On the other hand, as to our trade import structure, our fastest growing industries were ones, such as motor vehicles, rolled steel, metalworking machine tools, textile machinery, rubber and plastics manufacturing machinery, wire telephones or telephone switchboards, and refined oil, basically consistent with our domestic economic-growth structure. This shows that in contrast to domestic demand changes, our growth and trade-import structures responded quickly to meet demand, or market changes, while our investment structure did not respond flexibly enough. In other words, our market-guidance capability toward investment remained inadequate. In addition, our imperfect market development with a certain misguidance phenomenon, as well as the large impact of local government behavior on investment activity, were also factors in the lack of coordination between changes in our investment and market-demand structures. In such a state, market demand guided growth-structure change, while our growth structure could not effectively guide our investment structure through changes in industrial profit rates. From a long-range view, the impact on our domestic supply structure followed market-demand change, causing a sharp conflict of uncoordinated supply and demand structures, which could be supplemented only by trade imports. Such a state put great pressure for a time on our future balance of international payments, as well as steadily lowering the international market share of domestic enterprises. As this resulted in a reduction of pull by domestic market development on our domestic industrialization progress, this was a problem of farreaching impact which, when relying mainly on domestic markets to promote industrialization, required full attention. In the short term, the excessive pressure being put mainly on our international balance of payments showed that the state of our international balance of payments had an exceptionally crucial impact on our overall domestic supply and demand and structural balance, and thus on our domestic prices and even our whole economic growth. Genuinely resolving this problem meant rationalizing our investment-finance mechanism. On one hand, this required further improving our capital goods market, by adjusting upstream product prices, and standardizing and improving markets for factors, such as funds, in order to bring into better play the role of factor prices in guiding resources and funds. On the other, it meant a larger central government investment dynamic, by giving adequate investment inclination and support to fields in which markets had no impact, such as infrastructures, basic industry, and particularly high-tech forerunner industries. 2. The Widening of Our Urban-Rural Income and Market Gaps Indicated the Resurgence of a Glaring Binary Structural Conflict. Preliminary estimates for January through November are that real urban incomes corrected for inflation were up 13.9 percent from the same period in 1992; for the first three quarters, real peasant income corrected for inflation was up 3.7 percent from the same period in 1992. So our urban-rural income growth-rate gap reached 10.2 percentage points, which gap had been only 5.7 points in 1992. Along with this wider income gap, our urban-rural market gap also widened. For the first 11 months of 1993, our retail commodity sales growth rate was 30.1 percent for urban markets but 18.3 percent for rural markets, for a gap of 11.8 points; corrected for inflation, this gap was 9.5 percent. Around about 1992, these two gaps were respectively 7.8 points and 3.3 points. This indicated the resurgence of a glaring binary structural conflict in China's economy, or a rewidening of our urban-rural market and economic gaps, whose impacts were similarly far-reaching. a. The impact on our market development. As rural markets still made up over 50 percent of China's retail commodity market, the slowing of peasant income growth and our rural market-development rate was bound to affect the expansion of our overall retail commodity market. b. The impact on domestic enterprises. In particular, the rural market pull was mainly on domestic labor-intensive and traditional consumer goods industries. Changes in this part of the market would have a great impact on the development of these domestic industries. This situation was particularly disadvantageous to domestic-market enterprises that were subject to eversharpening competition, particularly to state enterprises and a large number of our midwestern township enterprises. As Chinese industry was currently still lacking in capability and competitiveness to meet domestic high-tech market demand, there was room for improvement in its urban market share. In addition, our rural market inadequacy of the time left Chinese enterprises sharply restricted by overall domestic-market demand growth. c. Rural market change was having a clear impact on our rural industrialization. As a key market of rural industry was the rural areas, this was going to further impact peasant income growth, putting it into an unhealthy cycle. d. Rural market change and the widening urban-rural economic gap also had a farreaching impact on our agricultural development and overall economic stability. This problem needed solved in ways, such as rapidly upgrading urban industry to concede a part of the market to rural industry, and increasing exports of rural labor-intensive products. In the short term, as the existence of this problem affected mainly the effective expansion of consumer goods markets, as well as the market share of domestic enterprises, it could be held that domestic consumer-goods market demand, as to domestic enteprises, was in a state of stable growth, so would not exert a strong pull. 3. State-Asset Reorganization and a Solution for State Enterprises Was a Matter in Urgent Need of Resolution. Our 1993 economic fluctuations reexposed the problems existing in state enterprises and state-asset operations, such as low operating efficiency, unmarketable products, poor market competitiveness, economic cooling, triangular debt, product overstocking, and growth rates down sharply, which showed up first in state enterprises. These problems were essentially ones that state enterprises and state assets could not adjust to properly in the course of excellence through market competition, leaving their structures and situations severely unsuited to market-demand changes and competition needs. So we had to reorganize state assets to complete our structural-adjustment mission, while speeding up our conversion of state-enterprise operating forces to meet market-competition needs. The existing problems in our state enterprises and state assets left China's economy with very little capability to sustain regulation and control. Once growth rates fell, this would put great pressure on government, as well as sharply discounting our overall economic growth efficiency, to lower our economic growth quality. 4. Our Factor-Market Development Remained Poor, With a Lack of Market Order, and Still Unsound Capability To Regulate Factor-Disposition. Our 1993 economic-order chaos showed up conspicuously in factor markets, with economic regulation and control also being expressed mainly as rectification of factor markets. As we generally controlled factor-market scale to reduce the factor-market impact on the disposition of [production] factors, factor markets remained unable to improve quickly or develop fully. But in view of our socialist market economy reforms, which required the establishment of a complete market system, as factor markets played a key role in the market system and the market-disposition of resources, as well as being a crucial grounds for the new form of macroeconomic regulation and control, factor-market development and improvement was imperative. A matter that required attention was the relations between an appropriate resolution of factor-market development and the conversion of macroeconomic regulation and control style, to ensure an effective macroeconomic regulation and control capability. Analysis of these problems shows that while the Chinese economy has entered a period of more mature growth, deeper development and system conflicts remain, affecting the sound development of our whole economy. Along with our dual growth and system conversion, the time is gradually approaching to resolve these deeper conflicts, so that we are facing a crucial period for reform and development. III. An Evaluation of Our 1994 Economic Trends The determining factors in our 1994 economic trends are roughly as follows: Demand-expansion potential, including investment growth and domestic market demand expansion; supply-growth potential, including farm-product supply growth, and basic and key raw material supply-growth capability; our international balance of payments, reflected mainly in import-growth capability; inflation trends and economic and social sustainability. These are separately analyzed and projected below. 1. An Analysis of Our Demand-Expansion Prospects We hold that our major demand-expansion area in 1994 will remain investment, which is interrelated with our conversion of growth style and change in development stage. Our investment demand in 1994 will be affected by investment aspirations, investment fund sources, and investment-fund supply channels. Investment aspirations will be related to our current development stage, about which all parties will remain exceptionally exuberant. For a detailed analysis, our 1994 planned investment is 1.4-1.45 trillion yuan, up an estimated 16.7 percent from 1993, basically suited to our GNP growth rate of about 10 percent for the first time in years of planning, showing that the Central Government has made quite large plans for increased investment. Local governments will remain burdened on one hand with the problems of employment, shortage limitations, and invigoration of local economies, while being further heavily motivated by 1994 reelection activities on the other. In addition, as our overall economic policy will be for the whole nation to seize the opportunity for faster development, local government investment aspirations will also remain exceptionally strong. Enterprises faced with great pressures from market change, equipment upgrading, and the establishment of new-product production lines will also take active steps to invest more. In general, the aspirations of all parties to invest more will remain very strong. Investment fund sources will also be more abundant. Current estimates are that 1993 was our year of fastest income growth and most savings growth, with our savings deposit balance at 1.46 trillion yuan by the end of November, up 30.6 percent from the same period in 1992. In addition, 1994 will see still better terms for a further increase in our use of foreign investment. Our real use of foreign investment had reached $22.7 billion for the first three quarters of 1993, and is expected to top $30 billion for all of 1994, to be a major funding source for investment. In addition, once our exchange rates are merged in 1994, some of the foreign-exchange funds that flowed abroad in 1993 will flow back to China, also adding to our investment funding sources. The current problem is in investment fund channels. On one hand, local government investment fund channels are down in the new investment-finance system, with limitations on channels, such as credit fund regulation authority, the two basic regulation funds, and fundraising. On the other, once the central government sets up the policy-investment bank, it may have trouble smoothly dovetailing it with its former investment-control sector, which problem might affect investment-fund supply. But we hold that investment sources will be abundant, with strong investment aspirations by all parties, so that investment demand will remain very high. As to consumer demand, 1994 will see a stable growth trend. For a detailed analysis, urban consumption will grow faster, particularly in large cities. Certain new consumer hotspots will further expand. For instance, areas, such as housing and interior decoration, telephone and communications equipment, new-age home electronics, and private automobiles, will all grow faster. But as rural markets will be in a slow trend, with the purchasing power in small and midsize cities and of low- and middle-income city dwellers for new consumer goods remaining obviously inadequate, consumer markets will generally remain in a state of sustained, steady growth roughly similar to 1993. In general, demand in 1994 will maintain a brisk growth momentum pulled by investment. We predict for 1994 an investment growth rate at prvailing prices of still over 30 percent, with retail commodity sales growth remaining at about 20 percent. As domestic demand will remain very brisk, our 1994 exports will still maintain their low-growth trend and, despite the impact of factors, such as the merging of exchange rates, are predicted to have a growth rate still not higher than 10 percent. This analysis shows that as to demand pull, 1994 will still have high economic-growth conditions. 2. An Analysis of Our Supply-Growth Prospects The product supplies closely connected to demand expansion are farm products, transport capability, power, and key production raw materials. Overall, 1993 remained a year of bumper agricultural harvests. While our cotton and sugar crop yields were lower, our farm product supplies in general still had a certain potential. Our railway transport capacity grew slowly in 1993, below 3 percent, probably indicating inadequate railway transport growth. So our 1994 transport capacity will be one of supply shortages on top of shortages. As 40 percent of our railway transport capacity goes to coal shipping, transport-capacity limitations will directly affect our energy growth, which will be quite a large restraint on our 1994 economic growth. In 1993, our rolled steel supplies grew very quickly. By the end of November, despite our sustained high economic growth, our rolled steel inventories were still up 21.5 percent from the same period in 1992. But our 1993 rolled steel supply growth was due to exceptional factors: a) Iron and steel enterprises, induced by market prices, put their equipment into overload production, with rolled steel output up 16.7 percent for the first 11 months, making 1993 another year of high growth on the heels of that in 1992. b) Guided by market prices, imports grew excessively. By the end of November, rolled steel imports had reached 25.81 million tons, up 370 percent from 1992. In 1994, as all of these factors will have a much lower impact, with iron and steel enterprise growth potential no longer large, and sharp import growth also restricted by foreign exchange, our rolled steel supply growth rate will be back down sharply from 1993. This analysis shows that in 1994, our supply-growth potential will be lower than our demand-expansion potential. From a supply-growth perspective, this will support a GNP growth rate of only about 10 percent, leaving a definite gap with our demand-expansion momentum. 3. An Analysis of Our International Balance of Payments Prospects This involves mostly an analysis and forecast of our trade balance and foreign exchange reserves. We have already analyzed above our 1994 export growth rate, which will be lower. But our import growth will remain faster, due on one hand to our great domestic market-expansion potential (investment and consumer demand), and on the other to the large gap between our domestic supply and demand structures. So in 1994, our imports will grow faster than our exports, with our trade foreign-exchange balance remaining in a deficit state, and our foreign exchange reserves down further. By the end of November 1993, our state foreign exchange reserves were at a level of enough exchange to pay for two and one-half months of imports. If this declines further in 1994, it will very quickly fall below the warning line. Our state of international balance of payments shows that there will be little capability in 1994 to increase domestic supplies through imports, which will further restrict our domestic supply-growth potential. Particularly once our exchange rates are merged in 1994, the probable exchange-rate rise will touch off a tariff-base change, which will put definite limitations on import growth. This will have the impact of easing our international balance of payments, while restricting our supply growth. 4. An Analysis of Our Inflation Prospects After November 1993, our domestic market prices went into a further rising trend, with the general appearance in particular of rising prices for basic consumer goods, such as food, and many places afflicted with the phenomenon of panic-buying of grain, edible oil, and meat. So our 1994 price and inflation trends have become a hot topic of widespread concern to all. We hold that our 1994 prices and inflation will be determined by our macroeconomic regulation and control steps and effective market management. The above supply analysis shows that our supply-growth potential will still be able to support a GNP growth rate of approximately 10 percent which, generally speaking, is still quite a high growth rate. If supply can be kept within the limits of growth, there will be neither a large gap between supply and demand, or severe inflation and price rises. But as our 1994 demand-expansion momentum will remain very strong, being larger than our supply-growth potential, if we do not regulate and control at all our demand-pulled high economic growth, but adopt rather an incentive policy, our prevailing-price growth rate will be very high, with very severe inflation and price rises. In addition, the phenomenon since November 1993 of faster price rises for basic consumer goods, particularly grain, is sharply related to the lack of the necessary control, restraint, and regulatory means for grain and edible oil markets since grain and edible oil prices were deregulated. This phenomenon shows more of a market-management problem than one of tight supply and demand for basic consumer goods and farm products. So as long as our overall macroeconomic regulation and control steps in 1994 are correct, to effectively control and regulate markets for daily necessities, such as grain and edible oil, we will not see severe price rises for basic consumer goods. Summing up the above analyses, we hold that 1994 may bring either of two economic trends: a) A situation in which high growth and more severe inflation coexist, in which case we will likely see major regulation and control steps taken in the last half or fourth quarter, bringing quite sharp economic fluctuation. b) An overall policy keynote of appropriate regulation and control to bring higher but stable growth, accompanied by sustainable, approximately 10 percent price rises and inflation. The key to which trend will occur will be determined by our 1994 macroeconomic-policy keynote. We hold that we ought to base our actions on a correct understanding of our supply potential and growth conditions, to choose an overall macroeconomic policy orientation of appropriate regulation and control, in an attempt to achieve the second growth trend. IV. Major Issues and Suggested Countermeasures for 1994 1. Investment-Finance System-Reform and Rational Guidance of Investment In 1994, we are going to establish a policy-investment bank, which will combine the former control functions of the State Planning Commission and the Economics and Trade Commission over capital construction and technological-upgrading investment, for joint control of investment funds. In addition, local government investment-fund sources will be sharply restricted. This reform will involve two issues: a) Whether investment channels can be opened up to impact investment growth; b) Whether our investment orientation can be guided correctly to resolve the problem pointed out in the above analysis of the lack of coordination between our investment-growth and economic-growth structures. We hold that the key to the first issue is to rationalize the relations of the policy-investment bank with the Planning and the Economics and Trade commissions, for an effective increase in Central Government investment. This issue is actually related to the second one, as a correct guidance of investment orientation, in addition to perfecting the functioning of market forces, will more importantly bring the government role in the disposition of funds into full play in our current economic development stage, which role must be realized mainly in the form of Central Government investment. So in investment-finance system-reform, we need to give central place to Central Government investment, by ensuring that Central Government investment channels are open. In addition, we need to analyze in detail Central Government investment targets. Of our investment fields that are currently under little market guidance, in addition to infrastructures and some basic industry, the most prominent ones are high-tech industries, such as the equipment and basic electronics industries, which are industrial forerunners. As these require large investments, are highly capital- and technology-intensive, have long investment-construction periods, and do not have clear short-term market prospects, enterprises and localities find it very hard to invest in these fields, leaving a particular need for Central Government investment guidance. We hold that there is now more emphasis on infrastructure and basic industry construction, but not enough on faster development and construction of high-tech forerunner industries, so that the latter should be given priority. This will be the only way to promote faster upgrading of our industrial structure. In investment-fund use, central government investment should give prominence to industrial-policy targets, rather than being overaffected by microeconomic efficiency goals. Otherwise, the market role would interfere too much in Central investment activities, making it impossible for the Central Government to supplement market defects through direct investment. So when coordinating the relations between the former government-investment control sector and the policy bank, we need to effectvely meet mostly industrial-policy needs, instead of overemphasizing microeconomic capital efficiency. Summing up this analysis, we hold that the crux of our 1994 financial-system reform should be to effectively increase central government investment capability, as well as using mostly industrial policy to set central government investment orientation. This will also be of significance in effectively regulating and controlling our investment-growth rate, thus affecting overall demand. 2. Effectively Combining Financial-System Reform With Overall Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Our analysis of our 1994 economic trends shows that rapid and sound economic growth in 1994 will depend largely on the central government's overall macroecnomic regulation and control capability, centered on its financial regulation and control capability. A very important part of our 1994 financial reform will be making specialized banks more businesslike, in which process, whether reform is complete or not, specialized banks will acquire more independent decisionmaking power. As our regulation and control of specialized banks and overall financial activities will be converted more to setting the basic money supply and benchmark interest rates, effective financial regulation and control will be a mojor issue affecting our overall economic situation. We hold that in 1994, our capability to control fund volume and regulate and control financial activities through the basic money supply will be sharply lower. This is due mainly to too much basic currency having been put into circulation in the fourth quarter of 1993. From September through November, the central bank put over 200 billion yuan in basic money supply into circulation, promoting a rapid increase in bank loans, which grew more than 250 billion yuan in October and November, over twice their increase for the first three quarters. As we estimate that even more money was put into circulation in December, we are projecting our loan increase for 1993 at 470 billion yuan, up 22 percent from 1992. Under such concentrated lending and putting into circulation of basic currency, funds grew very quickly for both all specialized banks and enterprises. Our current specialized bank provision rate is over 13 percent, sharply higher than the normal level of 5-7 percent, and more than 10 points higher than that at the beginning of 1993, showing that bank credit-expansion potential is great. As to enterprise funds, enterprise deposits began to bottom out in October, growing 24 billion yuan that month, over 50 billion yuan in November, and an estimated even larger amount in December. This shows that the large amount of funds put into circulation are already higher than our objective economic-growth needs. Our calculations show the unit-loan-increase correspondence to industrial output value growth at 1.50 yuan for 1991 and 2.47 yuan for 1992, but only at 0.55 yuan for September through November 1993. This situation is now more stable on one hand because the rapid demand growth, particularly that of investment, is subject to a time lag in pulling high-speed economic growth. On the other, it is due to more control steps directed at specialized banks, such as the relending of basic currency put into circulation going first to the head offices of all specialized banks where it is divided up among all branches, and all specialized bank branch large-denomination remittance settlements having to go through the central bank, all of which have sharply reduced fund turnover rates, partially offsetting the impact of more overall funds. As specialized banks make entrepreneurial reforms in 1994, the above measures to restrict specialized banks will be affected to decrease in impact, with resulting faster fund turnover rates, and problems related to more overall funds growing more conspicuous. In addition, as it is predicted that investment demand will expand rapidly in the first quarter of 1994 due to massive fund support, the enterprise fund-turnover rate will also accelerate. Summing up this analysis, the excessive amount of credit granted in the fourth quarter of 1933, and the entrepreneurial reforms of specialized banks in 1994, will sharply reduce the capability of the central bank in 1994 to regulate and control overall finance through controlling the basic money supply. As to the function of benchmark interest rates, since China has still not perfected our money markets, once specialized banks become businesslike, as new restraint forces will remain hard to evolve in a short time, and particularly as prices will fluctuate sharply during rapid economic growth, benchmark interest rates will still have a weak capability to regulate overall finance. Summing up this analysis, the Central Government's overall macroeconomic regulation and control capability will be lower in 1994 than in 1993, with financial reforms likely to exacerbate this trend. As to the sound growth of our overall economy, this will pose a potential danger. In light of this, in our 1994 financial reform, we should pay conscientious attention to its impact on our macroeconomic regulation and control capability, particularly on our financial regulation and control capability. Moreover, we should cut back on the amount of basic currency put into circulation starting from the beginning of 1994, in an attempt to reduce the impact of the excessive amount put into circulation. Meanwhile, we should standardize and perfect as quickly as possible our money-market order, by strengthening restraints on enterprises, particularly financial enterprises, in an attempt to strengthen the regulatory impact of capital prices on financing activities. 3. The Merging of Our Exchange Rates and Our Balance of International Payments In our 1994 economic trends, the major support to supply will be import growth and, as long as supply grows faster, we will be able to achieve our goal of rapid economic growth with low inflation. So import-growth potential has a supportive capability for our international balance of payments, being one of our key grounds for sound economic growth in 1994. Our 1994 foreign exchange reform will abolish foreign exchange retention and quota control, deregulating foreign exchange prices, with banks managing foreign exchange services and foreign exchange transaction activities. This will have the impact of probably raising foreign-exchange exchange rates and, once foreign exchange quota control is abolished, affecting central import activities, also lowering central ability to control overall foreign exchange usage. While it is predicted that higher exchange rates will stimulate exports and restrict imports, having a good impact on our international balance of payments, the restriction on central imports may have a bad impact on our import structure. Imports of capital goods where the relations between domestic and international prices have not yet been rationalized, as well as ones, such as crude oil, refined oil, and grain, will be impacted sharply, while imports, such as high-priced, high-profit manufactured consumer goods, will grow faster, which will be particularly adverse to supporting effective supply growth. In addition, more importantly, our ability to control the use of foreign exchange will decline. As pointed out in our above analysis, exports will grow slowly and imports sharply in 1994, putting foreign exchange in a state of undersupply. So easing our foreign exchange control in such a state is very likely to touch off large exchange rates volatility, as well as reducing our foreign exchange reserves faster, thus weakening our ability to regulate and control our international balance of payments. This could result in a deterioration in our international balance of payments, forcing the government to institute a policy of overall economic retrenchment. As to economic growth, this is yet another unstable factor. So in our 1994 foreign exchange system reform and exchange rates merging, we need to pay attention to overall economic trends, particularly our international balance of payments, by doing all possible to avoid or lower the negative impacts pointed out in our above analysis, in order to pave the way for a more effective use of foreign exchange funds, the overall strengthening of our macroeconomic regulation and control capability, and better macroeconomic regulation and control effectiveness.
