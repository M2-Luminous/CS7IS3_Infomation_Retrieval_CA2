During his talks with Premier Li Peng, the two agreed that the DPRK should open all its nuclear sites to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). However, there was apparent discord between them -- Hosokawa, with a sense of crisis, urged China to persuade the DPRK to accept the nuclear inspections while Li called for exercising prudence in dealing with the issue. The DPRK issue is expected to be a main topic in Japanese-South Korean and Sino-South Korean summits scheduled for this weekend. Because it has become apparent that China is taking a cautious approach, Tokyo will have to review its plan for "Japan, the United States, China, and the ROK to work in closer cooperation" in dealing with the DPRK issue. Hosokawa repeatedly touched on the suspected nuclear weapons development by the DPRK during his talks with President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li on 20 March. He said: "It (what the DPRK is doing) is delaying tactics," and "the international community's patience has been running out and it is possible that attempts to resolve this nuclear issue through dialogue might end in failure." Compared with Tokyo's traditional stand, his remarks were a little harsher to Pyongyang in response to the DPRK's recent attitude. Behind his remarks lie growing arguments in Japan, the United States, and the ROK that "if these nations try to resolve the issue only through dialogue, they will fall into the DPRK's tactics" (according to a government source). The DPRK nuclear issue has direct influence on security in Japan and other northeast Asian nations. In recent summits, Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton shared the same view on this grave problem and agreed to work in closer cooperation in dealing with it. In view of current relations between Washington and Beijing, Japan is the only nation that can make requests to China. It is certain that being aware of this, Hosokawa visited Beijing. However, Beijing did not fully accept Japan's requests. Because there are about 2 million Koreans living along the China-DPRK border, any actions that provoke the DPRK might also create commotion in China. Moreover, it is rumored that DPRK President Kim Il-song will visit Beijing in the near future. In such a situation, it is a matter of course for China to think it is best to exercise prudence. Another reason for China rejecting Japan's requests might be that it tried to indirectly check the United States from carrying out a hard-line policy against the DPRK. Because China's cautious attitude has become apparent through the recent Japanese-Sino summit, some people have begun to think that even if the DPRK nuclear issue is sent from the IAEA to the UN Security Council [UNSC], it is uncertain whether the UNSC will be able to adopt a resolution calling for sanctions against the DPRK because if China, a permanent UNSC member, should exercise its veto power, the resolution will be killed. A government source said: "Tokyo will consider strengthening its persuasion on China." Nevertheless, China's cautious approach might affect future cooperation between "Japan, the United States, China, and the ROK." During his talks with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam scheduled for 24 March, Hosokawa is to discuss with the president cooperation between Japan and South Korea in dealing with the DPRK. After visiting Japan, President Kim is to visit China to meet with Chinese leaders. The DPRK issue occupies a major position in a series of summits between Japan and China, Japan and the ROK, and China and the ROK. It can be said that in the recent Japanese-Sino talks, the first in a series of summits, Tokyo was forced to review its plan for "Japan, the United States, China, and South Korea to work in closer cooperation" in dealing with the DPRK.
