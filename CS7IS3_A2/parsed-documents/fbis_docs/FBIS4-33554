"Untimely statements such as this violate the cardinal and universal principles of sovereignty and self-determination that govern relations among nations," a communique issued by the provisional government pointed out. "The sacred land of Haiti is not and will never be the backyard of any other state, not even of the world's most powerful," the document added. After reminding that the use of force remains among the U.S. options for restoring democracy in Haiti, Clinton pointed out on 19 May, the United States has "significant interests" in this country, which is located "in the backyard" of the United States. He also commented on the problem of the Haitian refugees and on drug trafficking.
