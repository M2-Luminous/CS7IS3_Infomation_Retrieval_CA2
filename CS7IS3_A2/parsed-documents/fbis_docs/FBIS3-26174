Wu Jianmin, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said this at a routine news conference this afternoon, when asked to comment on former British Ambassador to China Sir Percy Cradock's criticism of Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten in an article carried by the "SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST". Wu said that China has noticed that there are different voices within Britain over the Hong Kong issue. He noted that to maintain cooperation between China and Britain on the matter of Hong Kong is in accordance with the interests of the two sides. He said that Patten's intransigence and uncooperative attitude would end up harming Britain's own interests. Cradock was ambassador to China from June 1978 to December 1983. On China's reaction toward the recently tabled fourth funding plan for the construction of the new Hong Kong airport, Wu said that the Chinese Government had just received the new financial arrangement plan from the British side and was studying it earnestly. He said that the new airport issue should be settled in accordance with the memorandum of understanding reached between China and Britain. In the process of such settlement, the British side should demonstrate its sincerity, Wu said, adding that the Chinese side has already demonstrated a lot of sincerity over the Hong Kong matter.
