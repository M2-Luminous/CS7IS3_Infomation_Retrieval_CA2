Janis Adamsons told reporters on return from a border inspection trip. The border control is hampered by the acute lack of funding and equipment, as well as inefficiency of certain officials. The Frontier Brigade received 42 percent of the required minimal funding this year, Adamsons said. Border guards have 47 percent of needed vehicles not speaking about specific technologies, he noted. Many work organization problems also wait for solution, the commander said. For example, several units are stationed 70 kilometers from frontier, he said. The average discipline of guards is "rather poor," said Adamsons, "separate unit chiefs imagine that they can take nation-scope decisions." During the spot check, Adamsons fired 12 officers. He, however, denied it being "personnel cleansing" because the sacked people were unprofessional and lacked discipline. Adamsons called absurd the present situation when serving border guards face 92 criminal charges or former convicts join the staff. The economic protection of Latvia stands the main task of border guards in the present situation, said Adamsons. The large quantity of imported food blocks the development of local agriculture, he said. According to guards' estimates, 20 percent of imported food is contraband. Adamsons said the brigade command will propose the government to allow border guards to confiscate not only the illegal cargos but also the vehicles that carry them. The Latvian Border Guard Brigade has a personnel of 4,000. Around 900 border guards work on the border daily checking 8,500 Latvian citizens and 10,000 visitors.
