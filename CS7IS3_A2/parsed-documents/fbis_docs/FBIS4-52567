On that occasion, the Russian ambassador thanked Samdech Chea Sim for allowing him to come and bid farewell before returning to his country on 8 May 1994, after the completion of his mission in Cambodia. The ambassador expressed his regret and nostalgia over his departure from Cambodia, where he had been working for 24 years in close bilateral cooperation to reinforce and expand the relations in all fields, especially in the process of seeking peace, national reconciliation, and national compromise to put an end to the Cambodian war. This process remains unsuccessful due to the Party of Democratic Kampuchea's intransigence and refusal to join the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC]. Anyway, the Russian envoy emphasized that even though he was to undertake his task in another place, he would continue his endeavor to seek peace for Cambodia. In his reply, Samdech Chea Sim thanked Russia for its assistance to Cambodia and for the success resulting from its good bilateral cooperation with the country. He expressed hope that Russia would further its diplomatic cooperation with Cambodia after the departure of H.E. Yuriy Mirkotnykh. Again the Russian ambassador said Russia would make arrangements for welcoming Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs of the Kingdom of Cambodia, who will soon visit Russia to sign a number of agreements on international cooperation between the two countries. He added that Russia would always support the RGC and National Assembly. Samdech Chea Sim thanked Russia for its support for the National Assembly and RGC, saying he hoped that in the cooperation between the two countries' assemblies there would be exchanges of visits by various assembly committees to strengthen and promote the process of rehabilitating and rebuilding the countries toward prosperity. On that occasion, the Russian ambassador asked Samdech Chea Sim about the roundtable meeting between the RGC and the Party of Democratic Kampuchea. Commenting on this issue Samdech Chea Sim said the RGC has exerted its all-out efforts in this problem, but the Khmer Rouge side refuses to meet in Phnom Penh under the pretext that the city is not neutral and that there is no security for its delegation, although the RGC has already made all kinds of guarantees. The samdech also pointed out that the roundtable meeting had not been held yet and that it can take place only if a cease-fire is implemented beforehand. On the issue of reorganizing elections proposed by His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk -- who has said that if the Khmer Rouge are real patriots, he will propose new general elections to be organized by Cambodian parties without the participation of the United Nations -- Samdech Chea Sim said the Khmer Rouge side has not yet given its answer to this proposal and that the Cambodian National Assembly is currently considering it and awaiting a decision from the RGC. The samdech stressed that if polls are to be reorganized, the Constitution should be changed, and the RGC and National Assembly should be dissolved. This move, he added, appears to be beneficial to the Khmer Rouge. The Russian ambassador also wanted to know about the RGC's decision to outlaw the Khmer Rouge. On this issue, Samdech Chea Sim said this move has been put aside and that the RGC and National Assembly have not discussed it yet. He further said that next week, the National Assembly will continue its session to discuss the appointment of new MP's to replace the old ones and debate diverse laws as planned in the agenda.
