"Japan has relied on the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. If it calls it (the use of nuclear arms) unlawful, nuclear deterrence would be rendered ineffective," the premier said. Hata made the remarks at a House of Councillors Budget Committee session in connection with a statement Japan submitted to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on June 10. Japan has dropped from the document a phrase saying the use of nuclear arms does not violate international law. The country had been criticized at home and abroad after reports that it would present a document including such a phrase. In spite of the deletion, the government has not changed its opinion that the use of nuclear arms cannot be called a violation of international law since nuclear deterrence exists. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told the same session that the importance of nuclear deterrence cannot yet be denied, pointing out that China recently conducted a nuclear test.
