In a brief statement prior to their departure, Lord Owen stressed that it is too early to evaluate the results of their tour before they complete their meetings in Tirana and Rome. Lord Owen said that it was his general impression that the voices of the neighbors of the former Yugoslavia, who are suffering serious losses from the Yugoslav embargo, should be heard more loudly and clearly. Here is what Lord Owen said when asked by a correspondent whether he would support the cancellation of the Yugoslav sanctions: [Owen] No, I do not favor lifting the sanctions. At this stage, such a step would be premature. Anyway, it is not my job to lift them; it is a matter for the UN Security Council. However, the sanctions were imposed for a specific purpose, and in the final analysis they should serve to achieve this aim. If it becomes clear that there is no way that the sanctions will bring about a settlement, then indeed it will be necessary to raise the question of lifting them.
