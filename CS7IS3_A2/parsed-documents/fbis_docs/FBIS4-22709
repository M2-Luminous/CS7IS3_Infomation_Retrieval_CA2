Nevertheless, let us not forget that for a long time PACT's name has been literally a permanent fixture on the pages of some local newspapers (now no longer published), which organized the hounding of "red directors," who allegedly [line missing] of Maritime Kray's economic potential... PACT's real work meanwhile remained, as they say, outside the framework. Our VLADIVOSTOK correspondent asked PACT's Vice President Vladimir Kolesnichenko to describe what this organization was really doing and what it intends to do after its "exoneration." [Kolesnichenko] All this time we have been doing the same thing as before--developing within PACT's framework a mechanism for structural restructuring of the kray economy. Why did we of all people undertake this task? PACT, which is a financial-industrial group, or consortium, is the first structure in Russia set up on the Western model, with an orientation toward a high degree of survivability in a free-market environment--both of the corporation as a whole and each of its component enterprises. In short, we took as a basis the "keiretsu" system--currently the most effective form of enterprise integration in the world. Having integrated themselves into a multisectoral concern, which typically has its own bank, trading companies, joint ownership of stock, and so on, these enterprises orient themselves in terms of earning profits mainly at investing in the most promising developments, as well as further commercialization of interrelated products and markets. This, by the way, explains why Japan, where the "keiretsu" system is most widely used, is winning the competition against the United States today. In September of last year the Ministry of the Economy approved the initiative to create PACT; a decision was made to conduct an experiment and then extend our experience to all of Russia, testimony of which was the president's December decree on the creation of financial-industrial groups in the country. Then, however, political intrigues around PACT began, involving audits by uncountable commissions from the government, financial organs, the procuracy, and even state security, which, although not quite paralyzing the organization's activities, did considerably slow down the work on structural restructuring that had at first taken off very energetically. Now the situation has changed. No matter how much Government Decree No. 1001 is berated, it has been implemented at least in one respect: The kray has been granted a very preferential rate in paying for electric power (40 rubles [R] per kilowatt). Had it not been for this, the kray economy would have ground to a halt as early as last fall. In May, however, we expect a sharp jump in thermal-electric power rates for industrial consumers--the government says that it is no longer able to maintain such low rates. It is not difficult to predict what will happen then--half the enterprises will find themselves on the brink of bankruptcy, and a considerable part of the labor force (in our estimates, between 20 and 40 percent) may be laid off. That is, we have practically approached the point of having no time left for "contemplation." A considerable part of PACT is comprised of former defense enterprises reorganized into joint-stock companies and undergoing conversion. The situation there is very difficult now. Military production at these enterprises for all practical purposes has been suspended; people are not paid wages (or if they are paid, it is in miserable amounts), but neither are they told what to do. Maintenance of these "dead" production facilities is done essentially at the expense of stockholders, which is a road straight to bankruptcy. In other words, collectives have found themselves in a sort of economic trap. Very soon annual stockholder meetings will begin at these enterprises, and people may demand dividends on their stock. They have a right to ask the board of every AO [joint-stock company]: Why do banks and investment funds produce capital and pay dividends, and you cannot? What we would like to do is to decide at each such meeting--taking into account stockholders' opinion, of course--what to produce, which production may be halted, where to sell the products, and so on. But first the government must decide where it stands and finally say clearly that at such and such enterprises in the kray it is in the interests of the state to produce such and such output in such and such volume, etc. Our proposals in this respect, including full conversion of defense enterprises, are already in the State Committee on Industry and are a component part of the kray program of structural restructuring of the economy. The government is preparing its own version of such restructuring, but in principle the entire burden of practical implementation will fall on the kray. We have to our own thinking--no good uncle will help us in this--on how to preserve jobs by starting production of competitive products that consumers need, and finding markets for their distribution--including abroad. It will probably be a very painful process. Structural restructuring of the economy is no rose garden; some lay-offs are inevitable, and therefore, I want to repeat, the priority problem we will have to deal with is how and where to employ these people. This is not a problem that is limited to PACT. Structural restructuring will extend to the entire kray, and this is at a time when we cannot really count on any significant help on the part of the state. In our calculations, structural restructuring of the kray economy in 1994 will require R2.3 trillion in current prices; nobody will give us this kind of money, of course. But we have a kind of counterproposal to the state: Since you do not have this money, let us work on signing an agreement with China on sales of Maritime Kray products in its markets, first and foremost in its northern provinces. There is no doubt that our industrial potential is higher than that at many Chinese enterprises, and therefore we can be competitive with them. The same may be said regarding the markets of North Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. We should not be afraid to take our products there; we also need to look for investors and find them. For instance, we already have concrete developments with respect to investment intents on the part of a number of Taiwanese companies. Over the past year the consolidated profit of PACT enterprises amounted to R87 billion. This is a considerable amount, but probably is not enough for every one of the corporation's component enterprises. What enterprises are in most acute need of today is first and foremost capital, money. Since we cannot count on outside help, we in PACT intend to apply internally the method of "pulling ourselves up by the bootstraps." The substance of this is that the government will give us the right, so to say, on a tax-free basis to direct part of the profits generated, for instance, by Dalpribor, into the development of, for instance, a Vladivostok meat-processing plant. We are not talking about "charity" here--this project will be presented to Dalpribor stockholders, with the length of time needed to receive a payoff and returns on investment, the prospects for the new production, etc. This is what structural restructuring is: First we pull up one segment, then another... I am convinced that today this is the only real way, which we need to take. Of course, some may think that there is too much abstract reasoning in this. What structural restructuring of the economy, they say--people have to live today, and wages are low... But in most cases this is precisely why they are so low--there is no way to pay more if production is either idle or operating at half capacity, producing goods that accumulate in warehouses and cannot be sold. Therefore, as I have already said, the "wait-and-see" period is over, unless we shift production as soon as possible into making products everyone needs, while preserving jobs (or creating new ones), unless we find new distribution markets, unless we train a completely new type of managers to run these enterprises, and do many other things, the crisis in the kray economy may indeed reach extremes. The time of uncertainty and talk is over; it is time to act now. PACT is ready to be the first to start this difficult work.
