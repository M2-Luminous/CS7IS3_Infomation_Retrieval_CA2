This time the newly appointed deputies are sitting on the benches. The session should start any minute. Dr. Vojislav Dimitrijevic, the oldest deputy, has still not taken the seat of the chairman. Let me remind you that Dr. Dimitrijevic chaired the previous assembly last year. He will be assisted in chairing the session by the two youngest deputies, Aleksandar Vucic and Milan Dragisic. These deputies from the Serbian Radical Party have already taken their seats at the chairing table. The first part of the session should be taken up by the verification of the deputies' mandates. One of the 250 deputies will be elected chairman of the Assembly. The four deputy chairmen are also to be elected today. At least 30 deputies are needed to put forward a candidate for chairman. We have found out unofficially that the Socialist Party of Serbia will put forward Dr. Zoran Arandjelovic, the previous chairman, as candidate. We have also found out unofficially that the Democratic Movement of Serbia [Depos] will put forward as candidate for chairman one of the following deputies: Vuk Draskovic, Dusan Mihajlovic, Milan Nikovic, or Borivoje Borovic. So one of them will be the Depos candidate for chairman of the Assembly. The voting will be as the deputies decide, public or secret. The candidate who gets the majority vote will be elected chairman. When the Assembly is constituted the procedure will commence for the formation of the government. The president of Serbia will put forward the candidate for the new prime minister. At least 126 votes are needed for his election. The deadline for the formation of the government has not been given. Esteemed listeners, I am saying all this in the expectation that the Serbian Assembly session will begin. It is about to start. We will let you know more in our next newscast.
