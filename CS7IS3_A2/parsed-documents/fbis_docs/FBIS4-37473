The brother president said that the Western Sahara issue is an issue of special interest and was the subject of deep concern for the presidents of the African states who attended the 30th OAU summit. The brother president pointed out that the latest proposal put forward by the Polisario Front, calling for the convening of an international conference for giving a boost to the UN peace plan on Western Sahara, is considered by the organization as a constructive initiative and was approved in a report by the OAU secretary general. With regard to a question related to Morocco's stance, which rejects OAU participation, the brother president said that Morocco has constantly used all forms of maneuvering and procrastination and today it rejects the OAU participation in the identification process and this is a blatant violation of the text and spirit of the UN-OAU peace plan based on African resolution 104. The brother president added: Through our contacts with the various African heads of states, we made a full denunciation of the Moroccan stance which calls basically for blowing up the UN-OAU peace plan, stipulating the organization of a free, just, and unbiased referendum for the Saharan people. He highlighted that this Moroccan stance is dangerous and would put Morocco in a clear and open conflict with the UN, the OAU and international legality. [passage indistinct].
