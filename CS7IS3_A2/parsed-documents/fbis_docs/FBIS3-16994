[Karasin] We would very much not like to bring the situation to a head, or to sanctions. Evidently the necessity has arisen to look at the situation attentively and discuss it with our partners. In particular the Russian and Japanese foreign ministers discussed this issue yesterday. And we have to find a quick, effective, and possibly even unusual solution to this problem. [Announer] Can Russia, bearing in mind her recent successes in foreign policy, become an intermediary in the dialogue between Pyongyang and the countries of the West? Here is Grigoriy Karasin once again. [Karasin] To be honest, I am not going to lay all my cards on the table. I just want to say that the appropriate senior Foreign Ministry employees have left for Vienna and are taking part in the discussions of this problem there. They return to Moscow tomorrow. We will take a close look at all possiblities and all approaches, and naturally we will act with energy.
