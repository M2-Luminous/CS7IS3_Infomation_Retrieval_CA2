Has Russian and U.S. Pressure Yielded Results?"] [Text] Recently Ukraine has speeded up the dismantling of the nuclear missile potential it has inherited. On 20 December Valeriy Shmarov, Ukrainian vice premier in charge of the military industrial complex, announced that 17 nuclear SS-24 missiles (in all there are 46 SS-24's in Ukraine) have been taken off alert. Combat nuclear units (more than 100) have been taken down from missiles, yet they still remain in silos. Before the end of the year Ukraine has promised to dismantle warheads from yet another three SS-24 missiles. And in 1994, according to Valeriy Shmarov, the remaining SS-24 missiles located on Ukraine's territory are to be taken off alert status. This, in spite of the fact that back on 11 August Grishchenko, head of the Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry's Arms Control and Disarmament Department, announced that, in Kiev's opinion, the Ukrainian SS-24's do not come under the START I Treaty and therefore may legally be kept. The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed that 17 warheads have indeed been taken down from SS-24 missiles. In addition, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, nuclear units have been dismantled from 41 Ukrainian SS-19 missiles (more than 200 units) while part of the SS-19 missiles have already been taken out of their silos for subsequent destruction. Therefore approximately one-third of the Ukrainian nuclear missile capability has been taken off alert. Clearly the joint Russian-U.S. diplomatic and economic pressure has finally resulted in appreciable shifts in Kiev's position. A U.S. State Department spokesman in Washington welcomed Ukraine's latest moves as "a step in the right direction." True, full elimination of all nuclear missile disagreements between Moscow and Kiev is still a long way off. Valeriy Shmarov said that Russian specialists continue to service the nuclear charges located on Ukraine's territory, and described the Russian Government statement that such servicing has been stopped as "populist and uncalled for." Nonetheless, Colonel General Yevgeniy Maslin, chief of the 12th Main Directorate of the Russian Defense Ministry (earlier a highly classified branch of the Soviet Army whose specialists deal with all matters of storage, use, and transportation of nuclear units and are generally responsible for all nuclear charges adopted for service), assured SEGODNYA's correspondent that "there are no Russian military servicemen from the 12th Directorate in Ukraine." However, the 43rd Missile Army deployed in Ukraine includes former specialists of the 12th Main Directorate who have "stayed" in Ukraine together with the army and sworn the Ukrainian military oath, and can not now be considered Russian servicemen. Furthermore, only three defective SS-24 missile warheads have been delivered to Russian territory and transferred to specialists of the Atomic Energy Ministry (former Sredmash). The other decomissioned missile nuclear units are so far in Ukraine. As before, the 43rd Army's combat unit storage facilities remain overloaded in excess of all norms (six to eight times, according to the 12th Main Directorate). The question about the form and size of compensation to Ukraine for nuclear disarmament also remains open.
