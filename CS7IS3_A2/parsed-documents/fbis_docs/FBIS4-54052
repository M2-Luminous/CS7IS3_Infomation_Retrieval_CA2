Nazir made the call in a 30-minute meeting with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa at the Foreign Ministry, the officials said. The Saudi minister, who is visiting Japan through Friday, made a similar request Monday during a meeting with Minister for International Trade and Industry Eijiro Hata. The joint project calls for building or acquiring several refineries in Japan to refine 45,000 barrels of Saudi crude oil per day for sale in the Japanese market. The project has been on hold since last November due to a policy rift among four Japanese partners in the scheme. The partners include Nippon Oil Co., Japan Energy Corp. and Arabian Oil Co. Kakizawa told Nazir he wants to play the role of catalyst in resuming the project, the officials said. He was also quoted as saying Japan wants to strengthen partnership with Saudi Arabia in the political field along with economic cooperation relations, they said. Kakizawa said Japan wants to contribute in humanitarian and economic fields as well as to the promotion of Middle East peace talks.
