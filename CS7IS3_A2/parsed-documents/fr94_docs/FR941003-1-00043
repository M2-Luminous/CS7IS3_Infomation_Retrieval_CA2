(a) > Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section, proof < Proof of any material fact alleged in a motion, opposition, or reply must be filed and served with the motion, opposition, or reply unless the proof relied upon is part of the interference file or the file of any patent or application involved in the interference or any earlier application filed in the United States of which a party has been accorded or seeks to be accorded benefit. * * * * * (c) If a party believes that additional evidence in the form of testimony that is unavailable to the party is necessary to support or oppose a preliminary motion under §1.633 or a motion to correct inventorship under §1.634, the party shall describe the nature of any proposed testimony as specified in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section. If the > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief finds that testimony is needed to decide the motion, the > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief may grant appropriate interlocutory relief and enter an order authorizing the taking of testimony and deferring a decision on the motion to final hearing.

Section 1.640 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b), (b)(1), (b)(2), (c), (d), (d)(1), (d)(3) and (e) to read as follows: §1.640 Motions, hearing and decision, redeclaration of interference, order to show cause. (a) A hearing on a motion may be held in the discretion of the > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief . The > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief shall set the date and time for any hearing. The length of oral argument at a hearing on a motion is a matter within the discretion of the > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief . An > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief may direct that a hearing take place by telephone. (b) > Unless an administrative patent judge or the Board is of the opinion that a decision on a preliminary motion would materially advance the resolution of the interference, decision on a preliminary motion shall be deferred to final hearing. < Motions > otherwise < will be decided by an > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief . An > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief may consult with an examiner in deciding motions involving a question of patentability. An > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief > may take up motions for decision in any order and < may grant or deny any motion or take such other action which will secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of the interference. > A matter raised by a party in support of or in opposition to a motion that is deferred to final hearing will not be entitled to consideration at final hearing unless the matter is raised in the party's brief at final hearing. If the administrative patent judge determines that the interference shall proceed to final hearing on the issue of priority or derivation, a time shall be set for each party to file a paper identifying any decisions on motions or on matters raised sua sponte by the administrative patent judge that the party wishes to have reviewed at final hearing as well as identifying any deferred motions that the party wishes to have considered at final hearing. Any evidence that a party wishes to have considered with respect to the decisions and motions identified by the party or by an opponent for consideration or review at final hearing, including any affidavit filed by the party under §1.608 or 1.639(b), shall be served on the opponent during the testimony-in-chief period of the party. < (1) > When appropriate after the time expires for filing replies to oppositions to preliminary motions < When preliminary motions under §1.633 are decided , the > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief will , when necessary, set a time for filing any amendment to an application involved in the interference and for filing a supplemental preliminary statement as to any new counts > which may become < involved in the interference > if a preliminary motion to amend or substitute a count has been filed < . Failure or refusal of a party to timely present an amendment required by an > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief shall be taken without further action as a disclaimer by that party of the invention involved. A supplemental preliminary statement shall meet the requirements specified in §1.623, §1.624, §1.625, or §1.626, but need not be filed if a party states that it intends to rely on a preliminary statement previously filed under §1.621(a). > At an appropriate time in the interference, and when necessary < After the time expires for filing any amendment and supplemental preliminary statement , > an order will be entered redeclaring the examiner-in-chief will, if necessary, redeclare the interference. (2) After > the time expires for filing preliminary motions < a decision is entered on preliminary motions filed under §1.633 , a further > preliminary < motion under §1.633 will not be considered except as provided by § 1.655(b) > 1.645(b) < . (c) When a decision on any motion under §1.633, §1.634, or §1.635 > or on any matter raised sua sponte by an administrative patent judge < is entered which does not result in the issuance of an order to show cause under paragraph (d) of this section, a party may file a request for reconsideration within 14 days after the date of the decision. > The request for reconsideration shall be served by hand or Express Mail. < The filing of a request for reconsideration will not stay any time period set by the decision. The request for reconsideration shall specify with particularity the points believed to have been misapprehended or overlooked in rendering the decision. > An opponent may file an opposition within 14 days after service of the request for reconsideration. < No opposition to a request for reconsideration shall be filed unless requested by an examiner-in-chief or the Board. A decision of a single examiner-in-chief will not ordinarily be modified unless an opposition has been requested by an examiner-in-chief or the Board. The request for reconsideration shall be acted on by a panel of the Board consisting of at least three examiners-in-chief, one of whom will normally be the examiner-in-chief who decided the motion . (d) An > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief may issue an order to show cause why judgment should not be entered against a party when: (1) A decision on a motion > or on a matter raised sua sponte by an administrative patent judge < is entered which is dispositive of the interference against the party as to any count; * * * * * (3) The party is a junior party whose preliminary statement fails to overcome the earlier of the filing date or effective filing date of another party. (e) When an order to show cause is issued under paragraph (d) of this section, the Board shall enter judgment in accordance with the order unless, within 20 days after the date of the order, the party against whom the order issued files a paper which shows good cause why judgment should not be entered in accordance with the order.
