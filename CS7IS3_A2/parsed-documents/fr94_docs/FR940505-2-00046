Intergovernmental Review This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs and 45 CFR part 100, Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities. Under the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under covered programs. All States and Territories except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau have elected to participate in the Executive Order process and have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Applications from Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are exempt from the requirements of Executive Order 12372. Applicants from these seventeen jurisdictions need take no action regarding Executive Order 12372. All other applicants should contact their SPOC as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective application and to receive any necessary instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the Standard Form 424, item 16a. Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline date to comment on proposed new or competing continuation awards. However, for this program announcement, the SPOC comment period has been reduced to seven (7) days in order to ensure timely awards. These comments are reviewed as part of the award process. Failure to notify the SPOC can result in a delay in grant award. SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations which they intend to trigger the accommodate or explain rule under 45 CFR 100.10. It is helpful in tracking SPOC comments if the SPOC will clearly indicate the applicant organization as it appears on the application SF&hyph;424. When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Financial Management, Division of Discretionary Grants, 6th Floor, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., Washington, DC 20447. A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included at Attachment C of this announcement. Part F_Post-Award and Reporting Requirements Following approval of the applications selected for funding, notice of project approval and authority to draw down project funds will be made in writing. The official award document is the Financial Assistance Award which provides the amount of Federal funds approved for use in the project, the project and budget periods for which support is provided, the terms and conditions of the award, and the total required financial grantee participation. Grantees are subject to the audit requirements in OMB Circulars A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133. Attachment E indicates the regulations which apply to all applicants/grantees under the Demonstration Partnership Program. Grantees will be required to submit a final progress and financial report within 90 days of the termination of the project. Dated: April 22, 1994.
