This was one of the results of the Diakron poll released yesterday by Gianni Pilo, Berlusconi's polling "wizard" at the Forza Italia convention. In addition, 75 percent fear for democracy in the country and 70 percent feel that the leaders of the traditional parties are not capable of dealing with the situation. Thus, just 17 percent of the population has any faith in the old party system and 70 percent want to see new men. Some 80 percent, on the other hand, are confident and believe that the crisis will soon be over. Pilo also quoted from a CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research] poll which gave Silvio Berlusconi 52 percent of the vote and recorded an increase in support for Forza Italia from 7.4 percent in September 1993 to 25.5 percent today.
