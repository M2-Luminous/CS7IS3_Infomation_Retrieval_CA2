Golovizin, general director of the "Partner" Crimean association for economic cooperation and chairman of the Economic Council of the Union of Entrepreneurs of the Crimean Republic, by V. Savchenko; place and date not given: "How Long Will We Continue To Operate Outside the Law?"] [Text] A day hardly goes by now when there is not a report in the newspaper, or over radio and television, on the shutdown of one enterprise or another, on energy supply problems, or on failure to make payments. Things are bad everywhere in industry, in agriculture, and in the business structures engaged in production. They are very bad. How can we overcome this crisis in the economy? Is it not time to stop destroying our production? These and other questions disturb Candidate of Technical Sciences A.S. Golovizin, general director of the "Partner" Crimean association for economic cooperation and chairman of the Economic Council of the Union of Entrepreneurs of the Crimean Republic, who speaks with us today. [Golovizin] When you analyze crisis situations in other countries, you see that the one thing that survives is transnational companies--which have a diversified structure of production and trade, and powerful investments in scientific development. But we, unfortunately, in essence primarily a transnational company, have initiated the destruction of all economic ties with partners in the former USSR. [Savchenko] But this is not the only factor that led to the collapse of the economy. [Golovizin] Yes. The state also failed to concern itself with drawing up state orders. Whereas in the West a powerful struggle ensues to obtain these, up to and including bribing members of the parliament, we have no experience at all in incorporating them. Having declared that it would pursue the option of defense industry conversion, the state should have determined priority programs, presented them on a competitive basis as state orders among enterprises, allocated financing on preferential terms for production development, and afforded tax privileges, and as they say, move on from there. But nothing of the kind took place either in Ukraine or in Russia. We have reached the point today when 70 percent, on the average, of the equipment at enterprises is physically worn out, and a full 90 percent are obsolete; and no efforts are under way to replace it. We see a degradation of our entire production. Following in Russia's footsteps, Ukraine repeated its serious mistake and announced the liberalization of prices under conditions of deeply entrenched monopolism. Everyone is now getting a personal sense of what this alienation of the state from price regulation has brought about. Incidentally, not one recognized economist in the West suggested that we carry out such proposals. [Savchenko] Also characteristic of Ukraine is the fiscal system of taxation. Crimean producers have been screaming about this for the past two years, but, alas, no one is listening. [Golovizin] In a speech that I delivered before the Third Ukrainian Congress of Entrepreneurs, attended by the president and the deputy prime minister, I stated that the Government of Ukraine was the chief racketeer in Ukraine, the state racketeer. Under the present system of taxation, it is at times necessary, for every ruble of trade production output, to hand over 1.6 in the form of taxes. Where else do you see that? And this is happening at a time when our wage standards have dropped significantly, although you constantly hear it said that reforms are being conducted for the benefit of the individual, for the sake of improving his life, done for his benefit, while actual results show that the individual is becoming impoverished, plants are shutting down, production is being curtailed, and incomes are diminishing. [Savchenko] The system of taxation has also hit entrepreneurial structures quite hard. Where have the stock exchanges gone, for example? [Golovizin] In 1991 we saw a boom in their establishment. There were 76 of them in Ukraine, 15 in Crimea. But on 10 February 1992, the parliament of Ukraine adopted the Law on Taxation, which prescribes that income obtained from stock exchange activity is subject to tax at a rate of 75 percent. So you complete a transaction for R1,000 [rubles], but all you have left is 15--the state collects the rest. Therefore, all the stock exchanges virtually died. We continue to say that they are lying on the bottom, like a ship that has suffered colossal damage. Knowing, however, that not a single state with any economy can survive without a stock exchange, we have now decided to join the Crimean Universal Stock Exchange with the Agricultural Stock Exchange and begin operations. This is how we are thinking about getting around the system of taxation. Can it possibly be a victory for the state when it forces the stock exchanges and other entrepreneurs to withdraw into a shadow economy? After all, we know that something on the order of 12 trillion karbovantsy are in cash circulation right now. This money does not go through the banks or help augment the budget. It is corrupting businessmen and contributing toward the emergence of racketeering. [Savchenko] Instead of civilized trade on the stock exchange, we now have a middleman. [Golovizin] It is easy to find someone for a soft job. Thanks to the middlemen who purchase commodities two, three, and four times from one another, the commodity goes up 1.5- or 2-fold in price. I am convinced that if we return the stock exchange and wholesale purchase bases to a civilized course and afford them low-interest credit, the standard of living of the populace will rise tomorrow. There will be a sharp drop in prices. And the middlemen will go back to civilized work. Today many people say they do not want to work on the edge of violating the law, but otherwise they have to eat bread crumbs. [Savchenko] How do you feel about the introduction in Crimea of the system of an open economy? [Golovizin] With its available potential, Crimea has to be an international business center. It is situated at a crossroads--of trade, political, cultural, and spiritual paths. This is a unique position. In the West they determine the optimal zone of economic relations using a compass. They draw a circle with radius of 600 km. Some 22 independent, highly developed states find themselves neighbors with Crimea in such a circle. Where else in the world could you find such a unique position? [Savchenko] What is the best possible thing for our structures of authority and entrepreneurial structures to do? [Golovizin] They must enter into direct ties with other states, including Russia, create joint enterprises, and act more boldly. Here in Crimea we have all the conditions for establishment of a business center, including suitable buildings that could house the headquarters for economic reform of Crimea. Here we must attract the entire scientific potential of the republic. [Savchenko] All possible kinds of funds and joint-stock companies have recently been sprouting up everywhere. Readers are constantly asking: "Can they be trusted?" How do you answer them? [Golovizin] There is not a single fund, not a single joint- stock company advertising itself in the newspapers or on television that carries out its main practical functions. Stockholders do not know what kind of charter fund they have, how accumulation of funds takes place, in what specific undertaking funds are invested, or what safeguards are in place. On the other hand, "the guys" are very good at manipulating money while having nothing to do with the production that results in accumulation of the country's basic wealth. [Savchenko] We will soon elect a new parliament. What should be the starting point of its work? [Golovizin] It should start by adopting three laws: one on the credit and finance system, one on the budget of Crimea, and another on taxation. This is the basis of development of the economy. When this is done, we will be able to stand on our feet and move forward rapidly.
