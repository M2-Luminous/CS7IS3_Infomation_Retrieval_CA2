The naval representative was reacting to a declaration issued by the Ukrainian Defence Ministry that the Russians had "plans to seize at least 20 Tu-22 military aircraft during the Black Sea Fleet's upcoming military maneuvers". The press-centre representative told ITAR-TASS that the Ukrainian assertion that "pilots of the Black Sea Fleet based in the Crimea received orders to land the rocket-carrying aircraft at the military base of Krymsk in southern Russia" cannot stand up to criticism if only for techical reasons. All pilots, including Ukrainian ones, know that the airfield in question cannot handle such planes, the representative said. The naval press centre is sure that, upon carefully reading through the Ukrainian Defence Ministry's statement, one can conclude that Kiev is hastily making public unchecked information to confuse the public. This, unfortunately, is not the first time such things have been done, the representative noted.
