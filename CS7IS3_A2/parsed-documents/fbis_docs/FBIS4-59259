South Yemen said Arab elements are fighting alongside north Yemenis, adding that these elements will appear on Aden television screens, the paper said. This version has several serious implications. According to this version, troops from an Arab country may be fighting beside the forces of the north along with Arab elements living in Yemen. The report may, in the meantime, be a call for internationalizing the crisis, the paper added. In any case there should be a warning against any interference in the Yemeni war in the way reported by the southerners, the paper said.
