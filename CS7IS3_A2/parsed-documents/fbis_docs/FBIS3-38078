Will it prove possible to extend the cease-fire around the Bosnian capital to other flashpoints in the country? This question formed the subject matter of a conversation between our observer Vladimir Pasko and Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Ivanovich Churkin, the Russian president's special envoy, who was in Sarajevo at the height of the crisis and subsequently held consultations with representatives of the United States, the European Union, and United Nations Organizations in Bonn. So last Thursday he returned to Moscow and, immediately after reporting to the Russian leadership on the work he had accomplished, he received a Mayak representative. [Pasko] Vitaliy Ivanovich, it was not the first time that you had been to Yugoslavia, Belgrade, and Sarajevo. What is going on there? How do you see things, not as a man burdened by tasks of some kind, but as a simple observer? [Churkin] If one is to talk about change, then, visually, the most noticeable changes have probably occurred in Sarajevo. My last two visits to the city over the past seven days contrasted sharply, of course, in atmosphere with what things were like earlier. I was first in Sarajevo in May 1993, later I was there on two other occasions, and now the fourth and fifth trips have taken place during the last seven days. Well, the city is calmer now. Snipers are still firing, but, even so, in the streets, in the main street, children were running around, since it was covered with snow. They tried to slide about on something remotely like skis, clung on to a car and slid over the snow. There were more people in the streets. In other words, the situation is moving away from being a war one. During the last trip, I had to spend a night in Sarajevo for the first time -- that famous night of the 20-21 . Although we slept in quite a comfortable flat that night, there was no electricity -- electricity is a rarity. The water comes on for an hour or two during the day, and one can fill up in the bathroom. Needless to say, there is no... [Pasko, interrupting] And the water is ice cold? [Churkin] Needless to say, there is no hot water. It is more than cool in the apartment. [Pasko] What about food? [Churkin] Well you see, the city's population is supplied through the United Nations, the Red Cross, and other humanitarian organizations. The rations are extremely meager. During one of my trips, I was taken to a bakery. It is the only bakery in Sarajevo. Incidentally, it is of interest, and it is important, that the bakery operates on Russian gas. When people throughout the world talk about humanitarian aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina and to Sarajevo, it is somehow not mentioned that, throughout these months, albeit with interruptions, Russian gas has been getting through to Sarajevo, and, if it had not been for Russian gas, the city might simply have perished, since that is the only source of any kind of heating. It is the only source of power for the only bakery in the city. But, in general, one can see that people do not have enough to eat, and that life is very hard. It is easier for the UN people. There are special food supplies for the United Nations. Meals at UN headquarters are pretty good -- you get a first, second, and third course. UN back-up is quite good. It is simply impossible to feed the city on the same level, of course, since airborne supply is the only source of provisions, and disruptions are not uncommon. So, the fact that it has proved possible, nevertheless, to carry out the operation to place heavy weapons -- both Serbian and Moslem -- under control or to withdraw them is not just a qualitative military-political turnabout; it is also an extremely important humanitarian action. We now hope that it will be possible to advance further toward normalizing the situation in the city. At the moment, in many districts there, one can only drive along in an armored personnel carrier or in an armored jeep. It is still dangerous. There are checkpoints everywhere between the Croatian and Moslem districts of the city. In other words, there is still a very long way to go to normality. We will have to do some special work on that now. [Pasko] Vitaliy Ivanovich, as far as I recall, Sarajevo is mainly a Muslim city. Of the 360,000 population only 40,000 are Serbs. [Churkin] Yes. The Serbs that there are rather more. If I am not mistaken they say 60,000. There are also Croats there, 10-20,000 of them, but indeed, there are mainly Muslims and Serbs. The problem is that in some places in the city - although they all lived together just as they did throughout the country -- there are quite clearly defined Serbian areas of the city. Grbavica area, for example, where our battalion is now stationed along with the French, is a Serb area of the city. And the demarcation line passes between Muslim and Serb areas. And the reason why this cross-fire and the exchange of artillery strikes took place recently is that as soon one of the sides made an attempt to change the front line in the city -- quite often this was the Muslims who have a superiority in infantry -- then the Serbs responded with powerful fire from all of their weapons against the city. The result is that the city has been destroyed to a very large extent. The Serbs have now withdrawn their weapons or put them under UN control. The Muslims have also handed over about 50 heavy weapons. They simply had less of these in the city, but they have also put them under UN control. Now neither of the sides has the capability of firing. [Pasko] What surprises me here is the statements made by some of the Bosnian leaders who represent the Muslim community and, in particular, the Bosnian representative in the United Nations, attacking our initiatives and the fact that our Russian battalion has appeared there. That is, clear dissatisfaction is being expressed when it would seem that the reaction should be quite different. [Churkin] As for the specific person that you have referred to, I can say that he is a totally irresponsible man who is distinguished by the fact that throughout the crisis he has made the most disgraceful statements, taking advantage of the fact that he speaks English well. There are also people who are not so keen on naked propaganda but who have also recently made similar statements. I have had contacts with the people who make these statements. I know them quite well. There are considerable differences between their positions and ours. We are aiming toward peace while they are aiming toward war. It is as simple as that. I do not consider that this is the position of the whole Muslim leadership or -- as it is now usually referred to in international contacts -- the Bosnian Government. For example, Izetbegovic, the number one and Silajdzic, the number two, in the Muslim leadership, occupy a more pragmatic position and I still proceed on the basis that they understand that it is necessary to reach a political accord. You only have to talk to those other people and it becomes totally clear -- and they do not even conceal this -- that they want to fight the whole war over again. [Pasko] If there are disagreements among the Bosnian leaders, how can it be hoped that they will agree to a peaceful settlement and how can it be hoped that an external diplomatic interference being discussed at the moment will be successful? [Churkin] Well, you have touched upon a most painful issue. This is one of our biggest difficulties. Admittedly, there is no unity among their leaders and this is clear to everybody. Therefore, conditions should be created whereby the people supporting extremist approaches would be isolated, so that they should understand that nobody is going to add fuel to the war and that the time has come to conclude a peace agreement. I think that such moment is likely to come. The settlement documents themselves need some further improvement, but on the whole, the time will come when the positions of people with more pragmatic views in the Muslim government will become stronger, but this is one of the most difficult tasks -- how to isolate extremists among the Muslims. [Pasko] To what extent can we count on U.S. assistance in this matter? After all, a strange statement was issued after the recent talks in Washington between U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher with Haris Silajdzic. [Churkin] Well, these statements seem clear enough to me. You know, I think that statements should be taken at their face value. On the whole, Americans tend to say reasonable and correct things. There is nothing wrong if the Americans have decided to work in closer contact with the Muslims and, to some extent, with Croatians, and to come up with some new sensible proposals regarding the settlement. The stress should be laid on the word sensible -- I said this to the Americans and then repeated it at the multilateral meeting in Bonn, and everyone seemed to agree. The important point is that the Americans are now saying that, like the Europeans and like us, they proceed from the assumption that borders should be drawn on the basis of a key criterion -- that a republic with the Muslim majority is to get 33.3 percent of the territory. Now this criterion has been consolidated in the U.S. approach. If the Americans, as they help the Muslims with this business -- this is a very complicated job, you have to read the map and calculate on the computer all the time the percentage [of parts of territory due to each side], and to take into account a number of various parameters -- if they really arrive at some sensible proposals that can be accepted by the other sides, then I can see absolutely no harm in this. After all, we can help the Serbs to take a realistic stance -- why cannot the Americans help the Muslims do the same? If they succeed, they will deserve fame and glory. All the more so that we have an understanding, the Americans have assured us that they intend to work in the closest possible contact with us, and I am in fact quite pleased with the personal and professional relations I have developed with U.S. Special Envoy Charles Redman. So, my attitude to all this is calm. But it is important that all these agreements and intentions expressed both publicly and privately should be implemented in the same form in which they were declared. [Pasko] Vitaliy Ivanovich, now the last question. We -- I mean President Yeltsin -- have suggested holding a summit on the Bosnian settlement. Knowing all that you know, how did your partners in the former Yugoslavia settlement talks react to this proposal, in your opinion? [Churkin] Well, for instance, I have just seen the British statement that welcomes this proposal. When I say partners, I mean a broader circle of partners involved in the settlement of this conflict. So here is the first unequivocally positive response, but there is something I would like to add. Of course, as far as I know, the proposal does not imply that the meeting could take place tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, or next Sunday. It is desirable to have it within some deadline, so that we do not lose the impetus gained through resolving the political crisis around Sarajevo, but intensive work will of course be necessary to achieve this. I must say that right now we are involved in extremely intensive work on political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Second, we do not think that this is the only possible format of such meeting. There can be some other forms of a summit. So, although this was stated formally and authoritatively by the president, we are open to suggestions. I would like to finish this with a little joke: We are against any kinds of ultimatums.
