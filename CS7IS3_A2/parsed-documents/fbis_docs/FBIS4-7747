The talks were attended by the ambassador of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] to Bucharest. A press release that was faxed to us a short while ago says that during their talks President Slobodan Milosevic -- after outlining the high level reached in bilateral relations before the introduction of economic sanctions against the FRY -- expressed his conviction that those sanctions will soon be lifted because, considering the recent evolution of the political situation in that area, they are no longer justified. Anticipating that moment, impatiently looked forward to not only by Serbia but also by its neighbors, who are severely affected by the embargo imposed by the international community, it is necessary that ways of cultural, scientific, and educational cooperation should be examined now, whereas after the partial or total lifting of the sanctions cooperation between Serbia and Romania should also be extended to industry, investments, finance, and commerce, so that within a short time the level of bilateral exchanges should equal or surpass the previous levels, the guest stressed. In turn, Vacaroiu pointed out that Romania has strictly observed the international embargo imposed on the FRY but it also consequently acted by intervening at international fora for the reduction of the level of those sanctions, especially considering recent political evolutions that give reason to hope for the peaceful settlement of the conflicts that broke out out with the dismembering of the former Yugoslav Federation. The consequences of the embargo were drastic for Romania as well, especially because they came in addition to the difficulties emerged in the process of economic reform and industrial restructuring currently under way in our country. A number of enterprises, the Romanian prime minister emphasized, which used to work in cooperation with Serbian firms had to suspend their activity, which accentuated the decline of our industrial production and amplified unemployment. During their meeting, the parties agreed to examine, at the level of a joint commission, possibilities of resuming, as soon as possible, bilateral economic and commercial relations, once the level of the international sanctions imposed on the FRY is diminished or the sanctions are totally lifted.
