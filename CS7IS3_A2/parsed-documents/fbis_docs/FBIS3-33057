It is also interesting how that "directive" found its way out of Guzman's cell in the Callao Navy base -- where he is supposed to be isolated -- and how it got to Stockholm. As for the contents of that directive, several issues must be studied. First, "President Gonzalo" at no time says he will give up his objectives or ideology; he simply expresses in other terms what in other letters he described as a "retreat." Second, he establishes a date on which the "peace agreement" will end and when hostilities will resume: "The 21st Century as a decade," he states. Guzman thus believes that at the beginning of the next century his organization will have completely recovered its capability to attack and destroy the Peruvian State, or that he will by then be freed through an amnesty of some administration. Guzman states in his letter to his comrades in Sweden that the main problem of the "people's war" which "cannot develop" is found at the level of the "proletariat leadership" which "cannot be solved on time." This means that as long as he and his close aides are imprisoned, everything must be paralyzed. (It must be pointed out that he has not even considered replacing his leadership with other members.) To summarize: This is not an authentic surrender. It is just a tactical capitulation to recover from some wounds and to regain forces which, Guzman estimates, will take a minimum of six years until the beginning of the first decade of the next century. Nothing justifies having allowed Guzman to violate his isolation and send the letter to Sweden -- which obviously happened with the consent of the authorities, unless otherwise proven. We hope that the government is not giving a better treatment to the man responsible for the most atrocious years of Peruvian history in exchange of epistolary offerings. A Justice Ministry report explaining the conditions of the imprisonment of Abimael Guzman would not go amiss.
