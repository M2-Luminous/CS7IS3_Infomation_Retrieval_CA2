ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed regulations relating to the method of reporting for trusts which are treated as owned by grantors or other persons under the provisions of subpart E (section 671 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.

The proposed regulations would affect grantors and trustees of trusts that are treated as owned by grantors or other persons, as well as persons who are required to file information returns with respect to payments to these trusts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on the collection of information should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224. The collection of information is required by §§1.671&hyph;4 and 1.6012&hyph;3 of the proposed Income Tax Regulations and §301.6109&hyph;1 of the proposed Regulations on Procedure and Administration. This information is required by the IRS to insure the proper reporting of income and proceeds paid to a trust any portion of which is treated as owned by the grantor or another person. The likely respondents are individuals, trusts, businesses and other for-profit institutions, and small businesses. Estimated total annual reporting burden: 920,000 hours. The estimated annual burden per respondent: 30 minutes. Estimated number of respondents: 1,840,000. Estimated annual frequency of responses: once. Background This document proposes amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under sections 671 and 6012 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), and to the Regulations on Procedure and Administration (26 CFR part 301) under section 6109 of the Code. The proposed amendments are to be issued under the authority of section 7805 of the Code. Explanation of Provisions Reporting Requirements Under the Current Regulations In general, every fiduciary (which includes a trustee of a trust) must make a return of income on Form 1041. Under the current regulations, items of income, loss, deduction, and credit attributable to any portion of a trust which is treated as owned by the grantor or another person generally must be shown by the trustee on a separate statement attached to a Form 1041, rather than on the form itself. There are two exceptions to this rule. The first exception applies when the same individual is both grantor and trustee (or co-trustee) of the trust, and that individual is treated for the taxable year as the owner of the entire trust under section 676 of the Code. The second exception applies when a husband and wife are the grantors of certain revocable trusts. Section 301.6109&hyph;1(a)(2) of the current Regulations on Procedure and Administration provides that a grantor trust reporting under one of these two exceptions shall not obtain an employer identification number until such time as the reporting exceptions no longer apply to the trust. Instead, the grantor of such a trust must furnish his or her social security number (or, when applicable, his or her employer identification number) to payors of income, and payors must report income as if paid to the grantor, not the trust. Reporting Requirements Under the Proposed Regulations The proposed regulations will reduce the reporting burden on certain trustees by expanding the current exceptions to the requirement of filing a Form 1041 to other trusts all of which are treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons. Thus, considerably more trustees will not be required to file a Form 1041. The proposed regulations retain the general rule of the current regulations that items of income, deduction, and credit attributable to any portion of a trust which is treated as owned by the grantor or another person must be reported by the trustee on a separate statement attached to a Form 1041. The proposed regulations, however, provide alternative methods of reporting for a trust all of which is treated as owned by one or more grantors or other persons, including a trust treated as owned by a person other than an individual and a trust with a third-party trustee. Under these alternative methods, the trustee does not file a Form 1041 with an attached statement. If the trust is treated as owned by one grantor or other person, the trustee may choose between two alternative methods of reporting. The trustee must furnish to all payors of income and proceeds during the taxable year either: (i) the name and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the grantor or other person, and the address of the trust; or (ii) the name, TIN, and address of the trust. If the trust is treated as owned by more than one grantor or other person, the trustee must furnish the name, TIN, and address of the trust to all payors of income and proceeds during the taxable year.
