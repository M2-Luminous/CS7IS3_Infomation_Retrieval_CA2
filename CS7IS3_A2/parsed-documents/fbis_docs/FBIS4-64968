FBIS4-64968 "drweu091aa_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-091 Daily Report 11 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS IAEA Says Inspectors Ready To Visit DPRK IAEA Says Inspectors Ready To Visit DPRK AU1105081594 Paris AFP in English 0751 GMT 11 May 94 AU1105081594 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Vienna, May 11 (AFP) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has asked North Korean experts to visit Vienna for talks on replacing fuel rods in a nuclear reactor, the Agency announced Wednesday [11 May]. In addition, Agency inspectors would visit North Korea "in the next few days" if the replacement of the rods in the Yonbyon reactor was postponed, the IAEA said in a statement. U.S. officials say the change of fuel rods could provide enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear weapons. The IAEA has been insisting on not only witnessing the fuel change but also on sampling the used fuel to determine whether the Stalinist country has diverted fissile material for weapons. IAEA Director General Hans Blix proposed to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Young-Nam in a telex message that North Korea send a team of experts to Vienna to discuss these measures and the timetable for replacement of the rods, the statement said. "In the meantime, on the assumption that the core discharge is deferred, the IAEA proposes to send an inspection team in the next few days." "This team is to carry out the activities which the IAEA was not able to implement during the inspection in March at the reprocessing plant." Blix reaffirmed in the telex that it was very important to take samples from the fuel rods of a five-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of Pyongyang, to measure their radioactivity levels. But the IAEA chief suggested that the actual testing of the fuel rods could be carried out "in the second half of this year," a spokesman for South Korea's foreign ministry said in Seoul. The Blix message was an answer to the North Korean foreign minister's proposal on Friday that Pyongyang could negotiate with the IAEA over nuclear inspections and the presence of monitors to witness the fuel replacement. The Blix message was made public in Seoul following unconfirmed South Korean press reports that Washington had agreed to resume high-level talks with North Korea in return for the sampling of the fuel rods at a later date. The IAEA also said its team could finish inspecting a radiochemical laboratory, from which IAEA inspectors were barred by North Koreans last March, and check surveillance equipments at various nuclear facilities. In Vienna, IAEA spokesman David Kyd said the inspectors could leave for North Korea any time from Saturday if the response from Pyongyang was positive.
