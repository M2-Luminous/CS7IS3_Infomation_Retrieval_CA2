"This problem should be studied, since many do not know its essence," he added. He said that the editing commission would prepare a draft decision for this Tuesday's meeting, which will contain some amendments to the decree. Aushev claimed that amendments should provide, above all, for introducing a direct presidential rule in the conflict area, withdrawing all armed groups, suspending the activities of executive power and subordinating the head of the area administration directly to the Russian president. The Ingush president expressed hope that a special commission of the Federation Council on the examination of the situation in the conflict zone, which will be formed on the basis of the Committee for the Affairs of the Russian Federation, the federal treaty and regional policy as well as of the Defence and Security Committee, "will appraise the situation on the spot and prepare legislators for the next presidential decree which may appear within two months, that is by the time the term of the present decree expires". North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov told journalists after the end of the session that he regarded today's discussion of the presidential decree by the Federation Council as unconstructive. He was deadly opposed to the introduction of a direct presidential rule. However, Galazov agreed that the state of emergency should be prolonged. He noted that the presidential decree was poorly drafted, and some of its points were "quite illiterate juridically". According to the president, remarks by North Ossetian representatives were not taken into account when the document was drafted. Adighe Republic President Aslan Dzharimov told ITAR-TASS today that he deems it necessary "to stiffen the execution of adopted decisions", and the start should be made with this presidential decree. Dzharimov, a member of the North-Caucasian Coordination Council which started negotiations on the conflict back in January 1993, does not preclude the need for introducing a direct presidential rule. "Decisions hitherto taken by the Russian president and representative power were of small effect, but the conflict should be extinguished at long last," the Adighe president concluded.
