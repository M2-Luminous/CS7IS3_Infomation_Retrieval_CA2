Hosokawa has a troubled look again. One difficulty arises after the other, but the Diet and the Prime Minister's Residence are not the only places where those in power have trouble. The same is also true of Kasumigaseki, where elite bureaucrats reign supreme. The uproar over the national health tax, which vanished with the dew. Such persons as Administrative Vice Minister Jiro Saito of the Ministry of Finance, who ended up being made the "heavy," seem like symbols of Kasumigaseki in a difficult time. Vice Minister Saito's nickname within the Ministry of Finance is "Densuke." It is said to come from the fact that he says "den" when he wins at mahjong, but in the tax system reform this time, he was unable to make that sound. Ever since Prime Minister Hosokawa set forth the idea of a national welfare tax at a predawn press conference on 3 February, and it collapsed completely in the twinkling of an eye, Vice Minister Saito has been hounded at Ministry-of-Finance press conferences. At a press conference when there was much discord at meetings of representatives of the governing parties, it went like this: [Question] The rate of support for the cabinet has dropped 20 percent, would you care to comment on that? [Saito] I would like to reserve comment on that because it is not something said by the authorities concerned." [Question] Is it not true that the biggest problem with Hosokawa's idea is the fact that there was little discussion? Ought not you, as the authority in charge of government finance, give an explanation? [Saito] I shall accept that as advice for future. [Question] Are you saying that you will not change the way you have been doing things up till now? [Saito] We are now in the middle of a meeting of representatives (of the governing parties), so the position of the authorities concerned is to reserve comment. Jiro Saito is 58 years old. Since joining the Ministry of Finance in 1959, in the Budget Bureau, which is in charge of compiling the budget, he smoothly ascended the ladder from assistant division chief to division chief, budget examiner, vice bureau chief, and bureau chief; and in June 1993, he assumed the post of vice minister, the ultimate post for a bureaucrat. Cool Calculation Lurks Behind an Uncompromising Attitude "He is said to be the kind of great vice minister who comes along once in a decade. However, at press conferences and the like, his favorite statement is `That is why I said that earlier,' and his blunt responses are conspicuous. One almost suspects that he is making fools of people, thinking that such people as politicians and the media do not understand anyhow" (economic reporter). Even at the press conference upon his assumption to the position of vice minister, when asked what he aspired to do, he said: "At present, it is as the former vice minister said, I have nothing to add." Such being the case, he is bound to appear haughty and arrogant. Although he has awesome ability, or because of his awesome ability, in any case, he is unpopular. Speaking in terms of political circles, he is exactly like Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, who along with him was considered a "war criminal" because of the welfare-tax idea this time. He does not like dinner parties nor does he play golf. According to people, his attitude toward his subordinates is that "He is a person whose likes and dislikes are very clear; they are divided into those he treats with great fondness and those with whom he will have nothing to do." "He is said to dislike dinner parties. But if he attends a dinner party after allowing people to say that, he can give people a strong sense of gratitude, thinking that Saito, who dislikes dinner parties, has been kind enough to come. People think that they heard that he is a disagreeable person, but he talks to them pleasantly with a smile, or some such. I also have a feeling that Saito is considering such things. "Even Ichiro Ozawa has something about him that makes one end up yielding to him if one is spoken to kindly by him, does he not" (another reporter)? He suggests that there may be surprisingly cool calculation behind the uncompromising attitude. A Lone Struggle Over the "Gulf Tax Increase" These two, who are exactly alike, are considered to be the ones who designed the welfare tax idea this time. The idea for reform of the tax system set forth by Prime Minister Hosokawa was put off, and the shortfall in revenue because of the tax reduction will be covered by the first deficit-covering bonds in five years. It turned out to be the result that Vice Minister Saito most detests. One of Vice Minister Saito's subordinates when he was in the Budget Bureau says: "His assessment within the ministry was that of a steady person. In any case, he was absolutely opposed to deficit-covering bonds. Even after breaking away in 1990 from the incontinent issuing of deficit-covering bonds, he has made that a symbol of legitimacy. In the Budget Bureau, there is a temperment that likes that kind of steadiness." At a time when the balance of deficit-covering bonds exceeds 200 trillion yen, it is natural for Finance Ministry bureaucrats to dislike such bonds; however, Saito's dislike is said to be utter and complete. A person related to the Ministry of Finance disclosed a certain "war experience." "At the time of the Gulf war, you must remember that beginning in 1991 we made such gulf tax increases as a special corporation tax in order to fund Japan's contribution. At that time, the trend of opinion in the Ministry of Finance was deficit-covering bonds, not a tax increase. The one who worked hard, alone, for the tax-increase line was Saito." When a meeting in the Ministry of Finance had begun to agree on deficit-covering bonds, Saito, who was deputy vice minister, stood up and addressed the meeting. The content of his speech is reported within the ministry to have been as follows: "Deficit-covering bonds, what are you talking about? Even the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is saying that a tax increase cannot be avoided. What a shame that the Ministry of Finance, which is in the position of protecting government finances, talks about deficit-covering bonds." It is said that all those Finance Ministry executives present at the meeting were argued into silence by Secretariat Director Saito, who spoke eloquently, so the gulf-tax-increase became a reality. "It was the deputy vice minister. It was not a vice minister nor was it chief of the Tax Bureau, the person in direct charge of the matter, nor was it chief of the Budget Bureau. The chief of the Tax Bureau at that time was former Vice Minister Mamoru Ozaki, and he, too, said that deficit-covering bonds were unavoidable. It is said that ill will developed between Saito and Ozaki after that. It seems that when Ozaki got drunk, he would say things like `That SOB Saito'" (the same Finance Ministry-related person). The disposition in the Tax Bureau, which handles taxes, and in the Budget Bureau, which compiles the budget, is said to be somewhat different. LDP Diet Member Hakuo Yanagisawa is a former Finance Ministry bureaucrat. He is two years junior to Vice Minister Saito, but while admitting that Vice Minister Saito is "an able person," Yanagisawa, who has experience in the Tax Bureau, makes some harsh observations in relation to taxes: "I think that the matter this time also is an uproar caused by someone who does not know about taxes meddling in them. He has worked only in the budget field, so he has no `sense of a reasonable level' concerning taxes. He has no fear of taxes. I cannot help but say that his career lacks balance." Therefore, now Diet Member Yanagisawa also says of the atmosphere in the Tax Bureau: "There appears to be no sense of a setback because they followed Saito grudgingly while being dissatisfied with his way of doing things. I suspect they are thinking: See, we told you so." This Vice Minister Saito also has a slight "historical" connection with Prime Minister Hosokawa. What Ought To Have Been the Strongest Team Came Out the Loser It was a half century ago that Prime Minister Hosokawa's grandfather, Fumimaro Konoe, served as prime minister, and a persen who was commissioned to do work for the Konoe cabinet as an advisor was the (Hozumi) Ozaki of the Sorge spy affair. In 1939 Ozaki was commissioned to do work for the Manchurian Railway Inspection Department and went to China. One of his subordinates was Saito's father. Saito became a bureaucrat on his father's advice. Then he happened to cross paths with Prime Minister Hosokawa in this time of upheaval. According to a certain person who keeps tabs on Kasumigaseki, "Because of the birth of the coalition government, the Ministry of Finance is trying to seize the initiative. The situation is such that there is almost the term `Finance Ministry government.' The Ministry of Finance has shaken up the Hosokawa government by holding the budget and stimulus measures hostage. In the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], which has lost the support of zoku Diet members, Vice Minister (Hideaki) Kumano has been completely won over to Saito's way of doing things, so it is called "the second Ministry of Finance." The underlying cause of that MITI bureau chief resignation uproar is also found there." At such a time, Ozawa, who heretofore had no contacts in the Finance Ministry, and Vice Minister Saito form a team. The two are said to have found themselves kindred spirits when Ozawa talked up the concept of an international contribution tax two years ago. The LDP Research Commission on the Tax System was angered, saying, "it ignores the discussions of the Research Commission on the Tax System." It was defeated, but the previously mentioned person related to the Ministry of Finance says: "At that time, the only one who supported Ozawa's idea was Saito, who was chief of the Budget Bureau. Their relationship has existed since then. When an uproar occurred over whether Ozawa would or would not form a new party, he suddenly made himself vanish from before the media. There is talk that Ozawa met with Saito for two hours during that time." This means that the Ozawa-Saito team has now failed for the second time, but this related person goes on to say: "In spite of Ozawa's objective being good, he is weak on the process. Since the Ministry of Finance is the government office which is most skillful at process, if Ozawa and the Ministry of Finance team up, there will be nothing as strong. Unfortunately, Saito is an official whose process is high-handed. Because of that, they came out on the losing side--both times." A bureaucrat, who is supposed to be an inconspicuous stagehand, was taken up by a photo magazine and was even photographed by television while walking a dog. When inconspicuous stagehands stand out, it is not a very good time.
