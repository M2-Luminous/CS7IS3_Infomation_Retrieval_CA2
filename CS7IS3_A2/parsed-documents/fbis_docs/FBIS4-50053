An agreement to import mobile telecommunications equipment with a total capacity of more than 70,000 terminals from the Ericsson Radio System AB of Sweden was signed here Tuesday. Officials from the Hebei Provincial Posts and Telecommunications Bureau said that upon completion of the installation by the end of this year, mobile telephone calls from any of all 103 counties and cities in the province will automatically reach receivers in neighboring Tianjin and Beijing cities. The province built its first mobile telecommunications system in 1987. However, by the end of April this year, the total number of mobile phone users topped 17,000. The agreement, which is the third import transaction with the Swedish company, involves some 28.59 million U.S. dollars. Wei Enhong, director of the provincial telecommunications bureau, said that the province is set to install more mobile phones in the coming few years to meet increasing demands. By 1998, the expected number of mobile phone users will top 300,000, some 17.5 times the existing number.
