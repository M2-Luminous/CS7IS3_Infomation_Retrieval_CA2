The law would primarily be a signal to the Danish people that they should use condoms. Rules Must Change This was stated by Justice Minister Erling Olsen (Social Democrat) to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE after the Supreme Court acquitted an HIV-infected 36-year-old Haitian man on Thursday [14 April]. The man had been accused of having unsafe sex with 23 women. As early as Tuesday the legal affairs spokesmen of the coalition parties met in an effort to close the loophole in the law that led to acquittal of both the Haitian and an Arhus woman on Thursday. "If you do not protect your partner, you will be convicted. We will no longer accept situations such as these," Olsen said. It is now up to Justice Ministry officials to work out a foundation that the politicians can discuss on Tuesday. According to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's information, it is now being decided whether the new law "On the Spread of the HIV Infection" will be integrated into the penal code or whether an entirely new and independent law should be passed. At the same time, various aggravating circumstances are being considered, such as whether anal sex and other sexual acts should increase the punishment. But the big question is whether a violation of the law should result in fines or imprisonment. One possibility is to consult the penalties for assault when determining the punishment. Dr. Michael von Magnus of the Board of Health fears that a new law would inhibit "infection-detecting activities" since, "even though it is illogical, people will become more afraid." "Strictly from the standpoint of health care, there is no indication that laws help prevent sexually transmitted diseases. But I understand full well that there are other considerations in play, namely people's sense of justice," Dr. von Magnus said.
