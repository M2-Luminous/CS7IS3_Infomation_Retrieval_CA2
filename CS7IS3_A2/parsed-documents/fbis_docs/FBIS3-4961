The United States has criticized Japan's automotive standards and certification system as an import barrier, and called for an immediate removal of the barrier. The officials said there are two methods of certification for foreign cars -- one method being a one-by-one certification of imported autos and the other a blanket certification of imported autos of the same type. If a foreign automaker is to ensure blanket certification, it will have to file with the ministry for designation of autos of the same type, the officials said. If a foreign automaker wins type designation for a certain type of auto, the cost of bringing such autos into Japan is lower and the formalities involved are much simpler, they said. Thus, most of the autos imported from Europe are covered by the type designation system, while most of the U.S. automakers have not utilized the system. The ministry is sending Hideaki Mukaiyama, vice minister for international affairs, to Detroit next Tuesday to encourage U.S. automakers to utilize the system. The ministry is due to station a consul at the Japanese Consulate General in Detroit from April to help U.S. automakers win type designation for their autos.
