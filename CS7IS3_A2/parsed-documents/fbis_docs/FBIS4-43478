"French President Mitterrand is seeking a consensus; if there is not a consensus for Mr. Dehaene, then it could be someone else," Mr. Lubbers affirmed. "My candidacy does not pose any problems for President Mitterrand," he added following an hour-long meeting with President Mitterrand at the Elysee. The head of the Netherlands Government nevertheless described his meeting with President Mitterrand as "good." Last week Mr. Lubbers met with French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. "This time, we discussed matters in more detail," Mr. Lubbers added. Greek European Affairs Minister Pangalos and Mr. Papandreou, Greek state secretary for foreign affairs, are to visit The Hague on Tuesday evening. They are due to meet with Mr. Lubbers and Netherlands Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans. The issue of Mr. Jacques Delors' successor as EC president is to be discussed at these meetings. The visit is a routine visit which the Greek presidency of the European Union (EU) is making to all EU member states to prepare for the Corfu Summit next 24 and 25 June.
