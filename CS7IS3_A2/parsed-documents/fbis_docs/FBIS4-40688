To view (constitute) the present gathering of delegates from the Georgian Workers Communist Party [GWCP], the "Stalin" political organization, the Union of Georgian Communists [UGC], and the "Remembrance of Stalin" international organization as a congress and the 425 delegates as congress delegates. 2. The present congress establishes the Unified Communist Party of Georgia [UCPG] that includes the Georgian Workers Communist Party, the "Stalin" political organization, the Union of Georgian Communists, and members of the "Remembrance of Stalin" international organization. The rules of the Georgian Communist Party that were published in KOMUNISTI No. 1 of 19 March 1994 are to viewed as the rules of the UPCG until this party holds its congress. 3. A political council is to be formed to prepare and hold the regular congress and direct the activities of the UCPG. It is to be composed of the following 23 people: P. Georgadze, D. Lomashvili, D. Kevlishvili, I. Khazaradze, G. Leiashvili, D. Gaganidze, D. Glunchadze, R. Chkhaidze, T. Pipiya, Z. Lelashvili, V. Makharadze, S. Rigvava, K. Gardapkhadze, M. Chachukashvili, D. Kiknadze, K. Kuliyev, F. Makharadze, V. Dolidze, G. Oniani, I. Pantskhava, A. Tsereteli, N. Zakariadze, K. Ukleba. In the event of there being an urgent necessity to include new members, the Political Council is provided with the right of co- option. 4. The congress declares the UCPG to be the successor to the Georgian Communist Party that existed until 26 August 1991. 5. Once the UCPG has been registered, the parties that have joined it (GWCP, UGC, and the "Stalin" political organization) will be liquidated in accordance with their rules. 6. The congress informs those parties and social organizations that adhere to socialist ideas that the UCPG is ready to receive them into its ranks. The Political Council is empowered to conduct conciliatory talks with the representatives of any parties and social organizations that wish to defend the interests of Georgia's workers through joint efforts. 7. The congress approves the activities of the editorial board of the GWCP organ KOMUNISTI and considers it necessary to assist it in every way (including materially). The constituent congress confirms KOMUNISTI, the newspaper of the GWCP, a party that has made a big contribution to the creation of the UCPG, to be its press organ. 8. The congress recommends that primary, rayon, town, and oblast party organizations unite their efforts, strengthen the unified ranks of party organizations, and, at regular meetings (conferences), elect single delegates for the forthcoming congress according to the norm that will be established later. 9. The congress, understanding all the complexities of settling the Abkhazian problem, views as acceptable the agreement on a cease- fire and the separation of forces signed in Moscow on 11 May 1994 by representatives from Georgia and Abkhazia in the presence of [representatives from] the UN, Russian Federation, and CSCE.
