[Correspondent] You are the prime minister appointed after the Arusha Agreement. You are now in France to hold talks with French officials. Mr. Twagiramungu, what do you think about the statement UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali made yesterday evening? The UN secretary general was really desperate and worried by the situation in your country. [Twagiramungu] It is true, the UN secretary general is saddened by what is going on in my country, Rwanda. But I think that we should not be as discouraged and worried as he is. The Rwandan people must know that the situation in our country is a Rwandan problem. We Rwandans must try by all means to find a viable solution so that peace is restored. [Correspondent] We will come back to this point, but do you agree with Butrus Butrus-Ghali who says that the international community has failed because it has done nothing? [Twagiramungu] I do agree because I think that what is going on in Rwanda is quite a scandal. It raises questions about the sensibility of people and about our sense of humanity. This massacre--which is actually being called a genocide today...[pauses] We cannot understand how people are not worried by what is going on and do not want to find a solution. Today we are talking about genocide. It is not only a word today. We have had UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] 1; we are now waiting for UNAMIR 2. But we do not see the international community reacting positively. This is why--when you see what is going on in Rwanda--I think it is a failure and a shameful thing for the international community. [Correspondent] What do you think of the special investigator appointed to investigate the massacres for four weeks? [Twagiramungu] I think that it is just the first step. Quite frankly I must admit that I am absolutely not satisfied with that. I am not the only one by the way. With such a genocide, we cannot avoid setting up an international court to try and punish the criminals. I do not see any difference between what is happening in Rwanda and what happened in Germany between 1940 and 1945. There was a genocide there, there were serious problems there, similar to ours. Why cannot the international community set up an international court to judge these criminals. Moreover, if they are not tried they will think that they can continue and resume the massacres in some years' time. This is why we will lobby the international community so that the court is set up. That will be the beginning of the solution. Otherwise, we will encourage the killers. [Correspondent] There has been talk of sending 5,500 UN troops to Rwanda, but they have not been found yet. Nobody--almost nobody--wants to send troops. [Twagiramungu] I personally think that they do not want to. It is as if they were saying: Look, it is a small country, there are massacres and there is genocide. We must not get involved and we are not interested in that. They should be allowed to continue until they stop. As I told you before, it is a huge failure and we are disappointed. [Correspondent] This is what you really feel? [Twagiramungu] This is what I feel. The international community should understand that there are serious problems. People have been killing each other for almost two months, and the killers are left to do what they want. We must employ all available means to stop the killers. [Correspondent] Let us now talk about the situation there and about the war. There are massacres and there is war. Is there something else that could be done other than a military solution? We have the feeling that the RPF [Rwanda Patriotic Front] is gaining ground. [Twagiramungu] Yes, the RPF is gaining ground. It has always put forward conditions to end the war and the massacres. Let us talk about the massacres first. These are two different things. The massacres were started by the regular army and in particular, by the Presidential Guard. The war was just the consequence of the massacres. What can we do today? First, those who started the massacres should decide to stop. I launch an appeal from here to the Rwandan Army and to the government put in place by a hidden coup. Another solution is that the Rwandan Army and the RPF--after the war started by the RPF--try to start talks. But it is still necessary to stop the massacres first. In other words, in order to solve the problem (?we would like to see) on the ground a military victory of any kind by the RPF. I do not know whether the RPF agrees on this point. [passage as heard] In any case the RPF controls Kanombe Airport and the country's most important barracks today. They should understand that the time has now come for talks so that the other party can give a positive answer and fulfill the conditions set by the RPF, that is the end of massacres. They must talk and solve this Rwandan problem, because it is a problem that concerns us all. [Correspondent] Does the Arusha Agreement have any kind of validity left. Is it still possible to discuss? [Twagiramungu] I do not think so, and luckily the other political players do not think so either. [Correspondent] With whom do you accept to talk with right now? [Twagiramungu] You mean myself, or the democratic forces and parties for change? [Correspondent] Yourself. [Twagiramungu] I prefer to talk to all those who are interested in the situation in my country: The RPF, the democratic forces for change. I am also interested in finding moderates within the parties that started the massacres: The MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] and the CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic]. [Correspondent] What will you personally do in the next few weeks? [Twagiramungu] In the next few weeks I will start to meet--it has already been decided--members of the democratic parties for change. I will also meet members of the RPF's Executive Committee. I think we must continue to look together for solutions that may put an end to fighting. [Correspondent] It seems that the RPF absolutely does not want to talk to the MRND and the CDR. However, you are in favor of dialogue. [Twagiramungu] I do not want to talk to the parties. I want to talk to those who showed some restraint and who were not involved in the latest massacres. [Correspondent] What should be the UN troops' precise role? The RPF does not want any buffer force. [Twagiramungu] The RPF does not want a buffer force and I do not want a buffer force, but yesterday in New York the RPF decided that these 5,500 people should go to Rwanda to provide security in areas to be chosen, provide security in the food supplies corridor, and respond to attack from the militia's. Otherwise, I cannot see the goal of the mission. [Correspondent] How is your relationship with the French authorities now? [Twagiramungu] We just exchange information. As I am a witness of what is going on in my country, I have given enough information and have asked clear questions on the situation. I have been told that France does not provide weapons anymore to the Rwandan regular army. [Correspondent] Thank you.
