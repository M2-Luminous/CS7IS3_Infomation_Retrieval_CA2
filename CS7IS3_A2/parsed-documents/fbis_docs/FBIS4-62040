In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Anatoliy Khmelnitskiy, head of the second Asia department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, said that "presently, the Russian-Malaysian deal estimated at about 600 million U.S. dollars is at the final stage of consideration. There are no serious obstacles for its signing." A Russian delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov has just returned from Malaysia where it held a series of fruitful meetings and talks. They aimed at specifying the details of a large package of agreements now in the works, Khmelnitskiy said. Apart from selling MiG fighters to Malaysia, the sides also discussed the possibility of launching the production of spare parts for them in Malaysia. Bilateral agreements between the two countries have committed them to establish a sound maintenance base and teach Malaysian pilots to fly Russian MiG fighters. Malaysia will pay part of the deal with palm oil. "This fact must not worry Russian people. Malaysian palm oil is not only a highly nutritious product, but is also indispensable in various industries, including aerospace industry," Khmelnitskiy said. If the deal goes through, Malaysia will be the first Southeast Asian country to be granted access to Russian weapons and military technologies.
