Phra Chamrun Panchan said he regretted the decision not to admit more Hmong drug addicts for treatment. [passage omitted] Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut, who did not provide details of the plan to put an end to anti-Vientiane activity based in Thailand, yesterday said some of the Hmong at the drug treatment centre are connected with right-wing anti-Vientiane rebel leader Vang Pao. Deputy Interior Ministry Permanent Secretary Chaloem Phromloet said that 6,052 of the 10,000 Hmong at the temple are illegal immigrants from Laos, not from northern Thailand as are the others who are known as Thai Pukhao [Thai mountain people]. According to the ministry's figures, there are less than 200 drug addicts at Wat Tham Krabok. The National Security Council last year asked the Interior Ministry to screen residents of the temple to separate the drug addicts from the alleged Hmong rebels in disguise. The ministry was also asked to take necessary action against those using the temple for reasons other than drug rehabilitation. Phra Chamrun said provincial authorities had deployed militiamen around his temple for several weeks after a report last year that the sprawling compound had been used by rightwing Hmong opposed to the Lao government as a staging area for sabotage and acts of terrorism inside Laos. "But the militiamen have since been recalled because they did not find any illegal activities committed by the Hmong people," he said. He said he wanted the provincial authorities to send in observers to monitor the work of his staff at the drug rehabilitation centre to make sure no illegal activities took place. The abbot complained that the authorities tended to regard him and his staff with suspicion. Phra Chamrun said although the number of Hmong hilltribe people undergoing treatment was small, the majority of the close to 10,000 Hmong at the temple were their family members and relatives. The abbot denied that any of the Hmong residing at his temple had anything to do with Gen Vang Pao, the leader of a Hmong armed force opposed to Vientiane.
