Yesterday we commented on the members of his team who are associates of Salinas and Zedillo. At this time we will discuss the associates of Zedillo and Colosio, the so-called "Orphans of the Tijuana Tragedy." First, however, we must make a clarification. The existence of such a group should surprise no one because Colosio and Zedillo worked together. They were not rivals. If the new candidate had been Camacho (who was assassinated with Colosio, only politically), the story would have been different. In addition, let us keep in mind that Zedillo, in his 29 March speech accepting the candidacy, mentioned Colosio some 30 times. Throughout, his speech carried a message of continuity. Enter Sonora-born Manlio Fabio Beltrones, another of Zedillo's men. By reason of his birthplace and political inclination, Beltrones hitched his carriage to that of his countryman, Colosio, to the extent that he, Beltrones, appointed Colosio's father in his state cabinet. Perhaps for his relationship with Colosio, Cordoba selected Beltrones to present Zedillo as the new candidate. It was said at a dinner that Zedillo and Beltrones presented a united front against the followers of Colosio who had proposed Lievano Saenz to be the coordinator of Zedillo's campaign. Zedillo's list includes Mario Luis Fuentes, the strongest link between Colosio and Zedillo, and Victor Manuel Palma Cesar, Zedillo's deputy coordinator for Colosio's campaign and who is believed to be appointed senator for the State of Morelos. Guillermo Hopkins Gamez was born in Magdalena de Kino, Sonora. Politically speaking, he was very, very close to Colosio. Hopkins holds a degree in political science from the Ibero-American University and a master's degree in public administration from the University of Colorado. He held the position of adviser to the Chief Clerk from 1987 to 1988 and worked in the planning and budget areas in the Sonora State Government. He was deputy logistics coordinator for the PRI campaign under coordinator Zedillo. It has been said he stands a good chance of becoming senator for Sonora and even governor of the state. Another of Zedillo's men and Colosio's associates is Andres Marco Antonio Bernal Gutierrez, also Tamaulipas-born, who was president of the SEDESOL [Social Development Secretariat] National Solidarity Institute during 1992 and 1993 under Colosio and deputy planning coordinator for the PRI campaign under Zedillo. As for Lievano Saenz, we know that prior to the campaign, he held the post of chief clerk at SEDESOL and that he was social communications spokesman for the PRI presidential campaign. He could become senator for Chihuahua in the future. Nevertheless, it has been said that, among Colosio's friends, Esteban Moctezuma Barragan is one of the men closest to Zedillo. He holds a degree in law and economics from National Autonomous University of Mexico, a master's degree in political economy from Cambridge University, and a degree in regional development, which he obtained in Japan. In addition, Moctezuma Barragan started out at the Planning and Budget Secretariat [SPP], in the area managed by Colosio, held the post of chief clerk at SPP under Zedillo, and was Colosio's private secretary when Colosio was head of the PRI National Executive Council. He was also Deputy Secretary for Educational Planning at the Public Education Secretariat. Of all the men mentioned, he is closest to Zedillo. For this reason, it is believed that he will be appointed for a very important position. We can say that Colosio's associates and Zedillo's associates can well be taken for one another because their political inclinations and ideologies, not only are compatible, but nearly parallel. All of them are birds of a feather. All of them are young, educated, hold master's and doctor's degrees obtained abroad, and have been following a steady political course. By reason of mutual friendship, this group also includes Carlos Rojas, former SPP deputy secretary under Zedillo and in charge of the National Solidarity Program, as well as Francisco Labastida Ochoa, former governor of Sinaloa. Let us keep in mind that all of these people will appear in the country's political horizon for the next six-year term if Zedillo is elected president.
