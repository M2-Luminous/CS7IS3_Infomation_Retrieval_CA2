Of course, the last thing you could ever accuse the Bolsheviks of was wanting to build a civil society. But the needs of industrialization forced them to achieve 100-percent literacy among the population and to give higher, if not classical, education to millions of people. And political awareness is the inevitable offshoot of education. So we have the Bolsheviks to thank for that, too! However, once their "political enlightenment" had given us a taste for big politics, they were unable to satisfy our political appetite. We had to do this ourselves, getting together with friends and colleagues in somebody's kitchen. Where else, I wonder, would the cook and her children do it? O kitchen! You are the birthplace of all our country's present political concepts and doctrines. You launched the careers of many stars and entire troupes who are now giving shows on the political stage. And it does not matter that the relations between them are, frankly, more appropriate to the kitchen. What matters is that the actors and performers should have a perfect mastery of at least the main recipes in political cuisine: all those cooked-up facts served up with titillating "plums," all that raw meat from the hot spots, stuffed with lead and covered in ideological sauce. Of course, the public does not always like these details -- it is a matter of taste. But since they are feeding it to us anyway, we had better make sure they do not foist any really uneatable bad meat on us. That is why, from now on, page two of our newspaper will carry articles by the best chefs who prepare dishes for the table of the country's president, government, leading politicians, and businessmen. Let us hope that with their help we will all reach the standard of that legendary cook who is supposed to run the state. And irony aside: That standard is what is called a civil society. Today we offer for your attention two pieces of research work carried out specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's analysis service by a group of experts. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has exclusive rights to this research. So, welcome to our political kitchen! Yours, Feliks Babitskiy. [Malyutin, Grigoryev, Yakovenko article begins] And All This Is About Him About the terrible Zhirinovskiy, from whom, for some reason or other, people expect unheard-of villainies and great acts of heroism on a Quixotic scale -- and some of them, in a fit of "administrative rapture," have even decided to form a front to barricade themselves against him. This is totally unwarranted -- you only have to remember Zhirinovskiy at the Constitutional Conference to see how quiet and God-fearing he can be. He too will be a center. Center in every sense, including a center of attention, and, with 70 people, a center of decisionmaking. Unless, naturally, a centrist majority forms, and finds a common language with the government, and that is clearly not going to happen for the first few months at least. And if enough acts of folly are committed during that time, the Duma in its present composition might never succeed at all. Of course, on the strength of its basic principles, Zhirinovskiy's party is the typical "power party," in some ways downright archetypal, as Grandpa Lenin would have said. But unlike the Communists and the national patriots, who based all their plans (and still do, sometimes, to this day) on raising the masses against the ruling regime and using parliament as a platform to kindle the masses' fury, Zhirinovskiy has every chance of coming to power legally in the very near future. Never in his life has he had any philosophical allergy (whether based on communism or on a back-to-the-land philosophy) to using general elections, the presidency, and parliamentary democracy as tools. Without comparing him to Hitler, we would nonetheless like to point out that the Third Reich was a strictly rule-of-law state, and its Fuehrer never broke a single law in his life (OK, so he wrote the laws himself, but every great man has his whims). And so the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], like the other groupings (YaBL [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] and the PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] most of all) for whom the most important thing is the presidential elections in summer 1996 (that is the very latest date, they could be earlier), will use the Duma (which, moreover, does not decide anything, in the sense of exercising power) to "flex their muscles." Shakhray and Yavlinskiy will demonstrate to the whole world that "only they can stop" Zhirinovskiy, using him as a battering ram. If, say, after a while Zhirinovskiy concludes that there is a high probability of his losing the elections, he will undoubtedly go over to the intransigents and become their leader, but that is not how things stand for the time being. He does not really need them as a worn-out step up to his pedestal. What we have here is a kind of "negative synthesis" of the NSF [National Salvation Front] in content and Democratic Russia in form -- and more effective in both cases, thus far. There is no need to embark on an analysis of the front's ideology now: The predominant force there was "down with!", and any attempts to think in terms of "long live!" ran aground on the problems faced by "an alliance of cats tied together by their tails." It is quite obvious that in September-October the NSF suffered an organizational failure, since it was not in control of anything and played the part of more or less active "cannon fodder" and "cheerleaders" for Khasbulatov and Rutskoy. All in all, there were too many petty contenders for the roles of leaders and ideologues, none of whom knew how to work with the mass media -- nor were they willing to learn.... As for Democratic Russia, it had, generally speaking, the same organizational Achilles heel. For this movement of brilliant (mainly Moscow-based) individualists, Yeltsin was initially "not one of ours." They quite openly decided to take him up and make use of him as a battering ram in pursuit of their own goals, making no secret of the fact that they could drop him if they no longer needed him, and he repaid them in kind. Yeltsin very sensibly never claimed to be an original thinker. They got into parliament thanks to their own efforts, and when, for one reason or another, they were disappointed with Yeltsin, they distanced themselves from him, and often gained by doing so. It is no accident that virtually nobody from Moscow's Democratic Russia has made an even remotely successful government career, even after August 1991. Yeltsin, for his part, within his "milieu," always kept the radicals at a certain distance, preferring the position of "father of the nation." In actual fact Zhirinovskiy likewise -- with adjustments for temperament and style -- was never a radical in his actions, nor is he an "unbounded" demagogue. As long as you do not hang on his every word and judge him by his public statements, in actual fact he is rather a cautious creature who always has a keen sense of the dividing line between what is permitted and what is not, for the moment, permitted. Even without him, the Duma will have no shortage of radicals, who will inevitably try to "out-Zhirinovskiy" him and, in a way, to revive the traditions of the "White" wing of the NSF. Zhirinovskiy took "his" list into the Duma himself, on his own back: 60 of them, of whom only six are from the electoral districts -- a striking contrast! They include practically no well-known, outstanding individuals except for A. Kashpirovskiy and the ecologist M. Lemeshev, nor are there any really independent thinkers with claims to originality -- although the presence of the editor of YURIDICHESKAYA GAZETA and a group of legal experts and economists formerly linked with the radical wing of the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation] solves the problem of who will write the draft laws, while at the same time giving rise to a certain lack of internal homogeneity in the team, where there is already a growing dissatisfaction among the "old boyars" with the "new staff of smart guys." It will therefore be a very obedient tool, especially if the idea of the imperative mandate -- propagandized not only by Zhirinovskiy -- catches on and the entire faction votes as one man, so that the "lawyer's son" could end any parliamentary or extraparliamentary argument with the same phrase (like Cato about Carthage): "Apart from all that has been said, I must add that Russia's problems will never be solved until I am elected president, the sooner the better." This phrase will sound all the more weighty given that, with the existing structure of the Duma, Zhirinovskiy's faction could block any decision by abstaining. Unless the center can come to an agreement with either Zyuganov or Gaydar on any given question. Meanwhile Vladimir Volfovich will willingly explain to whoever wants to listen that he is voting in this way because he does not want to get dragged into squabbles between bankrupt politickers who are always sharing out power and do not think about the people. Against the background of the democrats' convulsive attempts to knock together an antifascist front (it is not clear that this front is going to do anything except make trips abroad: It might hold rallies -- but who is going to come?), these tactics will instantly win new supporters. Of course, there will be rows too, and on many more occasions our hero will have to write the word "traitor" next to the names of those who are presently his closest comrades in arms -- for a charismatic leader, that is quite normal.... Moreover, the "Zhirinovskiy factor," irrespective of the fact that everyone has already declared that they will not join a coalition with him, will strengthen the intransigent opposition of the old stamp. That opposition can now operate as zealously as it likes -- because this Duma cannot be disbanded, except, of course, at bayonet point. And judging by the vote, the main military secret is not how many bayonets, sabers, and other antiquated items the former Red Army has, but whom the army is backing today. The present Kremlin authorities know very well that there can hardly be a repetition of the October onslaught -- a miracle is a miracle precisely because it happens only once. The intransigents could even blackmail the democrats with the threat of self-dissolution by the Duma, because at the moment everyone knows who would win the next elections if such were held. Obviously not "Russia's Choice," especially since the new electoral law (including the Law on Presidential Elections) will be adopted, amid heated debates, by this very Duma. And Yeltsin's edicts, whether on the timing of the presidential elections or on abandoning them, also need ratifying. So there you are. Naturally, Zhirinovskiy's future as a politician is by no means cloudless, and his success is by no means predetermined, just as Yeltsin's political past -- turbulent even by our standards, which are far from poor in this respect -- was not cloudless. In the opinion of many serious analysts, Yeltsin's career, retrospectively, looks like a chain of lucky chances which at any moment -- until the evening of 3 October 1993 -- turned out ultimately in his favor. But that does not really have anything to do with parliament: The LDPR faces questions relating to the building of its own political party, the coordination of extraparliamentary forms of pressure on the regime, work with the Army, foreign policy actions, and much else. After all, before the elections it was no more substantial than the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia] in this respect, that is, it had a few thousand activists and, according to expert assessments, its numerical strength was not much in excess of 10,000 members, and, other than in the Moscow region, it was influential and had a real presence only in the Nonchernozem and a few other regions. It is clear that all this will not be decided at the level of the parliamentary faction: That faction will give voice to the planned strategy and tactics in the public area, which, incidentally, is what has always been done throughout the world. But since, in this article, we are analyzing not the prospects of a certain type of charismatic leader and his "ultramodern party" taking power, but the prospects of the new parliament on whose stage he will put on his political performances, what has been said about the LDPR is sufficient, as a first approximation. Zhirinovskiy has received his mandate of confidence as the "Yeltsin of today," in an even more provincial version. Let us see whether he will be able to take advantage of it. On the Eve of a Choice In its very first hours of work the State Duma will face a question whose answer will immediately clarify much. It is a kind of archetypal "knight at the crossroads" situation. With its "if you turn left...and if you turn right...." This is not the question of the government, as many people fear. Ultimately Chernomyrdin has quite a good chance of being given confidence, although, of course, some unpleasant moments lie in store for him when he is forced to answer the question of the possible presence of Gaydar, Chubays, Fedorov, and Kozyrev in the government. After all, if worst comes to worst, the question of the government can be avoided entirely, but the question of ratifying Edict 1400 cannot be avoided. Especially since this procedure was stipulated by the edict itself and by subsequent legislative activity carried out by the president "on credit." The consequences of the ratification or nonratification of Edict 1400 are obvious. If the edict is not ratified, the entire new political and legal structure collapses. After that, while the president will unequivocally be, from the legal viewpoint, a "usurper and rebel who carried out a bloody coup d'etat," parliament, although it will not have been elected entirely legitimately, will still remain the organ of people's power. All it has to do is to declare itself, by a simple majority, to be the successor not only to the Congress, but also to the State Duma and the Constituent Assembly into the bargain, and even to the Zemskiy Sobor that used to elect the czars at one time. First of all, the new Constitution automatically ceases to operate, since the referendum on it was held in violation of the Law on the Referendum, which Yeltsin was entitled to do only in the event that the edict was ratified. Incidentally, in their haste, they omitted to repeal or suspend that law. Nonratification of the edict does not necessarily mean the automatic reinstatement of the disbanded Congress, but it does allow for the possibility of turning the Duma into a Constituent Assembly, and here you cannot get away with just another edict to the effect that the relevant point of Edict 1400 is invalid on the basis of the referendum results (nationwide approval by one-third of the electoral register is politically insubstantial and has no legal status without ratification by parliament), especially since the new Constitution was not adopted in the majority of components of the Federation. The situation is made even trickier by the fact that votes must be collected not against, but for ratification, and it is quite possible to propose the interpretation that since Edict 1400 is undoubtedly constitutional, it requires a constitutional majority (that is, three-fourths), and this cheerfully postpones the question until the twelfth of never. There will be people in the Duma who will raise this question, but the centrists will be very well aware of what prospects face them in this connection. Especially since the YaBL bloc has decided to seize the initiative and has declared that it will seek the formation of a commission for parliamentary investigation of all the circumstances relating to the adoption and implementation of Edict 1400. It will then be "not just simple, but very simple" to postpone its ratification until then and to keep Yeltsin personally in their sights. While extracting in exchange, as a minimum, a return to June 1994 presidential elections. And then it will be possible to create a really broad front, if not antifascist (there is no real threat from there at present), then an anti-authoritarian front, on the basis of limiting the president's powers and returning to a majority system in elections. The democratic factions themselves have no way of collecting 225 votes for the ratification of the edict, especially since not everyone in the PRUA or YaBL will vote for it, and the "independent" is independent, and it is not at all clear what he can be bought for at the moment. Nor is intimidation really practicable. Two options remain. Either you buy the votes of the centrists, up to and including the agrarians -- but in return they will demand the government, nothing less. Or else you openly enter into a coalition with Zhirinovskiy, once again on the basis of renewed constitutionalism. And even then there might not be enough votes. From the viewpoint of his own interests, there is no particular reason for Zhirinovskiy to "tarnish his bright image" in the eyes of the voter through an open alliance with "Russia's Choice." That could lose him votes. On this question, it would be better for him to abstain: After all, he played absolutely no part in the September-October events, and therefore he need not join in someone else's fight, he can sit and wait. But the question of the ratification of Edict 1400 gives him a unique opportunity to demand, as payment, that presidential elections be called for June of this year. That step is something that would be very well understood by his voters. And not only his.... Whatever the president's team may do, the raising of the question of Edict 1400 in the Duma is inevitable. This will be voted for both by the centrists, if our analysis is correct and there are more serious politicians among them today, and by Zhirinovskiy, because power itself is falling into his hands. "We will make a deal with the president" -- this man knows what he is saying. The reformers had better start thinking now who they would prefer to deal with. They have already started: Kozyrev observed aloud that the communists were always the staunchest fighters against fascism. How far Zyuganov can be counted as one of them, and how far it is reasonable to classify his party, in its present form, in the tradition of the left, and specifically the antifascist tradition, is another matter. But the CPRF clearly does not tolerate crooks, and if it is going to come to terms, it is only with Chernomyrdin and the "pragmatic wing" in general, certainly not with fundamentalist ideologists. It has plenty of its own, within the faction. Especially since the CPRF has its own favorite complicating factor -- a coalition government of people's confidence, and it is clearly going to push that most of all. But if the barrier of Edict 1400 can somehow be crossed, the problem of the budget and the government will loom large, mainly the former, because, whatever Constitution we are to live under in future, any parliament is going to have a fairly distant connection with the government, but the Duma will allow the government to draw up the budget for 1994, so as to be able to castigate it later (and Fedorov's head alone might not be enough). As for other avenues of development, there is no point in talking about them until after this latest fork in the road has been traversed.
