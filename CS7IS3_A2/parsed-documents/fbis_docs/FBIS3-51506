They will only benefit from the amnesty if they surrender their weapons and release the hostages they are holding, and they must adhere to the terms established by the commission that is going to implement the law. In addition to sending the amnesty bill to the National Congress, President Salinas appointed Manuel Camacho Solis as the special commissioner to negotiate peace and to establish contact with the rebels in the Zapatist Army of National Liberation. The Amnesty Law suspends penal sactions against individuals who participated in the violent occupation of several towns in Chiapas and in later clashes with the Mexican Army. The Chamber of Deputies received the bill and modified certain articles to make the deadline for the surrender of weapons more flexible and to establish that one condition for the surrender of weapons would be a willingness to enter negotiations. The bill originally established that the sole beneficiaries of the amnesty would be those people who participated in violent incidents between 1 January and 1100 on 16 January if they surrendered their weapons and adhered to the benefits of this law. The deputies added to the draft law an article that calls on the executive branch to create a commission that will coordinate the implementation of the law to strengthen legal procedures and to prevent setting deadlines that hinder the implementation of the law. The application of benefits of the amnesty will go into effect the moment the commission declares a definitive end to hostile actions. Another change made to the draft law was the elimination of a 30-day deadline and the inclusion of the delivery of hostages. Also, it emphasized that the people receiving benefits of the law will not be interrogated, investigated, summoned, or bothered, inasmuch as amnesty includes a respect for human rights. The ruling explains that the Amnesty Law must be made public and disseminated in Spanish and in the nine indian dialects that are spoken in the area so that it will be learned as best possible by those for whom it is intended. The armed conflict in Chiapas began on 1 January with the violent takeover of San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, Altamirano, Oxchuc, and Las Margaritas, from where the Armed Forces expelled the rebels who remain entrenched in the community of Guadalupe Tepeyac near the border with Guatemala.
