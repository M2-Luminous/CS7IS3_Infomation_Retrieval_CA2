But this does not mean that Russia was earlier a passive observer of the events occurring here. Our country was a participant in the Madrid Near East Peace Conference in 1991 and participated throughout the past two years, as cosponsor of this conference, in the negotiating process. Inasmuch as this process was quite smooth, diplomatic activity was not that noticeable to public opinion. Russia's interests have traditionally been connected with the Near East. So our promotion of a peace settlement is far from fortuitous. The work initiated on the instructions of President Yeltsin is expressed both in contacts of the minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation with his colleagues from many states and in our active position in the UN Security Council. My trip to the region in the past week was made within the framework of these efforts. Its purpose was to meet directly with the leadership of the parties, to obtain information about the state of affairs first-hand, and to attempt to find compromise solutions that would make it possible to halt the violence and to resume the negotiating process. After all, as we all know, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon terminated the negotiations with Israel after the Hebron tragedy as a sign of solidarity with the PLO leadership. A great deal of hard diplomatic work is now needed for finding a way out of the situation. There were meetings in the course of the trip with Yasir Arafat and the PLO Executive Committee in Tunis, with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and with Minister of Foreign Affairs Shimon Peres in Jerusalem. A practical step toward a resumption of the negotiating process could be, in our view, an effective UN Security Council resolution condemning the terrorist act in Hebron and opening the way to the creation of the conditions for assurance of security for the Palestinian population. Second, it is necessary to decide the question of an international presence from the viewpoint of both its format and mandate in order to guarantee the realization of the accords that are achieved. It seems to us that an international presence should be realized with the active role of the cosponsors of the Madrid Peace Conference, that is, Russia and the United States, which does not, of course, rule out the participation of other states. For it was Russia and the United States that assumed responsibility for the peace process, appending their signatures to the Declaration of Principles of Provisional Palestinian Self-Government adopted last fall in Washington. The practical aspects of the international presence, on the other hand, would be resolved by the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships: Without their consent there can be no question of the dispatch of observers at all. I was asked frequently during my Near East trip: Are Russia and the United States not competing over what credit will be attributed to whom? But I replied: We are not at the Olympic Games, they are over, the medals have been handed out. Russian-American cosponsorship presupposes both the joint efforts of the two countries and the independent diplomatic actions of each of them: This is what the United States is doing, this is what Russia is doing also. The trip to the region helped in an explanation on the spot of our new initiative, which had originally been misinterpreted. We proposed, as we all know, stage two of the Near East Peace Conference. The reaction, on the part of the United States and Israel primarily, was cool: They were afraid that we wanted in this way to substitute for the negotiations that are already under way and, in fact, to cancel out all that has been achieved. But this is by no means part of our intentions. We are confident that the present Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are close to completion and that we need to be thinking today even about the future. Stage one has been negotiated, and certain experience--both negative and positive--has been accumulated. We now need to meet and think about how to further advance the peace process in all directions. On 14 March Andrey Kozyrev will meet with Warren Christopher in Vladivostok, and a principal topic of the negotiations will be a Near East settlement. We will be discussing this topic with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon also. We have traditionally had good relations with the Palestinian people and other Arab states. But we attach great significance to relations with Israel, proceeding from the fact that we could be an equal partner with all the parties, not an advocate for just one of them. Attempts have been made in the Yugoslav conflict also, incidentally, to depict us as the defenders of the interests of just the Serbian side. But Russia has supported and continues to support equal contacts with the Serbs and with the Muslims and with the Croats. Shuttle diplomacy is in this respect helping us clear up the misunderstandings and find compromise solutions.
