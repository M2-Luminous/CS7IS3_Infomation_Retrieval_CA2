FR941104-1-00026 FR941104-1-00003 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 20 Radiological Criteria for Decommissioning; Workshop on Site-Specific Advisory Boards AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Notice of workshop. SUMMARY: On August 22, 1994, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission published for comment a proposed rule on Radiological Criteria for Decommissioning (59 FR 43200). Section 20.1406(b) of this proposed rule requires that a Site Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) be convened in cases where a licensee proposes to request restricted release of the site. The objective of this workshop is to conduct an informed discussion among affected interests on the implementation of this requirement. The workshop will be facilitated by an independent facilitator and will involve approximately fifteen to twenty invited participants representing a broad range of affected interests including, for example, government (local, State, tribal, Federal), industry, and environmental and citizen groups. The workshop will be open to the public with sufficient time being provided for public comment and questions throughout each day of the workshop. The workshop proceedings will be transcribed and the transcript will be available for public review. An Issues Paper containing a detailed description of the SSAB implementation issues is being developed by the NRC staff for use as a background discussion document for the workshop. This Issues paper will be distributed to participants in advance of the workshop. A detailed agenda and list of participants for the workshop is also being developed for distribution to participants in advance of the workshop. Copies of the Issues Paper, the Workshop Agenda, and the list of workshop participants will be made available to the public at the workshop. Copies of these documents will be placed in the NRC Public Document Room and will also be available for downloading and viewing on the NRC bulletin board as described below. DATES: The workshop will be held in Washington, DC, on December 6, 7, and the morning of December 8, 1994. The location of the workshop will be in the National Governor's Association Conference Room, Room 333, Hall of the States, 444 North Capitol Street NW., Washington, DC. ADDRESSES: Send comments to: Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. ATTN: Docketing and Service Branch. Hand deliver comments to: 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, between 7:45 a.m. and 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Comments may be submitted electronically, in either ASCII text or Wordperfect format, by calling the NRC Enhanced Participatory Rulemaking on Radiological Criteria for Decommissioning Electronic Bulletin Board, 1&hyph;800&hyph;880&hyph;6091 (58 FR 37760; July 13, 1993). The bulletin board may be accessed using a personal computer, a modem, and most commonly available communications software packages. Communication software parameters should be set as follows: parity to none, data bits to 8, and stop bits to 1 (N, 8, 1). Use ANSI or VT&hyph;100 terminal emulation. Copies of the Issues Paper, the Workshop Agenda, and the list of workshop participants will also be available for downloading and viewing on the bulletin board.

Malaro, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone (301) 415&hyph;6201. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In situations where a licensee proposes to decommission a site under restricted release conditions, proposed Section 20.1407 would require the licensee to establish a SSAB for the purpose of obtaining advice from affected interests on the proposed decommissioning. There are many important issues related to the SSAB concept that must be further developed before the final rule is promulgated to facilitate implementation of the SSAB concept at NRC licensed sites. These include determining the exact scope and functions of an SSAB and the appointment and composition of an SSAB. A national workshop will be extremely useful in developing information on how these issues should be addressed, as well as for developing the final NRC position on the SSAB concept. The objective of the workshop will not be to develop a consensus on the implementation of an SSAB but will rather be a discussion of information, ideas, and concerns about SSAB implementation issues, as well as identifying areas of agreement and disagreement on the implementation issues. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 28th day of October, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Eric S. Beckjord, Director, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research.
