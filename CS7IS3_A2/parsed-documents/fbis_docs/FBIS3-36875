The opposition newspaper SVABODA reported the same in a recent issue. According to SVABODA, the Cabinet of Ministers leadership have requested that the Prosecutor's Office, KGB, and the Interior Ministry find legal grounds to ban the BNF. The Prosecutor's Office reportedly has been asked to consider the possibility of initiating criminal proceedings against Zyanon Paznyak. However, as has been pointed out by Viktar Ivashkevich, the BNF leadership thus far knows nothing about any concrete legal measures taken by law enforcement bodies.
