Speaking before Zimbabwe African National Union members, Mugabe said one of the examples of these politicians is Enoch Dumbutshena, the leader of Zimbabwe Movement of Unity and former chairman of the Supreme Court. Mugabe has been accusing the country's whites of racism for resisting the government's plans of acquiring agricultural land and distributing them to black farmers. Whites say the government is using the agricultural issue to restore its popularity before the elections.
