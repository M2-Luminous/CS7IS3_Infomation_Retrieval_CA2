Talking to journalists in the State Duma Grigoriy Yavlinskiy assumed that the president "evidently brought together those who did not meet with Richard Nixon." He said Yeltsin's public refusal to receive the former American president now staying in Moscow on a private visit, after Nixon met several opposition leaders, the ban on Nixon's meetings with the government and the head of the presidential administration Sergey Filatov, "have nothing even to do with the slightest ideas of democracy, loyalty, tolerance or diplomacy." Yavlinskiy also said that the contents of his hour-and-a-half conversation with the former American head of state on March 8 "gave no grounds for such a demonstration." According to Yavlinskiy, during their meeting, Nixon mentioned that the list of his meetings in Russia had been agreed upon with President Clinton. Yavlinskiy said the former American president also disagreed with claims that Yeltsin is oppressive and undemocratic because Nixon could meet with opposition leaders. Nixon said this shows the president is confident and is quite broad-minded.
