He addressed students at the University of Stellenbosch today. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Ronel van Zyl] Meyer said that CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg could participate under the umbrella of the Freedom Front. [Meyer] The reasons or conditions which he advances for participation are not practical. He said 800,000 votes must see to it that there is a volkstaat. There is no way that we will yield to that sort of condition for a volkstaat. The issue will have to be negotiated further. [Van Zyl] In his speech to the students, Meyer castigated the Inkatha Freedom Party for its decision to join the elections at the last moment. [Meyer] The decision by Inkatha to participate in fact came at a time when Inkatha realized that the election was not going to be postponed. [Van Zyl] Meyer said he believed the election will be reasonably free and fair. He was optimistic about the new South Africa, and added that white South Africans should not feel uneasy, but should rather look forward to the future with anticipation and excitement. [end recording] The ANC in its reaction rejected Dr. Hartzenberg's proposal that the principle of a volkstaat must be accepted if the right wing can attract 800,000 votes in the election. This organization's chief negotiator said at a news conference in Johannesburg that the interim constitution was already making provision for a volkstaat that will be able to make recommendations to the constituent assembly. [Ramaphosa, in English] We do not believe that the proposal that has been put forward by Ferdi Hartzenberg is a proposal that we should take seriously. If Ferdi Hartzenberg wants to participate in the election, he is free to do so, and we would encourage him to be part of Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front. They should contest elections under that name, and we will meet them in Parliament. We will then be able to discuss the idea of a volkstaat more effectively. [end recording]
