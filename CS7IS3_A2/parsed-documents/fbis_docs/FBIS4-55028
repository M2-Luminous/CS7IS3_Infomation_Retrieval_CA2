[Berisha] The Serbian president would have done much better, I think, if he had given peace and stability to the Bosnian people and had given orders to the Karadzic-type criminals to stop bombarding Gorazde and obey the will of the EC and the norms regulating peace and good relations among countries. That would have been a valuable contribution by him to the solution of the conflict that was started by Belgrade and is still being ferociously backed by it. There can be no way of establishing any federation or confederation as long as Serbian aggression is creating thousands of victims. It is a mere farce, a phoney proposal reflecting Serbia's integrationist plans tantamount to the Greater Serbia idea, aggression, and conflict in the Balkans. [Correspondent] Neither Montenegro, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], or Kosova were mentioned at all in Milosevic's draft constitutions. What does this augur for the Albanian territories? [Berisha] It shows that President Milosevic, in accordance with the Memorandum of the (Serbian) Academy of Sciences [on the formation of a Greater Serbia], is going out of his way to draw all these territories into a Greater Serbia. There is no doubt that he has come up with this proposal just to be able to make Serbia the dominant factor and ensure its hegemony over the Balkans. However, I must stress here that the idea of a Greater Serbia and its domination over the Balkans can never bring stability to the region and, historically speaking, it is an erroneous and totally groundless idea. The Balkans can never be given stability by those who set it on fire. It would be absurd to claim that the Balkans could be dominated by a population that accounts for no more than 10 percent of the entire population of the region. I am of the opinion that Serbia must once and for all renounce its policy of aggression and war, and naturally after this there must be a policy of cooperation throughout the Balkan peninsula. [Correspondent] What would you say about President Clinton's proposal, and what would be your comment on NATO's steps and military intervention against Serbia? [Berisha] I have stressed in the past, and I would like to stress again, that the restoration of NATO's credibility is of tremendous importance to the solution of this conflict that has swept over the region and to the prevention of other conflicts in the Balkans. I have welcomed all President Clinton's proposals and I hope that the Atlantic union and NATO will put them into practice. It is impermissible that a gang of bandits and criminals with 30 or 50 tanks should humiliate universal principles and the international community, thus causing the greatest human slaughter that Europe has witnessed since World War II. [Correspondent] What is your opinion on Milosevic's proposal for dialogue... [Berisha] Albania has already expressed its view on this matter: It is and always will be in favor of dialogue and negotiations. The only way to resolve problems is to recognize realities and evaluate them, not ignore them. I am certain that a dialogue of this kind between Milosevic and Rugova, under the auspices of a third party, would lead to the solution of the Kosova issue. [Correspondent] What are the prospects for Albania's relations with Greece in the wake of the border incident? [Berisha] It is rather difficult to define the prospects for our relations with Greece, because unfortunately Greece through its actions has turned into a compass, as it were, for the aggressive Serbian policy in the Balkans. So, while there is war going on in the north and a policy in the south that favours aggression and creates tensions in the Balkans, our relations with Greece remain tense. However, I would like to express Albania's determination to overcome, through dialogue with Greece, the great problems created in the Peshkopia area. There are many plans under way proportionately to expand the number of our two countries' diplomats, and these plans will be discussed as early as 3 May, when our two foreign ministers will meet in Geneva. We intend to make our contribution to the success of this meeting and the reduction of tensions in the southern Balkans, but the truth is that Greece is deeply affected by chauvinism.
