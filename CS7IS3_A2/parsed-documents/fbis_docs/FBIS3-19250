Thus begins the campaign platform of those Greens who at one time had lined up in opposition to the "established" parties, both inside and outside the parliaments, but most assuredly without having any sort of governing responsibility. In many land governments, this is now nothing more than yesterday's dogma. The party--including all its factions--is now trying with all its might to get to the cabinet's table in the Chancellor's Office. That this will come about is seen by many as probable. The weakness of the Kohl government, they say, and the "right" image that SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] Chairman Scharping has prescribed for his party, have opened up great opportunities for a left-wing party. The Greens want to avail themselves of these opportunities. The platform approved by them over the weekend does reaffirm their old goals, to be sure, but at the same time it qualified them dramatically: Not one of the demands contained in the campaign platform could be cited as a justification for causing a failure of coalition negotiations with the SPD, neither by the Green fundamentalists nor by the Social Democrats. Likewise, of the points of controversy that arose between the "realists" and the leftist "fundamentalists" at the party congress over the weekend, all lend themselves to negotiation, for the party is bent on gaining power. After 14 years in an opposition role and an apprenticeship in a number of land governments, the Greens finally want to help shape politics in Bonn. The Greens as a party of the "sixty-eighters" have grown older. Like all other parties, it now has a youth organization. But not only aging has caused the Greens to become wiser, the country's reunification, as well, changed them in many ways. "Alliance 90/The Greens"--this is not only a new name. Even though the courageous GDR civil rights proponents of 1989/90 are of little consequence numerically, they did lastingly change the face of the party that had been unified only a year earlier. Especially in the area of foreign and security policies, many of the civil rights campaigners successfully called into question traditional positions, ranging from the use of military force to save people in Bosnia to the debate on the Bundeswehr. To be sure, the "realists" have so far been unable to gain a "structural" majority, yet the party's left wing felt compelled prior to the party congress in Mannheim to give the assurance that it had "never" demanded in the recent past that the Bundeswehr must be abolished "immediately." The word now is that this will be a long-lasting "process"--in view of the very real budgetary concerns, it is now easier than it was before to convince people that this process has already begun. Before the Greens could gain access to a Federal Government, they would of course have to return to the Bundestag. In the last elections, the west German Greens had not managed to do this--contrary to all expectations. And so they associate with German unity the memory of their greatest defeat. Because they conducted an unrealistic ideological campaign in 1990, they did not receive the required 5 percent of the votes. "Green" parliamentary work at the federal level has since been carried out by the successful civil rights campaigners of the Alliance 90 from the east. Those responsible learned from this bitter experience. The party congress over the weekend was marked by real concerns of the voters--jobs and a secure future. Ecology was in last place. In its program, the party is pinning its hopes on a solidarity alliance of the materially satisfied middle class, which is willing to make financial sacrifices for more quality of life and environmental protection, also for socially weaker persons. But that will not suffice for the "basic social security" which provides for circa 1,300 German marks [DM] per month for everyone. For that reason, the party wants to tax the "huge" capital and land holdings of the rich at a substantially higher rate than in the past. Following the pattern set by West European neighbors, also heirs are to share their "unearned" gain with the "poor." With these leftist redistribution maxims and its resolutions calling for a drastic reduction of working hours, the party is more radical than the SPD, and yet is not too far distant from it. At the same time, the Greens' former criticism of capitalism has become more muted. Even though they denounce the alleged failure of the market economy in the reconstruction of the east, they nevertheless want to exploit the forces of the marketplace in the ecological tax reform. Here it is even difficult to find differences from the new "ecological and social market economy" of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]. And so the controversy between the party's fundamentalists and the realists basically turned only on the question of how sharply the Alliance 90/Greens, as a left-wing party, is to distinguish itself in its election platform from what is alleged to be an SPD that has moved to the right--and how honestly one plans to say that "everything is negotiable." Despite their clear coalition statement, the Greens are under no illusions. Even though polls currently show them to be the third strongest party: Only the results of the election in the fall will show whether they can "force" the SPD to adopt a "reform policy," or whether Scharping must seek his salvation in a different, perhaps grand, coalition. For the Greens know that the SPD chairman is not exactly an enthusiastic supporter of "red-green." What Scharping would probably like most of all is to play the Greens and the FDP [Free Democratic Party] off against each other in a "traffic-light coalition." The Alliance 90/Greens is less enthralled by such a prospect. For that reason, the party is now offering its services as the best guarantee to avoid the nightmare of a grand coalition--it plans to offer itself to the voter as the "sole left-wing party." A professional campaign management team is to help the party achieve its goal, a party that is as united and motivated as never before.
