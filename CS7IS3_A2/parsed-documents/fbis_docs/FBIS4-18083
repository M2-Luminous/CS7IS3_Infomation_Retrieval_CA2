A decision as to whether there is sufficient reason for initiating investigations cannot be expected before Easter, Senior Public Prosecutor Bernhard Brenneis told DPA on Tuesday [29 March]. Before investigations are started, the European Parliament will have to lift Schoenhuber's immunity. Schoenhuber's accusation of "instigation" against Bubis has been met with dismay from all parties.
