It won 25 of the 48 state assembly seats contested to retain the reign of government in the state. It got the simple majority after the results of 44 seats were declared at 1030 PM [1430 GMT] last night. Newspapers described the PBS's victory as a slim one, as it defeated the Barisan Nasional [National Front] by only two seats. Reports from Kota Kinabalu this morning said the swearing in of the new Sabah State Government before the governor, Tun Mohamed Said Keruak, was scheduled to be held at 0830 this morning. Meanwhile, in a press conference in Kuala Lumpur this morning, Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said he has been informed that many of the PBS state assemblymen have been held in confinement for fear that they would cross over to Barisan Nasional. He said Barisan Nasional has received the messages that some PBS state assemblymen have expressed their intention to join Barisan Nasional. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said he was prepared to receive them.
