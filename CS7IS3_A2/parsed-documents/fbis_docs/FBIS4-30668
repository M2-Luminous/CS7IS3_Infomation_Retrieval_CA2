It was hoped that the results of this study would benefit the country and society in general. One of the important questions of this study was the question of how to seize the assets of wealthy state officials who have gained their wealth by defrauding the public. The money they earn from engaging in corrupt activities is considered to be dirty money that must be seized and returned to the country. The main problem is not authority to seize assets, because OCCC [Office of the Commission to Counter Corruption] laws have been promulgated. The problem is to find the location of the huge sums of money earned from engaging in corrupt activities. I think that in carrying on narcotics suppression activities, the ONCB [Office of the Narcotics Control Board] probably faces the same problem. That is, it has the authority to seize assets based on ONCB laws, but it is difficult to find out where the narcotics traffickers keep their money and how they transfer it. Those who are best informed about the movement of this cash are the banks and other financial institutions. Thus, to locate the cash earned from engaging in corruption and trafficking in narcotics, we must rely mainly on information provided by the banks and financial institutions. To achieve real results, a special law must be promulgated that will make it possible to locate this dirty money and prevent it from being transferred and laundered. To put it simply, we must prevent this money from being laundered, because it is then very difficult to prove whether the money is "clean" or "dirty" money. [passage omitted] Even though this law will be very beneficial, many people don't think that it will be possible to promulgate such a law. The powerholders in Thai society will probably oppose this and take steps to prevent this bill from being passed by the legislative council. The commercial banks, which would be required to regularly file reports, are afraid that this will increase the burden on them. Besides this, the money that once flowed into the system will flow out of the system. The foreign currency that flowed into the country will go to other countries that do not have such a law. This will put our domestic economy at a disadvantage as compared with that of neighboring countries. Some groups hold differing views. Some think that this will infringe on people's personal rights. Others think that it won't be worth the price if we allow money to flow out of the country. Others think that our monetary and banking systems are fine as they are and that it isn't necessary to promulgate a special law. While I was writing the report on the results of the study, I began to feel that getting this law passed by parliament would probably be as difficult as pushing a mortar up a hill. This is because there are very few people who support this. Many people will be adversely affected, and most of these are highly influential people who will oppose this, which is exactly what has happened in many other countries. But today, many people are interested in this and so there is hope that something can be done: 1. A way must be found to have countries throughout the world cooperate in promulgating such a law. Because the present economic situation is now an international matter, it should be easier to obtain such cooperation. 2. Fears concerning individual rights should carry little weight. Even in the United States, Professor Peter Baldwin Jr., a professor at the University of Florida and an expert on money-laundering laws, whom the OCCC invited to come give a lecture on 3 December 1993, has said that those who violate the law, particularly those who engage in corruption, have forfeited the personal rights guaranteed by the constitution. If dirty money is kept somewhere, that place must be considered dirty, too. For example, if a house is used to conceal dirty money, the state can seize that house. 3. We are in the information age. It is easy to transmit information to people everywhere. The mass media can help inform the people about the advantages and disadvantages. 4. Most members of the legislative council are concerned about the common good rather than person interests. Because money laundering is a very complex issue and affects people in many countries, unless this problem is discussed in a reasonable manner, conflicts and problems will arise. Thus, to promulgate this law, things must be done very carefully. The objectives must be very clear, and everyone must be made to understand the reasons for this. If this law is really good, it will be difficult for people to oppose it. This is a good opportunity for those who support the principles of this law to prove their case.
