(NTT) as part of economic deregulation, ministry officials said Tuesday [7 June]. KDD controls Japan's international telecommunications market while NTT handles domestic telecommunications. The NTT and KDD laws clearly define their business territories. The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry will consider removing the barrier when it conducts a complete review of NTT operations in fiscal 1995, the officials said. The review is expected to cover a possible split-up of NTT. KDD was set up in 1978 as a result of the separation and privatization of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corp.'s international division. NTT was born in 1985 when the corporation itself was privatized. If a division of NTT were allowed to enter the international telecommunications market, the effect on the structure of Japan's telecommunications market would be serious, the officials said. An advisory group for Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata earlier called for removal of the barrier between the international and domestic markets.
