About 230 enterprises are idle and 240,000 persons are out of work. This information was provided by Anatoliy Ogurtsov, chairman of the Russian Committee on Machinebuilding, at an expanded session of the collegium of this department. A report prepared for the meeting by the committee's experts notes that production volume in the sector declined by 14.9 percent compared with 1992. The cutback of a number of items was especially substantial: chiefly trucks (81 percent), bulldozers (53 percent), and mainline diesel engines (70 percent). The production of drilling rigs dropped to 45 percent and the production of mainline electric locomotives decreased to 33 percent. The chairman of Roskommash [Russian Committee on Machinebuilding] sees the establishment of financial-industrial groups as one of the ways to stabilize the sector. The committee is drafting the plans for 20 such groups. The department head believes that the government should implement a selective state policy of support and introduce protective export duties on foreign machinebuilding output.
