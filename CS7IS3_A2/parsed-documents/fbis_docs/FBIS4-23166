The proposals on the disbanding and disarming of SDUs were given to SDU representatives from nine East Rand townships at a meeting in Katlehong on Sunday [29 May]. ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Deputy Secretary Obed Bapela outlined the proposals as: - providing special catch-up schooling to SDU members between the ages of 13 and 18; - accepting those below the age of 25 as police reservists in a neighbourhood watch programme; - and integrating others into the SAPS. He said this would have to be negotiated with regional and national authorities, and that the current matric qualification for policemen would have to be addressed. "Some of the people...have got some experience of policing (by)...patrolling our streets to ensure that people sleep peacefully... "In the army, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation] (the ANC's military wing) through negotiations were able to take a lot of people without matric who have joined the national defence force. "And...we feel strongly that members of the SDUs have to play that role (in the police)." The ANC also proposed a police academy and service brigade to train and use people in areas such as electrical and civil engineering. SDU members would be debriefed to update them on recent political developments, Mr Bapela said. He said SDU representatives, who would report to the ANC on June 19 after consulting their members, had welcomed the proposals which, he said, were in line with the ANC's plans for strict gun control measures in the PWV. The disarming of SDU members, criminals and "impis [group of warriors] in hostels" would operate voluntarily and in conjunction with an amnesty, Mr Bapela said, adding that this would have to be discussed with authorities. Mr Bapela, who recently announced a "one person, one gun" policy in the PWV provincial legislature, said licences would be issued to people only on merit. People entitled to guns would include policemen, reservists, soldiers and those living or working in dangerous areas. PWV MEC [member Executive Committee] for safety and security Jessie Duarte attended the meeting, but only in her capacity as an ANC regional executive member, Mr Bapela said.
