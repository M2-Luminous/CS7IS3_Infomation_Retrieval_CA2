The provocative aerial espionage was part of their premeditated war preparations against the DPRK. Meanwhile, overseas-based pursuit-assault planes, VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] assault planes and early warning planes held a surprise bombing exercise in the skies above Yongwol, Pyongchang and Asan Bay in cooperation with scores of warplanes belonging to the U.S. Air Force present in South Korea. On the same day, a formation of Pacific-based KC-135 tankers were deployed in a U.S. Air Force base in South Korea. Facts prove the U.S. imperialists are persistently seeking confrontation and war, going against peace and detente.
