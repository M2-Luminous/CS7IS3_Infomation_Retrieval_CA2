In a short statement by the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the 49-year-old minister declared that he decided to take this step upon the advice of his doctor. Thus, he submitted a request to the chancellor requesting his discharge from the minister's office to the federal president. Ortleb informed FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel that he has also resigned from his position as FDP chairman in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. According to FDP spokesman Hans-Rolf Goebel, Kinkel took note of the two decisions with regret and respect and thanked Ortleb for the work he has performed. Kinkel expressed the hope that Ortleb will continue to make his "indispensable contribution" to completing German unity in the party's Executive Committee and the Bundestag group. In November, Ortleb was hospitalized because of a circulatory collapse and later because of pneumonia. At the beginning of January, however, he resumed his official duties. According to information received by DPA, State Secretary Fritz Schaumann of the Education Ministry (FDP/47) and FDP Deputy Chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt are considered possible successors.
