Denying reports that Japan had rejected U.S. requests for the meeting, Fujii said, "We have not received such a request yet." But he said he considered the proposed meeting "positively" and he told a press conference he wanted to "take the opportunity" to meet Bentsen, indicating that Japan may propose the meeting. Fujii declined to comment on what they might discuss, but said he is "not in the position to negotiate" for the Japan-U.S. "framework" trade talks in reference to recent U.S. demand to meet with officials who can make political decisions instead of bureaucrats. Turning to domestic issues, Fujii indicated that the government's new economic stimulus package will be launched by month-end, but hinted that an income tax cut may not be included. The compilation of the package is progressing "substantially," and the completion will not be "so far away," he said. Considering the tax issue, he said, "it's separate" from the package that is now being formed by the Economic Planning Agency because the decision is left to a joint economic problem forum of the government and the coalition parties. But Fujii noted that he wishes tax cuts to be included as an economic measure, saying "that's more favorable." Given the package, his ministry will compile a third fiscal 1993 supplementary budget along with fiscal 1994 budget, he said.
