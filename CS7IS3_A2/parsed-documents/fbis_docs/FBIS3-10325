What is the CD/FMLN/MNR [Democratic Convergence, Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, National Revolutionary Movement] economic proposal for these elections? [Zamora] There is certainly a common denominator among all candidates. I personally do not like to talk about a social market economy because the term no longer has any meaning in our country. Everybody uses it, even when referring to different aspects, such as Arena's [Nationalist Republican Alliance] proposal. For example, the German social market economy is completely different. Furthermore, this is a tautology, because the market is social. The first points in the CD/FMLN/MNR platform are based on the following concepts: First, we believe in the existence of a market. It is the most important force in the economy. Second, because the market is deaf to certain signals, we see the role of the state as supplemental. The state must create the legal framework, facilitate redistribution, and correct market irregularities. Third, our objective is to achieve self-sustained and equitable economic development based on the new actors in the economy. That is the difference between our proposal and Arena's. Their proposal calls for a concentration of efforts on strong capital under the assumption that there will be enormous growth, which will subsequently bring well-being to society. That is not what happens. The income of Salvadorans has replaced coffee as the main source of foreign exchange. For the first time in history, the main source of foreign exchange comes directly from popular sectors. Our strategy will not be based on excluding major capital but on giving priority to the new actors: cooperatives, the informal sector, and small and medium enterprises. Fourth, we link social development to economic development. We see social services -- especially health and education -- not as an expense but as an investment for economic development. Our fifth pillar is Central American integration. Arena is proposing integration strictly at the capital and technocratic level. Many plans have been formulated without consulting businessmen or other sectors. The integration we propose calls for the participation of workers, businessmen, and the state. [Reporter] You have said that you prefer not to talk about social market economy. Your plan, however, must follow a path. What path have you chosen? [Zamora] We propose a method in accordance with all these principles. It can be summarized in one expression: concerted efforts. The wisdom of economic development is not allowing the veto to begin functioning as it did in the past. Workers veto government plans and destabilize them; businessmen veto government plans -- as in President Duarte's case -- because the grass roots followed a policy of confrontation. Government policy must be the result of concerted efforts with the various sectors. [Reporter] Leftist economic ideas have always been associated with statism, with planned economies. You have said you believe in market forces. Does that mean you have given up the socialist model? [Zamora] I cannot give up something I never believed in. I never believed in that type of socialism because, in my opinion, it has never been real socialism. It was only statism and control by a single party; that was it. Do not ask me to give up something I never believed in. It would be too easy. It would be like giving up the Spanish king's treasures. Of course I would give them up because they were never mine. This is an important question because I want to make one thing clear: Our government will not be a government of our coalition. It will be a government where the CD\FMLN\MNR forces are present, but we will try to express concerted efforts. There will be no nationalizations during our term. We do not believe statization [estatizacion] should be exercised under these circumstances. We are not in favor of expropriations. In facing the problem of price controls, our position is that they can only be allowed for a limited time when special circumstances require them. We believe freezing prices is the most absurd thing in the world. We will seek a more efficient economy that is capable of both producing and allowing a better distribution of wealth, which is now very limited. [Reporter] What will be state's role be in the economy? Developing a policy of assistance? [Zamora] We disagree with a policy of assistance. The state does play an important role in the economy. It has in the past. Our country's development since the 1950's was based on the state's support for major capital. It can be seen in all our laws. Today criticizing the state is fashionable even though all the major capital was created with state support. We must determine the scope of state participation. We do not believe in an enterprise state. The state has too many problems to resolve to get involved in the hotel business or to run a textile factory. We propose a plan that will mean increasing expenses in the social area. We have clearly proposed tripling the percentage of GNP spent on education and health in the next five years. [Reporter] How do you plan to finance those social expenditures? [Zamora] First, by redistributing the budget. We cannot live with military budgets. We must transfer those funds to the social area. Second, by revising state expenses. The government spent more than 20 million colones on radio and television from October to December. I realize the state must spend money on publicity when it offers a service and must inform the people, such as the vaccination and identification card campaigns. It is not necessary, however, to spend money to say that FINATA [National Financial Institution for Agricultural Lands] is doing a good job. Third, by controlling tax evasion. The Finance Ministry has estimated it at 40 percent. We believe it is closer to 50 percent. If we manage to reduce it to at least 30 percent, we will have money for social expenses. Finally, through international aid. We do not have to sit back and watch how aid is being reduced. We must seek means of cooperation. We believe it is feasible to finance social expenses without increasing taxes. We are not in favor of increasing taxes, but we do feel they must be collected. For example, there is widespread evasion of the value-added tax. There are 706 enterprises here controlling more than 70 percent of all sales. We simply want people to comply with the law. Our view is that the central government should be reduced so local and municipal governments and associations can assume more responsibility and resources. [Reporter] In Latin America, the general practice of opposition political parties has been to change the schemes of outgoing governments and interrupt the continuity of programs. What would your coalition do with the economic plan initiated by the current government? [Zamora] The key to the country's governability during this period consists of recognizing the real relationship between continuity and change. Once the peace agreements were signed, the country began a process of national agreement. It is expressed in a reformed constitution which is the result of a consensus. Now it is not a matter of starting from scratch every five years. We must see what plans need modifications. The current government's handling of macroeconomic variables is quite healthy. Why change it? There are programs that permit participation, such as Educo, which must be developed. Of course, in other areas we will do things quite differently. The possibility of an energy policy, for example, must be considered. This government could not implement it, but it will have to be done through a national agreement. Environmental issues have been neglected. We will have to make changes there, too. Credit policy has been mainly for those with more capital. Now that we are in the electoral campaign, they are talking about credits for small enterprises. We must determine where change is necessary. We will analyze each area one by one and decide where there should be continuity, where corrections should be made, and where changes are necessary. That is our vision.
