Moltke told a seminar of French senators that the WEU's executive council could disappear, as the Maastricht Treaty in effect conferred the power of political decision-making in defence matters on the foreign ministers of the 12 member states. The WEU, considered the European pillar of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, consists of 10 members. The only two EU states that are not part of the WEU are Ireland and Denmark.
