Mass rallies were held on May 22 and 23 in North Pyongan, South Hwanghae and Kangwon Provinces and Kaesong municipality. Senior officials and representatives of workers, agricultural working people, youth and students and men of culture in the Provinces and municipality spoke at the rallies. The speakers said the Kwangju popular uprising in May 1980 was a massive armed uprising in which the entire Kwangju citizens turned out and made a decisive resistance to the fascist violence in order to terminate the colonial domination of the U.S. imperialists and the military fascist rule and to achieve democratisation of the South Korean society and the reunification of the country, and a just anti-U.S., anti-fascist democratic resistance. The desire of the valiant Kwangju resistance fighters for independence and democratisation of the South Korean society still has not been realized owing to the colonial enslavement policy of the U.S. imperialists, they noted. They stressed that in order to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime and realize the desire of the martyrs of Kwangju, the South Korean students and people should wage vigorous mass struggles in all places to scrap such fascist laws as the "National Security Law", dissolve all the repressive machines and establish a true democratic government. They stressed the need for the people of all segments of South Korea to turn out to check and frustrate the colonial domination and interference of the United States and get the U.S. Forces and nuclear weapons withdrawn from South Korea.
