This is according to an Israeli source speaking to reporters in the U.S. capital yesterday. Talks with Palestinians will not resume until the Taba talks are concluded, the source said. Jordan's King Husayn is to meet with President Bill Clinton next week, a meeting considered no less important than Clinton's upcoming summit with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, said the Israeli source. The Israeli source in Washington says that Israel will not be satisfied with slogans on peace from Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad when he meets U.S. President Clinton in Geneva. The source told Qol Yisra'el Jerusalem expects concrete steps, in particular on the issue of security arrangements. Intelligence sources here in Israel believe the Syrians, for their part, have high hopes in advance of the summit. They say President al-Asad's entourage will include some 100 people, as compared to smaller teams that accompanied him when he met in the past with U.S. Presidents Bush and Carter.
