In particular, it is being stressed that the supposed "internationalist" inspiration of Italian policy -- in Somalia, in Mozambique, in support of the sanctions in Yugoslavia, in backing Yeltsin's reform policy, in the development of a common foreign policy at the European level, and in the GATT negotiations -- neglects "national interests." According to these interpretations, Italy's busy activity within the international bodies is a way of evading decisions on points of position and emphasis -- for instance, between a "Mediterranean," rather than "European," role. These criticisms are based on an anachronistic vision of foreign policy, are groundless, and, if supported, would prove counterproductive. Italy does not have to choose between a Mediterranean and a European policy because there is no inconsistency between them. Indeed, we are important actors in the Mediterranean precisely because we are a European power and, vice versa, we are heeded in Europe partly by virtue of our special sensitivity to the problems of the South of the Old Continent. Whenever in the past our foreign policy was unbalanced, the consequences were serious. Whenever we tried to become the foremost Mediterranean power we became, by the same token, the last of the European powers. Whenever we adopted aggressive and unilateral policies in the Mediterranean and Africa -- as with Crispi and Mussolini after 1934 -- we were left so isolated in Europe as to be forced into alliances that were contrary to our own interests. Italy is a country that is now a full and fully qualified part of the West, so there is no reason to adopt any eccentric or unnatural forms of behavior. Furthermore, even though, because of our geographical position, we are exposed particularly to the instabilities caused by the end of the Cold War, we certainly do not have the resources -- economic, military, or in terms of public support -- to tackle these problems on our own or in a unilateral manner. Rather, our main objectives are to strengthen collective instruments such as NATO, the European Union, the CSCE, and the United Nations. They have the legitimacy and the capability to prevent crises from degenerating and to enhance our credibility and assert our viewpoint more strongly. This means taking part reliably in these organizations' operations and development, rather than allowing ourselves to become marginalized by supposed selfish interests. In any case, the very development of military technologies has made peace indivisible. Moreover, the very concept that Italian foreign policy is allegedly neglecting the national interest is without substance. It is surprising that this argument is being used by circles that are very critical of the Catholic vision of the common good. Indeed, there is no one nation personified in a single and consistent interest, as perhaps there was in the courts of dictatorial regimes, in which context, indeed the very concept, of the national interest was formulated. In the modern world, however, the states and the complex societies that make them up have many varied, sometimes partial and conflicting interests. Some of the analysts with whom I have met to discuss the former Yugoslavia readily cite national interest and accuse the Foreign Ministry of aligning too much with European positions. Beyond this, they sometimes seem divided between a pro-Serbian and a pro-Croatian conception of the national interest. Apart from ignoring the principle aspects of the matter, which are what specifically prompted us to support the Bosnians, these analyses therefore conceal personal sympathies and allegiances beneath the cloak and the powerful rhetoric of the national interest. Perhaps it would be wiser to talk about general interests -- that is, interests that are the outcome of a great number of particular interests of individuals, regions, or economic groups that are themselves mutually conflicting -- without lapsing into the naivete of the existence of uniform national interests or the hypocrisy of portraying particular interests or opinions as the interests of all. Yet, again, our conscience forces us to mistrust these ideological pseudoconcepts. The skill of politics lies precisely in bringing together and moderating these differing interests. This does not mean that Italy does not have a clearly defined path ahead of it. The "recent internationalist swing" has already set our country on this path. Indeed, we must help create the international conditions for our country's development, the very conditions that have for the past 40 years guaranteed the modernization of civil society and the growth of prosperity. This progress is bound to a liberal and universal vision of international trade, keeping in mind that one-half Italy's exports go to countries outside Europe and 90 percent of those are outside the Mediterranean. Hence the change of approach that I introduced in the GATT negotiations, in the final months of which we were determinedly in favor of concluding the Uruguay Round and opposed to any parochial defense of supposed inalienable European interests. This progress can also be achieved by strengthening our country's attachment to the architectures of the community of nations -- the only structures that can mobilize sufficient resources to guarantee a secure international environment and a transition to prosperity and peace for the areas of crisis. Not only will this permit us to avoid the costs that insecurity entails, but it will create new markets for our products. Indeed, the rationale of geoeconomics, albeit competitive, is different from the conflictual rationale of geopolitcs, because the "cake" to be shared out is growing all the time. Quite the opposite, therefore, of the unilateralist implications of those who cite "national interests."
