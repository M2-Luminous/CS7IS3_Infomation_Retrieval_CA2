They believe bureaucrats in Brussels are more accessible and sympathetic than their own Government. Frustrated by the way in which government departments delay or refuse to support pet schemes, the regions are increasingly pleading their case directly with the European Commission instead of waiting for what they regard as half-hearted help by Whitehall. Regional power has been recognised and strengthened by the Maastricht Treaty which set up a Committee of the Regions with the duty to advise and consult the Commission. The first meeting takes place next month and many of the 24 British representatives joined a Commission conference in Lincolnshire last week to discuss tactics and hear complaints from local organisations about central government. Philip Jagger, of the TUC's [Trade Union Congress] Yorkshire regional council, summed up feelings. "We can hardly find anyone in Government to listen to us in London these days but in Brussels they are always prepared to give us time and help," he said. William Newton Dunn, Conservative MEP [Member of the European Parliament] for Lincolnshire, agreed. "If you put things through the British Government then you will often find it sells you down the river," he said. "They do their best to balance things but they are more concerned about achieving something else." Scotland and Wales, with their clear regional identities, have led the way in Brussels where the "Tartan Mafia" and the "Taffia" [Welsh mafia] are recognised within the Commission. They have their own offices in Brussels and their example has been followed in England by the North West, the West Midlands and Kent. Britain's nine other regions, designated after the Maastricht Treaty, are being actively encouraged to set up their own Brussels operations. Treasury sources at the conference urged delegates to learn quickly how to pull their weight. With Britain a net contributor of 2 billion pounds a year to the Community budget, the Treasury does not want to waste any chance of "getting our money back." "This is subsidiarity in action," one official said. In the short term these offices are likely to be more effective than the Council of the Regions, which has no powers yet and only a tiny budget. However, local authority representatives at the conference were determined that it must quickly win influence and power in Brussels to fight for their interests. "Whitehall seems happy for Europe to deal with the regional management of wildfowl but then it wants to do everything else itself," Tony Davies, of Yorkshire and Humberside regional association, said. Britain nevertheless is lagging behind much of the Community in regional lobbying. Each German state has a Brussels office which operates almost like a national representative, lobbying for local interests, winning contracts for local firms and claiming every scrap of Community aid available. England's lack of clear regions has made it more difficult to organise. A Foreign Office source assured delegates that the Government had "an underlying commitment and excitement about Europe." But he gave a warning against too much expectation and enthusiasm for the next moves towards European integration.
