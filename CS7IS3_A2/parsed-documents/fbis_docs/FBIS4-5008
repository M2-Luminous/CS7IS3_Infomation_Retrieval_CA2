As a first salvo in operating its surveillance operations, the MOF summoned department heads in charge of underwriting services at Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi and initiated a hearing on activities of bank-affiliated securities firms and their overseas subsidiaries and will seek the views of Nomura Securities within the week. MOF has revealed that it will appoint officials in the early part of this month who will be responsible for checking on the adequacy of measures being used to prevent abuses from taking place between banks' securities subsidiaries and their parent banks. The foremost purpose of the new system is to uncover violations of Section 65 of the Securities Transaction Law which prohibits the performance of securities businesses on the part of banks, but it is said that the MOF is interested in whether or not prices which favor businesses were established in the process of issuing new bonds. Officials of the General Affairs Section Securities Bureau who are commonly referred to as "watchmen" say, "Before officially approving securities subsidiaries of city banks, we will gather information on the involvement of parent banks in the operation of overseas securities subsidiaries."
