The unification has provided a warranty for overseas businesses in China such as Du Pont, according to Liu. Last year, the rising market foreign exchange rate left the prices of his company's raw material imports increasing greatly and production costs going up apace, which affected the firm's profits. Now, he said, the unified exchange rate assured the normal production and import and export business of the foreign-funded companies in China. The reform of the management system of foreign exchange is one aspect of China's reform package this year. Since the reforms, covering the fields of foreign exchange, taxation, finance, state planning, investment and foreign trade, will have a great impact on foreign-funded companies and banks in China, all foreign entrepreneurs and bankers attach great importance to their implementation. With this in mind, XINHUA reporters arranged interviews with chief representatives of the Beijing offices of 20 foreign companies and banks, as well as foreign managers of foreign-funded enterprises. During the interviews, they all agreed that the reform is one of the most decisive steps China has taken in adjusting its economy to conform to international economic norms. The reform will attract more foreign capital into China, they say. Klaus Kaltenthaler, chief representative of Germany's BASF Chemical Corporation's Beijing office, said that in order to develop a market economy connected with the world economy as a whole, China must establish economic structures similar to well-accepted models in most parts of the world. The success of the reform will give China more opportunities to conduct economic cooperation with foreign countries, he said. Sander Tideman, chief representative of the Netherlands' Abn-Amro Bank Beijing office, said that the reforms, especially those on the management system of foreign exchange and taxation system, were "far-reaching" in importance. "Although some foreigners will adopt a `wait and see' attitude toward the complicated reforms, the majority of investors felt encouraged and more confident in investing in China," he added. Touching on the reform of China's foreign exchange system, the chief representative of the Beijing office of the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, Takeshi Kagami, said that it is more convenient for his business after the unification of China's dual-track foreign exchange rates. "It is very difficult to explain the dual-track exchange rates to our associates, while things have become easy and clear now," said the banker. The overseas businessmen all believed that dual-track exchange rates were confusing and imposed disadvantages on their interests in China. When talking about reform of the taxation system, U. Buchmann, chief representative of the Beijing office of the Swiss Credit Bank, said that a healthy taxation system can ensure a country's revenue and the smooth development of the country's economy. For instance, China needs a huge amount of capital to develop its infrastructure and social insurance system. Since the beginning of this year, China started to levy value-added tax, consumption tax and business tax from overseas businesses in China, instead of the former consolidated industrial and commercial tax, and this will create a fair taxation environment for overseas business people. Evan Papadopoulos, general manager of the Beijing Concord Store, expressed his satisfaction with the tax reform, noting that the reform enables China's taxation system to come nearer to international practice, without putting much burden on retail companies. These business people stated their understanding of some problems in the process of such reforms, saying that the reforms will be successful as long as the Chinese Government pays attention to the problems and resolves them well.
