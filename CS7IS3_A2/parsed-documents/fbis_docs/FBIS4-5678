The panel, headed by Tadao Ichikawa, former president of Keio University, will file a report on its work in six months, they said. The government will submit a bill based on the panel's report and the Diet is expected to enact the bill in an extraordinary session this fall, the officials said. The launching of the council followed the enactment earlier this year of a package of political reform bills which introduce single- seat constituencies for lower house general elections. Under the package, 300 of the 500 lower house members will be elected from single-seat districts and the remaining 200 through proportional representation. The current 511-seat House of Representatives was elected last July from constituencies with the number of seats ranging from two to six each.
