This is stipulated in a resolution signed by Saparmurad Niyazov on 13 May. The privatization of trade outlets will be carried out through auctions, tenders, and sales. Retail trade outlets selling consumer goods will be privatized in the first instance. The authorities in the capital and oblasts have been given personal responsibility to ensure that newly privatized outlets function effectively, while staying in the same line of business. Small industrial enterprises employing up to 100 people will be bought by members of working collectives, and will also be sold to citizens of Turkmenistan and foreigners. Private individuals and foreign firms will have to take part in investment tenders and later ensure their own supplies of raw materials. Enterprises employing more than 100 people will be transformed into joint-stock companies with the controlling packet of shares being retained by the government. The president's resolution envisages subsidies for working collectives during the destatification of their enterprises. In particular, employees will receive some shares free of charge, while state property will be sold to them with a 25 percent price reduction with up to one year credit facility. Income gained from privatization will be channelled to the central government budget.
