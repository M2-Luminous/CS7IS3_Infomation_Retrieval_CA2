The Foreign Ministry of this ex-Soviet republic accused the command of the 14th Russian Army deployed in the Moldovan breakaway Dniester Province of "crude interference into the affairs of the republic" and said in a statement issued on Friday the Russian Army was "the main destabilising factor in the Dniester region". However, ealier this week, the Russian Army Command warned all sides against "the illusion that the conflict can be solved by force". It did say though that it would not stand on the sidelines if anything untowards happened and promised that "the organizers of armed provocations from either bank (of the Dniester River) will get severe punishment for any attempt to unleash a new conflict". The Foreign Ministry said that such statements "undermine bilateral negotiations on the future of the 14th Army" and reiterated that the Moldovan leadership "insists on an unconditional pullout of the army". The statement then switched away from the Russian Army and blasted the leadership of the Dniester region for "blocking any constructive effort of Kishinev aiming to ensure peace in the region" and for not allowing the area residents to participate in Moldova's parliamentary elections scheduled for February 27. The tone for the criticism must have been set by Moldovan Presdient Mircea Snegur, who, still earlier in the week, accused Tiraspol, the Dniester area administrative centre, of attempting to further aggravate the social and political situation in the republic. The situation is evidently hotting up in the Dniester Province. Already on Wednesday, the parliament of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic responded to verbal attacks by calling on the United Nations, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the heads of the CIS states to send observers for "the objective assessment of the situation". "The presence of international observers may prevent an economic siege and a new military conflict in the region", the appeal of the Dniester parliament said. The call was prompted by the sense of an impending strike. "A single act of provocation will be enough to have a military conflict unleashed", Valeriy Prudnikov, chief of police in the Dniester town of Bendery told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. To complicate the matter, the Russian Army and the Dniester area are not the only pains in the back for Kishinev. The leaders of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic in southern Moldova poured oil in the fire by insisting that the 14th Russian Army deployed in the former Soviet republic must be granted the status of a peace-keeping force. This will prevent Kishinev's possible attempts at solving by force the problem of Moldova's two provinces - Dniester and Gagauz, said a statement signed by Gagauz leaders. Rather mollifying sounded the Friday statement of a CSCE official Slavomir Dabrova, a Pole working for the CSCE mission in Moldova. He predicted there would be no new military conflicts since "the 1992 conflict with no winner was a good lesson for politicians in Kishinev and Tiraspol". "However, it is still a long way to the complete settlement of the Moldovan conflicts, and international organisations should work hard to untie this knot", he added.
