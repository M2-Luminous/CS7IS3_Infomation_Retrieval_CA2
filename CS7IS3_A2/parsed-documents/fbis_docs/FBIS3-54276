Koirala and Azuma also discussed Japan's Asia-Pacific regional policy, the source added. The vice minister, who arrived here early Thursday, signed two separate agreements to assist in improving facilities at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport and the construction of the Tripureswore-Bagmati bridge. The existing bridge was built with help from India, but has been weakened by heavy traffic. The Japanese official also had an audience with King Birendra late Thursday at the royal palace. A Japanese Embassy spokesman said the main purpose of Azuma's visit was to promote goodwill and mutual understanding and strengthen relations between the two countries. Azuma is scheduled to leave Friday after attending the inauguration of another bridge here, which Japan also assisted in building. He is to make stops in India and Pakistan at the weekend before returning to Japan.
