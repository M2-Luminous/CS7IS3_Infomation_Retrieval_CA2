This is what he said in an ITAR-TASS interview after the ceremony of an official meeting of Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton. "All versions have already been discussed," Chernomyrdin said. He made it clear, however, that a final decision on the candidatures would be taken after the steering bodies of the Federal Assembly are formed. "I am very much worried about the formation of the steering bodies of the State Duma," he added. Responding to the ITAR-TASS supposition that Oleg Soskovets and Yegor Gaydar will be appointed first deputy prime ministers, and Yuriy Yarov and Aleksandr Zaveryukha -- deputy prime ministers, Chernomyrdin said: "You are almost right." The prime minister commented angrily on the open letter, sent by leaders of the Democratic Russia Movement Gleb Yakunin and Lev Ponomarev to President Yeltsin on Wednesday. They opposed the appointment of Aleksandr Zaveryukha to the post of deputy prime minister. "It is not these people who will determine the government make-up," he said. According to Chernomyrdin, professionalism and personal business qualities were the main criteria for choosing candidates to the top posts in the government. "The most important thing is that people working in the government should share our ideas and realise the depth of the processes taking place in the country... The government is formed not for the purpose of meeting the requirements of certain individuals, but for fulfilling specific tasks," Chernomyrdin said.
