"Criminal sanctions must be imposed on those who commit intellectual property right offences to safeguard the integrity of ideas and the dignity of law," he told the International Symposium on Intellectual Property Protection. Currently only civil procedures are available for copyright infringements. Criminal sanctions are reserved for trademark violators. Chinese lawmakers are also pushing through legislation on border controls where intellectual property rights are violated, according to Xiao. "Customs will play a bigger role in intellectual property protection through prohibiting import and export of the relevant commodities," he said. The government moves will guarantee implementation of the National Commitments outlined by the Paris Convention on Protection of Industrial Intellectual Property and the Berne Convention on Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, Xiao said. Patent protection has been extended to cover chemicals, medicines, food, beverages and condiments in China. And company logos now enjoy the protection previously offered trademarks. Lawmakers are still debating how best to legislate for biological patents. But the government has promised to write flora and fauna into the law within two or three years, according to Ma Lianyuan, vice director of the State Patent Office. The moves are an important step in China's efforts to internationalize its patent system. Ma said. Liu Jiyang, chief secretary of the China Intellectual Property Society, revealed that the National People's Congress was considering legislating against compact disc piracy and trademark counterfeiting. Calling the country's trademark protection "comprehensive and effective," Li Bida, Vice Director of the Trademark Bureau under the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), urged foreign trademark owners to learn more about Chinese laws to avoid wasting time. Ignorance of the law can unnecessarily prolong the suffering of foreigners, when they find their trademarks have been abused and they want help from the Chinese authorities, he said. Foreign trademark owners should go to SAIC authorized departments to file their complaints, he said. He also advised foreigners to pay more attention to the "roots" of trademark infringements. "Although some offences take place in China, they do not necessarily originate here," he pointed out. "Trademark owners should track down the culprits by following the clues to find out those behind the scenes." Many cases of foreign trademark infringement are actually committed by foreigners, he asserted. "Protection of registered trademarks is an international problem it demands common action by the world as a whole," he said. "Mutual reproach is of no benefit." The two-day international symposium attracted 130 experts, lawyers and business people from China Australia, Britain, France, Germany Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Thailand and the United States, as well as from Hong Kong and Taiwan.
