FR940304-1-00061 FR940304-1-00012 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC35 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Withdrawal of the Proposal To Determine the Hawaiian Plant Hesperocnide Sandwicensis an Endangered Species AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule; withdrawal. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) withdraws the proposal to list Hesperocnide sandwicensis (no common name), a plant endemic to the island of Hawaii, Hawaiian Islands, as an endangered species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, as amended (Act). Additional field surveys have provided new information revealing that the species has a wider distribution than previously known. The Service has considered the additional information and determined that this species is not likely to become either endangered or threatened throughout all or a significant portion of its range in the foreseeable future, and it does not qualify for listing under the Act. ADDRESSES: The complete file for this rule is available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Pacific Islands Office, 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, room 6307, P.O. Box 50167, Honolulu, Hawaii 96850. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert P. Smith, at the above address (808/541&hyph;2749). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 17, 1992, the Service published in the Federal Register (57 FR 59951) a proposal to list 22 plant taxa from the island of Hawaii as endangered or threatened. Hesperocnide sandwicensis was included in this proposal. During the comment period on the proposal, additional information was received regarding Hesperocnide sandwicensis indicating that individuals are more numerous than previously believed (possibly over 1 million) and they face few serious threats. The Service has considered the new information and determined that the species does not warrant listing under the Act. A final rule listing the other 21 plant taxa included in the proposal is published in the Federal Register concurrently with this notice of withdrawal of Hesperocnide sandwicensis . The final rule contains more detailed information about the status of Hesperocnide sandwicensis .
