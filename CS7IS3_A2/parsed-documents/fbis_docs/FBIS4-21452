A representative of the Primorye administration announced last Thursday that liquid radioactive waste might be dumped into the sea, given the critical condition of the TNT-5 and TNT-27 storage ships. To quote Shapovalenko, a mobile rectification system with a handling capacity of 0.5 cubic meters per hour is to be built in the Far East. After such a system is put into operation, a stationary facility with a handling capacity of 2.5 cubic meters per hour will be built. Besides that, an enterprise manufacturing sorbents is to be built in the Far East. Shapovalenko also said that 114 billion rubles will have to be spent on solving the problem of liquid radioactive wastes in the Primorye Territory. However, the government has not allocated anything to it so far. The know-how which has been proposed by Japan and which the local administration would like to have consumes almost 100 times more energy and will require an investment of about $50 million, said Shapovalenko. The Maritime Territory is experiencing a dire shortage of energy. Meanwhile, if the Japanese project is accepted, a thermal electric power plant costing nearly as much as the entire rectification facility, will have to be built. Moreover, Russia will be entirely dependent on the Japanese suppliers. According to the State Atomic Inspection Committee, the condition of the TNT-5 ship, built back in 1960, is particularly serious. This tanker was to be written off in 1992, but to this day it stores 400 cubic meters of low-level liquid radioactive wastes. ``It may sink any moment right at the moorage,'' said Shapovalov.
