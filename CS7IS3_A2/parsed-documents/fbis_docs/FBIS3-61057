Super-secret details of the operation were cited. Let's turn to those articles and reports. THE WASHINGTON POST, March 20, 1975 "The wreckage of a Soviet submarine that sank in the Pacific Ocean has been detected on the ocean bottom. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency salvaged one third of the submarine in the summer of 1974. A ship with drilling equipment that was built by Billionaire Howard Hughes was used to do that." DPA Agency, March 21 1975 "The U.S. CIA discovered two torpedoes with nuclear warheads on board the Soviet submarine that sank in 1968. `Remarkable material' was obtained as a result of operations conducted to salvage the submarine. Both torpedoes were raised to the surface and were loaded into a specially equipped barge to conceal it from foreign ships. The operation that was undertaken to salvage the submarine will be continued in the future. If it is successfully completed, the CIA will have all of the codes, ciphers and diagrams of submarine command and control machines." And everything began with a tragedy. "Your Son Has Been Declared Dead..." On February 24, 1968, the submarine with conning tower number 574 went out on combat patrol from the Mogila basing facility on Kamchatka. It was a diesel with three underwater-launch ballistic missiles with high-power nuclear warheads and also with two nuclear torpedoes. Captain 1st Rank Vladimir Kobzar, whom the command authorities characterized as an experienced, competent and strong-willed submariner, commanded the submarine. For 12 days, the crew carried out the assigned missions of undetected patrolling (the submarine planned to return to base on 5 May 1968) but it did not establish communications on March 8. On that day, PL-574 should have transmitted a radio test message -- a short signal, but... Retired Rear Admiral Viktor Dygalo, who in 1968 commanded the large unit to which PL-574 was assigned, recalls what happened: "In accordance with the combat order, Vladimir Kobzar regularly sent reports to headquarters on the course of the cruise. But on March 8 we were all alarmed -- the submarine did not respond to the radio test message that was transmitted by Pacific Ocean Fleet Headquarters as a communications check. Indeed, this did not provide grounds to suggest a tragic outcome of the cruise -- rarely did those kinds of reasons prevent a commander from establishing communications. "But the message did not arrive. This was serious grounds for alarm. All the more so that, according to intelligence information, the American submarine Swordfish, which had sustained damage, had arrived at the Japanese port of Yokosuka at approximately the same time. During this submarine's entry into Yokosuka, the Americans had taken unusual security measures and only American personnel were involved with the repair work. The thought arose about a collision underwater. We began to urgently prepare a search and rescue operation. "Aircraft, surface combatants and auxiliary ships were sent out into the ocean. The depth in the search area was 5,000-6,000 meters and the distance from Kamchatka was approximately 1,230 miles. However, a two-month search in the area where we assumed the submarine could have sunk ended unsuccessfully. An analysis of the oil spot that was found indicated that it was solar oil and diesel oil. Consequently, the submarine had sunk." Several versions on the loss of PL-574 were advanced and exist until the present time. The most well-founded version is the one that Admiral Viktor Dygalo has described. The American nuclear submarine Swordfish, which was tracking PL-574, had unintentionally rammed it. At the time of the collision, PL-574 was traveling at periscope depth in the "diesel operations underwater mode," under RDP as the experts say it, and was "deaf" due to the diesel's noise. Swordfish maneuvered to a close distance and presumably struck the upper portion of PL-574's conning tower when PL-574 was turning to a new course. PL-574, with a flooded central compartment, went to the bottom. PL-574 took the lives of 98 Soviet seamen to the ocean depths. Moscow was silent about the catastrophe. Killed in action notices were sent to the relatives which stated: "Your son, husband, or father has been declared dead..." They were silent about the catastrophe. Nevertheless, the United States had learned about it, and not only about the fact itself, but about the precise location of the submarine's loss. They had photographed the sunken submarine. The photographs showed: The submarine was lying on the ground on an even keel and practically without a list. The Americans had a real opportunity to obtain many of the Soviet Navy's secrets -- the United States Navy's primary enemy at sea. The cipher machine was of special interest. U.S. intelligence personnel almost always experienced difficulties with Soviet codes and even a seven-year-old machine could be utilized to decipher thousands of Soviet messages that had been transmitted when the Cold War was in full swing in the 1960's. Project "Jennifer" Practical realization of the idea to salvage the lost Soviet submarine took the form of a CIA operation code named "Project Jennifer" which was frequently designated "Project J" at the CIA. The operation began to be conducted at the beginning of the 1970's with the full support of President Richard Nixon and was a deep secret. Billionaire Howard Hughes, owner of airlines, electronics companies, and oil drilling enterprises, was assigned an important role. He partially financed the operation. The technical executors designed two special ships to raise PL-574: The Glomar-Explorer ship-platform and the N V-1 pontoon-floating dock. A characteristic detail: Even during the final assembly of the ships, the engineers-builders could not understand their function. In October 1970, Soviet intelligence in the United States managed to establish that the U.S. intelligence services had taken steps to look for the sunken Soviet submarine and had sent a special ship to the area where the submarine had been lost. A Secret Ship Surveillance established that the ship had dropped anchor and had lowered pipes to a depth of approximately 5,000 meters. The ship, which was being painstakingly observed by Soviet seamen, belonged to the firm Glomar and was one of its nine specialized ships that were designed to drill shelves in coastal areas of the World Ocean. It had been leased by the CIA for decoy maneuvering and the firm's managers and crew did not have any idea about the true nature of Operation Jennifer. Direct implementation of Project Jennifer began later. The Glomar Explorer left the shipyard in July 1973 for ocean tests. It was sighted off the coast of Nicaragua, where it was assumed Howard Hughes lived at that time, in the autumn of that same year. Opinions were expressed in the Western press that the "secret ship" was conducting a search for manganese at depths from 10,000 to 16,000 feet. And already in the summer of 1974 the ship was sighted near the Hawaiian Islands in the area where the Soviet submarine had been lost. The "secret ship's" crew totaled 170 people. All crew members were CIA employees-contractors. In June 1974, the crew of the Glomar Explorer undertook the first attempt to raise the Soviet submarine. This was witnessed by crew members of a Soviet intelligence ship. The "Chazhma" ship measurement system was sent to the Hawaiian Islands at the beginning of March 1975. It shadowed the Explorer for a week. According to the commander's report, the ship was screwing and threading pipes. The fleet intelligence directorate obtained authorization from the fleet commander to send the MV-136 Ocean Rescue Tug with a surveillance team from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy to organize uninterrupted shadowing of the "secret ship". They "observed" the Explorer for ten days -- as before, it was involved with "screwing pipes". And suddenly... A sensational explosion in the foreign press: "The U.S. CIA had raised a sunken Soviet submarine from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean". Using the pipes that had been extended to a length of five kilometers, the dock-pontoon with claw-shaped underwater gripping devices was dropped to the very bottom of the ocean. The television cameras that had been installed on it permitted the operators to see in detail everything that was occurring in the ocean's depths. Soon the most important moment arrived for the specialists -- the seizure of the Soviet submarine. It occurred successfully. The salvage began, but... When the dock-pontoon had completed 99% of the journey, the submarine broke into two parts at the point of the puncture. The stern section slipped out of the gripping devices and rushed to the bottom of the ocean with the bodies of the majority of those who had perished and with the ballistic missiles. The missiles with the nuclear warheads floated away from the CIA, however. On that day the agency's experts considered the goal to be half-attained. In their hands was the first compartment with the torpedoes and the second, commander's compartment with the cipher room. The Explorer and the dock-pontoon left the area and headed for Honolulu. They planned to raise the stern section with the missile compartment later. Near Honolulu, in a range that had been closed to ship navigation, the deceased seamen, who had not been affected by decay for seven years --there is no oxygen at great depths -- were extracted from the nose section of the submarine. As the Project Jennifer plan had stipulated, the submariners from PL-574 were reburied in the ocean according to the ritual that was accepted in the Soviet Navy. They delivered the hull of the submarine, from which the dead had been removed, to carefully guarded Redwood City Bay (near San Francisco). The two nuclear torpedoes, surviving documents and other equipment were extracted from it there. The American press reported that the submarine's design features were painstakingly studied and were assessed as "quite interesting". The Kremlin and White House Were Silent However, the U.S. intelligence service's primary goal was not achieved --there were no ciphers. That's how it turned out. Let's turn once again to the recollections of Retired Rear Admiral Anatoliy Shtyrov: The reason was unexpected both for the Americans and for us too: During plant repair and modernization at Dalzavod (Vladivostok) in 1967, PL-574 Commander Vladimir Kobzar "displayed rational initiative" -- for the appropriate "reward", more precisely, for spirits and an awl, as they say it in the navy -- and transferred the organic cipher room from the second to the fourth compartment, having thereby widened his commander's cabin. The press prevented the future continuation of the operation. The CIA couldn't keep the operation secret. A curious incident prevented that. A band of gangsters from Los Angeles learned that there were documents in the office of Billionaire Howard Hughes, the possession of which would yield millions of dollars. The police recorded the raid on the office. A sea of reporters arrived with the police. One of the documents ultimately ended up in the press. The White House and the Kremlin simply did not react to the reports about the Soviet submarine for a long time. The White House's silence was understandable. The attempt to salvage the Soviet submarine would have involved consequences similar to those that had occurred during the incident with the U-2 aircraft piloted by Powers. As for the Kremlin, the Soviet government never publicly reported the submarine's loss. In fulfillment of a CPSU Central Committee decree, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy issued an order: Ships would conduct combat alert duty in the area of the loss of PL-574 and would prevent salvaging of its remaining portion from the bottom of the ocean, even if they had to bomb the area. That type of combat alert duty was conducted for six months. The measures undertaken played their role. To avoid complicating relations with Moscow, Washington rejected further submarine salvage operations and the appropriate instructions were issued to the CIA leadership. Operation Project Jennifer, an operation which still has many secrets, came to an end.
