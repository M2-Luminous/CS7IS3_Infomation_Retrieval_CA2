FR940628-2-00138 FR940628-2-00097 (5) Confidentiality of records for family violence services. Section 832(e) of NAHA requires each recipient to certify that it will develop and implement procedures to ensure the confidentiality of records pertaining to any individual provided family violence prevention or treatment services with ESG Program assistance. In addition, the address or location of any ESG-assisted housing used as a family violence shelter may not be made public without the written authorization of persons responsible for the operation of the shelter. This new certification is included in the application kit, as provided in Section III of this NOFA. (6) Establishes habitability standards. Section 832(g) of NAHA requires the Secretary to prescribe the minimum standards of habitability appropriate to ensure that emergency shelters assisted by this program are environments that provide appropriate privacy, safety, and sanitary and other health-related conditions for homeless persons and families. A description of the Minimum Habitability Standards and the required certification is included in the application kit, as provided in Section III of this NOFA. The Habitability Standards that have been developed under section 832(g) of NAHA to apply to emergency shelters are as follows: (a) Structure and materials. The shelter shall be structurally sound so as not to pose any threat to the health and safety of the occupants and so as to protect the occupants from the environment. (b) Access. The shelter shall be accessible and capable of being utilized without unauthorized use of other private properties. The building shall provide an alternate means of egress in case of fire. (c) Space and security. Each occupant shall be afforded adequate space and security for the occupant's person and belongings. Each occupant shall be provided an acceptable place to sleep. (d) Interior air quality. Every room or space shall be provided with natural or mechanical ventilation. The shelter shall be free of pollutants in the air at levels that threaten the health of the occupants. (e) Water supply. The water supply shall be free from contamination at levels that threaten the health of the recipients. (f) Sanitary facilities. Shelter occupants shall have access to sanitary facilities that are in proper operating condition, can be used in privacy, and are adequate for personal cleanliness and the disposal of human waste. (g) Thermal environment. The shelter shall have adequate heating and cooling facilities in proper operating condition. (h) Illumination and electricity. The shelter shall have adequate natural or artificial illumination to permit normal indoor activities and to support the health and safety of occupants. Sufficient electrical sources shall be provided to permit use of essential electrical appliances while assuring safety from fire. (i) Food preparation and refuse disposal. All food preparation areas shall contain suitable space and equipment to store, prepare, and serve food in a sanitary manner. (j) Sanitary condition. The shelter and its equipment shall be maintained in sanitary condition. Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 Amendments: The 1992 Act changes are described in the following Sections I.B (7)&hyph;(9) of this NOFA. (7) Certification of involvement of homeless individuals and families. The recipient must certify that, to the maximum extent practicable, it will involve homeless individuals and families, through employment, volunteer services, or otherwise, in providing services and in constructing, renovating, maintaining, and operating facilities, where assistance is provided for those activities under the program. (8) Termination of assistance. The recipient may terminate assistance provided to an individual or a family only in accordance with a formal process established by the recipient that recognizes the rights of the individuals affected, which may include a hearing. (9) Eligibility of staff costs. Staff costs relating to the operation of emergency shelters are specifically recognized as an eligible activity, but not more than 10 percent of the amount of any grant may be used for these costs. C. CHAS and NEPA Requirements (1) Indian tribes are not included in NAHA's definition of ``jurisdiction'', the entity charged with submitting a Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) under section 105 of NAHA. Therefore, Indian tribes are not required to submit a CHAS. Furthermore, Indian tribes will not be required to certify to consistency with the State's CHAS to receive ESG funding. The Department reiterates its position stated in adopting the CHAS Interim Rule (56 FR 4484, February 4, 1991) that, given the sovereign status of Indian tribes, a State cannot be deemed the appropriate jurisdiction to apply its housing strategy to programs administered by Indian tribes (see 56 FR 4481&hyph;82). (2) The assumption of environmental responsibilities specified in section 104(g)(1) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 was authorized for certain recipients of assistance under the McKinney Act, pursuant to section 443 of the McKinney Act. Assumption of the responsibilities for the ESG program is set forth in 24 CFR 576.52, and shall apply to Indian tribes in the same manner as described for a unit of general local government or territory. When the tribe does not have the legal capacity to assume the environmental responsibility (see 24 CFR 58.11), the appropriate HUD Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) Field Office will conduct the environmental review. D. Allocation Amounts This notice announces the availability of a total of $1,469,000 in funding provided by the Department's appropriations acts for fiscal year 1994 and unused funds from fiscal year 1993 for competitive grants to Indian tribes for emergency shelter grants. Indian Program Office set-aside allocations of the total amount are detailed in the following chart:
