I. Introduction The Commission today is adopting several amendments that will extend financial statement accommodations available to foreign issuers to filings by domestic issuers that are required to include financial statements of foreign equity investees or acquired foreign business. 19 The accommodations relate to the age of financial statements 20 and the reconciliation of financial statements to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP'') for those foreign entities. 21 In addition, the adopted amendments revise the tests of significance for determining whether financial statements of an equity investee must be provided. The amendments also eliminate certain supplemental financial schedules that were eliminated recently for foreign issuers, 22 as well as eliminate two additional schedules that foreign and domestic issuers have been required to include in annual reports and registration statements filed with the Commission. 19 The amendments regarding acquired foreign businesses adopted today would also apply to issuers that file under Regulation S&hyph;B. 20 See Securities Act Release No. 7026 (November 3, 1993) (58 FR 60304) regarding the age of financial statements for foreign private issuers. 21 See Securities Act Release No. 7053 (April 19, 1994) (59 FR 21644) regarding the modification of the reconciliation requirements for foreign equity investees and foreign acquired businesses. 22 Id.
