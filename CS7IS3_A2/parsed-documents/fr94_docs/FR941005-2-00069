FR941005-2-00069 FR941005-2-00043 Grant Activities L. When Should Proposed Activities Start? Activities cannot start before funds are awarded. Start dates are currently targeted for June 1, 1995. EPA plans to award these projects by May 31, 1995. M. How Much Time Do Grant Recipients Have to Complete Projects? Funding may be requested for periods of up to 12 months. However, flexibility is possible depending upon the nature of the project. Activities must be completed within the time frame specified in the grant award. Requests for renewals will receive low priority. N. Who Will Perform Projects and Activities? The project manager, who is normally an employee of the recipient, is responsible by law for the technical success of the project. The project manager is subject to approval by the EPA project officer. O. What Reports Must Grant Recipients Complete? All recipients must submit final reports for EPA approval within ninety (90) days following the end of the project period. Specific report requirements (for example, Final Technical Report and Financial Status Report) will be detailed in the award agreement. EPA plans to collect, evaluate, and disseminate grantees' final reports to serve as model programs. Since networking is crucial to the success of the program, grantees may be required to submit an extra copy to a central collection point. P.
