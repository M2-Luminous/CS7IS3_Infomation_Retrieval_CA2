FR940606-0-00033 FR940606-0-00013 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Bureau of Land Management 43 CFR Parts 1720, 2070, 2510, and 8350 [WO&hyph;260&hyph;4212&hyph;02&hyph;24 1A; Circular No. 2656] RIN 1004&hyph;AB98 Homesteading; Designation of Areas and Sites; Programs and Objectives AGENCY: Bureau of Land Management, Interior. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This administrative final rule removes Bureau of Land Management (BLM) regulations on programs and objectives, designation of areas and sites, homesteads, and established areas from the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations are obsolete either because their authorities have expired or been repealed, or they have been superseded by other regulations or supplanted by BLM Manual provisions. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Inquiries and suggestions should be sent to: Director (260), Bureau of Land Management, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jim Paugh, (307) 775&hyph;6306. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Parts 1720, 2070, 2510, and subpart 8352 of title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations are being removed in this administrative final rule. In some instances, the statutory authorities prompting a part either have been repealed or have expired. In other cases, the provisions of a part have been superseded by other regulations or replaced by BLM Manual provisions. Part 1720, which is being removed by this rule, lists policies pertaining to the disposal and management of the public lands as managed by BLM before the enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), 43 U.S.C. 1700 et seq. These pre-FLPMA policies were based, to a considerable extent, on the Classification and Multiple Use Act, which expired according to its own terms on December 23, 1970. The BLM's post-FLPMA management and disposal policies now are reflected not only in FLPMA, but also in BLM's land use planning regulations, along with its other management- or disposal-related regulations, and its manualized instructions to BLM personnel. The BLM's Manual is open to public inspection. See 43 CFR 2.3. Part 2510 pertains to the homestead laws that were repealed on October 21, 1976 (as to Alaska, October 21, 1986), by FLPMA. Because homestead entries no longer can be made with regard to the public lands of the United States, the regulations in this part are no longer needed. Part 2070 and subpart 8352 were used to designate areas and sites. The types of designations referred to in these provisions have all been superseded by designations created in FLPMA and other laws. Such designations include areas of critical environmental concern, covered in 43 CFR part 1600; national conservation areas and national recreation areas, covered in various specific resource management regulations; wilderness, covered in part 8560; and national trails and rivers, covered in part 8350. Because this final rule is an administrative action to remove obsolete provisions, it has been determined that it has no impacts on the public. The Department of the Interior, therefore, for good cause finds under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 553(d)(3) that notice and public procedure thereon are unnecessary and that this rule may take effect upon publication. The principal author of this final rule is Jim Paugh of the BLM Wyoming State Office, assisted by the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management, BLM. Because this final rule is a purely administrative regulatory action having no effects upon the public or the environment, it has been determined that the rule is categorically excluded from review under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)). This rule was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.
