The newspaper, in an article published on February 9, quoted American prison rights activists as criticizing the U.S. policy as "hypocritical." The U.S. newspaper quoted Brad Haga, marketing director for Oregon Prison Industries, the state agency overseeing the manufacture of prison goods, as revealing that Oregon will export an estimated 3 million U.S. dollars worth of prison-made jeans and shirts this year to Japan, Italy and other countries. According to the article, California prisons export less prison-made clothing than Oregon, but have so far sent test orders to Japan and Malaysia. Corey Weinstein, a board member of the California Prisoners Rights Union, was also quoted as saying that the U.S. Government typically "complains of human-rights violations in other countries but cares not one bit about human-rights violations in the United States". Haga admitted that the two different policies the U.S. Government is pursuing on prison exports "may smack of old-fashioned imperialism." Weinstein stressed that as long as California exports prison-made goods, the United States "has no basis" for criticizing other countries involved in the same practice.
