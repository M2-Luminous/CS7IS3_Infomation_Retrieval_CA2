The allegedly illegal loans were made by a person close to the late Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka to whom Hosokawa lent the 60 million yen, the sources said. The person in turn lent the money from Hosokawa to other people in a manner that may have violated a law governing the legal qualifications for making such loans, they told Kyodo News Service. "There is the likelihood that the Hosokawa side entrusted the 60 million yen to a person well versed in financial asset management who was close to former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and then the person made the shady loans using the money," a source said. Hosokawa told a news conference Friday at which he made a bombshell announcement of his intention to resign, "A new problem has come to light. New suspicions have emerged that my political office entrusted a certain person with managing my personal financial means, raking in profits for a few years since 1981." "The suspicion is that his management may have involved some illegalities, although the person, who is my old friend, asked for permission to manage my personal money, saying it would definitely be invested in a profitable manner," he said. However, he declined to elaborate further on the specifics of the new suspicions, saying the investigation by his political office was still under way. The sources said Hosokawa and two of his relatives obtained "some 400 million yen" from the 1982 sale of the Tekigaiso estate of the wife of Hosokawa's grandfather, former Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. Hosokawa and the two relatives, including his younger brother, Tadateru Konoe, decided to sell part of the Konoe estate in March 1982 after the three inherited the estate following the death of their grandmother Chiyoko Konoe in September 1980, they said. Hosokawa received some 202 million yen as his portion of the 400 million yen sale, the sources said. After paying inheritance taxes, Hosokawa received 186 million yen and placed it in a personal savings account. Hosokawa then lent 64 million yen out of the money to one of his political funds-raising organizations, while setting aside the remaining 100 million yen as reserve funds from which he planned to pay the income tax on the profits from the land sale, they said. However, Hosokawa spent 77 million yen out of the 100 million yen to purchase a condominium in Tokyo's Moto-azabu [district] in July 1982, they said. After Hosokawa received 100 million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking group firm in late 1982, he made up the 77 million yen in order to return his tax payment reserve fund to the original 100 million yen level, they said. In March 1983, Hosokawa paid some 40 million yen in income taxes on the sale of the estate and turned the remaining 60 million yen over to the person close to Tanaka in order to profit from the person's asset management, the sources said. "I think Prime Minister Hosokawa developed anxieties that the financial management of his personal funds by this person might have violated the law regarding the qualifications of persons allowed to lend money to others," one of the sources said. In 1982, Hosokawa was a member of the Tanaka faction in the House of Councillors. The following year, with Tanaka's backing, Hosokawa ran a successful campaign to become governor in Kumamoto Prefecture.
