The document to serve as a basis material for coalition talks on higher self-administrative units was bad and the ODS Executive Council was disappointed with it, Cermak said. He said that the document "did not reflect things which had been long agreed upon" and was not acceptable to the ODS. The document "was conceptually empty, incomplete, not oriented towards the future and practically makes it possible for higher territorial administrative units to start functioning only around the year 2000," Cermak added. If the political will to agree on the system of elections to the Senate, the as yet non-existent upper chamber of the Czech parliament, is shown, the ODS will not object to senatorial elections being held this autumn simultaneously with local elections, Cermak said. Judging by the state of preparation for the establishment of higher self-administrative units the ODS considered the elections to these units being held in 1996, as proposed by the ODA, unacceptable, he said.
