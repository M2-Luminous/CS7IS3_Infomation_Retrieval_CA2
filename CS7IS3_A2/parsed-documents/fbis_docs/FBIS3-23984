The investigators, including those holding an inquiry into the October events of 1993 in Moscow, were advised to turn over their duties in ten days. It is well known the main oppositionists from the White House are not the only prisoners in Lefortovo. Also conducted in this prison are serious investigations of smuggling, corruption and narcobusiness. These are hundreds of bulky cases, numerous material evidence and valuables, and stacks of classified material. According to investigators, only the regular checking of classified and non-classified documents usually takes 30-35 days. If the transfer of Lefortovo to MVD is speeded up, it is quite possible that many case files may be lost in this chaos. The Lefortovo employees do not conceal their concern and embarrassment. Their fate is not yet clear. The investigation of all cases has been suspended. The persons under investigation as well as officers are waiting for a decision of their destiny. It is still not clear to whom the material values confiscated from those arrested will be handed over to. The Main Military Procurator's Office seems to have voiced its readiness to assume responsibility for a part of the cases, but the question was: Who will investigate them. It has enough problems of its own. All the members of the investigation team inquiring into the October events have been dismissed. Their vague future and the absence of distinct explanations make the investigators assume that the abolition of the Security Ministry is a convenient pretext for making corrections to the "October case." An MN [MOSCOW NEWS] correspondent was told at Lefortovo that from the first day the president's entourage was dissatisfied with the investigation team. It was made clear what kind of results were expected from it. Investigators were compelled to hold a meeting and demand that they be protected against the pressure of the interested sides. Nevertheless, from early November the investigation team was kept in a state of temporary "time trouble": at the meetings in the General Procurator's Office its members are hastened, then the president set the task of taking the matters to court before the New Year. Investigators believe that this is a direct interference in judicial procedures and fear that in the process of the transfer of the cases the materials they had obtained may be sifted through the "political sieve." Of late it became known that several investigators of the General Procurator's Office handed in a request to Alexei Kazannik to release them from the cases on October events because of pressure they are subjected to from the officials of the president's staff. And from January 1 the Defense Ministry stopped financing military courts (tribunals) which were supposed to plead the cases of Rutskoi, Achalov, Barannikov, Dunayev and others. Added to this the rumors on the forthcoming dissolution of the General Procurator's Office, we shall have a strange chain.
