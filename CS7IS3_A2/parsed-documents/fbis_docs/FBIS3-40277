Ever since the Federal Assembly was placed in the position of outsider, with its functions assumed by the federal government, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia too has ceased to be financed according to the Law on the Federal Budget; instead, that financing has been provisional or based on decrees or decisions. At the end of last year, when the government, acting on its own and without the parliament, adopted one of last year's numerous rebalancings of the federal budget, Belgrade attorney Milenko Radic brought suit before the Yugoslav and Serbian Constitutional Court in an effort to prove that the government was acting in conflict with the Constitution and with the law. Naturally, no one paid the least bit of attention to this attorney's objections, nor to the criticism voiced by many party leaders who were alarmed that the Federal Assembly was increasingly being held back and marginalized societally and legislatively. On the contrary, the government in the meantime (in early January) issued a decree on the provisional financing of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] "for the period from January to March 1994," and in the first paragraph it washed its hands, so to speak, of all potential objections and criticism. "Until enactment of the Law on the Federal Budget for 1994, by 31 March 1994 at the latest, the authorities of the FRY shall be financed in accordance with the Law on the Federal Budget for 1993, with a real amount established by this decree." This is the first paragraph, which "covers" the federal government before the FRY Constitution. The Constitution states that laws are enacted by the assembly, while decrees and decisions come from the federal government. In the case of the federal budget, legal experts from the Palace of the Federation in Novi Beograd will repeat that here too it is simply a matter of indexing. Being added to the established price of a certain good are only the costs of inflation, hyperinflation, or mega-inflation, depending on the pace at which prices are rising. In the first quarter, the authorities of the FRY will be financed by a sum of 210,660,000,000 dinars, according to SLUZBENI LIST No. 2 of 10 January. In case anyone is concerned that this is too little and that it will be additionally and excessively devalued by further inflation, it must be said that the federal government has also considered that possibility. The very day after the enactment of the decree on the provisional financing of the FRY, a decision was adopted to valorize the funds for financing the FRY and was published in SLUZBENI LIST (No. 3) of 11 January. Here it now says that the funds (established by the decree) for the first quarter are valorized and "established" as 179,061,000,000,000 dinars, "based on the estimated growth in retail prices." Each According to Merit Thus, the decision became older than the decree, so that it is no longer possible to speak of the 210,066,000,000 dinars, but rather of the sum established by the decision. We have verified that the government has enacted no new decrees and decisions in the meantime, so that the one published in SLUZBENI LIST on 11 January is still in force. According to the decision, everything is in order on the revenue side: 111,018,500,000,000 dinars will be secured from base revenues, 53,720,000,000,000 dinars from long-term National Bank of Yugoslavia loans, and 14,322,500,000,000 from bonds. It is also calculated that in the first quarter 35.7 trillion will be collected from the excise tax, 52.19 trillion from revenue stamps (for the first time this sum is greater than the excise tax, which indicates that the population faces paying enormous stamp duty), 15.3 trillion from customs, and another 254 billion from administrative fees. The key items on the expenditure side are outlay for the Armed Forces of Yugoslavia (135.137 trillion dinars), the operation of federal agencies (20.502 trillion), disabled veteran benefits (14.056 trillion), and supplemental funds for the territories under UN protection (1.7 trillion dinars). During the first quarter, the Federal Assembly will cost 847.5 billion dinars (independent of possibility that it may not convene during that period), the general secretariat of the FRY president 110 billion, the Federal Court 74, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office 27, the Federal Constitutional Court 53.5, the Federal Public Legal Office 14.9, the Federal Council for Violations (!?) 53.3, and the general secretariat of the federal government 803 billion dinars. Concern for Olympic Matches We assume that every federal ministry has been well-assessed. In fact, mention is made in several places of certain funding for "intervention in the economy" (as in the case of the Secretariat for Legislation, where the amount is as much as 5.987 trillion dinars) or for "maintenance and procurement of equipment and other basic resources of federal agencies and organizations" (in the case of the Ministry of Justice, where the amount is 544 billion dinars). All institutions are present, from computer science to patents and the institute for measures and precious metals, as well as all inspectorates and the Office for the Performance of Specialized-Technical Work for the Needs of Federal Agencies (a total of 2.05 trillion dinars). According to the decision, the budget provides 90 billion for bank rehabilitation (it does not say which ones--whether, for example, Dafiment Bank is included) and another 877 billion for settlement of part of the obligation for deposited foreign-exchange savings. The largest part of the 126 billion provided for the Ministry of Sports will go to "funding for the program of the sports leagues of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Olympic Committee [JOK]." In the decree on provisional financing, 135 million out of the 149.2 million earmarked for the aforementioned ministry is provided for (as attorney Radic says) "Bakocevic's Olympic Committee," or a little less than what is provided for the entire Ministry of Agriculture, and twice as much as for the Archives of Yugoslavia, the Federal Market Inspectorate, the Ministry for Trade, or the Ministry for Science, Technology, and Development. In short, if one is cynical one must note that the government has perhaps allocated little for these purposes based on the successes achieved by the JOK in clearing the way for our athletes to participate in the Olympic Games. Nowhere, neither in the decree nor in the decision, is there any mention of youth or veterans organizations, but they can indeed be found under individual ministries or as "other needs." For example, financing of the operation of organizations and associations for veterans and the disabled is mentioned in the item linked with the Ministry of Health, while additional funding for practically the same purpose is found under "other needs." It is true that the federal government did not exactly have to give special consideration to the budget items, nor to whether some of the old expenditures were sandwiched--the budget was not the subject of parliamentary debate. Far from the deputies' eyes, the government was able to provide for and finance whatever it wanted, because for now no one is being held accountable for this, or for anything else.
