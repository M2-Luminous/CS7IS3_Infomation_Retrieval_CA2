It invited the European Commission and all bodies responsible for the implementation of the PHARE programme to intervene immediately to withdraw toxic pesticides from the market and asked that a study be undertaken making it possible to identify those responsible for the destruction of the ecological balance of the regions concerned. It is demanding that the Commission prepare a report with the detailed description and amount of aid granted to date to Albania by the Community in the framework of the PHARE programme, particularly with regard to the agricultural dimension. It is also asking the Commission to submit Commission projects to it on forthcoming aid to be granted. On behalf of the Commission, Sir Leon Brittan indicated that the stock of pesticides in Albania currently amounted to 3500 tonnes. Some 500 tonnes, of which 214 tonnes benefiting from PHARE programme support, are products of high quality that meet Community standards and from the countries of the European Union. The rest was not manufactured in the Community or supplied with its aid. Albania using little pesticide, only 60 tonnes could be placed on the market, the remainder reexported to the producers or destroyed, which is proving to be difficult for part of it, the destruction technology not yet being safe. The cost of destruction would amount to almost 2.7 million Ecus. The Commission and the Albanian authorities are currently studying these two possibilities, said the Commissioner. Mr. Graefe zu Baringdorf (German Green) regarded as scandalous that the estimated cost of destruction amounted to 2.7 million Ecus whereas the aid supplied to the agricultural sector under the PHARE programme is only 3 million Ecus.
