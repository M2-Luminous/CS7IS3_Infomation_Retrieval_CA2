Experts believe that if the two republics within the composition of Russia (Karelia and Komi) refuse from the institution of presidency, this will restrict activities of their leaders. SPIRIDONOV: Certainly, the head of the Komi Republic elected directly by the population will enjoy a kind of additional immunity in the face of both the federal structures and the representative bodies in Komi. However, I think that the new Constitution gives to the State Council (the future parliament) enough rights for control over the leader. At the same time, the additional powers will inevitably lead to additional and rather serious responsibility for the leader. I will point out that the head of the republic and the president are not quite the same. I have repeatedly stated that there must be only one president in Russia. I still think so since each of the federation's constituent members is an integral part of the Russian Federation. The leaders of the republics and regions, even if they are elected by nation-wide voting, cannot be called the presidents. The president in most cases does not head either the legislative or the executive powers but seems to stand above both of them. Contrary to the president, the head of the republic will directly head the government which means that he has to bear more responsibility than many regional presidents. That is why I believe that as the Head of the Komi Republic I will have enough powers but just in order to work more than some presidents do. INTERFAX: How will the head of the Komi republic organize "regional" and "federal" utilization of many resources possessed by the republic? SPIRIDONOV: This is right. God really made us very rich with natural and mineral resources. These resources must be used. Given the economic crisis it would be a crime just to be standing on these resources without using them now. First of all I will speak on the situation in the forestry complex -- the oldest industry in Komi which is now in a very poor situation. Success will depend on support which the center can give to the republic. This is the primary task. The second point is that we must go back to our economic origins and organize a good mining industry in this region. We have all necessary opportunities since a significant part of the Urals reach with mineral resources belongs to Komi, a kind of mountain countries. I believe that we have great opportunities for development of this industry. We just should not listen much to various demagogs covered by "green masks" who are pursuing their selfish political goals frightening people by ecological threats. Everything what the republic has must be made of use to people. INTERFAX: The strike movement of miners is gaining force in the republic. There are certain suggestions that the Komi government and the parliament were hoping for the center too much in what concerned the settlement of this issue. Will you have more opportunities to influence the Russian government on this issue since now you have received new powers? SPIRIDONOV: The point is that the coal industry is managed by the federal bodies. That is why this issue can be resolved only through contacts with the federal structures. The Komi leadership is maintaining permanent contacts with the center. A resolution of the Russian government on the problems on the Pechor coal basin was worked out as a result. The resolution provides for significant investments of capital into the industry. Unfortunately, some mines will be closed. However, I strongly believe that today it will better to create new jobs for specialists living in the North rather than to close unprofitable enterprises. Today most of investments into the social sphere must go to the regions with normal climate. Otherwise, inhabitants of the North region will be practically condemned to dying. A special protocol was signed with the Rosugol company. I have recently met the leadership of the Kaliningrad Region (western Russia) where the climate is rather favorable and construction of dwelling places will cost twice cheaper than in our northern Vorkuta. When I have to meet with miners, I always tell them on their political demands, "You are used by various dishonest political leaders in order to get access to power. You are promised possible and impossible privileges when you are used." Recently, miners have been given so many privileges that sometimes they allow themselves not to work for a half of the year. I think that miners, being naive, will be listening to those who enjoy using the difficulties of Vorkuta and Inta in their own interests and be backing them. In fact, there are many difficulties but there will be nothing good out of it. INTERFAX: You have repeatedly stated that the federal treaty does not work. Obviously, that is why the bilateral treaty between the Komi Republic and the Russian Federation. SPIRIDONOV: I believe that the treaty on establishment of the federation must be signed by its constituent members. During the last constitutional conference, in my opinion, called by the advisors of the president rather than by Boris Yeltsin himself, there were not more than 20 pct or 30 pct of the federation's constituent members present. As a result, the Constitution was adopted, worked out by mostly irresponsible people from the public and political organizations, the trade unions, etc. The Constitution includes only a part of the provisions of the federal treaty. Since Yeltsin remains practically the only person at the federal level who understands what the Russian state system is, he proposed to us that our bilateral relations be legalized. It is obvious that the present Federal Assembly cannot include the federal treaty in the Constitution. Unfortunately, most of current politicians do not realize the particularities of the Russian federal state system. That is what makes the uniqueness of Russia.
