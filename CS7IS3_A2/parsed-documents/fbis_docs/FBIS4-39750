Yeltsin made the announcement at a press conference on Friday admitting that the decree would cause sharp criticisms of Russian bankers who fear foreign banking giants can swallow them up. He did not provide any details, but said it is necessary to ensure a gradual access of foreign banks to Russia in order to stimulate the necessary competition. It is no longer possible to tolerate the 185 per cent discount rate offered by Russian banks, according to the president, who added that the presence of foreign banks would bring the rate down.
