Economy Minister Jorge Camet asserted that the $1.1 billion in aid granted to Peru by the international financial community will be invested primarily in social programs. Upon his return from the World Bank consultative meeting in Paris, Camet said the letter of intent submitted by the Peruvian Government to the IMF reflects the reforms adopted by the executive branch with the objective of curbing inflation. [Begin recording] [Reporter Walter Samuel Leiva] [words indistinct] are you satisfied and happy with the results obtained at the meeting? [Camet] Yes, I am satisfied. [Leiva] How will these funds be invested, sir? [Camet] There are concessionary and normal loans totalling $850 million that will be used in infrastructure and social programs. We also have $250 million in donations. [Leiva] What are the terms for these loans? [Camet] Some of them are concessionary loans and others are normal loans -- in addition to the donations I have already mentioned. [Leiva] In how many installments? [Camet] Well, this is for the whole of 1994. [Leiva] What are your comments on the letter of intent that the Peruvian Government has submitted to the IMF? [Camet] Well, the letter of intent was drafted by the Central Bank and the Economy Ministry, and it reflects the government's economic reform program and the goals we intend to achieve: about a 20 percent inflation rate and a growth in reserves by $150,000, that is, more than $300 billion. [end recording] Economy Minister Jorge Camet added that the current economic program will remain unchanged. He said there will be no changes because the government intends to continue curbing the inflation rate and eradicating extreme poverty in Peru. He said the Peruvian business mission's European tour, which ended today, was very positive. The Peruvian mission was headed by Industry Minister Liliana Canale and Peruvian businessmen, among them Confiep Chairman Arturo Woodman.
