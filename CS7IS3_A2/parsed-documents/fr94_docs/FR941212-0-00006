FR941212-0-00006 FR941212-0-00003 National Environmental Policy Act There is no impact on the human environment under the regulatory amendments being issued today. Accordingly, DOE has determined that this is not a major Federal action on which significant impact upon the quality of the human environment and, therefore, preparation of an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement is not required and categorically excluded from preparation under the National Environmental Policy Act pursuant to Appendix A6 of 10 CFR Part 1021. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule will not require a collection of information, and, accordingly, clearance is not required by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. ). Executive Order 12778 Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reductions. Agencies are also instructed to make every effort to ensure that the regulation specifies clearly a preemptive effect, effect on existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. The DOE certifies that today's final rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 1004 Freedom of Information. Issued in Washington, DC on December 7, 1994. Robert R. Nordhaus, General Counsel. For the reasons set out in the preamble, chapter X of title 10, part 1004 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as set forth below. PART 1004_FREEDOM OF INFORMATION 1. The authority citation for Part 1004 continues to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552. 2. Section 1004.3 is amended by revising the section heading, reserving paragraph (d), and adding paragraph (e) as follows: ยง1004.3 Public reading facilities and policy on contractor records. * * * * * (d) [Reserved] (e) Contractor Records. (1) When a contract with DOE provides that any records acquired or generated by the contractor in its performance of the contract shall be the property of the Government, DOE will make available to the public such records that are in the possession of the Government or the contractor, unless the records are exempt from public disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(2). (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, records owned by the Government under contract that contain information or technical data having commercial value as defined in ยง1004.3(e)(4) or information for which the contractor claims a privilege recognized under federal or state law shall be made available only when they are in the possession of the Government and not otherwise exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(b). (3) The policies stated in this paragraph: (i) Do not affect or alter contractors' obligations to provide to DOE upon request any records that DOE owns under contract, or DOE's rights under contract to obtain any contractor records and to determine their disposition, including public dissemination; and (ii) Will be applied by DOE to maximize public disclosure of records that pertain to concerns about the environment, public health or safety, or employee grievances. (4) For purposes of ยง1004.3(e)(2), ``technical data and information having commercial value'' means technical data and related commercial or financial information which is generated or acquired by a contractor and possessed by that contractor, and whose disclosure the contractor certifies to DOE would cause competitive harm to the commercial value or use of the information or data.
