He reported to journalists that the indicators for the dysentery epidemic that began 2 months ago in Goris have declined significantly. In this time 500 cases of this disease were registered. In 6 months of this year 150 brucellosis cases were registered. Last year 700 cases were registered. Ten days ago cholera bacillus was discovered in Shaumyanovskiy Canal, Erebuninskiy Rayon, Yerevan. Last week the republic's epidemiological commission held a meeting in the Ministry of Health. During it a decision was made to stop the cholera epidemic--to create special subdivisions in customs offices for public health inspection. Attention must be turned primarily to large transportation junctions, the airport and the railroad station. There are plans for carrying out preventive measures, and for taking samples to study the condition of water basins. Swimming in open-air water basins was prohibited. Ararat Mkrtchyan reported that cases of cholera have not yet been registered in Armenia, but such cases do exist in states neighboring on Armenia--Turkey and Iraq. Special attention is to be turned to tourist ties with countries neighboring on Armenia. The situation is more reassuring in Georgia, where the overall level of infectious diseases does not elicit any apprehensions. The health ministries of the two countries--Armenia and Georgia--agreed on joint public health inspection. Ararat Mkrtchyan announced that cases of cholera were recently registered in the territory of the former Union. On 3 August seven cases of cholera were registered in Tajikistan, and on 4 August 15 were registered in Azerbaijan and seven in Dagestan, one of them a fatality. Three cases of cholera were registered in Krasnodar, and two cases in Rostov. Cases of illness were registered in St. Petersburg. In the words of the chief public health physician, foreigners are the source of disease in Krasnodar, Rostov and St. Petersburg.
