FR941122-1-00017 FR941122-1-00002 7 CFR Part 273 RIN 0584&hyph;AB59 Food Stamp Program; Excess Shelter Expense Limit and Standard Utility Allowances AGENCY: Food and Consumer Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This action proposes several changes in Food Stamp Program rules relating to the limit on deductible excess shelter expenses and use of standard utility allowances. The major change would implement a provision of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act as set forth in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The provision would increase Program benefits to households that have no elderly or disabled members by gradually increasing and then, in 1997, removing the limit on the amount of excess shelter expenses these households can deduct from their income to determine eligibility and benefits. The changes in provisions for standard utility allowances would allow State agencies to use allow use of additional standards and would simplify requirements for determining entitlement to a standard.
