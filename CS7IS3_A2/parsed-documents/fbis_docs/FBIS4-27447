Intelligence and ethnic sources monitoring the situation along the Thai-Burmese border said several of the 11 armed ethnic groups which are party to the ceasefire have expressed their frustration over Rangoon's indifference to their political objectives and demands for greater autonomy. The groups have come to realize that they have little or nothing to gain from the truce while the junta, better known as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), has exploited the situation by claiming all the credit for the peace pact, the sources said. Most ethnic groups have not openly aired their dissatisfaction. But the Wa guerrillas, the strongest group and the first to strike a truce with Rangoon in 1989, have stood up to express their views. Forming the major and grassroots component of the Burma Communist Party, the Wa in early 1989 revolted against the ageing Maoist leaders and seized control of the communist headquarters as well as large stocks of heavy weaponry and ammunition supplied to the Party during the communist heyday by China. Karen leader Gen Bo Mya said recently he had received information that some of the 11 armed ethnic groups "are very frustrated" that there have been no political developments or negotiations since the ceasefire was agreed. Some groups have threatened to break the truce. "There is no progress. They were told that if they want to talk politics they must first lay down their arms and return to the legal fold," he said. Bo Mya also predicted that fighting would re-erupt. The Karen leader's statement was confirmed by intelligence sources and a Wa official who requested anonymity. The official told THE NATION that the Wa are disappointed with Rangoon's rejection of their demands for a Wa State. He said bilateral relations have been "very tense" lately following several incidents. Among others, Rangoon has refused to consider or discuss a proposal for the setting-up of the Wa State submitted by Wa representatives to the National Convention, he said. The convention was arbitrarily set up early last year by the Slorc to draft the country's new constitution. "The draft constitution only mentions seven states and seven divisions," which do not include the Wa State, the official said. He said a senior leader of the United Wa State Party travelled from the Wa headquarters at the Sino-Burmese border in Shan State to Rangoon at the end of April to reiterate the groups' demand for a separate state. He said the Wa had threatened to break the ceasefire deal with Rangoon unless their demands for statehood were responded to positively. "Just after we celebrated our 5th anniversary of the Wa revolution against the Burma Communist Party on April 17, a Wa leader went down to Rangoon. He warned the Slorc that without a genuine Wa State, the (Wa-Slorc) ceasefire would not last long," he said. The Wa official, however, said he did not know if the Wa leader had yet returned from Rangoon and could not confirm a report that he had been detained in Rangoon since the end of April. He said other armed groups were also unhappy with the Slorc indifference to their political cause and demands for political discussion but did not openly show their dissatisfaction due to the military weakness of the groups. "The Wa is holding the key to the success of the Slorc's truce with other ethnic groups. If the Wa ceasefire breaks down, other groups will follow suit as we are the largest group," he said. The Slorc has for the past several years pressed the Wa to reduce the number of its estimated 25,000-30,000 troops to 3,000, a demand rejected outright by the ethnic guerrillas. The latest incident contributing to the worsening of Slorc-Wa relations was the Wa's discovery at the end of January of 87 C-3 and G-4 guns hidden in 3,000 sacks of rice rationed every month to the guerrillas as part of the bilateral ceasefire agreement, according to the Wa official.
