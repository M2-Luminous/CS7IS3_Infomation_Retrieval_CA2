"I may occupy the post of the minister for CIS affairs only in case it envisages the status of a vice-premier", Shokhin told TASS on Monday. He added that the government is currently facing a complicated situation as it has to combine financial stabilisation with the policy of promoting production which needs enormous finances. The current reorganisation of the government also complicates the situation, according to Shokhin. "The existing situation in the country calls for two necessary things: a strict definition of concrete measures and the sharing of roles in the government", he stressed.
