Official statistics show that from 1992 to the end of 1993 more than 27,000 technological contracts had been signed, with a total business volume of over 800 million yuan (about 91.95 million U.S. dollars)-worth. Through these markets, the latest research findings have been spread all over the country and have been applied to production, resulting in a remarkable increase in profits. For instance, a computer designing system for silk spinning traded on the technology market has already brought more than 700 million yuan (about 80.5 million U.S. dollars) in increased profits to those firms which have applied it to production. A centrifugal ventilator invented by researchers at Zhejiang university has been applied in over 20 cities throughout the country and has created more than one billion yuan (about 115 million U.S. dollars) in profit. Local officials said that they are developing the technology market "in a bid to commercialize and spread new- and high- technology nationwide". This is also the best way to optimize the uneven allocation of technological forces, which has hindered the development of both scientific technology and the economy as a whole, they said. Meanwhile, the province has held a number of training classes in the operation of technology markets and technological contracts. Administration offices have been established in the meantime, in an effort to control the markets and remove trade barriers. With the improvement of the markets and policies, the province has witnessed a boom in science and technology development and has made remarkable progress in applying research findings to production. According to officials from the provincial technology market coordination and direction office, many items of high-technology have been sold to foreign businesses.
