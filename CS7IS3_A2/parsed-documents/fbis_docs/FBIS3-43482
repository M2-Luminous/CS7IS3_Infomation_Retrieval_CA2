A spokesman for the organization says the attack on the Chevron installations in Cabinda was aimed at making sure that Luanda did not use oil revenue for buying arms to kill Angolans. The FLEC-FAC source said Cabinda oil accounts for two-thirds of the state's revenues, three-fourths of which are spent on war. The Luanda government, as was the case of Malanje, wanted to blame the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola for the attack on Malongo. This is after all an old communist method which is still used by Luanda to score advantages over political and military situations.
