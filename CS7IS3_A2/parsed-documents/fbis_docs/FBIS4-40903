Just the other day the second stage of elections to the Oblast Duma and Magadan City Duma were held in the oblast. The elections, in which 27 percent of the voters took part, were successful. Former USSR Supreme Soviet Deputy Vladimir Yudin and a number of his colleagues from the "Civic Union of Kolyma" became Duma deputies. More than half the Duma members are heads of rayon administrations and personnel from the oblast's state structures. One of the main topics in the election program was the preservation of the economic and social potential of one of the principal northern regions.
