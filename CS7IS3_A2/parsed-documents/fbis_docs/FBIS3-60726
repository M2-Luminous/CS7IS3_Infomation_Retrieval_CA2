Recently in Ukraine, the first Ukrainian-German joint venture UNA has been established in this area. Among its founders were the Rivne nuclear power plant, the Kiev Institute Enerhoproekt, and the German joint stock company KAB. German nuclear power engineers have great experience in constructing nuclear power stations and improving their security. The new joint venture company will reinforce hermetic containers of the first and second power units at the Rivne nuclear power plant. Experts have recommended installation of a pass for polluted metal in a special smelting furnace. Also preliminary inspection of containers has already been conducted.
